			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD KNOCKS OFF RAIDERS  </P> <P> Channel Islands High was both unbeaten and impressive heading into its  nonleague football game against Oxnard on Friday.  </P> <P> The Raiders' running game had been nearly unstoppable, and the team had  averaged 30 points and 275 rushing yards in wins over Rio Mesa and Hueneme.  </P> <P> But, after dropping a 36-14 decision to Oxnard at Oxnard High, the beaten  Raiders aren't very impressive, either.  </P> <P> Tailback Renard Carn, who had rushed for 243 yards in the first two games, was  on the bench because of a stress fracture in his left foot. And Arturo  Hernandez, one of the top defensive ends in the Marmonte League, also was  sidelined, because of a hip injury.  </P> <P> And the Raiders' woes continued with blocked punts, costly penalties and  turnovers. Those mistakes overshadowed Lamont Pearson's 104 rushing yards in  nine carries.  </P> <P> "We just didn't look very good at all," Channel Islands Coach Joel Gershon  said. "We didn't even look like a football team."  </P> <P> Channel Islands' mistakes made a good Oxnard (2-1) team look even better.  Oxnard turned four critical Channel Islands errors into four touchdowns and the  Yellowjackets finished with 233 rushing yards and 313 total.  </P> <P> "We played about as good as we can play," Oxnard Coach Jack Davis said. "But I  also think that we caught (Channel Islands) on a bad night."  </P> <P> Channel Islands' troubles began when Oxnard, leading 6-0 on John Lewis'  two-yard run, blocked a Raider punt.  </P> <P> Eric Gutierrez smothered Juan Vargas' kick at Channel Islands' 26 and Oxnard's  Nathan Stephens recovered the ball at the 15.  </P> <P> Three plays later, Kenyon Lewis (150 yards in 18 carries) scored on a 27-yard  run and John Lewis' two-point conversion gave Oxnard a 14-0 lead with 8 minutes  34 seconds left in the half.  </P> <P> "After that blocked punt, we really had the momentum," Davis said.  </P> <P> Channel Islands' next mistake was a personal foul, during an Oxnard punt, which  gave the Yellowjackets a first down at Channel Islands' 32. Quarterback Larry  Bumpus hit Kenyon Lewis for a 26-yard gain to the 10, and Bumpus scored on a  six-yard run.  </P> <P> Dan Duchai's point-after extended Oxnard's lead to 21-0 with 3:09 left in the  first half.  </P> <P> "We made some critical mistakes," Gershon said.  </P> <P> Channel Islands finally reached the end zone on an 11-yard pass from  quarterback Pharoh Milner to Ricky Rodriguez with nine seconds left in the  half. Milner added the conversion run to cut Oxnard's lead to 21-8 at halftime.  </P> <P> But Oxnard took advantage of a pair of Channel Islands fumbles in the second  half to turn the game into a rout.  </P> <P> First, Milner fumbled at the Raiders' 39, and Oxnard capitalized, scoring on a  17-yard touchdown pass from Bumpus to Brooke Johnson. Kenyon Lewis' conversion  run extended Oxnard's lead to 29-8 with 11:51 remaining.  </P> <P> Then another fumbled by Milner resulted in a 32-yard pass from Bumpus to  Johnson that gave Oxnard a 36-8 lead with 9:45 left. Bumpus completed four of  six passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Channel Islands concluded the scoring when Milner, who rushed for 72 yards in  14 carries, scored on a three-yard run with 2:43 left.  </P></p>

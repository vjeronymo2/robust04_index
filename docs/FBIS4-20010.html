			<p>BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, April 25 -- Poland believes it will  become an European Union (EU) member before the year 2000,  Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said in Copenhagen Monday  [25 April], during his one-day working visit to Denmark.    He told a press conference that Poland has made a  significant  progress in meeting European standards in the field of  democracy, observance of human rights and economic growth.    While in Copenhagen, Olechowski met with his Danish  counterpart Niels Helveg Petersen to discuss current situation  in Europe and the priorities of Poland's foreign policy in the  context of Poland's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.    The Danish side expressed the conviction that Poland should  be granted full membership of the EU and that the application  for EU membership was a right, well-timed step.    Petersen also stressed that Denmark was ready to cooperate  with Poland within the framework of the Partnership for Peace  programme.    Later in the day Olechowski was received by Denmark's Prime  Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen for talks on opportunities for  cooperation in the Council of the Baltic Sea states.    Polish foreign minister discussed possibilities of  broadening  Polish-Danish economic cooperation with Minister for Economics  Marianne Jelved and Minister for Business Affairs Mimi Jakobsen.  He also met with Peter Duetoft, the head of the parliamentary  foreign affairs committee.</p>

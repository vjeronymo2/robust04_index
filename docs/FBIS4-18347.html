			<p>BFN     [Text] The Greek Cypriot National Guard has taken  additional measures along the confrontation line. President  Rauf Denktas described this provocative act by the Greek Cypriot  Administration as an effort to create suspicion against the  Turkish Cypriots and fear against Turkey, and then to build on  that. The president charged that the Greek Cypriots never  wanted the confidence-building measures [CBM's] in the first  place, but try to blame the Turkish Cypriots and claim it is the  Turkish Cypriots who do not want them. He said: Unless the  Greek Cypriots remember that they started the Cyprus problem in  the first place, and that the only thing they think of is to  usurp the rights of the Turkish Cypriots, they will not find the  right path.    The Greek Cypriot radio reported this morning that the Greek  Cypriot National Guard took additional measures along the  confrontation line. The Greek Cypriot Administration is waging  a campaign to blame the Turkish Cypriots for the lack of  progress in the talks on the implementation of the CBM's. This  latest decision is another dangerous link in that campaign. The  Greek Cypriot radio said that the Greek Cypriot National  Guardsmen were instructed to be very careful. As a pretext for  this provocative act, the Greek Cypriot Administration alleged  that the Turkish Cypriots took additional measures along the  border.</p>

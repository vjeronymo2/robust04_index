			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ANIMATED 'NUTCRACKER' STUMBLES BADLY  </P> <P> Watching "The Nutcracker Prince," a new Canadian animated feature (citywide) is  every bit as much fun as getting underwear for Christmas when you're 8 years  old. A blend of leaden gags, muddled storytelling and Saturday morning-style  animation, it's more a holiday threat than a treat.  </P> <P> Patricia Watson's script mixes the original E. T. A. Hoffmann story, "The  Nutcracker and the Mouse King," with elements from the popular Tchaikovsky  ballet. Clara (voice by Megan Follows) gets the Nutcracker (Kiefer Sutherland)  as a Christmas present from "Uncle" Drosselmeier (Peter Boretski) and plays  happily until her brother Fritz breaks it. She tends the injured Nutcracker and  helps him defeat the armies of the Mouseking (Mike MacDonald, who overacts so  shamelessly, he sounds more like a ham than a mouse). To celebrate their  victory, they travel to the magical Kingdom of the Dolls.  </P> <P> Executive producer Sheldon Wiseman says he wanted "to illuminate parts of the  original story that had not widely been told," but Watson's script and Paul  Schibli's direction eliminate both details of characterization and major plot  points, obscuring more than they illuminate.  </P> <P> They keep Hoffmann's fussy fairy-tale-within-a-fairy-tale explanation of how  Drosselmeier's nephew became the Nutcracker, but turn the story into a  crashingly unfunny "Fractured Fairy Tale." (The grating voices and gross humor  in this sequence will send any adult foolish enough to try and sit through it  racing to the lobby, if not the nearest bar.)  </P> <P> Clara doesn't kill the Mouseking with her shoe, as she does in the ballet, nor  does the Nutcracker slay him in a duel, as he does in the story, although they  both try. The obnoxious rodent comes back from two apparently fatal wounds and  only perishes when he falls off a balcony in the enchanted castle. He takes  longer to die than Barbara Hershey did in "Beaches."  </P> <P> The filmmakers waste so much time killing off the Mouseking, there's little  left to explore the wonders of the enchanted Kingdom of the Dolls.  </P> <P> The animation looks flat, stiff and lifeless: The weightless characters seem to  slide on the backgrounds when they're supposed to walk, and their appearance  changes from scene to scene. Clara is especially badly designed, with huge  eyes, a tiny chin and an awkwardly proportioned body. A scene of her dancing  with the prince is embarrassingly inept.  </P> <P> Still, "The Nutcracker Prince" (rated G for general audiences) will undoubtedly  find a place in many family holiday celebrations: The prospect of having to sit  through it is a much more dire threat to hold over the heads of misbehaving  children than a mere stocking full of coal.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SMALL FIRMS GET HELP IN SELLING GOODS ABROAD  </P> <P> After years of peddling soft drinks, laundry detergent and other consumer goods  for major corporations, Bob Wallace decided two years ago to take his  experience and strike out on his own.  </P> <P> Armed with a few thousand dollars and years of marketing savvy, the former Los  Angeles marketing manager for Pepsico Inc. and Lever Bros. started an export  management company to help others do what he does best: sell in the  international market.  </P> <P> His goal is simple: "I'm giving the little Davids of this world a shot at the  world market," Wallace said. "I'm the scout sent out to reconnoiter for the  advancing troops."  </P> <P> Wallace, marketing director of Exports International Co. in Santa Ana, is among  a growing pool of former international marketing managers who have left large  corporations to work as export consultants for small and medium-size companies.  </P> <P> "Most export managers have previous corporate experience and have an  entrepreneurial spirit," said Edward Chavez, president of Anaheim Marketing  International, an export management firm in Anaheim. "And export management is  one area that allows them to use this entrepreneurial characteristic to exploit  their marketing abilities and knowledge of the international market."  </P> <P> Demand for export assistance has increased as more small and medium-size  companies -- many with no prior experience in foreign markets -- try to peddle  their wares abroad, said Martin Magdaleno, president of Sel Pro International,  an Anaheim export management firm. Also, many companies can't afford to hire a  full-time international marketing manager, he said.  </P> <P> "A lot of times, the local manufacturers have a great product but they don't  export because they don't want to be bothered with the extra paper work and  bureaucracy," said Magdaleno, a former manager of Beckman Instruments  international division.  </P> <P> Moreover, many U.S. companies are reluctant to take the time and effort to  understand a foreign nation's culture and trade practices -- often a key to  success abroad. And companies that are doing brisk business in the U.S. market  are sometimes reluctant to spend money on a possibly risky overseas marketing  program, said Patrick Killeen, marketing vice president for PEC International  Trading Co. in San Marcos.  </P></p>

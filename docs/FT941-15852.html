			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Aslef wins 30% pay rise for Channel train drivers British train drivers who operate Channel tunnel services are to receive pay rises of about 30 per cent. Their union, Aslef, sees the deal as a model for agreements with new train operating companies after rail privatisation begins on April 1. Average annual salaries will rise to Pounds 25,000 under flexi-ble agreements based on performance-related pay reached by Aslef with Railfreight Distribution and European Passenger Services, which are subsidiaries of British Rail. Basic pay for the 55 drivers will be Pounds 20,800 a year. The drivers will be moving an estimated 30m passengers and 15m tons of freight a year through the tunnel in 18-coach trains. About 40 trains an hour will use the tunnel, rising to a maximum of 60. 'We are going to negotiate the best deals we can for our members and ensure their terms and conditions are protected,' Mr Lew Adams, the new general secretary of Aslef, said yesterday. The drivers involved will have to speak some French and operate three rulebooks. More than 600 from all over Britain have applied for the jobs - the drivers will be the best paid in the industry, and get more than their French colleagues. In return for substantially higher earnings and as generous sick pay and holidays, the drivers will have to work more flexibly with no restrictive practices or overtime. Hours are to be calculated on an annual rather than a weekly basis to fit new working patterns. The drivers will work a basic 1,700 hours a year, and a further 200 at management's discretion. Working rosters will vary between six and 11 hours a day. Mr Adams stressed that his union was still opposed to BR privatisation, but had 'no alternative but to meet the new owners and managers of the train operating companies'. He added: 'They will seek to maximise their position but this must not be to the detriment of our conditions.' Traditionally known for its obstructiveness, the union under Mr Adams is in the mood to co-operate with innovation in return for higher pay. 'We are not going to stick our heads in the sand and then get a kick up the backside,' said Mr Adams. 'We are a modern union preparing for the next century. 'Though we are not a push-over, we are prepared to get results. That is the way to do business. When our union was formed in 1880 we had to deal with 123 separate rail companies, so having to cope with 41 will be no problem.' BR has written to all the rail unions to tell them national pay bargaining will end with privatisation. Aslef's leaders believe they will be able to negotiate attractive deals at depot level.</p>

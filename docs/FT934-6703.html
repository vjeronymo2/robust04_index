			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Cuts in drugs bills 'ineffective': Merck executive warns on healthcare spending controls European governments' efforts to cut drugs bills are ineffective and counter-productive, according to Merck &amp; Co, the world's largest pharmaceuticals group. Mr David Anstice, Merck's senior vice-president for European human health, warned at a conference in Brussels yesterday that drugs spending cuts would not have a meaningful impact on overall expenditure because medicines represented such a small part of healthcare spending. Most European countries could control health spending more effectively through other means, he argued. Many were paying large amounts for the wrong sorts of medicines. Doctors should alter prescribing habits to provide better value for money for patients. This meant prescribing more innovative medicines, fewer traditional treatments of dubious efficacy and more off-patent generic drugs. Only a quarter of government spending on medicines was on patented drugs. Half, on average, was spent on over the counter non-prescription medicines - which could be paid for by the patient - or generic pharmaceuticals from one source. The latter tended to be traditional remedies restricted to a single country and lacking any efficacy, Mr Anstice said. As for patented medicines, doctors probably prescribed too many acute therapies such as antibiotics, analgesics, and tranquillisers. On the other hand, some illnesses such as arteriosclerosis were under-treated. Savings could be made in distribution and dispensing for which European governments were paying too much. Distribution and dispensing cost more than 50 per cent of the price of prescription pharmaceuticals, compared with 20 to 25 per cent in the US. The European wholesaling industry might need to rationalise, cutting costs and becoming more competitive. This would allow it to pass on lower costs to government purchasers, Mr Anstice said. Structural changes were required in healthcare delivery, he said. Governments needed to measure the performance of healthcare delivery not only through costs, but also outcome of treatment. Pharmaceuticals companies which failed to keep high standards in medical marketing should face stiff sanctions.</p>

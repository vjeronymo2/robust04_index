			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: US trade barriers criticised - European report pinpoints discrimination against foreigners US rhetoric about free trade contrasts with its own significant barriers to trade and investment, according to a new study by the European Commission released yesterday. The Commission's annual report on US trade barriers pinpoints protectionist trade legislation, discrimination against foreign investors, high tariffs and 'Buy American' laws in the US. 'The number of such impediments has not decreased since last year's report was published,' the study concludes. The 90-page Commission study comes as Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, is preparing to visit Washington for talks early next week with the Clinton administration. The aim is to head off US sanctions in the dispute over US/EC procurement legislation and to make progress in the Gatt world trade talks. A Commission spokesman stressed yesterday that criticism of US trade practices did not amount to proof that the new Democratic administration was more protectionist than its Republican predecessor. 'We continue to give them the benefit of the doubt.' The chief barriers cited in the report are: US tariffs of 20-50 per cent on textiles, ceramics, glassware, vegetables and footwear. 'Buy American' legislation at federal and state level which shuts out foreign suppliers, or sets down local content requirements of 50-65 per cent. Telecommunications equipment remains excluded from the Gatt procurement code. Unilateral US legislation such as the 'Super 301' law which, though lapsed, may be revived by the US Congress. The clause provides wide discretion to retaliate against trading practices deemed unfair or burdensome to US commerce. New extra-territorial legislation such as the Cuban Democracy Act (1992) which restricts trade with Cuba to humanitarian and food aid operations. It also extends to US-owned or controlled foreign companies. The US failure to renew favourable tariffs on dozens of farm and industrial products valued at Dollars 1.27bn (Pounds 841m). Some of the duties currently applicable are as high as 38 per cent, the report says. Mr Ove Jorgensen, the Commission's North America director, said yesterday most of the Dollars 200bn annual two-way trade was 'largely trouble-free'. The report however raises concerns about the new US preoccupation with national economic security - an apparent shift from the old national security considerations often used to justify trade barriers.</p>

The Central Bank of Russia has recently spent around $1  billion to stabilize the ruble. The bank created its foreign  currency reserves largely thanks to its vigorous purchases of  foreign currency last year. According to preliminary Central  Bank of Russia estimates, the surge of inflation in January 1994  reached approximately 20-25 percent.</p>

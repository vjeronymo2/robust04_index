			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): DSM up 3.3% as Amsterdam defies downtrend Weakness in most senior bourses was offset by an intraday peak in Brussels, and a further rise in Stockholm, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM had some hopes of the general election, which was expected to result in a change of government, but most investors concentrated on results from DSM which exceeded all expectations. The chemical group's shares saw an all-time high of Fl 148 during the session before closing up Fl 4.70, or 3.3 per cent at Fl 145. The AEX index improved 2.67 to 416.39. Attention turned to Philips, the electronics group, up Fl 1.60 to Fl 57.00 and due to announce its first quarter results today. Analysts were confidently expecting a strong rise in profits, helped by efforts to bring down the group's debt level; Hoare Govett estimated a 52 per cent rise in earnings per share. FRANKFURT was unsettled by volatility in the bond market, and pulled back from Monday's highs by mounting concern about the impact of the weak dollar on exporters. The Dax index fell 16.36 to 2,252.29, and while it recovered more than 9 points in the post bourse, there were fears that currency worries could weigh heavily again today. Turnover rose from DM7.9bn to DM9.6bn. On the session, exporters lost ground and sectors associated with the domestic economy, like utilities and construction, moved up instead. In chemicals, Hoechst led the way down with a fall of DM6 to DM354. Daimler dropped DM14.50 to DM897.50. Ms Heidemarie Hoppner, at B Metzler, said that worries about export pricing were rife. 'Not many industrialists are thought to have hedged their dollar positions,' she said, 'and there could be some nasty surprises, especially if the situation gets worse.' Meanwhile, Lufthansa rose DM5.80 to DM219.80; after hours the government called a news conference for today, on the long awaited privatisation of the flagship airline. PARIS concentrated most of the day's activity on Elf Sanofi, following news that it might acquire Eastman Kodak's stake in Sterling Winthrop, as well as develop its pharmaceuticals strategy with further acquisitions. Sanofi lost FFr43 to FFr975, off a session low of FFr965. The CAC-40 index eased 7.24 to 2,178.99 in low turnover of FFr2.8bn. By contrast Peugeot rose FFr7 to FFr915, helped by data which confirmed a rise in April car sales. Lafarge Coppee, the building materials company, put on FFr5.00 to FFr462.50 as it confirmed that it was selling its 61 per cent stake in Orsan, a biotechnology group, to Tate &amp; Lyle of the UK. ZURICH came under renewed foreign selling pressure, the SMI index falling 9.3 to 2,755.9. Roche certificates fell SFr30 to SFr6,690 in response to its Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex, the US drugs group. Analysts, who noted that the bearers rose SFr230 to a year's high of SFr13,000, commented that much of the day's buying of both issues was by one private Zurich bank. Mr Mirko Sangiorgio at Bank Julius Baer said that the impact of the deal on Roche's future financial income was unclear. He commented that in the short term, Roche appeared to have paid a high price in view of uncertainties about the value of Syntex's new product range. But in the three- to five-year term, the impact of Roche's distribution network and its management's contribution to Syntex's business made the deal look more positive. Banks remained under pressure with UBS bearers down SFr24 at a year's low of SFr1,156. The bank said it planned to launch an ADR programme during the summer in response to growing foreign demand. MILAN was weak, the Mibtel index falling 76 to 12,693. Goldman Sachs, however, maintained that a combination of earnings momentum, strong retail inflows, further rate cuts and the possibility of equity-friendly policy surprises should boost the market over the next year. Fondiaria rose L1,031 or 6.8 per cent to L16,248 on speculation that Mediobanca might use some of the cash from its forthcoming rights issue to raise its stake. Mediobanca fell L1,072 to L17,697. Montedison fell L26 to L1,545 and Ferruzzi lost L72 to L2,323 in response to their announcements of heavier than expected losses. MADRID read more threats of politically sensitive disclosures from the former civil guard chief, incorporated the losses racked up by the Ibex index on other exchanges on Monday, and came back from holiday with a fall of 2.4 per cent, the general index closing 7.87 lower at 317.35. Once again, speculation overrode caution in the case of Banesto, which hit Pta1,435 before closing at Pta1,280, up another Pta30 on the day. BRUSSELS, briefly, broke through its all time high, the Bel-20 index touching 1,544.17 before it closed 17.40, or 1.1 per cent higher at 1,539.40. Interest rate sensitive stocks, which have lagged behind the market, were among the biggest gainers. The utility, Electrabel, climbed BFr120 to BFr6,320. STOCKHOLM recovered after a shaky opening as debt market yields eased late in the session and the market built expectations of strong corporate earnings to come. The Affarsvarlden index rose to 15.9 to 1,515.8. Astra A shares added SKr5 to SKr165 while Electrolux B rose SKr15 to a year's high of SKr423.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  China's National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee,  said here today that China desires to further enhance its  cooperation with Japan.    Meeting with Bunbei Hara, president of the House of  Councillors of the Japanese Diet, and his wife and their party,  Qiao said China and Japan are close neighbors, adding: "We are  pleased to note that the two countries have enjoyed very good  relations."    The two countries have exchanged frequent visits and  conducted a wide range of exchanges in the fields of politics,  economy and culture, he said.    Qiao said the constant strengthening of bilateral friendship  and cooperation will be an important contribution to peace in  the Asia-Pacific region as well as the rest of the world.    Looking towards the 21st century, he said, the influence  exerted by such friendship and cooperation will become greater,  adding that "It is our hope that an unpleasant period in history  will never appear."    Referring to China's economy, Qiao said that over the past  few years, China has accelerated its economy. But there still  exists a gap between China and Japan in the level of development  because China, as a vast country with a large population, cannot  experience development all at once.    China is willing to further its cooperation with Japan  although it will mainly rely on its own efforts in its economic  development and do its utmost to develop its economy under a  stable environment.    He stressed that it is of great importance for China to  conduct varied ways of cooperation with countries all over the  world including Japan.    Hara said he was particularly glad to visit China for the  first time.    He said China has a history of several thousand years which  has exerted a great influence on Japan's culture.    At present, he said, China is implementing the policy of  reform and opening to the outside world, and its economy has  grown quickly.    He expressed the hope that both Japan and China will advance  hand in hand and further push forward bilateral ties and  exchanges and cooperation between the Japanese House of  Councillors and Chinese NPC.    Hara, aged 81, mentioned the unfortunate period in the  history of Sino-Japanese relations, stressing that it is  imperative for Japan to earnestly search its soul in this  regard. Aside from this, the most important thing for Japan to  do is to look towards the future and develop its cooperation  with China.    During the meeting, Hara invited Qiao to visit Japan. Qiao  thanked him for the invitation.    This evening, Qiao gave a dinner in honor of Hara and his  wife and their party.    Present at the two occasions were Qiao's wife Yu Wen, and  Wang Bingqian and Cao Zhi, respectively vice-chairman and  secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee.    Hara and his party arrived here this afternoon for an  official goodwill visit to China as Qiao's guests. They will  also tour Xian, Shanghai and Suzhou after their visit in Beijing.</p>

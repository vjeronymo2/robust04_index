			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Books: A treasure trove of carols old and new - Sixty-four years on, a definitive reference work has been replaced. Anthony Curtis applauds the result THE NEW OXFORD BOOK OF CAROLS edited by Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott Oxford Pounds 60.00 (Pounds 75.00 after January 1), 702 pages RALPH Vaughan Williams collaborated in 1928 with Martin Shaw and Percy Dearmer to compile The Oxford Book of Carols. The work has served its purpose for a long time but, as the editors of this replacement volume point out: 'Musical knowledge has increased enormously in the 60 or so years that have elapsed since its publication, and attitudes (as well as the circumstances in which carols are performed) are no longer the same.' They believe that the present book - an omnium gatherum of carols in many different languages, from medieval Latin to 19th century Basque - 'has the potential to revitalise what has, in many respects, become an enfeebled and inward-looking tradition.' Here is not merely a source book for carol-party organisers - a shorter version at a more affordable price is planned to appear soon - but also an historical anthology giving ample testimony of an enormously widespread and persistent musical tradition. In the view of Keyte (a music don at Bristol University) and Parrott (a conductor of international repute and founder of the Taverner Players), the essential features of a carol are that 'the content must be narrative, contemplative or celebratory, the spirit must be simple, the form normally strophic.' There are carols in celebration of many of the events of the Christian calendar, but the authors have restricted themselves in the main to carols 'for Christmas and most of its associated feasts and seasons, ranging from Advent . . . to Candlemas (the feast of the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple . . . 40 days after Christmas). Carols of the Annunciation have the status of honorary Christmas carols, having been sung at this season from medieval times.' The carols are printed with musical setting alongside the verbal text. If this is in a language other than English, it is also given in translation. For a scholarly history of the origins of the carol, the compilers refer us to RL Greene's The Early English Carols (revised edition 1977), but they themselves succeed here in imparting much valuable historical information in the form of the copious footnotes to each carol. They make a broad distinction between 'composed' carols and 'traditional' ones. Within the first category, 'the order (they write in explanation of their scheme) is roughly chronological, though with some geographical grouping leading to a slightly zig-zag sequence; in the second, the carols are arranged purely by country of origin. A carol's chronological position is determined by the date at which music and words first appeared together: Ding] dong] merrily on high is thus dated c. 1900, despite its 16th century tune. Composed and traditional settings of the same text are placed separately in Parts I and II: A Virgin unspotted, for example, appears in William Billings's setting in part I, and in its folk setting in part II.' The common European inheritance is emphasised by plainchant hymns and medieval carols from many different countries, including a group known chiefly from the Swedish-Finnish Piae Cantiones of 1582, deriving from much earlier central European material. Monks were prolific writers of words for carols in medieval times. Nearly all the noels in the French section are by clerical poets working on existing melodies, and the texts of some of the English medieval carols are by Franciscan friars doing the same job. Yet, the editors conclude, 'as we write, we are aware of a loosening of ideological restraints among younger composers so that simple, direct forms of expression are no longer frowned upon. It could even be that those who have written off the traditional carol as a dead form may once again prove to have been too hasty with their requiems.' Anyone who dips into this treasure trove of a book will surely want to ask if the long tradition could be continued in a modern idiom.</p>

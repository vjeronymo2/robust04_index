			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand will be affected by a 30.5 percent  reduction in ceilings proposed by the United States under its  Generalised System of Preferences [GSP] tariff-reduction  programme.    The current GSP eliminates import duties on products shipped  to the United States from developing countries, up to a ceiling  of $108 million a year per product.    Under the new programme, the ceiling will be $75 million a  year.    The new GSP will be extended for 10 years from October 1,  1994 to September 30, 2004. While the initial ceiling will be  $75 million based on 1995 figures, the figure will increase by  $5 million a year.    A Business Economics Department source said three Thai  products shipped to U.S. markets in 1993 exceeded the new  ceiling: automotive wiring, $116.97 million; computer equipment,  $98.49 million, and microwave ovens, $77.45 milllon.    The source said the one benefit to Thailand is that the new  GSP programme will not link environmental concerns to  qualification tariff preferences.    However, the programme may be withdrawn earlier than the  2004  deadline if the World Bank identifies a recipient country as  having achieved a per capita annual income of more than $7,900.    The first GSP programme from 1976-84 was designed to help  developing countries gain access to U.S. markets without any  conditions.    Under the second programme which expires at the end of  September, the extension of preferences depends on the  development level of exporting countries.    Recipient countries are also required to open their goods  and  services markets to American firms, protect U.S. intellectual  property rights and meet international labour-rights standards.    Kanitson Nawanukhro, deputy director-general of the Business  Economics Department, said a U.S. Congressional subcommittee has  recommended that the new GSP programme be ready for Congress at  the same time as ratification of the Uruguay Round of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

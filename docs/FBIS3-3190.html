The Chinese Government will introduce a number of  major reform measures in the systems of fiscal charges, banking,  planning, and investments, which will inevitably promote the  overall progress of Chinese society, but will also bring up new  problems in public security work in China. A TZU CHING magazine  correspondent recently had a special interview with Chinese  Public Security Vice Minister Tian Qiyu and asked him to  elaborate on how to strike more forceful blows against serious  criminal offenses, how to strengthen security control, promote  public security structural reform and strengthen the public  security contingent itself, and how to build closer cooperation  between the police forces of the Chinese mainland and of Hong  Kong.  <H3>  I. Jiang Zemin Seriously Puts Forward Requirements on  Various Localities </H3>   Taken as a whole, the present public security situation in  China is normal, and this plays the role of guarantor for reform  and opening-up and developing the economy. However, criminal  cases are still on the rise, and especially prominent are major  and malevolent cases. There are, indeed, some places where the  public security situation is not good, with criminals running  wild and the masses lacking a sense of security. Serious  criminal activities have been one of society's hot spots in  recent years.    Discussing this problem, Tian Qiyu told the correspondent  that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to  fighting criminal activities, which the masses hate bitterly,  and once again have asked law enforcement departments at various  levels to increase the strength of their attack. General  Secretary Jiang Zemin of the CPC Central Committee recently  asked major party and government leaders and departments of  political science and law of various provinces, municipalities,  and autonomous regions to seriously study the problem of  increasing criminal offenses, asked them to study the law, take  measures, and do their utmost to contain the momentum of  increasing criminal activities.  <H3>  II. Constantly Increase the Strength of Blows Against  Criminal Offenses </H3>   Public security organizations at various levels have  attached  great importance in recent years to fighting serious criminal  activities, and constantly increased the strength of their  attack against them. Last year, aiming at criminal activities,  they organized and developed extensive and varied modes of  attack, rectification, and control. From January to November,  public security organizations throughout China cracked over 1.04  million criminal cases, seized illicit money and stolen goods  equivalent to 4.08 billion yuan, and captured 3,950.82 kg of  heroin. In striking blows against various criminal activities,  the public security departments resolutely upheld the dignity of  law, laid stress on strict enforcement of law, punished  criminals severely and quickly according to law, and  successfully investigated and handled a number of major criminal  cases and economic cases of great impact.    For example: The Yu Zuomin case of Da Qiu County, Tianjin;  the Beijing-Moscow No. 3/4 international train case which  involved criminal gangs from the eastern region of Russia; the  especially big theft of cultural relics in Kaifeng County, Henan  Province; and the case of the $10 billion [figure as published]  spare credit card of the Hengshui District Central Sub-Branch of  the Hebei Agricultural Bank, retrieved huge economic losses for  the state.    After reviewing the work against criminal offenses in 1993,  Tian Qiyu said that in 1994, with "cracking major cases,  striking blows at gangs, and pursuing escaped criminals" as the  focus, and suiting measures to local conditions, we should  struggle to achieve special purposes, and carry out  rectification and control over crucial cases. In places where  security problems are prominent, we should organize centralized  and unified city-wide, county-wide, or even larger operations  and seriously battle murder, robbery, theft, and organized  crimes. We will continue to challenge bandits and despots along  railway communications lines. 1994 is a year of crucial  importance in the work of seizing firearms and narcotics in  Yunnan, Guanxi, and other southwest frontier areas, and we  should spare no effort. The objective is to block firearms and  narcotics at the borders and prevent them from coming into the  interior. We should struggle unremittingly against smuggling  and illegal emigration in various provinces, cities, and  autonomous regions along the coast, exploit victories, and  strictly guard against setbacks. Various localities should  strike severe blows at the vicious forces of hooligans in towns  and townships. We should maintain sharp vigilance against the  infiltration of triads from outside China, must never allow them  to set up organizations and recruit members inside China, and  will resolutely fight their criminal activities inside China.  Moreover, aimed at the increase in major economic and fraud  cases, we should step up work to ensure that state and  collective property is not lost, or less is lost.    Public security organizations at various levels should  carry out reform and step up criminal investigation work,  increase strength, increase input, improve equipment, step up  the building of basic vocational work, and combine modern  advanced instruments with the initiatives of the broad masses of  cadres and policemen in detecting and solving cases.    Presently, it is necessary to emphasize increasing the  number  solved cases, especially major cases; emphasize the work of  prosecuting cases after solving them; raising the efficiency of  handling cases; emphasize strict law enforcement and make full  use of all available legal weapons; punish severely and quickly  serious criminal elements according to law; and resolutely  overcome the problems of imposing a financial penalty instead of  imprisonment, bending the law for the benefit of relatives or  friends, and lowering the standard of punishment.  <H3>  III. Improve the Legal System, and Strengthen Security  Control </H3>   Relevant data shows that public security departments are  actively creating relevant laws and regulations. Last year, the  "Announcement on the Prohibition of Using Military Firearms for  Business Shooting Activities," the "Announcement on Striking  Severe Blows at the Criminal Activities of Theft, Sabotaging  Railways, Oil- Fields, Electric Power Plants, and Communication  Equipment," and the "Methods of Taking In and Educating  Prostitutes and Persons Visiting Prostitutes" and other laws and  regulations were submitted to the State Council for release.  Public security organizations in various localities also  promulgated quite a number of local control laws and regulations  and strengthened various public security control positions  according to law.    Tian Qiyu believed that this year, with rapid development of  the economy as a whole and the upgrading of marketization, the  growth of various markets will quicken, tertiary industry will  further develop, and a great deal of insecurity will continue to  exist in production and operations. Therefore, public security  control and safety precautions will be needed for new situations  and problems. At present, it is important to strengthen social  security comprehensive control.    Relevant regulations of the State Council and the Ministry  of  Public Security should be strictly carried out, and security  control, traffic control, fire control, entry and exit control,  and other spheres should be strengthened. Problems driven by  economic interests should be resolutely put right, and public  security personnel taking part -- directly or indirectly -- in  the operations of trades under their control by use of powers or  authority should be strictly prohibited.    We should step up the building of local police offices,  especially those in the rural areas, build up sound public  security organizations at basic levels, and pay attention to  bringing their role into play. This year the floating  population will continue to increase, and management of these  people will be one of our emphases. We should actively study  ways to manage the floating population. The contingents who  protect and control the masses have played an important role in  safeguarding public security, and we should continue rectifying,  consolidating, and strengthening them, and actively develop  "safety small district" activities, and popularize people's  defense, material defense, and technology defense measures. We  should educate and help those who have been released after  serving sentences or have been relieved of education through  labor, and step up the control of key people. It is necessary  to actively explore new approaches to strengthening enterprise  security work under the new situation. Locality, railway,  communications, civil aviation, forestry, and public security  organizations should coordinate closely with each other,  strengthen security in railway stations, wharves, airports, and  forests, and should develop centralized rectification and  control in places where problems stand out sharply. In short,  we should increase efforts to wipe out evil social phenomena,  and make sure we achieve actual results.   <H5>    IV. Carry Out Public Security Structural Reform </H5>   On this subject, Tian Qiyu declared that public security  work  must also constantly enhance the strength of reform under new  situations and conditions. Building up the people's police  patrol system in cities is a major reform of public security  work which meets the new situation of reform and opening-up and  economic development. In June 1993, the Ministry of Public  Security called the "All-China Working Conference of People's  Police Patrol in Cities," and developed, on a preliminary basis,  the work of the people's police patrol in a number of cities.  Shanghai, Tianjin, and some other cities started work on an  institutional, standardized, and systematic basis. The rapid  development of this work enabled public security organs in large  and medium-sized cities to greatly enhance their control of  social order, and to frighten criminals, which prevented crimes  and built close relations between the police and the people. In  1994 the Ministry of Public Security demanded that various  localities should consolidate and strengthen this job in terms  of hardware and software.    According to the requirement of the State Council, the  Ministry of Public Security last year set up a working group in  charge of organizational reform, and public security departments  and bureaus of the great majority of provinces, regions, and  cities also did a great deal of exploratory work. Through  repeated study and by pooling the wisdom of the masses, the  organizational reform plan of county-level public security  organs was worked out, experimental work was gradually spread  out in various provinces, regions, and cities, and many  localities even began reform experiments in some of their  vocational departments.    While performing structural reform, it is also necessary to  pay attention to the building of the public security  contingents, and great efforts should be made in anticorruption  work and instilling honesty. Concerning this, Tian Qiyu stated  that, in August of last year, the Ministry of Public Security  set up a special working group to fight corruption; called an  anticorruption telephone conference of public security organs  throughout China; stipulated the "Regulations on 10 Not-Alloweds  for Public Security Organs and Public Security Cadres and  Policeman," and "Decisions on Abolition of 16 Items of  Indiscriminate Fee Collection"; and sent out investigation teams  to various localities for supervision.    This year, on the basis of summarizing last year's  anticorruption struggle, we should continue investigating and  dealing with major cases; resolutely punish corrupt people;  overcome the problem of people knowingly violating the law; and  punish those who break the law while enforcing it, bend the law  for the benefit of relatives or friends, and encroach on the  interests of the masses. We should further build up a sound  internal supervisory and constraining mechanism of public  security organs, and actively explore and develop a supervisory  system that conforms with the vocational characteristics of the  people's police. We should strengthen the management of public  security contingent, and build up and improve various rules and  regulations. We should firmly grasp the opportunity to  implement public servant regulations and start building up an  entire set of rules and regulations on contingent management  that links with the public servant regulations and police  regulations and conform with the characteristics of public  security organs, so as to make contingent management more  standardized and in line with the legal system.  <H3>  V. Cooperation Between the Police Forces of Both Sides Is  Fruitful </H3>   Discussing the present situation in which Sino-British  negotiations have broken down as a result of the fact that the  British side adhered to a wrong position and practiced the  "three violations," Tian Qiyu, as a member of Preliminary  Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region, declared: The disruption of  Sino-British cooperation is what we and the broad masses of our  compatriots in Hong Kong are unwilling to see. We hope that  Hong Kong will remain prosperous and stable, and the Chinese  police force hopes that Hong Kong will experience fine social  security order. After the establishment of the meeting system  in 1984 between the public security organs of the Chinese  mainland and the Hong Kong police force, both sides held working  meetings every year in Beijing and Hong Kong and cooperated in  battling criminal offenses involving firearms, smuggling,  narcotics trafficking, economic crimes, and triad criminal  offenses. Cooperation between the police forces is fruitful.    To my knowledge, the police forces of both sides achieved  splendid results in recent years in pursuing crimes involving  the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. Since 1991, public security  organs in the Chinese mainland have handed-over 60 recovered  luxury cars stolen in Hong Kong, and 24 such cars were returned  last year alone. In recent years, mainland public security  organs have delivered dozens of criminals to the Hong Kong  police force: 15 in 1992, and 17 in 1993. They joined efforts  against crime, and forcefully frightened criminals, which  obviously reduced serious criminal cases of gun robbery and car  theft that took place recently in Hong Kong. Auto theft cases  in Hong Kong dropped by 46 percent, and crimes involving guns  dropped by nearly 50 percent, which played a positive role in  stabilizing social security in Hong Kong. Representatives of  public security organs from the Chinese mainland who went to  Hong Kong for investigation and to deliver evidence also won  enjoyed the positive cooperation of the Hong Kong police force.  Such cooperation is advantageous to maintaining the public  order of both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.    Tian Qiyu said: We hope such cooperation will be further  strengthened and developed during the later stage of transition.    To further promote the understanding between the police  forces of the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, we will enlarge  exchanges in police vocational work, education and training,  technological equipment, and culture and sports through working  meetings, exchange of visits, and friendly contacts. We also  welcome friends of the Hong Kong police force to come to the  mainland for tours, vacations, and to visit relatives. We not  only welcome visits from the upper and middle levels, but also  visits from the lower level. We not only welcome Chinese, but  also welcome those of non-Chinese descent. We welcome them to  visit the Chinese mainland mainly for the sake of increasing  understanding and strengthening friendship, so that both sides  will coordinate more smoothly and more effectively in the  preparatory work during the later stage of transition.    When the correspondent asked about the appraisal of the Hong  Kong police force and its use after 1997 -- a general concern of  Hong Kong police circles -- Tian Qiyu calmly replied: We have  talked about this issue on many occasions. The overall quality  of Hong Kong policemen is quite good, they are highly efficient  in handling affairs, and they have played a proper role in  maintaining the social security of Hong Kong. They not only  play an important role in ensuring the smooth transition of Hong  Kong during the later stage of transition, but will also be an  important force for maintaining the public order of Hong Kong  region after 1997. During the later stage of transition, the  social security of Hong Kong remains the responsibility of the  British-Hong Kong authorities.    The great majority of Hong Kong policemen "love their  motherland, and love Hong Kong", and after 1997 they will not be  discriminated against politically because they worked for the  British-Hong Kong Government. The Hong Kong police force is an  important component of the Hong Kong civil service. The policy  of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong civil service  naturally applies to the Hong Kong police force. We hope that  the police force will dispel their misgivings, be relieved, and  keep their mind on their work. We are convinced that the police  department of the SAR government will continue to use and  promote them according to their personal qualifications and  record of service, experiences, abilities, and their actual  performance in maintaining the public order of Hong Kong during  the transitional period.    With the approach of the return of Hong Kong in 1997, we  hope  that the police force of the Chinese mainland and that of Hong  Kong will continue to strengthen cooperation, and work with  concerted effort for the smooth transition and successful return  of Hong Kong.</p>

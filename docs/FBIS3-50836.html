			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1255 GMT on 8 January features a 13-minute live telephone  interview with Marilyn Perez Coto, journalist for the Puerto  Rican newspaper CLARIDAD, regarding the current situation of the  35 Cuban athletes who deserted recently during the 17th Central  American and Caribbean Games in Ponce.    Radio Rebelde host Alfredo Forte explains to Perez that this  call is in response to a 7 January GRANMA article that was based  on the Milvia Arcilla piece published in CLARIDAD entitled, "The  Defectors are Abandoned." Perez states: "Sadly enough, many of  the athletes who defected believed the promises made to them.  However a week after the games, they were housed in a civil  defense shelter." Perez states that many of the promises made to  them cannot be fulfilled because of certain Puerto Rican laws  and regulations. She adds: "It is not easy for someone new to  find work, particularly when there are so many unemployed Puerto  Ricans with university degrees in sports."    Perez stresses that athletes in Puerto Rico need to depend  on  regular jobs to make a living and that training facilities are  not as readily available as in Cuba. Perez stresses that the  athletes have basically been forbidden to speak to the press,  particularly CLARIDAD, which presents a point of view different  from the official view in other newspapers.    Perez points out that only one athlete, basketball star  Andre  Gibert, has been provided an apartment. Perez states that they  have been told Gibert is very depressed because he is not  playing and that his future is uncertain, since it is unlikely  that the Puerto Rican and Cuban Basketball Leagues will reach an  agreement to let him play. Forte and Perez stress that Gibert  had been told it was very easy to become a pro star.    Perez explains that the Cuban exile community is pressuring  sports leagues and local officials, behind closed doors, to  change the rules and let Cuban athletes play. Perez notes that  the possibilities for these athletes are minimal: "It is very  sad, but these young men [muchachos] have thrown their futures  overboard. Here they will end up working as store clerks."  Throughout the conversation, Perez repeatedly refers to the  athletes as "muchachos."    Forte states that they have unfortunately allowed themselves  to be carried away by a siren's song and are now dearly paying  the consequences.    Perez reports that there are approximately 10 athletes still  in Puerto Rico -- the ones who ended up in the shelter. Others  have reportedly moved to Miami or are staying with relatives.  Perez stresses that in Miami the situation is no easier in terms  of getting permission from sports leagues or overcoming  international rules.    Perez adds: "It is very, very sad. There are people here who  left during the Mariel boat lift; we all know the conditions  under which the Mariel people left. We see them in the streets,  very depressed and regretful. They are trying to get help, and  tell everyone that they regret having left and want to return to  Cuba. However, we cannot help them at this point." Perez adds  that there are immigrants from the seventies and eighties who  are truly sad and have not found a niche in Puerto Rico. Perez  says that the only hope these people have is to fight for the  end of the blockade and therefore vindicate themselves. Yet, it  is not easy to do this after having betrayed one's country. She  states: "They mope around like penitent souls. It is truly sad."    Perez describes the tragedy of these young men's actions,  that this will be a trauma they will have to shoulder the rest  of their lives, and adds: "In the end, they will regret what  they did."    Forte thanks Perez for the information. Perez explains that  they feel like Cuba'a correspondents. Forte thanks Perez for the  support CLARIDAD and the Puerto Rican people gave to Cuba during  the games. Perez says that it is their duty to support Cuba 100  percent, everyday, and under any circumstances, because: "We  believe in the Cuban Revolution."</p>

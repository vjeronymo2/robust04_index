			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Russia to copy UK regulatory structure MR Andrei Kashevarov, head of the Commission for Russian Exchanges, has decided to create a regulatory system based on the structure of the UK's Securities and Investments Board. A bill placing the development and control of all Russian exchanges under the commission, responsible directly to the president, will be developed by Financial Research Associates, an emerging markets consultancy, which is helping the Russians build up their financial framework under a UK government Know-how Fund programme. The move was urgently needed 'to halt the slide of financial deregulation towards organised crime on one hand and . . . to establish responsible exchanges on the other,' said Mr Tim Lewin, managing director of FRA. The draft bill is expected to go before the Russian parliament before the end of the year. There are currently 300 exchanges in Russia, but most will evolve into markets for goods, while only a few will become commodity or financial exchanges, according to Mr Lewin. The decision to follow the British model was reached after a series of meetings with the UK authorities during the International Organisation of Securities Commissions' annual meeting in London last week. Mr Kashevarov was accompanied by Mr Vitali Kulakovatras, a member of the Russian parliament's committee for economic reform. The regulatory structure 'will provide broad international standards of regulation and a clear chain of command,' said Mr Kashevarov. Spanish stockbroking firms' profits slumped in the first nine months of the year, Reuter reports from Madrid. The Madrid stock exchange's 50 members made a profit of Pta2.14bn (Dollars 19.5m) up to the end of September, down 82 per cent on the same period last year.</p>

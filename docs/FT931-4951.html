			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Technology: Two heads are better than one - A growing Japanese trend for international collaboration on R&amp;D ON A grey February afternoon in a London meeting room, a Cambridge research team announced that it had demonstrated one of the holy grails of electronics engineering. It had developed a single electron device, where a 'bit' of information could be stored by a single electron in a chip. The announcement overshadowed one of the most innovative aspects of the development: it was made by a joint Anglo-Japanese research team. For Hitachi, it was the first time the company had conducted fundamental research outside Japan, according to Akira Koizumi, managing director of Hitachi Europe. But this is a growing trend among Japanese companies. Cambridge's Cavendish laboratories have collaborative agreements with both Toshiba and Hitachi to conduct research into quantum electronics. And Sharp has set up its European research centre on the Oxford Science Park. Clive Bradley, managing director of Sharp Laboratories of Europe, believes credence in these projects is growing within Japanese industry and government. 'Generally speaking there is a perceived need to bring into Japanese companies the kind of research experience that is done outside. Building laboratories overseas and having good communications is the best way of doing that,' he says. Yutaka Kuwahara, general manager for Hitachi Europe's research and development centre, emphasises the point. 'Discussion between people from the same cultural background is not so deep. Researchers with different backgrounds bring different attitudes.' Hitachi had some track record in collaboration between Japanese and overseas researchers before joining forces with Cambridge. Some 300 foreign scientists had already passed through the doors of its Tokyo research laboratory. 'About five years ago we believed - and we still believe - that revolutionary technology could be done through international collaboration,' explains Kuwahara. 'We thought industry would have difficulty in doing it on its own - it needs to be a collaboration between theorists and industry.' Hitachi ploughs Pounds 1m a year into its Cambridge laboratory, which pays for seven staff, two from Japan and five from the UK. This comprises half the joint development team, with the rest funded through UK academic sources. Hitachi holds the patent on the single-electron device, but Cambridge University will share in any financial returns from the breakthrough. The Toshiba Cambridge Research Centre, on the Cambridge Science Park, which has been open since January 1991, has 11 staff, two of whom are Japanese. The managing director is Michael Pepper, a Cambridge professor. Sharp's laboratory, which has been open since March 1992, is by far the largest of the three. It employs 42, including four Japanese researchers, and has funds of Pounds 4m a year, out of Sharp's total R&amp;D funds of Pounds 500m. The most difficult thing in setting up the laboratories from scratch, reports Bradley, was deciding the focus of the research. 'Sharp asked us to consider programmes in opto-electronics, artificial intelligence and machine translation. Those were the broad categories,' he recalls. Cambridge's Cavendish laboratory and Hitachi faced a similar challenge. Four years ago the research was centred on quantum devices: only as the research progressed did it become focused on the single-electron memory. Researchers argue the collaboration has been fruitful, though not necessarily easy. 'Science is fairly universal,' points out Haroon Ahmed, professor of micro-electronics at the Cavendish Laboratory. 'But there are different ways of doing things.' The Hitachi team gets together once a week to discuss the extent of its research. 'We also argue about our results,' adds Ahmed. 'I am very interested in the difference between the Japanese and the UK way of doing research,' explains Yasuo Ikawa, deputy managing director of the Toshiba Cambridge Research Centre. 'As far as basic research is concerned the UK has strengths historically. Japan, I believe, has strengths in developmental research. We have to think about combining those differences.' Ikawa believes that in Japan researchers take a 'me too' attitude to research. When a theory is first proposed, he says, researchers are sceptical. But once the theory appears plausible, then every company takes it up. In the UK, on the other hand, researchers do not want to work in areas where rivals are working. 'That is why there is so much creative and original research done in the UK,' argues Ikawa. Bradley believes that in Japan more emphasis is placed on quantifying targets, even in basic research. 'I have to try to come to an appropriate blend of individualism in creative research and Japanese management skills,' he says. 'Management skills are not something that comes naturally to highly innovative scientists.' The trick, believes Bradley, is not to suppress the individualism that persuaded Sharp to invest in British scientists in the first place. And, he adds: 'We've been pleasantly surprised to see how researchers have responded to targets, even if they're five or 10 years away.' Communications hold the key, believes Kuwahara. At Hitachi, relationships were introduced at every level of research - between researchers and scientists as well as managers. Research programmes were used to send people from the UK to Japan to work in Hitachi's laboratories, where work is done on the related field of atomic manipulation. 'Of course, it is not easy,' says Kuwahara. 'But this sort of human communication is very important.' Bradley goes even further. He believes good communications between researchers in Japan and those in Oxford are crucial to the team's success. Researchers in the two centres have a 'very active day-to-day relationship', he says. Technology also aids researchers in forging closer links. Electronic mail, telephones and facsimile machines are used to keep researchers in the UK in contact with those in Japan. Sharp has a global network for telephone and fax calls. Looking to the future, Bradley believes computer-to-computer communications will also be established. But this will create its own problems. Much of the data held in the principal research centre are in Japanese and would need translating. Bradley points out the culture of Japanese companies such as Sharp prevents the research laboratories from feeling cut off from the main body of researchers. 'It's not the Japanese way to leave us isolated. We're all part of the family now. They work very hard at that.' For Bradley, the links between Oxford and Japan are particularly important because the Japanese company is Bradley's biggest customer. Although the European offices of Sharp funded the Pounds 9.9m capital outlay for the research facility - Sharp in the UK provided 80 per cent with France, Germany and Spain providing the rest - it will be some time before they will be able to take the Oxford developments and incorporate them into products. 'In five to 10 years' time we will be looking more to European countries,' adds Bradley. For Toshiba, too, it is Japan that funds the research. But, says Ikawa, the head office gives the research team a certain amount of autonomy. 'Toshiba Tokyo's concern is the research results.' In spite of the difficulties, Hitachi's Koizumi believes the benefits of international collaboration have outweighed any problems. 'We believe this is a good model for a different way of doing research,' he says. 'It's the opposite side of the brain drain.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conforming Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The changes to MSHA's procedures and requirements for testing and evaluation of products MSHA approves for use in gassy, underground mines set forth in this new proposed part 6 also would necessitate certain conforming amendments to the Agency's approval regulations in 30 CFR parts 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 33, and 35. These approval regulations contain application provisions for approval and extension of approval of products which manufacturers seeking MSHA approval must follow. Therefore, appropriate revisions to these application provisions to reference proposed part 6 are being included as part of this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency's effort in the initial issuance of the approval would be reduced significantly because MSHA's role would change from that of testing and evaluating prototype products to that of oversight, auditing, and addressing new technology. Thus, MSHA fees charged to manufacturers would be reduced significantly. Because the Agency no longer would provide certain kinds of testing and evaluation, its hourly and flat rate charges for such services would be eliminated. However, in order to issue a manufacturer an MSHA approval, the Agency still would have to review the manufacturer's documents. As a result of the proposed rule, the manufacturer's documents would now include the NRTL's testing and evaluation results. MSHA estimates that due to the increased technical and administrative time needed to review the NRTL testing and evaluation data, its application fee would increase from $100 to $400. The $400 estimate is based upon a per-hour fee of $50 and an 8-hour average for technical and administrative review, which account for the fact that applications vary in complexity and, therefore, differ in their review time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 requires that regulatory agencies assess both the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. MSHA has determined that this proposed rule does not meet the criteria of a significant regulatory action and, therefore, has not prepared a separate analysis of costs and benefits. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires regulatory agencies to consider a rule's impact on small entities. This proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The analysis contained in this preamble meets MSHA's responsibilities under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this proposed rule, Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs), rather than MSHA, would test and evaluate most mining products requiring Federal approval. Having more than one entity available to conduct tests and evaluations would facilitate a more efficient process of providing the required services and, thus, expedite the introduction of new and innovative equipment into the Nation's mines. Moreover, the proposed rule would maintain the existing level of workplace safety provided by Federal testing and evaluation because the NRTLs must be recognized by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration as being qualified to perform specific testing and evaluation for MSHA product approval. More importantly, MSHA still would be fully responsible for approving any equipment tested and evaluated before it could be used in a mine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reducing the number of tests and evaluations it conducts would allow MSHA to direct its resources more to auditing products actually used in mines. In addition, NRTLs recognized by OSHA must conduct field audits as part of their follow-up programs, and under MSHA's proposed rule any reports of such audits would have to be made available to MSHA. These field audits would ensure that products in use continue to meet the specifications of the approval. MSHA believes that increasing such field audits would enhance safety. Also, shifting resources from routine testing and evaluation would permit MSHA to direct more attention to evaluating new technology which may be safer than existing technology, potentially accelerating the entry of such equipment into mines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the proposed rule would permit MSHA to accept product testing and evaluation based upon approval requirements other than its own, so long as the alternative requirements provide at least the same level of safety as MSHA's requirements. In some instances these requirements may be more stringent than MSHA's. Because products approved using the more stringent requirements would have to be built to those requirements, safety would be enhanced. In addition, acceptance of equivalent or enhanced requirements should allow a wider spectrum of safe and improved equipment to be used in mining. This also would eliminate the need for manufacturers to design separate products to meet the demands of different approval requirements, MSHA's approval requirements and, for example, an international requirement, where a single design could provide the necessary level of safety. MSHA expects that this proposed rule also would facilitate the use of metrification in the construction of equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

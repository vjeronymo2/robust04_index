			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Charles Rebois: "Pasqua's Rise in the Polls"] </F>   [Excerpts] Although jobs remain the French people's top  priority, public safety is also one of their major concerns.  They said as much--in spectacular fashion--on the FIGARO  MAGAZINE-SOFRES [French Opinion Polling Company] barometer in  December by their vote on the performance of Interior Minister  Charles Pasqua, who gained 15 points, with 59 percent wishing to  see him play a major role in the future compared to 44 percent  the previous month.    The raid carried out on the premises of the FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front]; the expulsion of the Turkish imam of Nantua;  the police operation against the Kurds of the PKK [Workers'  Party of Kurdistan]; and Pasqua's statement (made over TF-1  [French Television-Channel 1] on 21 November during the "Seven  on Seven" program) to the effect that "France will no longer  allow, on its soil, activities likely to harm its interests,"  constituted a veritable "Pasqua festival" and fulfilled the  wishes of the very large segment of the public that voted  massively for the right last March. The French people are also  praising this cabinet minister for having acquired the  constitutional means for ending the abuse of the right to asylum.    At the political level, Charles Pasqua is seeing his  influence grow. As one of the trio who heads the honors list of  the leading figures of the right, he is closing fast behind  Edouard Balladur and is within one point of Simone Veil. His  actions contradict those--both within the majority and on the  left--who criticize the government's policy on grounds that it  is not bold enough. These actions also tend over time to  marginalize the National Front by taking away one of its  principal electoral arguments.    The intensity of the pro-public safety sentiment is also  confirmed by Pierre Mehaignerie's six-point rise in the poll.  The French people approve of the keeper of the seals [justice  minister], who dared to brave the hostility of the legal  profession by introducing a bill that prescribes life  imprisonment for rapists who murder their child victims.    Most of the leading figures of the right are not lagging  behind. The prime minister continues to rise in the poll,  scoring a gain of five points: 65 percent of those polled have  confidence in him, compared to 31 percent who do not. This score  places him out of range of the criticism of an evanescent left.  As for the impatience of certain individuals in his majority  coalition, it is echoed less in public opinion than in political  circles.    The conditions of the new cohabitation have changed  radically  from what they were in 1986. Whereas the rating for the prime  minister has remained at the highest level, that of the head of  state is dropping. Francois Mitterrand has lost 10 points: only  38 percent now have confidence in him, compared to the 59  percent who do not. This decline is all the more unexpected in  that it has taken place since his participation in the "Hour of  Truth."    Political analyses often set Edouard Balladur over against  Jacques Chirac. They are viewed as potential rivals for the  presidency. The prime minister's popularity has nonetheless not  overshadowed that of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] president,  who achieved a gain of six points.    This almost general improvement in the ratings of the  leaders  of the majority indicates that the left has not regained the  French people's confidence. Michel Rocard, the left's principal  leader was severely penalized with a loss of five points in the  poll. His presidential ambitions appear to be in jeopardy. His  famous big bang [preceding two words in English]--which was to  signal the start of the Socialist renewal--appears to have been  just one more illusion.    As for the approval ratings for the political parties, that  of the Socialist Party remained very negative, whereas that of  the RPR gained 5 percent and the UDF [Union for French  Democracy] 4 percent.    This barometer shows the price the left is having to pay for  persisting in a culture of political parties that ignores the  French people's need for public safety.  <H5>  Mitterrand: 38 Percent Approval Rating </H5>   Do you have complete confidence, relative confidence,  relative nonconfidence, or no confidence at all that Francois  Mitterrand can solve France's current problems?    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Inveresk turns in Pounds 4.5m as operating margins improve INVERESK, the Scottish speciality paper company which floated on the Stock Exchange in June, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.53m in the 27 weeks to June 5. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 3.12m in the six months to May 28 1992, struck after a Pounds 765,000 loss from activities since discontinued. Turnover improved to Pounds 46.9m, against Pounds 46.2m which included a Pounds 2.89m contribution from discontinued activities associated with the Caldwells mill where a commodity product line was shut down. Mr Stefan Kay, managing director, said: 'We have capital expenditure plans to spend about Pounds 7m a year for the next three years funded by internal cash generation.' The company, which said at its flotation it would grow partly by acquisition, has no purchases in mind now, but is considering two joint ventures. The graphic board business, which together with label paper operations accounts for about 60 per cent of turnover, saw steady demand in the UK and the Benelux countries, but experienced weak sales in Germany without loss of market share. Sales of label paper 'developed well'. Demand for sheets of labels, as opposed to rolls, was sharply higher and the company was forced to employ contractors to meet orders. Inveresk believes the new pattern of label buying indicated economic recovery as demand for sheets signals companies were seeking to respond more quickly to changes in their markets. Operating profits increased to Pounds 4.67m (Pounds 3.31m) and net operating margins improved to 9.9 per cent (9.4 per cent). Net interest payments dropped to Pounds 140,000 (Pounds 181,000). The company is not paying a dividend until the final, which will be proposed when results for the 53 week period to December 4 are published. Earnings per share increased to 8.6p (6.1p).</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Strong yen brings Japanese little joy: Michiyo Nakamota sees no early import boost THE RISE of the yen's value against the dollar has been cited by both Japanese and US officials as a factor that would help stimulate Japanese consumption of imported goods and, in the long run, reduce Japan's Dollars 126bn (Pounds 82bn) trade surplus. But so far, for Japanese corporations and consumers alike, the impact of the yen's appreciation this year has brought little to rejoice about. 'There are only demerits of endaka (the yen's appreciation) but no merits,' laments Mr Yasuaki Takano, president of Sanyo Electric, who explains that because utility costs have not come down his company has seen none of the benefits of a higher yen. In spite of the yen's rapid rise over the past few months, and the fact that Japan imports a large proportion of its raw materials and basic foodstuffs, there is spreading scepticism in Japan whether a higher yen will bring the desired benefits to consumers and importers and eventually help reduce the country's bloated trade surplus. The yen appreciation has raised calls from industry and consumer associations alike for measures to ensure that the benefits do not disappear in the maze of Japan's complicated distribution system but are passed on fully to end-users and consumers. The government's Economic Planning Agency has started a survey of imported products to determine whether there is room for price reductions as a result of the yen's rise. Both the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations are meanwhile looking into price differentials between Japanese and overseas markets. While the prices of some imported products have been reduced to reflect the higher yen, the impact of these isolated cases is far outweighed by the refusal of the utilities, for example, to pass on the benefits. Oil companies said last week they would cut petrol prices. But in spite of calls from industry leaders and consumer groups to reduce their prices, the big electric power and gas companies have been reluctant to do so. The utilities say that when planning for this year they based their cost calculations on an oil price of Dollars 16.50 a barrel whereas the price of oil is now about Dollars 18.50 and has recently been higher. They claim further that any benefits of a higher yen are absorbed by the rise in employee and capital expenditure costs which they must bear regardless of the yen's appreciation. While it is still too early to determine the impact of the yen's rise on demand for imports, it is thought that it may be minimal. 'A 10 per cent appreciation of the yen is not likely to have a visible effect,' says Mr Takao Komine of the EPA. A feeling that the yen's appreciation will do little more than stimulate overseas travel is aggravated by a heightened sense that the cost of living in Japan is much higher than that of other countries. The higher yen increases price differentials between Japan and other markets when prices are denominated in yen. So the price of a pair of jeans in the US at Dollars 50 now appears much cheaper to a Japanese in Tokyo then it did in January - at Y111 to the dollar it is only Y5,550 compared with Y6,200 at an exchange rate of Y124 as the year began. The overall impact is to create the impression that the higher yen has done little to increase consumers' purchasing power at home. At the same time, experience has shown that a higher yen does not necessarily lead to lower import prices since the difference often gets lost in the high margins claimed by the many intermediaries in Japan's distribution system. Reform of Japan's convoluted distribution system and government regulation of industry would go much futher than a higher yen in reducing the cost of living in Japan, Mr Komine points out. As such, in contrast to a higher yen, it would also help reduce price differentials. The high cost of building a house in Japan could, for example, be reduced by 30 per cent if the distribution and contracting systems were simplified, the Japan Research Institute points out.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Forlani forced to pull out of Italy's presidential race ITALY'S Christian Democrats suffered a big reverse yesterday when the leadership was forced to withdraw the party's official presidential candidate, Mr Arnaldo Forlani, from the race. The withdrawal of Mr Forlani after he twice failed to obtain sufficient backing in the special parliamentary vote for the presidency is likely to complicate the five-day-old process of choosing Italy's ninth postwar head of state. The opposition to Mr Forlani, the Christian Democrat party secretary, also underlined the serious divisions within both the party and its allies in the outgoing government coalition. The presidential race was last night again open, with the Christian Democrats having to reconsider the whole basis of their alliances and whether they should consider seeking a candidate from within their own ranks. Mr Forlani had only emerged as the Christian Democrats' official candidate on Friday after a series of hectic late-night negotiating sessions and four inconclusive rounds of voting in parliament. When he stood in the fifth and sixth rounds he got 469 and 479 votes. This was well short of the simple majority of 508 votes required after the first three rounds in which a two-thirds majority was necessary, had passed, As one of the party's most experienced political figures and the man responsible for strategy in the April 5 general elections, Mr Forlani had been chosen as a heavyweight to rally support among a demoralised and divided party. The Christian Democrats had also counted on the support of their allies in the outgoing coalition - the Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats. In theory the four should have been able to muster 539 votes if all the deputies, senators and regional council representatives had backed Mr Forlani. The failure of Mr Forlani underlines the virtual impossibility in the present parliamentary climate of finding a presidential candidate proposed solely by the outgoing four-party coalition. Mr Mario Segni, the Christian Democrat dissident who heads the referendum movement, revealed yesterday he had cast a blank vote, as had several of his supporters, in protest against the party's continued refusal to recognise the need for a head of state who clearly represented the nation's mood in favour of fundamental institutional change. The issue of change, highlighted by the large protest vote in the April general elections, is now likely to dominate the choice of a candidate. Equally, the withdrawal of Mr Forlani could mark the beginning of a big change within the Christian Democrat party, leading to the exit of old-guard politicians.</p>

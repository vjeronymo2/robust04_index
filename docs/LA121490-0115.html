			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS' ORDER: CLEANLINESS COURSE  </P> <P> Despite protests from the Chamber of Commerce and the California Restaurant  Assn., the City Council this week unanimously approved an ordinance creating  the first program in the county requiring a course on cleanliness and food  handling for restaurant managers.  </P> <P> The ordinance makes mandatory a four-hour course to educate managers of  restaurants with five or more employees.  </P> <P> The course will be administered by the environmental health department of the  county's Health Care Agency and will affect more than 200 restaurants.  </P> <P> Each location will have eight months to comply with the ordinance. Restaurants  must have at least one manager who has earned a certificate by attending the  $20 course and passing a written exam. The certificate is valid for three  years.  </P> <P> Opponents of the new ordinance complained that the city program duplicates  similar efforts by private industry and does not include smaller restaurants,  markets and other food facilities prone to sanitation violations.  </P> <P> Ed Dart, a member of the Board of Supervisors Food Sanitation Advisory Council,  said a task force concluded that the estimated course cost is too low and  predicted a fee increase of up to $125. Dart said the program could also cost  employers up to $150 per employee for time and travel expenses.  </P> <P> Bill Utter, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce's governmental affairs  committee, called the course "an unnecessary expense to put on the backs of  restaurant owners" during an economic slowdown.

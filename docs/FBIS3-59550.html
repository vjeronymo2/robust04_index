			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Franco Foresta Martin: "Supercomputing To </F> Understand the Phenomena of the Planet."]    [Text] Parallel computing will be the basis of the new and  invigorated vocations of research that ENEA [National Agency for  New Technologies, Energy and the Environment] President Nicola  Cabibbo intends to promote in the agency that came under his  guidance a few months ago. "Climatology, remote sensing,  environmental analysis, and energy processes are some of the  ENEA fields of interest that will benefit from the sharp  improvement in quality that will come from the introduction of  parallel computing methods," announced Cabibbo.    A theoretical physicist of international prestige, who has  been distinguished more than once by the Swedish Academy of  Sciences for his contributions to the so-called "standard model"  of physics, Cabibbo has been president of the National Institute  for Nuclear Physics (INFN) for eight years. It was there that he  started the APE (Array Processor Experiment) project for a  supercomputer capable of performing billions of operations per  second.    Cabibbo remembers that: "At the beginning of the eighties  our  group working on quantistic cromodynamics, the theory that  describes the behavior of quarks, was engaged on a numerical  simulation project to deduce the values of some physical  quantities. Such an expensive high-performance supercomputer  was needed that we thought of building it ourselves. We decided  not to go along the same path as the big producers like Cray,  that push the speed of the single components to a maximum, and  preferred to build a machine in which a large number of  computing units worked in parallel. In this way it was possible  to obtain high performance using standard technologies, and  therefore at a more economic cost."  <H5>  Basic Physics </H5>   That was how, in 1984, the first APE machine capable of  performing one billion operations per second, started. Its  versatility, also outside the field of basic physics, was  immediately recognized for all processes relating to industrial  production and in general to forecasting analyses.    The project developed and in 1989 a second generation  machine  was built, the APE 100-Quadrix, characterized by eight computing  units capable of performing 100 billion operations per second.  In comparison, the best personal computers on our desks that  have a single computing unit can carry out between one and 10  million operations per second. At this point the APE project  passed from the INFN laboratories to those of Alenia Spazio,  which had acquired the license and intended to market the  machine in the international field. However the INFN continued  to work on the third generation: APE 1000.    With Cabibbo as president of the ENEA the potentialities of  the supercomputer were immediately acquired by the agency which,  in its increased capacity (law of August 1991), is engaged in  research and applications in the sectors of new technologies,  energy and the environment. "The ENEA has purchased an APE 100  that will be installed in the Casaccia laboratories by next  summer and will be used both in traditional and frontier  research."  <H5>  Climatic Plan </H5>   Climatic simulations, aimed at interpreting the possible  early signs of global overheating (the greenhouse effect) and  forecasting the effects on the environment, presuppose an  intense use of the APE, also in view of the unification of all  the authorities to form a national climatic plan. Another ENEA  initiative that is based on the advantages offered by  supercomputing is the Mediterranean Basin Project (PBM) to  construct and manage an ecological system made up of telematic  computer networks and monitors, databases, and mathematical  models of the sea and the atmosphere. The final goal is  monitoring the environment, preventive and civil defense  services, and the safety of commercial and civilian traffic.    In particular, parallel computing will be used within the  scope of this program for the elaboration of climatic and  weather forecasts and for the elaboration of images obtained  both using traditional surveying instruments and the SAR  (synthetic aperture radar) technology.    ENEA's more mature lines of research will also be relaunched  thanks to the supercomputer. "There is still a lot to study  about the phenomena of combustion if we want to improve  efficiency and limit the production of pollutants. And also in  this case we have started a research line to simulate the  processes using parallel computing. Without forgetting the  possibilities offered by the cycles of nuclear fission that are  alternatives to uranium, such as those of thorium proposed by  the Bowman group of Los Alamos, with whom the ENEA has already  started to cooperate," concludes Cabibbo.</p>

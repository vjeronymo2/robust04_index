			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UN air protection over Bosnia A decision on the use of Nato airpower to protect UN troops in Bosnia will be made early next week, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, announced last night, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent, in New York. 'I hope everything will be ready on Monday or Tuesday,' he said. Forward air controllers must first be in place to guide the attack aircraft. Britain, France and the Netherlands have promised to deploy the controllers and the first of the British contingent was said yesterday to be 'in theatre'. Procedures for invoking the Security Council's resolution on possible air strikes against the Serbs had still not been worked out, Mr Boutros Ghali said. Peackeeping staff yesterday discussed the Islamic Conference Organisation offer of additional troops for the UN force.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Baghdad, Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of  the Arab Popular Forces Conference, has accused U.S. President  Clinton of seeking to extend the anti-Iraq embargo and  criticized his conditions for reducing international sanctions.  Hammudi, who is also a member of the Iraqi Ba'th Party's  Foreign Relations Committee, described Clinton's message as one  of blackmail.    This is the first Iraqi official reaction to Clinton's  message to Congress in which he expressed his fears that the  Iraqi authorities might rebuild Iraq's mass destruction arsenal.  Clinton demanded a long period of monitoring on Iraq's military  establishments before any reduction of the sanctions is effected.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOUGH ON COPS TOO  </P> <P> If there is anything that can swing the pendulum from being a conservative,  law-abiding citizen to a protesting, law-defying anarchist, it is reading about  two killings by the San Diego police and sheriff's departments.  </P> <P> In two separate incidents, two men violently met their death.  </P> <P> One man's hand held a trowel, the other man's hand held a non-existent gun.  </P> <P> Has society, stress and the criminal element in San Diego caused our law  enforcement people to react with such deadly force? Even if the appalling  answer to this question is yes, what possible rationalization is there for the  Sheriff's Department to leave the victim's body on the pavement for five hours  -- handcuffed? What possible rationalization is there for the San Diego  policeman to fire eight rounds at a man waving a trowel?  </P> <P> I've always respected authority, slowed down when I saw a California Highway  Patrol car in my rear-view mirror and could be called conservative in my  political views. I am now questioning this "rubber stamp" as I look at the  picture of a handcuffed dead body, and ask why?  </P> <P> The San Diego County Sheriff's Department certainly deserves no plaudits for  its insensitive handling of a truly unfortunate incident. At least the San  Diego police officer showed remorse over his part in the slaying. The two  sheriffs showed no compassion, remorse or respect for the human condition;  unfortunately one reaps as one sows.  </P> <P> RONALD M. KIMURA  </P> <P> Cardiff  </P></p>

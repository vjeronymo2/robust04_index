			<p>CSO     [Text] European carmakers such as Mercedes Benz and BMW  have set up low-interest loans one after the other and begun a  sales offensive in the Japanese market. U.S. autos already have  introduced "low-priced cars" with a low list price, but in the  case of European cars which are luxury class autos, it appears  that, because of the necessity to maintain brand image, they  have entered the "low price battlefront" by lowering loan  interest rates which has little effect on the list price. With  the bonus season drawing close, domestic car dealers have a  heightened sense of wariness about intensification of price  competition.    BMW (BMW Japan, Chiba city), the import base for BMW cars,  announced on 3 June that it would extend until the end of August  the special 2.9-percent loans that it had implemented until the  end of May. The whole series was considered subject to it up  until the end of May, but the extension will narrow the car  class to the middle-class "5 series." In the case of the "5201  Sedan" (4.95 million yen), the total price will be over 305,000  yen cheaper (60 payments) compared to the regular loan (6.5  percent).    Moreover, Mercedes Benz Japan (Minato Ward, Tokyo), the  import base for Benz cars, has introduced a 3.5-percent loan  beginning this month until the end of July targeting its highest  car class, "S class." In the case of borrowing 11 million yen,  total payments will be 825,000 yen less than a regular loan (6.5  percent).    In addition, it will set up special loans until the end of  July for the Audi and through June for the Rover (Mini).    Many of the European auto low-interest loans adopt the  method  of a maker-affiliated finance company paying the trade account  receivable for the sales office at the time of the purchase  contract and receiving repayment from the purchasing customer  later. The import bases which are the Japanese subsidiaries of  European makers consider that, "while bound by sales policy,  they will set up low-interest loans for limited car classes and  periods," (BMW Japan) and it is a so-called maker (import base)  initiated "discount."    As opposed to this, the sales offices of many domestic cars  finance the purchasing customer. For this reason, even though  the car price is discounted, there is the aspect of trying to  improve profit by financing, and interest has become high.</p>

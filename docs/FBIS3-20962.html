			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by FO: "Daimler-Benz/Mitsubishi: Fifth Summit </F> Meeting With Concrete Agreements; Semiconductor Know-How From  Japan for Company Subsidiary Temic Secured"]    [Text] Berlin, HANDELSBLATT, Wednesday, 1 Dec--Temic  (Telefunken Microelectronics, Ltd.), a subsidiary of  Daimler-Benz, has secured the semiconductor know-how of the  Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Access to the so-called CMOS  [complementary metal oxide semiconductor] technology has been  opened through a license, something that company head Edward  Reuter described as a "milestone" in cooperation with the  Japanese Mitsubishi combine.    The Temic agreement is part of a package of projects which  was agreed on by the top managers of both companies on Tuesday  in Berlin (which has already been reported in another section of  HANDELSBLATT). With it, according to Shinroku Morohashi, the  chairman of the Mitsubishi Corporation, six of a total of 35  planned joint ventures can be realized.    Morohashi and Reuter described the fifth meeting as  extraordinarily successful. Reuter confronted critics of the  talks held between the two technology combines for three and a  half years now with the fact that the participants had been "not  so impatient" and the contacts "somewhat longer-term"  deliberately. Morohashi indirectly explained the obviously  difficult rapprochement of the Germans and Japanese as being  attributable to "different management methods" and "a different  corporate philosophy."    They also reached a concrete stage on the planned joint  construction of a metallurgical recycling plant for used cars in  Germany. According to Reuter, two locations for the  DM100-million project, in which the Austrian firm, Voest Alpine,  is also to be participating, are being studied. Mercedes-Benz  and Mitsubishi want to examine the cost effectiveness of the  technology with this pilot plant. Another cooperative project  involves joint research in the field of recycling of plastics.    However, an agreement in principle is still to be negotiated  in detail between Mercedes-Benz and Mitsubishi Motor Corporation  on the licensed production of the MItsubishi L-2000 minivan by  Mercedes-Benz of South Africa. Mitsubishi is at present  producing from 50,000 to 60,000 units a year of this vehicle  with a payload of one ton in Japan. According to the firm, its  worldwide competitors in this class of vehicle are Nissan and  Toyota.    Further arrangements between Daimler and Mitsubishi involve  a  joint appearance at the "New Earth '93" environmental exposition  in Osaka this month, various research fields, joint purchases of  materials worldwide, and management training. Furthermore,  Mitsubishi wants to submit an offer to take over the general  management of one or several of the buildings of the Daimler  construction project on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin.    Reuter estimates that his company spends from DM50 to DM100  million a year on research and investments involving joint  ventures. With more comprehensive aerospace projects, this  figure could be considerably higher.</p>

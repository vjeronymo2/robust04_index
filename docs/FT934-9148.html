			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Albanian ministers arrested in Macedonia crackdown THE government of Macedonia yesterday arrested several ethnic Albanians, including two deputy ministers in the coalition government, on charges of preparing an armed rebellion. Macedonian police yesterday renewed their clampdown on Gostivar and Tetovo, mostly ethnic Albanian towns. The move could shatter the fragile ethnic co-existence between Albanians and Macedonians in the former Yugoslav republic, where Albanians comprise at least 20 per cent of the 2m population. Mr Hisen Haskaj, the deputy defence minister, and Mr Imer Imeri, the deputy health minister, were arrested and charged with organising a paramilitary unit and preparing an armed rebellion, said Macedonian radio. The radio said 300 automatic rifles were discovered in a police raid, and claimed the rebellion had been planned by a political party with close ties with ethnic Albanians in the neighbouring province of Kosovo, southern Serbia. Meanwhile in Sarajevo, three children were killed and about 15 were critically wounded in a mortar bomb attack in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. Sarajevo radio said two adults were killed and 30 wounded by shelling in another mortar attack in the city besieged by Serbs since April 1992. The assault comes just one day after nine people, including four children and their teacher, were killed by mortar bombs. Bosnian Croats and Moslems have asked Turkey to help end fierce fighting between their forces, the Turkish foreign ministry said yesterday. Reuter reports from Ankara. The ministry said Mr Hikmet Cetin, the foreign minister, was preparing to fly to Sarajevo.</p>

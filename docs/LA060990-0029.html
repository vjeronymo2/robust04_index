			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON HOPE LAND SWAP POSTPONED  </P> <P> A House subcommittee hearing on a controversial proposal to exchange National  Park Service property in Cheeseboro Canyon for land owned by entertainer Bob  Hope in eastern Ventura County has been rescheduled for July 19.  </P> <P> The subcommittee on the environment, energy and natural resources of the  Committee on Government Operations is holding hearings to determine whether the  federal agencies should approve large land swaps.  </P> <P> Subcommittee Chairman Mike Synar (D-Okla.) has suggested that requiring  congressional approval might provide more public scrutiny and safeguards.  </P> <P> The hearing, originally scheduled for May 3, will be the second to be held by  the subcommittee.  </P> <P> National Park Service officials will be asked to explain previous actions on  the proposed land swap and verify the agency's stated neutrality on the deal, a  subcommittee aide said.  </P> <P> Under the land-swap proposal, the park service would exchange 59 acres in  Cheeseboro Canyon for 1,100 acres that Hope owns in adjacent Jordan Ranch.  </P> <P> Developers who have an option to buy Jordan Ranch are seeking the Cheeseboro  property for an access road to a proposed golf course and 750 homes.  </P> <P> In addition, if the swap is approved, Hope has agreed to sell parks agencies  another 4,600 acres he owns in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for  $20 million, which proponents say is well below the market rate.  </P> <P> Opponents of the exchange, which has divided the environmental community,  regard the hearing as a place to stymie it.  </P> <P> Public criticism by a subcommittee of Congress, which controls the park  service's budget, could make the agency reluctant to approve such a proposal.  </P></p>

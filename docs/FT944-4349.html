			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (4): Fact file --------------------------------------------------- President: Le Duc Anh Prime Minister: Vo Van Kiet Population: 72m Area: 330,341 sq km  --------------------------------------------------- Economic indicators                                        1993   1994 Real GDP growth (%)                     8.1    8.8 Sectoral share of GDP (%)  Agriculture                             36    n/a  Industry                                26    n/a  Services                                38    n/a Inflation (%)                           5.2   12.0 Budget expenditure (% GDP)             18.8   18.8 Budget deficit (% GDP)                 -6.2   -2.7 Merchandise exports (Dollars bn)        2.8    3.6 Merchandise imports (Dollars bn)        3.5    4.0 Current account balance (Dollars m)     869    n/a Total external debt (Dollars bn)       17.7   19.6 Debt service ratio (% of exports)      28.5   12.0  --------------------------------------------------- Sources: World Bank, Vietnam government, UN, ADB  --------------------------------------------------- Getting there Air France, Lufthansa and the Dutch airline KLM fly routes from Europe. British Airways plans to start flights from London in mid-1995. Otherwise most Asian carriers have services to and from their capitals and Qantas runs one flight a week from Sydney. No direct flights run to and from the US, however. A handful of US airlines are waiting for commercial flight agreements to be worked out between the two countries. Business visas are needed for extended business trips but first-time visitors investigating opportunities can get by on a tourist visa. Currency Sweeping new rules issued in October theoretically banned the use of the dollar in Vietnam for most transactions. But bring sufficient dollars in cash for purchases or for exchange into dong, although many exchange bureaux will not accept old or worn notes. Most leading hotels accept credit cards and traveller's cheques. Information Economic and business news about Vietnam may be patchy outside the country but in the country it is difficult to escape. Many English language publications are produced in Vietnam, the most useful being the weekly Vietnam Investment Review, published by the SCCI (investment news) and the monthly Vietnam Economic Times (analysis and business tips). The local English-language directory enquiries telephone number is 108. Where to stay Hanoi. While it is relatively easy to book accommodation in Ho Chi Minh City, a severe shortage in Hanoi often means a frustrating search for rooms. The Metropole Hotel (tel: 84-4-266919, fax: 266920, Dollars 179-Dollars 394 a night) is running at 95 per cent occupancy and rooms are scarce. Try smaller hotels such as the Army Hotel (tel: 252896, fax: 259276, Dollars 50-Dollars 75 a night) and the Defence Ministry Guest House (tel: 265540, fax: 265539, Dollars 60-Dollars 150 a night). If you are really stuck, the 'mini-hotels' that have sprung up in the past year are perfectly respectable (Melody Hotel, tel: 263029, fax: 243746, Thuy Lam Hotel, tel:/fax: 250468). Ho Chi Minh City. Leading hotels include the Omni Saigon (tel: 84-8-449222, fax: 449200) and the vast, 540-room New World Saigon (tel: 228888, fax: 230710) and the Rex Hotel (tel: 296043, fax: 290536), famous for its rooftop bar. The Floating Hotel (tel: 290783, fax: 290784), a renovated barge with international standard rooms, is moored on the Saigon River at Nguyen Hue Boulevard but may have to move next year if its licence is not renewed. Danang. Standards in Danang, on the central coast, have yet to catch up with the north and south. The Bach Dang Hotel, (tel: 84-51-23649, fax: 21659) is fine. Do not miss fish and chips at Christie's Waterfront bar just down the road, run by New Zealander Bob Christie and his Vietnamese wife.</p>

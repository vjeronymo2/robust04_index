			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): A Bible for how the job should be done It all began as a marketing ploy, David Chambers, managing director of advertising agency Fenn, freely admits. 'We approached it in a tongue-in-cheek way, thinking it would be good publicity if we became the first company of our kind to get BS5750.' Eighteen months on, the company has succeeded in getting its award but Chambers says it would have been an expensive exercise just for the PR. Fortunately, he is convinced the company now operates more smoothly and profitably. Chambers' company is based in north Manchester, has a turnover of about Pounds 2m and employs eight full-time staff. Most of Fenn's work is providing 'business-to-business' creative services - designing leaflets, brochures and corporate stationary and handling trade and technical advertising. 'An increasing number of our customers were themselves getting BS5750. There wasn't exactly a threat, but there was the veiled suggestion that if we didn't have it we wouldn't be able to deal with them,' says Chambers. A DTI grant went towards hiring quality assurance consultants; other cash costs associated with certification totalled about Pounds 4,000. However, the greatest price to be paid was in time, says Chambers. He calculates that he spent at least two months getting certification. Overall, he considers it a 'relatively costly business' for a company of Fenn's size. The expenditure of time on administering BS5750 continues. Fenn receives six-monthly checks by external assessors and Chambers oversees monthly internal audits. At the moment he has a backlog and July and August's audit will take half a day's work. 'It's a paperwork chore and there's a lot of jargon - there's the sinister-sounding 'corrective action report', for example. We've had very good consultants but that whole area needs monitoring too, in my opinion. Consultants are proliferating - you've now got consultants for the consultants,' says Chambers. In spite of the paperwork, jargon and time-consuming nature of operating BS5750, Chambers is an evangelist. Businesses involving creative types have always been poor on organisation, he says. 'But the last thing we want people to think is that it's creativity by numbers. It doesn't impinge on the creative side but we do now know where things are filed, what procedures are for work to be checked by the customer, for example. There's a Bible for how the job should be done. 'If I'm run over by a bus, someone else would be able to come in and follow the job through smoothly. It's no longer the case that when I go on holiday I have to plaster everyone else's desks with notes before I go.'</p>

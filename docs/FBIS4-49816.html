			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial party school's third-phase  rotational training in the Three Basics officially started  yesterday morning.    At yesterday morning's ceremony, Pu Chaozhu, secretary of  the  provincial party committee and president of the provincial party  school, delivered a speech in which he emphatically called for  setting more store by the study of theory and for further  enhancing party spirit. He said: These two aspects are part  and parcel of all party building work!    Secretary Pu Chaozhu also urged party cadres at all levels  across the province to understand the profound importance of the  study of theory; to study revolutionary theory in a  conscientious manner; and to implement the party's principles  and policies more accurately and to the letter.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu stated: At present, while studying  Marxist- Leninist theory, we should focus on studying Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; use the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,"  volume three, as the main teaching material; study theories in  light of actual local conditions; clearly understand and  profoundly grasp socialism; and comprehend the necessity of  building and developing socialism, which is a fundamental issue  at the moment.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: We should know that socialism  aims at liberating and developing the productive forces;  conscientiously learn and master socialist market economic  theory; bear in mind that the on-going economic structural  reform aims at building and perfecting the socialist market  economy structure; and by dint of in-depth theory study,  heighten both our consciousness and our firmness in building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and in comprehensively  implementing and carrying out the party's basic line.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu held: While studying revolutionary  theory, we should persistently adhere to the fine style of  integrating theory with practice; become more capable of  applying theory to practice; and transform both the subjective  and objective worlds in accordance with revolutionary theory.  In view of the prevailing problems among leading cadres at and  above the county level, we should employ methods developed in  each and every rectification movement; conduct both criticisms  and self-criticisms; concentrate on studying a list of selected  original works by Marx, Lenin, and Deng Xiaoping; and firmly  grasp their essence and spirit, thereby achieving mastery  through a comprehensive study of the subject and acquiring an  in-depth understanding of the ideological line of persistently  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. In  addition, we should try to acquire an in-depth understanding of  such four basic issues as communist ideals, socialist faith,  whole- hearted service to the people, and democratic centralism,  as well as a better understanding of Marxism, thereby  successfully transforming our world outlook; enhancing our party  spirit; and accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and  economic development in local areas and local units under the  guidance of revolutionary theory.    Meng Jiyao, member of the provincial party committee  standing  committee and director of its organization department, also  attended the opening ceremony, which was presided over by Zhao  Shaomin, deputy director of the provincial party committee's  propaganda department, executive vice president of the  provincial party school, and secretary of its party committee.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Europe fuels Hyundai's strategy  -A US sales slump has forced a shift in focus HYUNDAI Motor, South Korea's largest vehicle manufacturer, is shifting gear in its export strategy. Europe could become the company's biggest foreign market this year, providing new momentum for export growth after sales slumped dramatically in the US. US sales fuelled Hyundai Motor's rapid growth during the 1980s, with more Americans than South Koreans buying Hyundai cars. But US demand suddenly weakened in 1989 due to the economic downturn. Production problems at Hyundai's Korean plants, and labour strife, led to a temporary deterioration in quality and growing consumer complaints. Hyundai's exports, which then accounted for almost two thirds of production, halved to 200,000 vehicles in 1989. In an attempt to revive exports, Hyundai quickly turned its attention to Europe and has expanded considerably its distribution network there during the past three years. The number of European countries where Hyundai cars are sold has increased from four in 1988 to 25, with France last month becoming the most recently opened market. Sales in Europe this year surpassed those in the US for the first time, with 78,571 vehicles sold in Europe during the first nine months against 61,235 cars in the US. Germany, which Hyundai entered only last year, is already its second largest national market overseas, after the US. Mr Kim Nae-Myoung, Hyundai Motor's export marketing director, says: 'In spite of the recession . . . we have continued to grow due to our status as a relative newcomer and because our prices are competitive.' The depreciation of the Korean won against the Japanese yen and other leading currencies has helped. But Hyundai is also accepting profit margins in Europe that are even lower than in the highly competitive South Korean market, according to Mr Kim. Analysts say Hyundai has little choice but to increase exports at almost any price, because it needs to reduce a growing inventory of vehicles. This reflects slower growth in the domestic market, which now accounts for 55 per cent of Hyundai's sales. The Korean government recently raised vehicle taxes, already among the highest in the world, to curb car ownership and alleviate growing traffic congestion. South Korea is now the world's eighth biggest car market. The introduction of the car taxes came at an awkward time for Hyundai and other Korean motor manufacturers since they recently expanded production facilities and are launching several new models. Hyundai's annual production capacity is 900,000 vehicles. Hyundai hopes to increase exports to almost 300,000 cars this year from 229,000 in 1991 as sales more than double in Europe and it develops other markets, including Latin America, south-east Asia and the Middle East. The strong export growth is predicted to raise Hyundai sales to Won6,500bn (Dollars 8.31bn) this year from Won5,652bn in 1991. Earnings are also expected to grow to Won65bn from Won54bn a year ago, although this mainly reflects improved productivity in its factories. Hyundai accounts for almost half of domestic motor vehicle sales and two thirds of Korean car exports. It has established a firm foothold in Europe ahead of its main domestic competitors, Kia Motors and Daewoo Motor, owing to its ability to freely market its cars worldwide. All three Korean motor manufacturers have licensed technology from foreign car companies. But Kia and Daewoo had to accept restrictions on overseas sales in their technology agreements, while Hyundai's Japanese partner Mitsubishi permitted export rights. Daewoo recently broke its joint venture ties with General Motors of the US in order to pursue overseas sales, while Kia is now planning to set up sales networks in the US and Europe as it independently develops new car models. Mr Kim believes Hyundai so far does not face much of a protectionist threat in Europe. 'We have taken advantage of the quotas placed on Japanese imports in developing a market. But our sales volume is too small for trade barriers to be directed against us. Our market share is peanuts, less than 1 per cent of the European market.' Hyundai's greatest obstacle in Europe is unfavourable perceptions about the quality of its vehicles, Mr Kim acknowledges. Hyundai is hoping that its Lantra compact car, launched in mid-1990 after five years of development, will help restore public trust. The Lantra - known as the Elantra in Korea - is expected this year to replace the Excel as Hyundai's most popular model in both the domestic and foreign markets. Hyundai also exports its Sonata saloon and Scoupe compact, while its luxury car Grandeur is only sold in Korea. Hyundai's research and development programme is the second biggest in Korea after Samsung Electronics, the country's main semiconductor producer. Hyundai last year became the first Korean vehicle manufacturer to completely develop a car engine and it plans to equip some of its vehicles with fuel-saving 'lean-burn engines' beginning in 1994. The development of key motor components will also enable Hyundai to reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers and cut high royalty payments to them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 46 (536): </F> Reports by Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitry Voskoboynikov, Igor  Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] As Interfax has learned from a credible source,  copies of a plan to drastically change the republic's policy  have been sent to parliament and government. The plan was  drafted by independent centers for political intiative with a  group of leading political scientists and economists taking part.    According to the draft, "if documents on the integration of  the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia are not signed by mid  March through the Russian leadership's fault", Belarus will  immediately start building up its frontier with Russia, will  introduce a national currency (by available information, money  bills were printed in Germany long ago and are currently stocked  in the republic - IF), and will impose heavy custom duties on  all Russian commodities transported across Belarus.    However, the key points of the program are those that  presuppose "energetic steps to be taken by Belarus to set up an  alliance of Baltic and Black Sea States". Such an alliance  would unite Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and a number of East  European countries and would possibly be maintained by NATO as a  "buffer" between Russia and Western Europe.    The plan provides for closer ties between Belarus and NATO  up  to a revision by the country of its proclaimed neutrality and a  withdrawal of all the Russian troops deployed in Belarus by the  end of this year.    Besides, the draft envisages dismantling the key Russian  strategic facilities at Vileika and Gantsevich at an early date.  By military experts estimates, the dismantlement would do more  than 150 Tn [Trillion]-rubles-worth damage to Russia and would  disorganize the management of sveral Russian fleets, the  nuclear-submarine fleet included.    The Belarusian Prime Minister's Spokesman Vladimir Zametalin  has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of such a  program. He told Interfax that "Russia's unjustified stalling  with signing the documents on the formation of a monetary union  for improper reasons make the Belarusian leadership weary and  compels it to plan steps in advance."</p>

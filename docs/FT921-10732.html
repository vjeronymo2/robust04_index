			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / German business slow to follow state on Croatia: Ex-Yugoslav republic shows few signs of economic loosening GERMANY'S business community is reluctant to invest in Croatia, not just because the newly-independent republic remains unstable, but because its government has been reluctant to introduce reforms to attract foreign capital. 'It is difficult to find one private hairdresser in Zagreb,' a German diplomat said. 'The economy remains highly centralised. There is no movement whatsoever in economic reforms,' he added. The war against the Croatian army by the Yugoslav federal army and Serb nationalists has played a large part in diverting the government's attention from decentralising the economy to building up a strong army. 'Although we are aware we must privatise the economy, it is difficult to talk about reforms when the war has cost at least the equivalent of one year's GDP, or Dollars 15bn (Pounds 8.3bn),' said Mr Jurica Pavelic, Croatia's deputy prime minister who is responsible for the economy. Since June 25, when the war started, more than 200,000 apartments and houses have been destroyed, 145,000 people have lost their jobs because factories have been bombed, and Croatia is taking care of 322,000 refugees. Many officials say the priority remains regaining that third of the republic's territory under the control of the federal army and Serb militants. The mood among German diplomats and economists is one of growing frustration with the slow pace of change, particularly since Germany was the first of the European Community countries to recognise Croatia. Germany is Croatia's largest single trading partner. Between January and June 1991, total trade amounted to Dollars 1.07bn. In 1988, total trade exceeded Dollars 2.2bn. Bonn's contribution to Croatia has so far focused on humanitarian and technical assistance. An office set up by the German foreign ministry recently opened in Zagreb to co-ordinate all the international aid agencies. Mr Michael Steiner, its director, said this centralised system of distributing aid has cut out duplication and waste. 'Mr Genscher earmarked DM10m (Pounds 3.4m) for humanitarian aid last December provided all aid was co-ordinated by Bonn,' said Mr Steiner. 'In addition, the German lander (states) have already contributed DM4bn worth of aid to Croatia.' Mr Darko Bekic, a former adviser to Mr Tudjman, and now lecturer at Zagreb university, said Bonn faces a difficult task in influencing the pace of economic change and strengthening the republic's fragile democratic traditions. 'Croatian enterprise managers are rooted in the old communist tradition. They still believe the state should bail them out. They want the state to do all their marketing. There is little initiative. The etatist tradition is very strong here,' he explained. But German diplomats believe the Tudjman government has not only inherited the tradition of a strong state which preceded the communist era. 'Even before the war, Tudjman refused to decentralise the economy, and instead created his own nomenklatura,' said a German diplomat and specialist in Yugoslavia. This direction of the economy is all the more exasperating for the large Croat diaspora in Germany which has swelled from 270,000 to more than 600,000 since June. 'The refugees want to return, so do some of the Croatian diaspora who came to Germany in the 1960s and who now want to invest in tourism or small businesses in their homeland. They are waiting for stability, and for new legislation on investment and privatisation,' the diplomat said. 'Bonn can do little. The pressure for change must come from within. Only then, will credits, and investments start flowing in,' he added. LORD Carrington, chairman of the European Community peace conference on Yugoslavia, returns to Belgrade today to try to overcome obstacles to the United Nations plan to deploypeacekeepers in Croatia and reconvene the conference, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. The visit is the first since the EC recognised Croatia and Slovenia last January, a move which promted many Serb officials to call for an end to EC mediation in the conflict. Lord Carrington is expected to meet Serb leaders before travelling tomorrow to Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and later to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.</p>

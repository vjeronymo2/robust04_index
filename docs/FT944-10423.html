			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Chemical Bank unit in Liffe joint venture Seagray Fosh Futures, an independent UK futures and options broker, is to set up a 50-50 joint venture with with Chemical Futures &amp; Options (UK), a subsidiary of Chemical Bank of the US. The new company, SGF Chemical Futures and Options, will deal in both futures and options on Liffe, taking advantage of Seagray's position as a leader in the exchange traded options market in London. It will make also use CF&amp;O's existing expertise in clearing and settlement, providing a 'one-stop service' for both execution and clearing of trades. The new venture is keen to increase its presence in the futures market and also hopes to be better placed to meet increased demand from hedge funds, many of which want a combined execution and clearing service, said Mr Matthew Fosh, a director and co-founder of Seagray. Unlike bank traders, hedge funds generally buy clearing services from third parties, explained Mr Fosh. Seagray, which employs a team of 25, was set up by Mr Fosh and Mr James Campbell-Gray, an independent trader on Liffe since its inauguration. Mr Fosh previously worked at stockbrokers Strauss Turnbull and then Sheppards. CF&amp;O was set up in April 1990 to complement Chemical Futures &amp; Options Inc's Chicago and Philadelphia operations and help capture the global growth in exchange-traded derivatives.</p>

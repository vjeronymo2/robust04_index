			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Prime Minister's Rightful Stand"] </F>   [Text] India is trying to become a permanent member of the  Security Council. Perhaps some major powers appear to be  supporting India on this issue. India and its supporting nations  believe that it should get this seat because it is a large  country and has substantial military resources. India will be  able to get the veto right if it becomes a permanent member of  the Security Council. At present, the five permanent  members--the United States of America, Russia, China, Great  Britain, and France--have this right.    There are not one or two, but several examples of how the  major powers have abused the veto right at will. Whenever the  Security Council approved a disciplinary action against Israel,  the United States made it ineffective using its veto power. The  Soviet Union also showed similar inclination in the past. It  also used the veto without paying attention to justice and  fairness. Therefore, making India a member of the Security  Council and giving it the veto right would be hurting the  prestige of this international organization. Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto is justified and right in her stand that India  should not be allowed to become a member of the Security  Council. Benazir Bhutto openly told in a press conference in  Turkey's capital Ankara last Saturday that Pakistani people are  strongly opposed to India's becoming a permanent member of the  UN Security Council since it has been continuously ignoring the  resolutions about Kashmir.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's objection has considerable  weight. A government that has been neglecting UN resolutions and  refusing self-government to Kashmiris cannot be given membership  to the Security Council. Additionally, India's attitude toward  Pakistan and other countries in this region has never been good.  It has always tried to take advantage of its being a large  country. If India still is made a permanent member of the  Security Council, it will increase its atrocities in Kashmir and  its negative activities in this region will also increase. The  United States and other countries know India's character very  well. The proposal to make India a permanent Security Council  member is just to make India a likely opponent of China in Asia.  Still, this proposal should be opposed with full force.</p>

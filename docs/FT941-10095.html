			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Caribbean slips up over EU's banana regime Caribbean banana producers are falling victim to the European Union's dispute over bananas with Latin American exporters, Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica, said yesterday. Latin American producers have complained to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about the EU's preferential trading arrangements on bananas with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. A report by a Gatt panel expected to condemn the Lome convention as incompatible with Gatt rules is due to be published today. 'I'm a believer in free trade, but not so free it ruins an entire country,' said Dame Eugenia. Banana exports provide 75 per cent of Dominica's revenue and Dame Eugenia said the Windward Islands had lost Dollars 70m (Pounds 48m) since last July when the EU's new banana regime came into force. However, it was not accepted by Latin American producers. Since then, the Commission has slightly increased the Latin Americans' import ceiling, but has insisted a condition of acceptance would be for the countries to withdraw their complaint to Gatt.</p>

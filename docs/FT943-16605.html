			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Financial malpractice in the workplace Businesses could learn from practices developed in the US and reward staff for highlighting financial malpractice in the workplace, a report says today, Richard Donkin writes. The report, by Public Concern at Work, an organisation which advises workplace 'whistleblowers', says fraud and financial malpractice have been the most prevalent concerns of employees who have approached it for advice. The report says: 'Our impression is that the pervading culture in many organisations in the UK is that staff should mind their own business come what may.' It says this is in contrast to developments in the US, where companies have started to reward staff for minding the company's business. The report cites Bear Sterns, the New York stockbroker, which gives staff 5 per cent of any losses they prevent when they report financial malpractice.</p>

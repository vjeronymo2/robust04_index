			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / The Markets: Masters of a fragmented universe - Global Investor Globalisation is a word heard these days from only a handful of industries. Once the height of fashion, used to justify the acquisitive tendencies of companies right across the stock market, it fell from popularity when many of those deals proved disappointing and when recession squeezed margins and balance sheets. But in some corners it lives on. At least two companies among those declaring third-quarter corporate results this week continue to wield the language of globalisation unabashed. They do not suggest that the pursuit of international scope is damaging in itself but they do lend some weight to the sceptics. WMI Waste Management International, the UK arm of WMX Technologies of the US, which releases its third-quarter results today, is one case. WMI has pursued growth through acquisition; last year it made 48 acquisitions in 12 countries, and in the second quarter this year another 16. WMI's directors argue that pollution control is a global business. Last year's annual report declares that WMI 'has established a strong leadership in (the) global marketplace' for environmental services, and values this market, excluding North America, at Pounds 150bn. It is true that that environmental regulation has been tightening in industrialised countries as well as in some industrialising ones in southern Asia. In particular, there has been a drive, both national and international, to tighten standards on disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste, the areas on which WMI focuses. In regulating pollution, many countries targeted threats to air and water first and have only recently turned to solid waste. But what benefits does international scale bring to a company in those markets? Standards are set nationally or regionally; the ability to manage a landfill in the UK does not imply that the company can do the same in Germany. WMI argues that its experience allows it to improve the management of the businesses it takes over. That is plausible, but risky. The liabilities of waste companies that have been technically lax as well as inefficient are potentially huge. WMI also argues that once it has entered a market it can grow organically by winning new contracts because it has advantages over local companies. It can, it says, display to government officials a track record of managing large scale projects. Its size also reassures them about its ability to meet potential liabilities; adequacy of financial resources became a condition of UK waste licences earlier this year. However, one of the unfortunate near-global characteristics of the waste industry is that choice of contractor is frequently influenced by special deals, if not corruption, particularly where local government awards contracts. It is not too cynical to ask whether the attractions of the professionally run 'outsider' to such markets will prevail over those offered by local rivals. In WMI's case, the question of whether the group's rush for international presence has left it capable of organic growth is now in the forefront; some analysts believe its hefty goodwill write-offs and consequently rising gearing are a constraint to further acquisitions. It is perhaps too early to judge. The group has had notable success in winning contracts in Asia, but it is harder to assess its chances in Europe given sluggish economic recovery. The slump of some 15 per cent in the share price relative to the FT All-Share Index since its 12-month peak in September largely reflects concerns about European growth, and Italy in particular. But the group will be under pressure to demonstrate that the world's waste industry is not simply a fragmented collection of essentially different businesses, and that global presence pays off. SmithKline Some of the same points can be put to the world's pharmaceutical and healthcare giants, including SmithKline Beecham, which reports third-quarter results on Tuesday. SmithKline's results will shed more light on the impact of the loss of US patent protection for Tagamet, the group's ulcer treatment. But most attention will be focused on the integration of the two recent mega-deals: the Dollars 2.9bn purchase of Sterling Winthrop, the over-the-counter medicines group, in August, and the Dollars 2.3bn purchase of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, one of the four largest US drug wholesalers, in May. The strategy, which pushed gearing up to nearly 300 per cent, assumes that the deals will help protect margins and profits growth as competition from generic drugs grows and as governments pare back healthcare budgets. In the case of the Sterling deal, which makes SmithKline the world leader in over-the-counter drugs and sharply reduces its dependence on the US, that reckoning looks sound. According to SmithKline, the worldwide OTC market grew by more than 7 per cent last year, twice as fast as in the US. SmithKline hopes to use its distribution network in 100 countries to lift sales across its product line. It is also betting that European governments, hard pressed to pay the cost of prescription medicines, will increasingly back OTC remedies. Analysts question whether the long-term profitability of the OTC market is as great as SmithKline expects, and are anxious to see evidence that it can cut costs as promised. But their bigger concerns are directed at the DPS deal. It is unclear yet whether the deal will be the platform for the provision of wider healthcare services, as SmithKline hopes, and whether that concept can be exported to Europe and beyond. Given the wide variations in national healthcare systems, it would be surprising if there were a simple prescription for success.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 13/10/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 % change over period                       US     Japan     Germany   France   Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.09     0.04       0.09     0.10     0.16   0.10 Month                0.41     0.22       0.42     0.45     0.70   0.46 Year                 3.44     2.44       5.88     6.19     8.25   5.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.56     -0.47      0.93     1.02     0.52   1.13 Month               -0.28     -0.56      0.40     0.81     1.92   1.17 Year                -2.76     -0.23      1.81     0.43     0.69   0.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.99     -0.49      2.15     2.15     1.55   1.68 Month               -0.56     -0.81      1.36     1.15     2.58   1.72 Year                -7.58     -1.72     -2.78    -5.81    -7.21  -2.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                  3.4       1.9       5.7     5.4     -0.6     5.2 Month                 0.4       1.3      -2.6    -1.2     -0.6     0.6 Year                  4.2      -0.9       3.0    -3.3     13.2    13.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

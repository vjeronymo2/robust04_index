			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview by Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa </F> Serrano by unidentified reporter; date and place not given --  live or recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Reporter] Referring to some  specific countries, it seems the path toward the resumption of  diplomatic relations with Bolivia is being opened. Some people  believe Cuba's isolation has hurt the Cuban people. What  chances are there of resuming diplomatic relations with Bolivia  and of establishing relations, at an ambassadorial level, with  Cuba?    [Figueroa] I believe the first consideration in diplomatic  relations are Chilean interests. Chile maintains relations with  those countries that can help us to attain the  political-economic objectives we seek. This must be considered  when thinking about resuming relations. In the case of Bolivia,  they broke relations with Chile, therefore, it is up to them to  resume relations. In the case of Bolivia there is a climate of  confidence, friendship, and even an economic cooperation  agreement with that country. There are physical integration  projects involving highways, port facilities, etc., that reveal  the existence of a very good relationship between Chile and  Bolivia at this moment. Let us hope it will lead to the  establishment of diplomatic relations.    We maintain relations at a consular level with Cuba. We  maintain commercial relations. Chilean businessmen are  investing in Cuba and this must be considered when deciding to  step up relations to an ambassadorial level, because a  relationship does exist, as I have pointed out, at a consular  level.

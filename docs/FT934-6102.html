			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: Electricity finds a great conductor - Worth Watching Everyone knows if you are struck by lightning you have a better chance of survival if you are standing on a stone floor, as it prevents electricity passing through the body. In computer rooms or operating theatres the problem is the opposite: how to conduct the electric force away from expensive components. Frankfurt-based Degussa has developed a floor coating from methacrylate resin which is conductive - the first time such a combination has been achieved. Because the flooring is resin-based it hardens extremely quickly and is resistant to chemicals. The Degadur VP 070/071 system incorporates special fillers in the resin to establish a high level of conductivity. Degussa: Germany, 69 218 2860.</p>

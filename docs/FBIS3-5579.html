However, most of these  investments were not in the right category as it did not benefit  this nation much, in terms of technology transfer or resource  utilisation. New investments will be diverted to the right  sector to enable mutual benefits.    Minister of Finance, Sam Rangsi, told the CAMBODIA TIMES  that  the country has done remarkably well for a young and infant  liberal democracy. "Vietnam, with a bigger population and  resource base, has reportedly attracted U.S. $1 billion in  foreign investments. However, many of them are cautious as it is  not a gold mine as many believe. The lifting of the trade  embargo on Vietnam by the United States will also not have any  major material effect on the flow of foreign investment here."    "Our sustained efforts to show consistency in immigration  and  investment policy and the promotion of transparency in laws,  regulations and procedures, will see the influx of more  investors here in the near future. Within the next few weeks, we  will see major multi-national companies, with a strong  reputation, resource base and expertise, signing business  agreements as well as announcing business ventures and  investments here."    "These are the type of investors we need. We do not need bad  investors who are here just to reap the country of its resources  in limited industries such as logging, timber, gems and  unhealthy sectors such as laundering of money," Rangsi said. "We  will chase out the bad investors who do not represent the true  business community here and replace them with new, serious and  big companies with reputable international standings. These  will be seen very soon."    "Priority, said the Finance Minister, would be given to the  manufacturing sector, tourism, transportation and  infrastructural sectors." [passage omitted]    "Other measures to encourage investors are the writings of  the new investment law which will be submitted at the ICORC  [International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia]  meeting soon and which has been in principle approved by the  Royal Government."    "We are also looking into the formation of new laws  pertaining to investments. These include company laws,  bankruptcy laws and land laws. At the moment there is no land  law and this has been a hindrance to investment. This is because  many plots of land have more than one land title as a result of  irregularities and inadequacies at the land department. This  has to be resolved as an investor would not want to establish a  manufacturing plant on a plot of land which is in dispute in the  future."</p>

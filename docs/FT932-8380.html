			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Inquiry into carrier contract bids: Audit probe to decide how VSEL undercut Swan Hunter by Pounds 50m AN IMMEDIATE inquiry is to be launched by the National Audit Office into the bidding war for a helicopter carrier order that left Swan Hunter, the struggling shipbuilder, facing closure. The NAO, the government's spending watchdog, decided on the move yesterday after a meeting between Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, and Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence select committee. It hopes to report back to parliament before MPs rise for the summer recess in July or August. The inquiry will have to decide, among other things, how the victorious consortium of Cumbria-based VSEL and the Kvaerner Govan merchant shipyard in Glasgow was able to undercut Swan by as much as Pounds 50m on an order believed to be worth about Pounds 170m. Swan Hunter is the last working shipbuilder in north-east England. The NAO said yesterday that it aimed to check whether bid procedures were carried out fairly. The circumstances surrounding the order were the 'kind of thing' it might have looked into even without Sir Nicholas's approach. Sir Nicholas said it was 'a matter of concern' that Swan was at risk. 'It is very worrying. Certain allegations have been made about the way the contract was tendered.' The move came as Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East and frontbench spokesman, claimed additions to the original specifications ordered by the Ministry of Defence had forced Swan to add Pounds 30m to its original tender. This led to a final price of about Pounds 200m. He said Swan had been unable to absorb the cost of the additional work. VSEL had done so through the 'enormous profits' made on the 'cost-plus' Trident submarine contract. He wanted the inquiry to reach a conclusion about the level of subsidy in the VSEL bid. 'The plain truth is that those in the Ministry of Defence and higher up in the government never had any intention of allowing Swan Hunter to win the contract.' Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said Mr Brown had not served any good purpose by suggesting that there had been 'some kind of conspiracy'. In a separate move, Price Waterhouse - the receiver appointed to Swan's UK companies last week - confirmed it had reached an agreement with the MoD. This would permit it to meet this month's wage payment to Swan's 1,750 manual workforce, due this Friday. Under the agreement, work on three Type 23 frigates would continue until at least May 28. News of the inquiry triggered a mixed response. Mr Stephen Byers, the Labour MP in whose Wallsend constituency Swan is headquartered, complained it would not 'save a single job on Tyneside'. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said the scope of the inquiry should be expanded.</p>

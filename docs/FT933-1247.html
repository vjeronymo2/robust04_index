			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Russia stories darken bourse afternoon THE Bundesbank's decision to hold key interest rates unchanged was expected, reported relatively early in mid-morning, and did nothing to disturb the bourse recovery which was taking place at that stage, writes Our Markets Staff. However, share prices fell back in the afternoon, on rumours of unusual troop movements in Russia, and a Moscow news agency story that opponents of President Yeltsin were planning an attack on the main building of the Russian defence ministry. FRANKFURT moved from 1,916.31 at the official close, with the DAX index up 23.51, to just 1,902.38 in the post-bourse, only a fraction above its final mark on Wednesday afternoon. Over recent days both German and British strategists and analysts, working for B Metzler in Frankfurt and Kleinwort Benson in London, have said that there was relatively little to go for in German equities. But, during the session, the pattern of stock and sector rotation seemed to continue regardless. In carmakers, Daimler lost DM2 to DM750 against the market trend, reflecting job cuts scheduled at the cost of a DM1.5bn charge on earnings in the second half of 1993. Volkswagen rose DM11.50 to DM367 on its big European sales ambitions for a variant of its Golf model, for a low addition to its production costs. Turnover fell from DM8.4bn to DM6.4bn. Within that, Veba shot up the active stocks list to end second in turnover of DM726m. Mr Peter Bohnke of Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that there was a buying order for the shares, and rumours that it might be the next German stock to list on Wall Street. PARIS fell back 1 per cent under pressure from a further round of disappointing interim results. The CAC-40 index ended off 22.43 at 2,057.53. LVMH came out early in the session with first figures which were slightly worse than some brokers' forecasts. However, the fall in the share price, down FFr168 or 4 per cent at FFr3,924, was exacerbated by the group's statement that full year earnings were unlikely to match those in 1992. Mr John Wakely of Lehman Brothers in London commented that the group was likely to remain under pressure until there was an upturn in trading conditions in the Far East; but that by contrast to Guinness of the UK, in which it holds a minority stake, 1994 could turn out to be a reasonably good year. Skis Rossignol went against the trend with a gain of FFr183 to FFr1,553 after noting that 1993/94 profits should be more than twice the 1992/93 level. AMSTERDAM added to Wednesday's gains with a rise in the CBS Tendency index of 0.5 to 124.1. PolyGram was actively traded after announcing that it had set the price of its 9.5m new shares to be issued to help fund the acquisition of Motown records at Fl 62.20 outside the US and Dollars 34.00 in the US. The shares rose 90 cents to Fl 63.10, and those of its parent group, Philips, by 50 cents to Fl 35.80. Heineken continued its recent downtrend, losing another Fl 2.10 to Fl 179.50, while Royal Dutch picked up Fl 3.30 to Fl 181.60 and Unilever Fl 1.30 to Fl 201.30. ZURICH opened firmly in response to a market rumour that a Swiss discount rate cut was imminent, but gave up half the gain in response to a disclaimer from the National Bank president. The SMI index finished 11.2 higher at 2,425.8. Schindler bearers added another SFr250 to SFr6,050 in the wake of presentations to analysts in London and Zurich, and a buy recommendation from Lehman Brothers. Roche reflected analysts' recommendations and positive press comment, the bearers adding SFr50 to SFr8,790. MILAN was disappointed by July's industrial production figures, and nervous about forthcoming first half company results. The Comit index edged 2.86 higher to 592.80. Olivetti gave up some of Wednesday's gains to finish L21 lower at L1,953 in heavy volume ahead of results today. Fiat finished L43 lower at L5,896 after a day's high of L6,065, as attention focused on results due next Tuesday. Banks turned in a firm performance with Credito Italiano L60 higher at L2,593 after its announcement late on Wednesday of a 55 per cent rise in first half profit to L632bn. Benetton, also due to report shortly, shed L167 to L23,617: Merrill Lynch upgraded its earnings estimates for 1993 and 1994, commenting: 'We continue to like the stock, despite its performance.' BRUSSELS fielded a 5.4 per cent plunge in the Belgian flagship holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique, after it announced a dip in first-half 1993 group net profit and the sale of its cement-making unit, CBR. However, the Bel-20 index still managed to close 0.08 higher at 1,278.61 in turnover of BFr1.25bn, with SGB BFr100 lower at BFr2,490. Ms Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson said of SGB that the share price reflected both the fall in profits, and disappointment with the selling price for the CBR stake. ISTANBUL rose 2.6 per cent to a new high, the composite index closing 384.2 higher at 14,886.6, boosted by a cut in the rate of a one-year government bond. TEL AVIV rose after parliament approved an Israel-PLO agreement on self-rule in the occupied territories, the Mishtanim index rising by 4.12, or 1.8 per cent to 231.73.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 23 THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30    11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1279.95  1280.83  1281.04  1280.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1353.93  1354.16  1353.20  1353.39                         13.00    14.00    15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1279.77  1274.10  1275.09  1273.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1352.29  1347.46  1347.80  1347.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sep 22 Sep 21 Sep 20 Sep 17 Sep 16 FT-SE Eurotrack 100 1271.99 1279.55 1278.06 1265.02 1257.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200 1346.05 1351.37 1351.78 1343.60 1335.87  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1281.42; 200 - 1355.02 Low/day: 100 - 1273.74 200 - 1346.07  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

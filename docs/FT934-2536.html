			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Japan to allow limited imports of rice Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, overriding fierce domestic opposition, said early today a reluctant Japan would open the country's heavily protected rice market to limited imports and help clinch a Gatt world trade treaty, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt chief, was quick to praise Japan's 'difficult' decision, saying the move would help trade talks as they struggled towards deadline. After weeks of agonised debate, Mr Hosokawa's polarised coalition partners finally agreed at 3.30am in Tokyo to back his plan. 'I have formally decided to accept the Gatt proposal (to open partially our rice market),' Mr Hosokawa said after winning the endorsement of coalition and cabinet. 'If Japan were to have rejected this plan, the Uruguay Round would have collapsed and our country would have become the target of world criticism.' The decision to allow even limited imports almost split the country's governing coalition. Until the last minute, the Social Democrats looked deeply divided over whether to back Mr Hosokawa or support outraged farmers who account for a big portion of the party's declining support. The party, the largest but most unstable in the alliance, could have brought down the four-month-old government if it had decided to quit the coalition. That could well have held up a final agreement on a new world trade pact, due in Geneva tomorrow. However, after talks lasting nearly 12 hours, the party's top executive grudgingly agreed to leave the decision to Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the chairman, who said the Social Democrats must support the rice plan and stay in the coalition. Japan has agreed to import from 4 to 8 per cent of its domestic rice needs from 1995, in exchange for a minimum six-year grace period before putting tariffs in place of its import ban, as originally proposed by Gatt, Mr Hosokawa said. Japan would try to negotiate an extension of the grace period beyond the sixth year to avoid imposing tariffs. 'The history of rice is the history of Japan . . . so we made great effort to win an exemption (on the tariff plan),' he said. 'Right now, we're not thinking that we should accept tariffs in the seventh year.'</p>

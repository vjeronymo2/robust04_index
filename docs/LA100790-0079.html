			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FACE HOMOSEXUALITY WITH FACTS, NOT FEAR;  </P> <P> PREJUDICE: MOTHER WISHES SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HER SON'S  SEXUALITY 25 YEARS AGO.  </P> <P> If homosexuality had been understood, rather than feared, 25 years ago, our  son, Jeff, would not have felt compelled to lock himself in a dark closet for  secrecy. At 18, he confided in no one, ran from school to job to anonymity and,  finally, to our home in the wee hours of the morning.  </P> <P> If homosexuality had been acknowledged as reality, rather than ignored as  taboo, perhaps our son would not have been on a collision course on the  freeways and in our living room. He had numerous accidents and we had even more  arguments.  </P> <P> If homosexuals had been regarded as ordinary members of the community, rather  than persecuted as misfits, perhaps our daughter, Judi, would not have become  hysterical when she learned of her brother's gayness. To this day, she weeps in  fear for him.  </P> <P> If homosexuality did not raise threatening questions to men and women of  ignorance, I would not have nightmares about gay bashing and hassling, about  skinheads and rednecks.  </P> <P> When I was a child, homosexuality was not included in polite conversation, and  thus, could not be understood. When Judi and Jeff were children, it was  included in conversation long enough to be ridiculed and rejected.  </P> <P> When we confronted our son's gayness more than 21 years ago, the rejection and  the ridicule, the fears and the hysteria converged. "Of course we love you,  son, but we hate what you are doing with your life!"  </P> <P> What a preposterous conflict, spoken in heat and darkness, love and terror. My  husband and I, possessors of half a dozen university degrees between us, knew  nothing about homosexuality, except its myths, and were snug and smug in our  ignorance. We responded to our son's cry for help from the depths of that  mythology. We sent him to a therapist expecting that -- abracadabra -- he would  be changed into a conforming heterosexual. He was not; it does not happen.  </P> <P> It is said that you never get to know anyone until you live with that person. I  can honestly say you don't know (spell that "understand") homosexuality until  you live with it. Those who wish to misunderstand me can protest that I am  advocating a homosexual liaison to achieve understanding. Wrong! We must allow  the word, the idea, the concept and the people into our minds and our hearts:  live with them, study them, worry with them, absorb them.  </P> <P> The first fact we will learn is that no one chooses to live a homosexual  lifestyle. Who would choose rejection over acceptance, a slap over a hug? We  are not talking experimentation here, we are discussing lifestyle.  </P> <P> Studies have not discovered a single, clearly defined cause of sexual  orientation: biology or chemistry; heredity or environment; a combination of  all four, perhaps; but choice is not a scientific option. One may choose to be  celibate or sexually active, but the attraction that one person has for another  does not have an objectively definable origin.  </P> <P> When our grown son reminisced: "I knew I was different as a kid but I did not  know why . . . I preferred to be like all the others, but I didn't know how,"  choice never entered the discussion. Handsome, friendly and attractive, Jeff  had girlfriends, slept with some, hated it all, but continued to try to conform  until he matured into an understanding of himself.  </P> <P> We can help our gay children out of the closet into society's mainstream, to  participate as equals in school and at work. We can encourage them to make  career and social choices without the coloration of rejection and ostracism.  </P> <P> But we cannot do it alone. They must know that the world of their peers is  supportive and not hostile; that their teachers' patience will not run out when  she/he suspects a nonconformer; that their clergymen and women will be kind,  sensitive and unpunishing; that there will be no graffiti and no unsavory jokes  from friends, family and strangers.  </P> <P> Where do we begin to make first-class citizens of our gay children?  </P> <P> When the San Diego city school teachers, nurses and counselors recently met to  learn how to help students with their curiosity and fears concerning  homosexuality, Virginia Uribe, a prominent counselor to homosexual students,  explained, "We are trying to demystify the whole subject of homosexuality."  </P> <P> That is precisely where to begin.  </P> <P> For the parents who fear that education will promote homosexuality or encourage  -- even seduce -- their children into the gay lifestyle, the facts will  dissuade them, if they listen. Supporting children in their efforts to confront  their own realities does not lead to AIDS. A truly enlightened system that will  help children understand homosexuality will also help them understand how to  avoid AIDS and will guarantee their being far more knowledgeable than their  parents and, inevitably, more healthy.  </P> <P> Long ago, Sigmund Freud wrote to a troubled mother, "Homosexuality is assuredly  no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it  cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it a variation of the sexual  function. . . ." In 1973, the American Psychiatric Assn. caught up with Freud  and took homosexuality off the "illness" list.  </P> <P> It is time now for the rest of us to catch up. We can destroy the distortions  of mythology with a massive attack of facts.  </P></p>

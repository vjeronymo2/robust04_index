			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: MTM agrees short-term facilities with bankers MTM, the speciality chemicals group, yesterday announced that it had concluded a short-term agreement with its bankers following its breach of covenants. The group said the new facilities were for an initial period until April 30. Negotiations with two syndicates led by Chase Manhattan of the US and Standard Chartered, the international UK-based bank, were continuing with a view to securing the group's longer-term funding, said MTM. The company is believed to have debts of about Pounds 70m. Standard Chartered has said its exposure to MTM's debt is minimal. The largest shareholder in MTM last week was Midland Bank which held 6.79 per cent of the shares. Schroder Investment Management held 6.51 per cent, while Gartmore Investment Management held 6.14 per cent. The group, which has said it will probably not pay a final dividend for the year to December 31, has not yet given the date for publication of its full-year accounts. So far, BDO Binder Hamlyn, its auditors, have refused to sign off the accounts because of disagreements about asset values. The accountants have been asked to prepare a report on the reasons and circumstances surrounding the shortfall in profits that triggered its present crisis. Postern Executive Group, the corporate management specialist, has also been appointed to evaluate the group's financial and operational position. It will recommend options for MTM's future strategic development. The shares closed up 3p at 28p.</p>

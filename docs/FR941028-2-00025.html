The majority of naval training at these bases will be relocated to NTC Great Lakes, Illinois. In addition, Naval Technical Training Center (NTTC) Treasure Island, and Combat Systems Technical Schools Command (CSTC) Mare Island, California, will be closed pursuant to the recommendations of BRAC&hyph;93, with some of the training at these commands relocated to NTC Great Lakes. Also associated with this section is relocation of the Navy Recruiting Command (COMNAVCRUITCOM) from Washington, DC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Draft Environmental Impact Statement was prepared for the action and distributed to Federal, State, and local agencies and to interested individuals and groups. Public comments and Navy responses to those comments were incorporated into the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) which was distributed to the public for a review period that ended on October 15, 1994. This review resulted in a single letter from the Office of the Governor, Illinois State Clearinghouse, stating that the action is not in conflict with State plans, policies, and priorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The realignment will increase the number of average on-board service school students by approximately 2,088 between 1993 and 1998. The number of permanent-party naval personnel necessary to support service and apprentice school training will increase by approximately 243 over the same period. Twenty-four construction projects are required to accommodate the realignment at NTC Great Lakes. The projects include upgrades of existing facilities and new construction to support new functions and increased number of students and permanent-party personnel. All associated construction and renovation projects addressed in the FEIS will occur at NTC Great Lakes, with the exception of a family housing project. This project will construct 240 family housing units at the Navy-owned Glenview Annex. Another BRAC&hyph;93 decision directed closure of Naval Air Station (NAS) Glenview and allowed for portions of NAS Glenview to be retained by Navy for the family housing requirements of NTC Great Lakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act waived certain aspects of NEPA such that the environmental analysis need not consider the no-action alternative (no realignment). Alternative means of accommodating the mandated BRAC&hyph;93 realignment at NTC Great Lakes that were considered and included the use of existing structures and alternative sites for construction of new facilities. Sites considered at NTC Great Lakes for the new facilities/renovations avoided environmentally sensitive areas, then were selected based on the following functional considerations: adequacy of existing structures for the proposed uses, availability of utilities, and proximity of the barracks to existing and related facilities, such as classrooms and the galley. Glenview Annex is selected as the most environmentally preferred and functionally desirable alternative considered for the family housing project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construction of the new facilities will convert less than four acres of lawn area to impervious buildings and pavement surfaces. There will be no significant impacts to surface water or wetlands. With erosion mitigation and through sedimentation control described in the FEIS in place, any potential for localized decreases in the quality of stormwater runoff during construction will be minimal and temporary. There will be no significant impacts to groundwater or potable water resources as a result of the realignment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

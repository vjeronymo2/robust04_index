			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / MGN may not be sold for years MIRROR Group Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mirror, may not be sold for up to two years, senior directors believe. Executives of the company which was badly hit by 'the misappropriation of assets' before the death of Mr Robert Maxwell made it clear yesterday they were managing the business for the longer term. Signs of stability were underlined by pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.3m for the six months to June on a turnover of Pounds 233.7m. Earnings per share were 2.6p, against 8.3p last time. No dividend is being paid nor is likely before June 1994. The share price fell 2p to close at 63p yesterday. 'This is not a drama exercise but it is a story we are proud of. The first half in the circumstances has been very good,' said Sir Robert Clark, MGN chairman. Sir Robert said no comparisons could be made with the first half of 1991 because the figures were believed to be unreliable but the pro-forma figures for the year to December 1991 showed the group had pre-tax profits of Pounds 50.9m. Operational profit was Pounds 49.4m but this was reduced by a Pounds 22.8m net interest charge, Pounds 2.3m in losses from a stake in Donohue, the Canadian forest products group, and an allowance of Pounds 9m towards the deficit in the Mirror pension fund. Net borrowings, including lease finance for the new presses to be installed at the Daily Record's Anderston Quay headquarters in Glasgow increased from Pounds 398.4m at the end of 1991 to Pounds 422.7m in June. More than 54 per cent of MGN shares are held by Maxwell private companies in administration but Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator, repeated that the Mirror stake is not for sale at present. There is board level speculation at MGN that shares could be offered rather as the Wellcome Trust sold 20 per cent of the Wellcome drug company. Combined circulation of the Daily Mirror and The Daily Record stayed ahead of their rival The Sun but Mr Vic Horwood, MGN chief executive, conceded that in September the Sun had edged ahead. Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at Kleinwort Benson expected full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 35m.</p>

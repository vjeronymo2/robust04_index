			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 11 (BTA) -- The leaderships of the  two major political forces, the former communists' Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP) and the anti-communist Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS) held regular meetings today to discussed the  possibility for a closed-door parliamentary sitting to hear  President Zhelyu Zhelev on the decree regulating the functions  of his military office, described as exceeding of his powers as  to the army. The SDS and BSP have considered some other  parliamentary means as well, high-ranking officials of the two  parties told a briefing today. The decree was publicized  following press reports on Friday [7 January]. Dr. Zhelev  dismissed the allegations that he was exceeding his powers and  his spokesman accused the parties' headquarters of designing  backstage schemes.    SDS leader Filip Dimitrov stressed that the president's  decree aroused "certain concerns that structures, identical to  those existing under the totalitarian regime" were being set up.  The anti-communist coalition would not react and intends to  demand the decree, which blew up the scandal, via official  channels. BSP leader Zhan Videnov described as "unusual" the  fact that the decree has not so far been published and its text  is unknown. The Socialists need time to get familiar with the  issue and put it to discussion. "It is a tradition for the  President's Office to aim at exceeding its powers, and I am only  going to cite (the case with) foreign policy, national security  and the army," Mr. Videnov said at the BSP's regular briefing  today.    The Socialists considered some 7 or 8 ways of reacting to  this decree, BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva said. She mentioned  only the one envisaging a hearing of the president either at a  closed-door parliamentary sitting or at the Parliamentary  National Security Committee. The Socialist MP's are thinking  also of asking for the opinion of the defence minister, the  chief of General Staff and other senior government officers of  the defence sector. The BSP is expected to come up later with  one of the 7 variants discussed.    It is likely that the Constitutional Court also be  approached, according to Vasil Gotsev, law graduate and MP of  the SDS. He told journalists that the decree was  anticonstitutional. "Indeed, the president is commander in  chief of the Bulgarian Army, but the Constitution does not  provide for a body to control it. The Constitution does not say  that the President's Office should have structures exercising  control over the army," Mr. Gotsev said.</p>

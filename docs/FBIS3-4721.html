			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Kim Yong-sam at the ceremony marking </F> the 75th Anniversary of the Independence Movement Day at the  Sejong Cultural Hall in Seoul on 1 March--live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Now we have a good opportunity  to make a great national leap, and we should not miss this  opportunity. We must increase the national competitive strength  to stand out [potilsu innun] in the international arena.  [passage omitted]    Only those countries that have enough competitive strength  can become a genuine self-reliant and independent country in the  limitless competitive age.    We should not stick to the past national sentiment. We must  advance toward the future and the world, considering the past as  a valuable lesson. [passage omitted]    Our ancestors said that they would not punish Japan for its  past crimes nor condemn its acts, while they were protesting the  pitiless colonial rule. They also said they would not try to  satisfy their grudge accumulated in the past. They were right.  We should cooperate with Japan in a dauntless manner  [tangdanghage] with confidence and national pride, and we should  also win the just and fair competition with it, without fail.  [applause]    It is time for us to have a future-oriented view of history  and to demonstrate our ripened national capacity. It is time to  advance toward the world with a correct understanding of the new  Japan, the new Asia, and the new world.    Dear 70 million fellow countrymen:    Without national reunification, the building of a  self-reliant and independent country cannot be completed. The  national division is a historic holdover from the past that must  be cleared. Only when we destroy the wall of national division,  will we finally be able to enjoy the true glory of the nation,  and can we become a responsible nation that will make a greater  contribution to the co- prosperity and peace of the world.    Reunification should be achieved in a direction going with  the trend of world history. The world is moving toward an era  of openness and cooperation, putting an end to the era of  distrust and confrontation.    North Korea must realize that reform and openness is the  only  shortcut in making the nation one and guarantee the nation's  welfare. [applause]</p>

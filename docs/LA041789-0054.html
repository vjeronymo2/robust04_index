			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUT BUSH AIDES STILL VOW TO FIGHT FOR KEY ADMINISTRATION BUDGET ITEM;  </P> <P> DARMAN SEES SLIM CHANCE OF CAPITAL GAINS CUT  </P> <P> President Bush's budget director conceded Sunday that "chances look to be low"  for a key Administration budget priority -- reduction of capital gains taxes,  but Administration officials still vowed to press ahead with the controversial  tax cut plan.  </P> <P> "We're going to work awfully hard to get the capital gains tax reduction," said  White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. And while chances for the plan look  dim now because of strong opposition by congressional Democrats, the prospects  could improve in the months to come, insisted Richard G. Darman, director of  the White House Office of Management and Budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Windfall for Rich  </P> <P> Bush argues that cutting taxes on capital gains -- income a person receives  from the sale of assets such as stocks or bonds -- would spur the economy, but  Democrats charge that the plan would merely line the pockets of the rich.  Currently, income from capital gains is taxed the same way as any other kind of  income. Under Bush's plan, most capital gains would be taxed at a lower rate,  as has been past practice.  </P> <P> The fate of the idea is one of several unresolved elements in the agreement for  next year's federal budget that the Administration and congressional leaders  announced Friday.  </P> <P> When the budget agreement was announced, Administration officials claimed that  it would reduce the federal deficit by about $27 billion, but in an interview  Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation," Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman  of the House Budget Committee, said that only about two-thirds of that amount  is real. And even that two-thirds, he said, depends in large part on decisions  that Congress and the Administration have yet to make.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Gimmicks Too  </P> <P> The budget plan includes roughly $8 billion in real spending reductions,  Panetta said, and a similar amount in new revenues. The balance of the  agreement involves accounting gimmicks and plans to shift some spending from  next year to this year, making the deficit worse for the current fiscal year,  which ends Sept. 30.  </P> <P> With major policy decisions yet to be made, Administration officials and  congressional leaders fanned out to cover all the major network weekend  interview programs seeking to advance their positions in the continuing budget  debate. Their statements served mostly to illustrate how much the two sides  continue to differ over deficit reduction and how much each side would like the  other to be the first to propose higher taxes.  </P> <P> Darman, interviewed on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Sununu, on "Face  the Nation," and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, on NBC's "Meet the  Press" each defended the capital gains proposal and lauded the budget agreement  as a major first step toward reducing the deficit without raising taxes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foes Assail Proposal  </P> <P> Democrats, including Panetta on CBS, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim  Sasser (D-Tenn.) on ABC and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.)  on Cable News Network's "Newsmaker Saturday," each denounced the proposed  capital gains cut, depreciated the budget agreement as "minimalist," in  Sasser's words, and insisted that eventually Bush would have to propose higher  taxes to really make a dent in the deficit.  </P> <P> "I am not going to engage in a second level of negotiations with the  Administration unless everything's on the table," Panetta said.  </P> <P> "We're going to have everything discussed and negotiated," responded Sununu,  "but it's a question of who brings it to the table."  </P> <P> As the maneuvering continues, the most pressing immediate question is how to  plug a $5.3-billion hole that the budget negotiators left in the middle of  their agreement. The figure represents additional federal revenue that Congress  and the Administration have agreed to raise without actually increasing taxes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boost in Asset Sales Seen  </P> <P> The Administration argues that cutting the capital gains tax would accomplish  most of that. If the tax is cut, Administration economists say, many people  would take advantage of the lower rates and sell appreciated assets. The  increase in asset sales, in turn, would bring the government more revenue even  with lower rates. Bush proposed the tax cut during the fall campaign and argued  strenuously for it.  </P> <P> Democrats reject the idea. The rate cut might spur enough sales to increase  revenue the first year but that would only steal money from future years,  making the long-term deficit worse, they argue.  </P> <P> In any case, Mitchell said, Bush's proposal would "provide an enormous increase  (in income) to those at the top" because wealthy families own nearly all the  nation's capital assets. Given that the income disparity between rich and poor  in America has increased noticeably in the last decade, "that's the last thing  we need in our society today," he said.  </P> <P> If Democrats stick to their opposition and the capital gains reduction does not  pass, the way out of the current dilemma may be to extend some taxes that are  currently set to expire, Sasser said. For example, he noted, the current  federal excise tax on airplane tickets, which raises about $3 billion a year,  is set to expire at the end of this year.  </P></p>

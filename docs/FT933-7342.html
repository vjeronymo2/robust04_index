			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: Dartington comes in from the cold - Antony Thorncroft finds the Summer School begining to blow its own trumpet THE Dartington International Summer School is edging shyly into the spotlight. For years it has flourished as a discreet coming together of 400 committed music buffs, from enthusiastic amateurs keen to spend a week or two among the big musical names, to sharp students wanting to make contacts and catch the eye of the musical establishment, which from Stravinsky to Britten to Berio has always supported Dartington with enthusiasm. In the past the School was besotted with the very Dartington concept of the right to fail - that the composers, musicians and singers gathered to create new works, rediscover rarities, and polish established pieces should not be subject to rigorous outside criticism. Dartington was the serious musicians' idea of fun, and not for the real world. That is changing. Dartington under its artistic director Gavin Henderson is waking up to the fact that it can claim to be one of the largest music festivals in the world, with well over a hundred performances during its five-week season in addition to the thousands of classes, jam sessions and solo music making. In the past the projects put together at Dartington often had a successful after-life, but Dartington rarely enjoyed the credit. For example 'The Juliet Letters', the creation of Elvis Costello and the Brodsky Quartet, was refined at last year's Dartington. This year one of the works licked into shape was the 'Ordo Virtutum', created by the medieval abbess Hildegard of Bingen to entertain her nuns around 1200 and arguably the oldest piece of music theatre to survive. It is already earmarked for the 1995 Brighton Festival, of which Henderson just happens to be artistic director. The Dartington Summer School actually claims the Edinburgh Festival as its parent. In the euphoria of the 1940s it was felt that Edinburgh should have an educational role; and after a period at Bryanston, the summer school moved to Dartington. Unfortunately it naturally became linked in the public mind with the Dartington Trust, that idealistic creation of the inter-war period which never quite created the new man but which spawned a progressive school with an uncanny ability to make the tabloids. The school has gone, although the Schumacher College promoting new age philosophy thrives, and Dartington College, which provides the Summer School with its facilities, is now the performing arts off-shoot of the University of Plymouth. A new era has started in this idyllic setting in south Devon, which with its landscaped lawns and 14th century buildings can rival Glyndebourne in grace and beauty. But the Summer School would not want to shake off the idealism of Dartington. At this year's school the Hackney Youth Orchestra was in residence, working up a performance of Holst's 'St Paul's Suite', a tribute to Imogen Holst, part founder of the School. There must be give and take at Dartington. Anyone can pay up to Pounds 580 a week and expect some attention. They will be dragooned into the choir, which this week performed Janacek's 'Glagolithic Mass', and can hope for some personal advice from Nigel Osborne, Keith Tippett, Barrington Pheloung, or Robert Tear, who all receive a fixed Pounds 300 a week for their contribution. Most participants are the keenest of amateurs, students, or young professionals who want to play with the Medici String Quartet, or the Brodsky, or the Schubert Ensemble. Throughout the grounds music can be heard coming from bedrooms, studios, the bigger halls, or even from soloists among the trees. It is all too committed to seem escapist. Every evening there are three concerts and some tickets are usually available for visitors in the neighbourhood. Any music lover doomed to a beach holiday should think of the south Devon coast and steal away to Dartington in the evenings. The School is opening up because it wants more money for scholarships and for expansion. It is introducing dance and is considering widening its range to take in the orchestral. At the moment it concentrates on the small scale and devotes each of its five weeks to a dominating musical form, from early music, to baroque, classical, romantic, and modern. There is a growing emphasis on new works and next week around 30 composers are playing around with ideas, some of which will live on through such projects as the Royal Opera House's Garden Venture, which started at Dartington. Business is beginning to show an interest, notably Audi, which sponsors an International Conductors Class under Diego Masson. But Dartington is unlikely to sell out to commerce. It is really seeking wider recognition as the driving force behind the regeneration of British music and music making.</p>

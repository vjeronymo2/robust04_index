			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In each of the consumer analyses, such as payback and life-cycle costs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department did include all incremental expenses caused by standards. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those design options entailing additional maintenance expenses (beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base case), the incremental maintenance expenses were included in the consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price of the design option. Installation expenses that were specific to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design option and independent of the application were also included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer price of the design option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Regional and Other Variations in Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments recommended that the Department look at regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variations in usages of some climate-sensitive products, e.g., direct heating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 10; United Texas Transmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Company, No. 26 at 3; Florida Energy Office, No. 42 at 1; Arkansas Western Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Company, No. 64 at 3; and Minnegasco, No. 83 at 2.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards analysis assumes that nationwide average appliance usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates, energy prices, and efficiency applied to all consumers in all areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nation, although the Department recognizes that there exist large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variations in each of these factors. However, the Department did conduct a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity analysis on the life-cycle cost for energy prices by substituting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various high and low regional prices for national prices. The results of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these sensitivities are presented in the Technical Support Document. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Support Document, Chapter 4. However, these sensitivity analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were performed at the national level, and no effort is made to link them with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any specific population groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department seeks information concerning the extent to which any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed national efficiency standard is likely to affect identifiable groups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of consumers disproportionally and how best to consider such impacts in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection of efficiency standard levels. The Department is also seeking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional data to help it better assess the disproportionate impacts on such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On a related issue, numerous comments suggested that the usage variables  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department should use are those that are calculated from field usage data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, many of the comments provided estimates of annual operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses of several of the appliances, e.g. water heaters, direct heating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, and ranges and ovens. (Southern Gas Association No. 4 at 4; __  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 2; Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, No. 31 at 17, 19; Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 5; Lone Star  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas Company, No. 39 at 3; Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8; Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 3; Southern Natural Gas Company, No. 46 at 1;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Montana-Dakota Utilities Company, No. 54 at 3; Laclede, No. 55 at 4; Oklahoma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 3, 5; Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 36; Arkansas Western Gas Company, No. 64 at 6;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 65 at 1; Northern Minnesota Utilities, No. 68  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 1; Minnegasco, No. 83 at 2; and Flair, No. 85 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department appreciates the data it received. The Department also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained data on unit energy consumption by appliance type, principally from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility companies. The Department reviewed the data received from all sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and generated what it believes are the best estimates of energy consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are contained in the proposed test procedure amendments for mobile home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnaces, direct heating equipment, pool heaters and kitchen ranges and ovens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above, and were used in the analyses for today's notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, regional energy prices were used in sensitivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses. Additionally, in the proposed test procedure amendments, the usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for mobile home furnaces and direct heating equipment have been modified from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a national basis to a regional one to reflect the mostly regional distribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Rebound Effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments raised the issue of rebound effects, which occur when an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliance that is made more efficient is used more intensively, so that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected energy savings from the efficiency improvement do not fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materialize. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 2). American Council for an Energy Efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economy commented that the consumer sees and reacts to his or her total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility bill, so any efficiency change in a particular product that has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small impact on his or her total utility bill should not affect usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behavior. Washington Gas Light suggested that usage elasticities should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided by rigorous analyses of regional appliance usage characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian </F> Justice and Life Party, by correspondent Peter Obersovszky; date  and place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Obsersovszky] In light of the figures, can you  imagine a demonstration like the one you spoke about shortly  before the elections? You spoke about 100,000 people and that  the pronation parties, political groupings, and people ought to  demonstrate that they did not want a left-wing victory.    [Csurka] This is the third time I have been asked a question  like this this evening, as if there were a secret service here  wanting to know what I am planning, and whether I am taking the  Hungarian people to the streets. That is not my intention. I  know what we must do. We must organize anew the Hungarian Way  and the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] on a  professional basis. We have not had the money or financial  resources for this so far. It will become clear now upon whom we  can count.    Do not expect me to tell the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ], which has really come to power, what I plan. What I  will say is that this victory is not the victory of the  Hungarian Socialist Party, but the victory of the SZDSZ, because  this government will be directed by the SZDSZ and it will  function in accordance with the interests stipulated by the  foreign supporters of the SZDSZ.</p>

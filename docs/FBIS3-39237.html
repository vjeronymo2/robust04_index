The  representatives of the IG Metall trade union and the  Gesamtmetall employers organization parted in the evening,  without agreeing on a date for fresh talks.    Gesamtmetall's president, Hans-Joachim Gottschol, blamed the  trade union for not accepting the employers' proposals on  securing jobs. The employers had suggested opening up wage  agreements, which would have allowed companies to increase work  time to 40 hours, or decrease it below the current 36 hours per  week on a temporary basis. IG Metall had rejected longer  working hours and demanded wage compensations in the event of a  shorter working week, which would be counterproductive on the  labor market, Gottschol said.</p>

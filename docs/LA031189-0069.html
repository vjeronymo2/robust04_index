			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UTILITIES' PROPHECY OF LOWER BILLS DRAWS FIRE  </P> <P> The average San Diego County residential utility bill will be $50 to $60 less  each year if Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas  &amp; Electric Co. is approved, utility officials said Friday at a special  legislative hearing on the merger.  </P> <P> But San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor and a representative of utility consumers  said they believe the takeover would increase gas and electric rates or, at  best, leave them unaffected.  </P> <P> Michael Peevey, an Edison vice president, said the takeover, which would create  the largest investor-owned power company in the United States, would save  ratepayers about $1.7 billion during the next decade. He said the savings would  come through the elimination of administrative duplication and the more  efficient use of the two utilities' power plants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower Cost Claim  </P> <P> "The combined companies will have lower costs and therefore lower rates than  Southern California Edison or SDG&amp;E could achieve separately," Peevey said.  Although SDG&amp;E's rates have been falling of late while Edison's have been  rising, the San Diego company, if left on its own, eventually would be forced  to build expensive new power plants to satisfy the energy demand of the  county's rapidly growing population, said Peevey and Ron Fuller, an SDG&amp;E  vice president.  </P> <P> "We believe the Edison offer is a very good one for our customers," Fuller  said. "The Edison offer provides us what we need to provide lower rates in the  1990s. We have to do something."  </P> <P> But O'Connor, who has helped lead the opposition to the Edison takeover, said  she does not believe that Rosemead-based SCEcorp, Edison's parent company,  would fulfill its promise. Describing the proposed Edison-SDG&amp;E  conglomerate as a "monster utility," O'Connor said that Edison has given  assurances to its shareholders that would conflict with the interests of  customers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Validity Questioned  </P> <P> "The profit must come from somewhere," she said. "I fear it will come from  increased rates from San Diego."  </P> <P> Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a  San Diego consumer group, also questioned the validity of the Edison claim.  </P> <P> "I just see that as further evidence of Edison's rich fantasy life," Shames  said. He said SDG&amp;E's costs without the merger need not increase as much as  Edison contends they will.  </P> <P> "It's like a car salesman saying this car is priced at $15,000 but he can give  it to you for $12,000," Shames said. "But the car doesn't really sell for  $15,000 in the first place."  </P> <P> Shames also complained that Peevey overestimated the potential savings for San  Diegans because most of SDG&amp;E's residential customers use far more  electricity than the utility's "average" customer does.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Questions  </P> <P> Another consumer group leader questioned Edison's pledge to reduce rates in San  Diego, potentially at the expense of Edison customers. "You can't reduce one  group of customers' rates and not the other group's," said Sylvia Siegel,  executive director of San Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate Normalization.  "You can't do that because (the merger would create) one company."  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the Assembly Utilities  and Commerce Committee, and Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), chairman  of the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committees, held Friday's special  joint hearing to investigate the merger even though, under current law, the  Legislature has no direct voice in the matter, which will eventually be decided  by the Public Utilities Commission.  </P> <P> Already this year, more than half a dozen bills have been introduced that could  affect the merger. Several concern a proposal to thwart the merger by allowing  the San Diego County Water Authority to take over SDG&amp;E and run it as a  municipal utility. Other bills would set guidelines for the PUC to use when it  decides whether to approve the merger.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $3-Million Increase  </P> <P> Rosenthal announced Friday that he will seek a $3-million increase in the PUC's  budget this year to pay for more representation for consumers at the  commission's hearings on the merger. He said Southern California Edison has  vowed to spend $15 million or more to get the commission's approval.  </P> <P> Some of the extra money proposed by Rosenthal would be used by the PUC to hire  consultants and part would be allocated to public groups to help them prepare  the cases they intend to present to the commission.  </P> <P> "This will not make the playing field level, but it will no longer be  lopsided," said Rosenthal, who will pursue the funding during a Monday Senate  hearing.  </P> <P> However, Shames complained that the funds would not help consumer groups unless  they are handed out almost immediately. "I'm preparing my budget right now,"  Shames said.  </P> <P> Rosenthal also said he and Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Bonita) have proposed that the  commission open a temporary office in San Diego because several hearings on the  issue will be held there this year.  </P> <P> Commission officials said Friday that the utilities are now scheduled to  present documents supporting their case April 17, a month later than had been  planned. They said the change will probably mean that the PUC will not reach a  decision until early 1990.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Greg Johnson contributed to this article.  </P></p>

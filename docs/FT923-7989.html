			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / People: Watkins' unscheduled arrival at LT In a surprise move by the Department of Transport, Alan Watkins, the former boss of engineering group Hawker Siddeley, was yesterday appointed as the Pounds 100,000-a-year chief executive of London Transport. The surprise is that almost no one knew the job vacancy existed. Until now, the function has been carried out by Wilfrid Newton, London Transport's chairman. Last year, however, London Transport quietly called in McKinsey, the consultants, to have a look at its management. One recommendation was that LT should follow the current fashion for separating the roles of chairman and chief executive, leaving the former to concentrate on strategy and the latter to run day-to-day the business. Watkins, 53, has been kicking his heels since losing his job at Hawker Siddeley after the hostile takeover last year by BTR, Sir Owen Green's conglomerate. He had landed that job only two years earlier after spending his previous working life at Lucas Industries. One slightly puzzling aspect of his appointment to London Transport is why a professional engineer (and a born-and-bred Brummie) would want to run the capital's buses and Underground trains, particularly when it means a considerable drop in pay from the Pounds 260,000 a year he picked up at Hawker Siddeley. Watkins, pointing out that there are not all that many large engineering groups around with vacancies for chief executives, explains there is anyway a big engineering content in London Transport - all those trains, tracks, signals and bus garages. He says he relishes the task of building on the recent small signs of improvement in services. And the money?'The financial rewards are secondary. And anyway, it's a good deal more than most people earn.' ***** Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive, has persuaded former home secretary Kenneth Baker to become his personal adviser. Baker, who left the cabinet after the April election, has also joined the Hanson board as a non-executive director. An enthusiast for high technology in general and ICL in particular, Baker returned from the political cold in 1981 to become minister for information technology at the Department of Trade and Industry. Previously seen to be too closely allied to the old Heath administration for a cabinet position, Baker had written a paper to Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher outlining why Britain should have a minister specifically responsible for IT. She created the post and gave him the job, which he inhabited until 1984. Within two years he had boosted government support for the field to Pounds 250m from Pounds 30m - a point that Bonfield, who came from Texas Instruments onto the ICL board the year Baker took up office, has perhaps not forgotten. ICL, which is 80 per cent owned by Fujitsu, also notes that Baker has been an advocate of improved links with Japan. He is a director of the UK-Japan 2000 Group, and his business interests in the 1970's took him to Japan. Baker, meanwhile, has plenty of time for Bonfield. 'He is one of the great successes of the British technology industry' he said yesterday.</p>

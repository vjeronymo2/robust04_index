			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok January 28 TASS -- A top official of the  Russian Pacific Navy accused Japanase mass media of ``whipping  up tensions'' over the waste dumping problem.    ``Our neighbours in the Sea of Japan, as well as other  countries which have nuclear power-engineering, also dump  low-radioactive waste in coastal waters. This is world practice  and nobody, but Japan, makes so much ado about it,'' Valeriy  Danilyan, head of the chemical service of the Pacific Fleet,  told TASS on Friday.    This ``ado'' forced a tanker from the Pacific Fleet with  nuclear waste on board to dock in the Bolshoy Kamen Bay where it  will have to stay until spring.    In order to help the Pacific Fleet to cope with the  situation, Japan offered its own tanker to be used for storing  radioactive waste.    It is hard to say whether this was just a hasty decision or  an underestimation of the experience of Russian navymen,  according to Danilyan.    The Japanese tanker was worn out by 30 percent, it had no  necessary double coating and no pumping system to load and  unload the waste, he explained.    Besides, it could not solidify liquid waste and the Pacific  Fleet had to turn down the Japanese offer.    Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Feliks Gromov told reporters  during a recent visit to Vladivostok that 20 hours after dumping  the level of radioactivity does not exceed the natural  background in the Sea of Japan. He added that Russia is now  designing an ecologically-safe technology to utilise radioactive  waste.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (11): Still only a distant dream / A look at prospects for the Ecu becoming widely used THE SEE-SAWING prospects of the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union (Emu) being ratified by all 12 EC parliaments this year have been reflected in the health of the Ecu, which the treaty set as Europe's single currency by the end of the century. The Ecu currency basket itself remains stable. Eight currencies that account for 80 per cent of the Ecu's weighting are within the narrow fluctuation band of the European exchange rate mechanism. In addition, Maastricht agreed to make no further changes in the Ecu's composition. This is not a major move, but one which will prevent a recurrence of the slowdown in Ecu market activity that used to precede the five-yearly revision of the Ecu basket. It is the Ecu bond market which has acted as a bellwether of Maastricht's perceived political fortunes. Just after Maastricht, Ecu bond yields decreased as investors took the long view that the Ecu would be just about as solid as the D-mark - simply because it would have to be, if Germany was going to let the former replace the latter. But in March, as doubts began to creep in about Maastricht surviving the referendum in Denmark and getting a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, the spread between Ecu and D-Mark bond yields widened. The enthusiasm for Ecu bonds as a financial instrument stayed high this year. In the first quarter, primary issues totalled an impressive Ecu10.8bn, though down on the record Ecu14.9bn issued in the same period of 1991. The yield curve was filled at either end, with the French Treasury launching Ecu1.5bn worth of 30-year OAT notes and the UK Treasury issuing Ecu1bn worth of three-year notes. Over the past couple of years, the EC has stepped up its own Ecus issues, with balance of payments loans to Greece and eastern Europe and with European Investment Bank lending increasing to the latter region. EC central banks, too, are making more use of the official Ecu in intervention, buying and selling it against their national currencies. But there is still almost no private use of the Ecu. The past two years have seen minor advances, with the Eurocontrol air traffic control organisation starting to bill airline companies in Ecus, and some 18 European railway companies adopting the Ecu as the accounting unit between themselves. Yet, less than 1 per cent of EC exports are invoiced in Ecus. At this stage, therefore, the European Commission's dream of the Ecu becoming the world's top currency still seems distant. A 1990 Commission report forecast that Emu might, in various ways, lead to a flow into the Ecu of nearly Dollars 500bn. This, it speculated, could be the result of EC countries being able to dispense with Dollars 200bn in official reserves; An increase of Dollars 35bn in seigniorage (income derived from issuing interest-bearing assets) as non-Europeans decide to hold Ecus in cash as a store of value; Fund and portfolio managers diversifying into Ecus to the tune of perhaps Dollars 200bn; Increased use of the Ecu, roughly Dollars 60bn worth, in trade payments. The development of Ecu-denominated trade would reduce EC traders' foreign exchange risk, and give EC banks more scope to provide services in their own currency around the world. Though all this may be far off, there is at least growing interest in the Ecu in European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries, several of whom have applied to join the EC. Between October 1990 and June 1991, Norway, Sweden and Finland decided to peg their currencies to the Ecu; Austria, for its part, has attached the schilling to the D-Mark. Further afield, Iceland has apparently been weighing a link to the Ecu, even though the US dollar makes up 18 per cent of the trade-weighted currency basket it uses at the moment. Malta, which is an EC applicant, has not formally linked its money to the Ecu, but Ecu-component currencies have a majority weighting in the currency basket it uses. While it may make sense for central European countries to peg currencies to the Ecu, Warsaw, Prague and Budapest do not have the financial markets to handle such an operation. The three main Nordic countries would like associate membership of the European Monetary System, which EC states have so far resisted, partly because if they created such a status, it would be hard to deny it to others. Norway has, in fact, negotiated the essence of associate membership by organising swap credits with several EC central banks. Finland may want to do the same, particularly after its rocky start with the Ecu; it had to devalue the markka heavily against the Ecu this year. Sweden is still pushing for formal status as an EMS associate, to obtain a multilateral swap arrangement which would otherwise have to be negotiated bilaterally. But it is idle to think the Ecu will 'take off' outside the Community before it 'takes off' inside. Mr Andre Louw, one of the Commission's Ecu specialists, says there are still obstacles to greater use of the Ecu. Chief of these is that Germany still regards it as a currency index, not a true foreign currency. As a result, it is still not possible to write a cheque or contracts in Ecus which is enforceable in German courts. Some other countries, particularly Belgium, Spain (which only recently lifted exchange controls), Greece (which still has them), actually allow residents to perform in Ecus transactions that are not allowed in other foreign currencies. But Belgium, which has issued some Ecu coins as legal tender, does not allow companies to denominate their capital in Ecus. Luxembourg does, but only two firms have done so. Mr Louw also complains that banks, mistakenly, fail to promote the Ecu. 'When we get the Ecu, banks will lose from no longer being able to trade national (EC) currencies, but they will gain far more from an enormous increase in trading the Ecu against the dollar and yen, in Ecu deposit/credit banking and in Ecu bond trading,' he says. 'The problem is to generate a circuit, so that if you generate revenue in Ecu, you can spend it in Ecu.'</p>

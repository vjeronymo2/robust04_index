			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEWS  </P> <P> ****  </P> <P> MARCUS ROBERTS  </P> <P> "Deep in the Shed", RCA Novus  </P> <P> This is an all blues album, or so says pianist Roberts; it depends on how  strictly one construes the term. What his writing (for a three- or four-horn  band) gains in diversity of moods, modes and meters, it loses now and then in  true blues soul.  </P> <P> In fact, he has gone so deep into the woodshed that experimentation sometimes  takes precedence over celebration. Still, it's an intriguing example of his  evolution as a composer. Wessell Anderson's alto sax brings to "Nebuchadnezzar"  the flavor of Ellington, or what Duke might be writing had he survived and  advanced. "E. Dankworth" is a strong cut, thanks to the inventive trumpeter for  whom it was named.  </P> <P>  Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five stars (a classic).  </P> <P> LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

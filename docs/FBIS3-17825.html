"To put pressure on Crimea could cause an explosion. For  Ukraine, there is only one outcome, that is to offer Crimea the  widest possible scope in the economic domain," Konstantin  Zatulin told a press conference here. [passage omitted]    Zatulin is chairman of the committee in charge of relations  with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the Duma  (lower house of parliament).    Zatulin insisted that "Russia has never played and never  will  play the Crimean card," but "it is impossible not to take into  account Russia's special interests in Crimea." [passage omitted]    "We are working from the principle of Ukraine's  (territorial)  integrity, but Crimea and certain Ukrainian regions are de facto  very close to Russia," Zatulin said.    On the thorny question of the Black Sea fleet, which has  poisoned relations between Kiev and Moscow for the past two  years, Zatulin said to share the fleet was "an absurd idea."    "After talking to the sailors, I know that no decision on  sharing the fleet would be implemented by the military," he  said. "We must carry on working on the basis of the treaty of  Massandra."

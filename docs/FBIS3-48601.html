			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The influx of Vietnamese refugees back to Cambodia  by boat has drawn a strong reaction from the Army of Democratic  Kampuchea. Taking advantage of the permission given by the  royal government allowing all fishing groups to carry on their  activities, Vietnamese settlers -- who have been fishing in  Cambodia since 1979 and fled to live along the  Cambodian-Vietnamese border for fear of massacre by the Khmer  Rouge -- have returned with their fishing boats. This is not  legal at all.    According to sources in the Khmer Royal Armed Forces in the  4th Military Region, the Khmer Rouge [KR] has strongly reacted  to the return of illegal Vietnamese settlers. The sources also  said that the Khmer Rouge have accused the government of  colluding with Vietnam and allowing many Vietnamese fishing  boats into the country without any strict restrictions against  these Vietnamese.    According to other reliable sources, however, Khmer Rouge  leader General Chhit Choeun alias Mok -- who has gone to the  border intersection of Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand for medical  treatment -- has ordered Division 980 under the command of  "Muon" to resume its operations, particularly the Tonle Sap unit  which is believed to be the Khmer Rouge's special military unit.  This Khmer Rouge official based his remarks on the return of  Vietnamese fishermen. This source also specified that the Tonle  Sap unit, most of whose members are young, courageous, and  violent, are preparing for action in and along the Tonle Sap.    This source went on to say that except for the Tonle Sap  unit, the Khmer Rouge command has dispatched small groups to the  Anlung Veng or Pailin areas to assist in the defense of these  two regions against the royal government troops.    It should be recalled that last year nearly 40 Vietnamese  lost their lives in the Khmer Rouge attack on the village of  Chong Khneas in Siem Reap. This was a racist act on Vietnamese  fishermen in boats. It forced these fishermen to hastily leave  their shelters. Now such racist acts are continuing. This is  why the Tonle Sap unit is preparing to launch operations in the  Tonle Sap to coincide with the arrival of Vietnamese fishing  groups in the areas where they used to do business.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / South West stung and ready to fight Mr Ian Byatt's findings for South West Water stood out among the 10 water and sewerage companies like a 'sore thumb', Mr Ken Hill, the company's finance director, said yesterday. His sentiments were echoed in the industry and the City. 'They haven't got a hope in hell of doing their coastline schemes,' said one water company managing director. South West has a long coastline that has to be cleaned up under European legislation and has a relatively small population to help fund it. Its unique situation prompted the regulator three years ago to increase its K-factor, the allowed price increase above inflation, from 6 percentage points to 11.5 points. This time he was tougher. Mr Byatt said: 'They have already had their big price increase, and their bills are very high. I believe they could do it within the price limits I have given them.' South West intends to take the issue to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Hill said that the effect of yesterday's announcement was to demand efficiency savings of Pounds 400m over five years to pay for obligations which had not changed since the regulator agreed the increased K-factor.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Pru stake sale hits insurers The UK's leading insurance company, Prudential, was hit as one of its principal stakeholders sold 46m shares, the equivalent of a near 2.5 per cent holding in the company. The shares were placed with Smith New Court, one of the UK's most aggressive marketmaking firms, in the form of a bought deal, a situation where the trading house takes on all the risk - and potential profit. Dealers said Smith purchased the shares for 350p and placed most of them at 354p, a discount to the underlying share price. They added that the house could have been holding between 5m and 10m shares by the close of official trading. Smith said: 'We consider that we have had a successful placing.' It pointed out that the trade was carried out under new Stock Exchange rules which allow publication of big deals to be delayed. What the market really wanted to know was the identity of the seller. Potential candidates were Schroders' fund management arm, Mercury Asset Management, Baring, Britannic Assurance and Postel, all of which have significant holdings. Both Mercury Asset Management and Schroders denied any involvement in the deal, leaving Baring as the most likely seller. Prudential lost 9 at 362p, with the Seaq ticker showing turnover of 44m shares. Other composite and life assurance issues were weak as institutions sold them in order to take on the Prudential windfall. Legal &amp; General declined 15 to 523p, Commercial Union 17 to 674p, General Accident 24 to 701p and Royal Insurance 8 to 337p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata apologized Thursday for confusion  over the supply of rice and assured consumers that there will  not be any serious shortage.    Speaking before the House of Councillors' Committee on  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Hata said there will not be  any "quantitative problem" because the government has secured  rice to meet needs until August. Hata was replying to a  question by an opposition lawmaker about the mounting public  outrage as Japanese rice has disappeared from store shelves and  many consumers shun imported rice.    Hata said a total of three million tons of rice is needed  for  consumption until August and the need will be fulfilled by some  1.2 million tons of domestically grown rice left in stock, 1.7  million tons in imports and 100,000 tons of early crop rice from  this year's harvest. The government will step up efforts to  import more rice, he said.</p>

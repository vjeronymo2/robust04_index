			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RAY: "First Participation by East </F> European Navies in NATO Exercise"]    [Text] Brussels, 2 Jun (BELGA) -- Some 50 NATO ships,  including some from Belgium, and from the eight countries  bordering the Baltic Sea will participate for the first time in  a massive joint air and naval exercise from 7 to 10 June,  military sources said Thursday [2 June].    All in all, 15 countries will be represented in the  exercise,  code-named Baltic Operations 94 (shortened to Baltops 94). The  Belgian Navy will send a frigate, the Wandelaar, while the  Russian Baltic fleet will send the destroyer Neustrsashhimy,  according to a Belgian military spokesman.    The seven other non-NATO countries invited as observers for  the first phase of the exercise are Estonia, Finland, Ireland,  Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden. This is the first time  that so many neutral and former Warsaw Pact countries are  participating in allied naval maneuvers.    Some 40 NATO ships provided by the German, Belgian, British,  Danish, Netherlands, Norwegian, and American Navies will then  continue the maneuvers among themselves until 17 June, according  to the German naval staff at Glucksburg (in Schleswig-Holstein  in northern Germany). Nevertheless, they will put in at Gdynia  (Poland), the same source added.    The maneuver will be directed by Admiral David R. Morris,  the  U.S. Navy second-in-command in Europe.    Baltops 94 will be the 22d time this annual exercise has  been  performed.</p>

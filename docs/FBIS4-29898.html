			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Open Apology of Traitor Kim Yong-sam Demanded"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) called a  press conference on June 20 and strongly demanded that the  traitor Kim Yong-sam make an open apology for having thrown riot  police into five universities including Hongik University on  June 18, according to a radio report from Seoul.    It also demanded the resignation of the puppet prime  minister  and home minister.    It said the police intrusion into the universities was a  preparation for railroading the treacherous "bill on the Uruguay  Round world trade accord" through the "National Assembly" and  urged the authorities to declare to the people their will to  "renegotiate the Uruguay Round accord." It stressed that the  accord must never be "ratified."    Hanchongnyon demanded that the puppet authorities  immediately  release the students who had been taken to the police and  compensate for the damages done to the furniture.</p>

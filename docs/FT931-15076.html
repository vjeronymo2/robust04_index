			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gencos up on coal deal hope SHARES IN the two main power generators surged as rumours returned that the new contract to supply the regional electricity companies had been signed. The deal is due to be tied up by April but the present government predicament over the fate of the UK mining industry has added spice to the terms of the contract, and how it will affect the generators' shares. Before recent government hints that a subsidy may be given to coal production, some energy specialists were pred-icting that PowerGen and National Power would be able to provide about a 20 per cent dividend boost from the improved earnings growth this year. While some still hold this view, analysts are increasingly fearful that a subsidy on coal would not only limit earnings, but also add weight to the regulatory environment - with a Monopolies and Mergers Commission referral not ruled out - which in turn could impinge on profits. Yesterday the mood was more positive on the likely outcome; PowerGen advanced 8 1/2 to 289p and National Power 8 to 289p. The regional companies were also generally strong, with Manweb, ahead 13 at 506p, Norweb, up 12 at 489p, and Seeboard, 8 higher at 472p, among the main movers. Enterprise weakens The after-effects of a US listing by Enterprise Oil was said to be behind a sharp fall in the UK share price yesterday. The independent exploration and production company attempted to raise Dollars 150m (Pounds 98.6m) through an initial public offering of American Depositary Shares in October. A large chunk of the shares, however, were left with the underwriters, who needed to offload them in the UK. Dealers said the stock was now overhanging the market and responsible for the under-lying share price sliding 14 to 409p. Others suggested that the shares might merely have been consolidating following a good run. Courtaulds switch Chemicals group Courtaulds tumbled 14 1/2 to 572 1/2 p after US investment bank Lehman Brothers recommended switching out of the stock and into Laporte, which rose 7 to 602p ex-rights. Lehman analyst Mr Martin Glen argued that Laporte's price/earnings ratio was some two points lower than Courtaulds' and it was more exposed to economic recovery in North America. Also, Laporte was higher yielding and had greater earnings growth potential. Laporte was supported by a number of other houses, including Hoare Govett, which argues that the company's offer last week for Evode (steady at 123p) was 'shrewd and well timed'. Drug issues bought Pharmaceuticals stocks held against the trend as one leading securities house decided the tide was about to turn and became a strong buyer. The sector was marginally up on the day and leading issues resisted selling pressure. Hoare Govett published an in-depth note entitled 'Calling the Bottom', which argued that the sector presented a strong buying opportunity. Analyst Mr Nigel Barnes said the sector could drift more in the short term but on a 12-month view it was 'extremely cheap'. The house particularly likes SmithKline Beecham and said an R &amp; D presentation in Philadelphia in March will highlight new products. It is also buying Glaxo, Amersham International and London International. SmithKline firmed 2 to 477p and 418p in the Units. Glaxo was a penny higher at 724p, Amersham firm at 653p and LIG steady at 256p. Dixons disappoints The downward march in Dixons shares continued as the stores group revealed a decline in its US fortunes far worse than the market's expectations. While UK sales had held up well, particularly in the Christmas period, Dixons' US electrical retailing chain Silo produced further losses and deepening gloom among analysts. Dixons dropped 29 to 225p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 12m, the highest for around two years. However, there were signs yesterday that the shares may soon find some support. Mr Andy Hughes, stores specialist at Nomura, moved from a sell to a buy, arguing that the fall had been overdone - the shares stood at 280p a week ago - and that they now looked good value. 'Dixons is well placed for recovery and the UK sales picture is very encouraging.' He added that the revival in the US economy should come to the aid of Silo. Bears of the stock forecast further falls. Mr Tony Shiret at BZW predicted even worse losses in the US this year, despite Dixons' attempts to stem the tide with a series of store closures. 'The shares are still too highly rated,' he said. There were other gloomy reports around the stores sector yesterday. The well-signalled trading statement from Alexon proved this week's bear raiders correct and the shares reacted accordingly, falling 8 to 68p. Warning of flat earnings, the group said it did 'not anticipate recommending a final dividend'. Body Shop said UK sales in the pre-Christmas period were down 8 per cent. The shares weakened 15 to 153p. Profits forecasts were pulled in to a range of Pounds 19m to 22m, down about 10 per cent. Rumours of downgradings in Great Universal Stores were heard. The shares have fallen around a pound in the last week, including 37 yesterday to close at 1613p. DIY worries and the continuing uncertainty over the strength of the recovery knocked Kingfisher, off 18 at 554p. However, Next again responded to talk that its sales remain firm, the shares adding 1 1/2 at 154p. Oil shares were lower in the face of continued weakness in the oil price. Spot and January Brent crude dipped below Dollars 17 per barrel, leading some analysts to cut price forecasts for the year. BZW analyst Mr Jeremy Elden cut his 1993 oil price forecast to Dollars 19.5 per barrel from Dollars 21, but said investors should buy oil shares if Opec delivers production cuts. Shell Transport touched 524p but closed only a penny off at 529p, while Lasmo dipped 4 to 146p. British Petroleum was steady at 237 1/2 p, although Morgan Stanley was last night contacting clients to say it had cut fourth-quarter earnings estimates. Analyst Mr Lars Reierson lowered his forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 95m and said: 'US buying has been based on over-optimistic earnings estimates. There will be little fundamental support in the UK for the shares until the yield is a lot closer to Shell's' Vodafone declined 9 to 399p on talk of regulatory interest in the cellular market. Hoare Govett turned seller of the stock, citing aggressive competition from Cellnet. Hoare also downgraded BT, the fully-paid losing 4 at 386p, and Cable and Wireless, 15 adrift at 692p, blaming UK recessionary effects. Firm results from First Leisure sent the shares forward 7 to 327p. Championship prospects again lifted Manchester United, up 18 at 367p. Bid speculation continued to circulate around Lucas Industries, driving the shares forward 5 to 149p in trade of 3.2m. The Lucas warrants were also actively traded. Volume jumped to 2.3m as they hardened 2 1/2 to 17 1/2 p. Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce had a busy day. The shares fell 5 1/2 early in the session after Smith New Court cut dividend expectations for the year to December 1992 by 2 1/2 p to 5p. Smith blamed the reduction on a lack of pick-up in the spares business, technical factors, and the weak aircraft market due to cancellations. Bargain hunters helped the stock recover to close just 2 off at 106p on 6.3m traded. Investors appreciated GKN's confirmation of plans for a new US plant and the shares firmed 5 to 465p. Public relations firm Shandwick performed well in percentage terms, rising 1 1/2 to 15 1/2 p ahead of results on January 26. Shandwick is well geared for recovery in the US as it generates 50 per cent of profits there. Talk of a Cazenove downgrade left Northern Foods 8 cheaper at 270p. James Capel was said to be a buyer of Hillsdown, 8 higher at 143p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (71).

Lawyer Wendell Hollis, a former senator who lost his bid for  a House of Assembly seat in last October's general election,  handed in his letter of resignation to the UBP caucus on Monday.    "I no longer consider myself a member of the UBP," he told  reporters on Tuesday.    Hollis said the Bermuda Government's move towards  independence was just one of several reasons for his resignation.    "I am not in support of the way in which independence has  been handled by government," he said.    "I also wish to resume a sense of political independence so  anything I say won't reflect on the UBP.    "I want to talk freely on any issue without fear of  embarrassing the party.    "I value my personal independence and I used to be quite  proud of the fact that I was not affiliated with any political  party."    Hollis denied any resentment or disappointment at not being  reappointed to the Senate (upper house) after his election loss,  saying he did not expect to get back the seat.    The UBP caucus consists of members of Parliament and adopted  and approved candidates.    Hollis was the government spokesman on the environment while  in the Senate.    His resignation came days after delegated affairs Minister  Ann Cartwright Decouto quit the cabinet - but not the party,  expressly over moves towards independence.    And Management and Technology Minister Michael Winfield  resigned his post last Tuesday to focus on his business affairs.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Fiat to keep Basildon factory FIAT IS committed to keeping the former Ford tractor factory at Basildon, Essex, as one of the main plants in its worldwide agricultural equipment business, said Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer at the Italian vehicle producer. The plant, which produces diesel engines and undertakes final assembly of Ford tractors, was acquired by Fiat as part of last May's merger of Ford and Fiat's agricultural and construction equipment businesses, to form NH Geotech. Fiat is the 12th-largest non-British company in the UK with 8,000 employees last year. Employment at Basildon has fallen from about 2,800 in 1991 to just under 2,000. Most of the cuts were made last September when a fall-off in sales of agricultural vehicles, especially in Europe, led to 650 job losses. Speaking in London, Mr Garuzzo said Fiat intended to retain the twin-track strategy for Basildon - producing tractors and also engines for use on NH Geotech equipment. New products would be developed, and investment in the plant was assured, he said. The Fiat executive said there would be further rationalisation elsewhere in NH Geotech, although the company hoped to avoid plant closures.</p>

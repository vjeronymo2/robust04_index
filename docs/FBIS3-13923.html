The hunt continues for Marzel. Last night, police detectives  searched the home in Petah Tiqva of Kakh activist Natan Levi.  Levi told a Qol Yisra'el reporter that he has no idea where  Marzel is and that he doesn't think Marzel would hide out at the  home of someone identified with Kakh.    Marzel, who has been in hiding for several weeks, has said  he  would turn himself in with the mediation of several Knesset  members, including Avraham Ravitz of the United Torah Party, but  Shahal said the law forbids him to respond to such conditions.</p>

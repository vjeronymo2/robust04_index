			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] National Highway One between In Salah and  Tamanrasset was the scene of a series of armed attacks during  the last few months. The attacks were carried out by gangs  against trucks belonging to the National Road Haulage Company.  Faced with such a situation the lorries of the aforementioned  company did not have any other solution but to cut short their  journey at In Salah, thus starving the region from being  supplied with most commodities.    In an attempt to contain the situation, the local  authorities  at Tamanrasset have taken a number of security measures.  [passage omitted]</p>

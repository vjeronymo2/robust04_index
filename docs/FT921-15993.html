			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Shevardnadze warns Georgia faces economic catastrophe: Former Soviet foreign minister refuses to condemn new rulers for using force to oust President Zviad Gamsakhurdia THE FORMER Soviet foreign minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, yesterday called for national reconciliation in his native republic of Georgia which, he said, faced catastrophe because its resources were exhausted and its economy was destroyed. In an interview with the FT he offered his help to build a democratic society on the rubble left by President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The man who so frequently warned of impending dictatorship in the former Soviet Union dismissed suggestions that Georgia's new rulers were tainted by having used force to oust an elected president, whatever his authoritarian tendencies. 'It was not so much a violent takeover as a conflict between an authoritarian regime and democratic forces which were supported by armed formations,' said the former chief of Soviet diplomacy, losing no time in trying to boost the tattered image of his southern republic. The most famous living Georgian has been rootless since his republic declared independence from the union he served for most of his life. While he survived as a national politician as long as the Union survived, its dissolution last month spelt the end for him in Moscow. He quit Georgia and his job as republican Communist party chief in 1986, when he became foreign minister - a post in which he helped change the face of international relations. One of the rebel leaders yesterday described Mr Shevardnadze, who turns 64 later this month, as an able figure who could help build democracy in Georgia. He warned, however, that he could not say how people would react to the return of a man who once embodied Communist dictatorship over Georgia; Mr Shevardnadze once had Mr Gamsakhurdia jailed for dissent. However, Georgians know that Mr Shevardnadze - with his competence and international authority - could bring them the one prize which eluded Mr Gamsakhurdia: recognition and respectability as an independent state. Saying that Georgia had 'a lot to do to obtain recognition and join all-European processes', Mr Shevardnadze also predicted the republic would soon join the Commonwealth of Independent States spurned by Mr Gamsakhurdia. The former foreign minister praised Mr Tengiz Sigua, the civilian figurehead for the rebel movement who has been appointed caretaker prime minister. FORMER US president Jimmy Carter and former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze will convene a summit of elder statesmen next week to seek an end to civil conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, Reuter reports from Atlanta, Georgia. The 12 leaders of the private International Negotiation Network which Mr Carter chairs will meet for the first time at his presidential library.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  on Thursday [16 June] evaluated foreign access to Japan's  semiconductor market but avoided discussing whether or not to  end a bilateral chip trade pact before the July 1996 expiration,  a Japanese Trade Ministry official said.    During regular chip trade talks in Tokyo, both parties  instead agreed to review the "appropriateness" of an earlier  termination to the pact by the end of July this year, the  Japanese official told a press conference. The U.S. "has made  clear it has no interest" in an early termination, a U.S.  official told reporters. "It is important to see the agreement  will run its full course." Japan's stance on the issue has yet  to be decided, the Japanese official said.    The July 1991 bilateral chip trade accord calls for Japan to  maintain a "gradual and steady" increase in the foreign chip  share of the Japanese market above the 20 percent level. Under  the pact, both parties are required to decide at the end of July  this year whether or not to end it before the 1996 expiration.    The two-day session, the second of its kind this year  following the Hawaii gathering in March, came after Tuesday's  announcement that foreign-made semiconductor chips continued to  seize more than 20 percent of the Japanese market in the  January-March quarter.    The latest meeting assessed the first-quarter foreign chip  share, the recent increase in foreign chip sales in Japan and  implementation of "design-in" joint cooperation programs for  making chips from the development stage, the Japanese official  said. Washington appreciates the latest foreign chip share, the  U.S. Official said.    The Japanese side sought further marketing efforts from U.S.  Chip makers, including securing a stable product supply, the  Japanese official said, noting some types of foreign chips are  in short supply in Japan.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Observer: Departure time The Bank of England is set to lose one of its more cerebral influences. Tony Coleby, at 57 the eldest of the Bank's four executive directors, is planning to bow out early next year, thus clearing the way for Eddie George, the governor-in-waiting, to put his own men into positions of power. Coleby, the director in charge of monetary issues, intends to go when his four-year term ends and he turns 58. His replacement in the executive suite is likely to be 49-year-old Ian Plenderleith, a chain-smoking workaholic who is 'Hard Eddie's' closest disciple within Threadneedle Street and currently in charge of market operations. George, who takes over from Robin Leigh-Pemberton in less than three months, wants to make sure - whatever the political considerations - that the government sticks to its inflation target. To help him deal with the inevitable flak, he will need the help of a similarly hard-boiled colleague. Assuming Plenderleith makes it into the Bank's top layer, he will join a team which includes the new deputy governor Rupert Pennant-Rea, 47, chief economist Mervyn King, 45, international supremo Andrew Crockett, 50, and banking supervisor Brian Quinn, 56. Coleby, who joined the Bank in 1961, will be missed at Threadneedle Street for his erudite approach to economic affairs and a keen interest in choral singing. He has often brushed with George about the finer points of monetary policy - a tendency that has not always found favour with the new governor.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Medeva spends Dollars 77m on springboard into US MEDEVA, the fast-growing UK pharmaceutical group, yesterday announced its first US acquisition. It is paying Dollars 77m, or Pounds 44.9m, for MD Pharmaceutical, a specialised manufacturer of generic drugs based in Santa Ana, California. The acquisition will be funded by an issue of shares through an open offer to Medeva shareholders, underwritten by Lazard Brothers. MD, which is privately owned, operates in a highly profitable niche of the generic (off-patent) drugs market in the US. Its 1990 pre-tax profits were Dollars 8.3m (Dollars 5.7m) on turnover of Dollars 15.5m (Dollars 12.6m). Sales in 1991 are likely to be close to Dollars 20m. Some 80 per cent of MD's turnover comes from methylphenidate, a prescription-only stimulant used to treat both narcolepsy (sleeping sickness) in adults and - paradoxically - hyperactivity in children. As a drug subject to abuse, methylphenidate is controlled by the Drug Enforcement Agency and MD is one of only two companies permitted to make it. MD's other products include anti-histamines, anti-depressants, sedatives and stimulants. Some of these are very similar to drugs made by Medeva in the UK. Mr Bernard Taylor, Medeva chairman, said his company was buying MD both as an attractive business in its own right and because it gave Medeva a springboard to enter the US market. Medeva was formed in January 1990 through the merger of Medirace, a three-year-old research-based company, with Evans Medical, a long-established manufacturer of vaccines and generic drugs. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m on sales of Pounds 53m - 85 per cent in the UK. The market responded well to the MD deal and Medeva shares closed up 3p at 120p.</p>

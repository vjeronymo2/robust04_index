			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS CLEARED IN INFANT GIRL'S NEAR-DROWNING  </P> <P> Diana DeArmond and her husband have been cleared but their family's life is  still suffering in the wake of their arrest by La Habra police last week on  suspicion of felony child endangerment after their 18-month-old daughter,  Elizabeth, nearly drowned in a bathtub.  </P> <P> Although the DeArmonds have been cleared by the Orange County district  attorney's office, the 22-year-old mother said her husband, Jimmy, 26, has lost  his job as a roofer because of the arrest. She said she also suffers nightmares  now.  </P> <P> "It's been bad enough dealing with the accident," Diana DeArmond said in an  interview Wednesday. "I thought she was dead. They (police) treated me like a  common criminal."  </P> <P> Police arrested the DeArmonds on July 18 after Diana DeArmond had found  Elizabeth floating face down in bath water about 7:30 p.m. The girl had been  taking a bath with her 2 1/2-year-old sister, Heather. After police were  called, Elizabeth was taken to Brea Community Hospital and then to Children's  Hospital of Orange County, where she initially was listed in critical  condition. Heather was taken from her parents and placed under protective  custody at Orangewood Children's Home in Orange.  </P> <P> After their arrest, the DeArmonds were taken to County Jail. They were released  the next day. The two girls were also released to their parents' custody  Friday.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Nat Glover said the incident was an "unfortunate accident."  </P> <P> Glover said the district attorney's office decided Tuesday the facts of the  incident did not support criminal prosecution of the couple.  </P> <P> La Habra Police Lt. Terry Rammell said that statements made by the DeArmonds  and the condition of the younger child prompted Officer Chris Koelber to arrest  the couple.  </P> <P> "The arresting officer acted appropriately under the circumstances," Rammell  said.  </P> <P> Rammell said Diana DeArmond had told Koelber that she had left the children  unattended for several minutes. But she says the girls had been in the tub for  10 minutes and that she had left the bathroom only to get diapers, towels and  their pajamas in the next room.  </P> <P> "The police tried to make it seem like I made them (the girls) take a bath to  get rid of them," DeArmond said. "I did not leave my kids unattended."  </P> <P> DeArmond says she and her family are now trying to recover from the incident.  The family will attend crisis counseling provided by the County Social Services  Agency, she said.  </P> <P> "I was away from my kids for two nights and I couldn't sleep without them,"  DeArmond said. "I'm happy this is all over."  </P></p>

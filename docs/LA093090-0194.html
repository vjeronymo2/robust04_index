			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVERS TRY TO WEIGH SOUTER ROLE;  </P> <P> LAW: THE NEW JUSTICE COULD SOLIDIFY THE HIGH COURT'S CONSERVATIVE BLOC OR  FOLLOW A MORE MODERATE COURSE. UPCOMING CASES MAY PROVIDE SOME CLUES.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court opens its fall term Monday facing a looming question: Will it  finally have a true conservative majority?  </P> <P> For the first time since 1956, the justices will take the bench without William  J. Brennan Jr., the architect of the liberal court that a generation of  Americans came to know. It was a court that promoted school desegregation,  abolished school prayer, protected a woman's right to choose abortion, insisted  on a strict separation of church and state and upheld job policies that gave an  edge to blacks and other minorities.  </P> <P> To his young clerks, Brennan held up his hand, fingers spread, to explain his  formula: "All you need here is five votes," he would say.  </P> <P> But in recent years, as a procession of Republican appointees came to the  court, Brennan had more and more trouble finding five votes. Indeed, since  1988, with the arrival of President Ronald Reagan's third appointee -- Anthony  M. Kennedy -- it has been Brennan's conservative rival, Chief Justice William  H. Rehnquist, who has generally enjoyed a five-vote majority.  </P> <P> Now -- by mid-October, barring any unexpected developments -- 51-year-old David  H. Souter will join the court as its ninth justice, and some analysts are  saying Rehnquist should then have no trouble finding five votes to mold a  solidly conservative coalition. (The Senate is expected to approve Souter's  nomination this week.)  </P> <P> Already, Rehnquist has used his new majority to help press the goals of the  court's conservative revolution, narrowing the impact of anti-discrimination  laws and giving states more authority to limit abortion. But at times, the  rightward push has been sidetracked -- when Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and  Byron R. White have either refused to go along with sweeping Rehnquist opinions  or even switched sides to join with Brennan.  </P> <P> On June 27, for example, the 84-year-old Brennan, speaking in a weak, gravelly  voice, read his final opinion -- a 5-4 ruling upholding a federal policy that  gave blacks, minorities and women a slight preference in seeking broadcast  licenses. Without explanation, White had joined in the Brennan opinion.  Rehnquist, for his part, glared straight ahead.  </P> <P> Now, however, that sort of scene is not likely to be repeated. With Souter's  support, Rehnquist figures to have four -- or perhaps even five -- justices on  his side in the most contentious cases. And there is no compelling leader, like  Brennan, to help piece together a winning five-vote coalition for the court's  rapidly shrinking liberal bloc.  </P> <P> With Souter's support in the coming term, the Rehnquist court could call a halt  to busing for school desegregation, forbid doctors from telling needy pregnant  women about abortion and give states the authority to send drug users to prison  for life.  </P> <P> By the end of the term, the court might also face a direct challenge to the Roe  vs. Wade ruling on abortion. If Souter sides with Rehnquist, the constitutional  right to abortion will probably be wiped off the books.  </P> <P> But that may not prove as predictable as some critics have suggested. Indeed,  Souter's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee raised some serious  doubts as to how reliably Rehnquist will be able to count on the New Hampshire  jurist.  </P> <P> Staffers on the Judiciary Committee dubbed Souter's performance a "confirmation  surprise." They had spent weeks reading Souter's unswervingly conservative  writings as a New Hampshire attorney and judge, only to hear him testify to  moderate -- even liberal -- views on constitutional issues.  </P> <P> Law professors who closely follow the Supreme Court say they are perplexed: Is  Souter a conservative who will dutifully support the Rehnquist philosophy, or  is he a closet moderate who will occasionally follow the liberal path Brennan  laid down?  </P> <P> University of Minnesota law professor Daniel Farber, himself a former Supreme  Court clerk, says the New Hampshire judge sounded "somewhat like a Lewis  Powell" -- referring to the former justice from Virginia, who established a  conservative record on crime but often voted with the liberals on civil rights  and civil liberties cases. Farber predicts Souter "may be willing to play an  active role in defending individual rights."  </P> <P> But Georgetown University law professor Thomas Krattenmaker argues that Souter  was appointed only because he had a faithfully conservative record in New  Hampshire. "I wouldn't take the transcript of those hearings all that  seriously," he cautioned.  </P> <P> Added Louis M. Seidman, a colleague at Georgetown: "There must be a tremendous  temptation to go up there and say things that people want to hear."  </P> <P> Seidman and other skeptics point to Justice Kennedy's example. During his  confirmation hearings in 1987, Kennedy told senators he supported a right to  privacy, had an "open mind" on the abortion issue, saw firsthand the value of  affirmative action and believed court precedents were entitled to "very great  weight." But, after being confirmed unanimously, Kennedy has voted uniformly  with the court's conservatives, including in their efforts to overturn the  right to abortion and to outlaw affirmative action.  </P> <P> During Senate hearings earlier this month, Souter displayed a thoughtful tone  and a thorough knowledge of the law. But he left unanswered how he will vote on  close cases involving abortion, civil rights, crime and the death penalty --  questions that this coming court term almost certainly will be called on to  answer.  </P> <P> Here are a few of the major cases likely to come before the court this term:  </P> <P> SEGREGATION: When can a school board end its mandatory desegregation effort? In  1968, the court ruled that legally segregated school districts had a duty to  desegregate and to wipe out all "vestiges" of discrimination. But the justices  still have not made clear when, or if, that duty comes to an end. About 500  school districts are still under court control, the Justice Department says.  </P> <P> The Oklahoma City school district was found guilty of segregation in 1971, and  a federal judge ordered the busing of students as a remedy. Six years later,  the judge said the school system had fully complied with his order and  terminated all constraints. But last year, an appeals court in Denver ruled  that the school board may not go back to a neighborhood-school plan because  doing so would resegregate its elementary schools.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Oklahoma City, backed by the Bush Administration, say the school  board's legal duty has ended. But the Legal Defense Fund of the National Assn.  for the Advancement of Colored People argues that the board has a continuing  duty to maintain desegregated schools. The case of the Board of Education of  Oklahoma City vs. Dowell will be argued Tuesday. Souter will probably miss the  argument, so he will not get a chance to vote on the case unless the justices  split 4 to 4. In that event, the court would be expected to order new oral  arguments.  </P> <P> ABORTION: Can the Bush Administration insist that doctors in federally funded  family planning clinics not discuss abortion with low-income pregnant women?  Each year, about 5 million women and girls go to subsidized clinics for medical  checkups and for information about contraception and pregnancy.  </P> <P> By law, these clinics may not use federal funds for abortion. Two years ago,  however, the Reagan Administration issued strict new rules forbidding doctors  from referring their patients to abortion facilities -- or even telling them  about abortion.  </P> <P> Those regulations, which have been kept on hold, are being challenged in the  Supreme Court as an unconstitutional infringement on the free speech rights of  doctors and the abortion rights of women. Lawyers for the Bush Administration  counter that the government has a right to have a say in how its money is spent  and to require that these doctors "value childbirth over abortion." The case of  Rust vs. Sullivan will be heard on Oct. 30.  </P> <P> SEX DISCRIMINATION: Can a company exclude women from dangerous jobs to protect  a potential fetus? The Johnson Controls Co., a battery manufacturer based in  Milwaukee, forbids women up to age 50 from holding jobs in its factories  because they are likely to be exposed to lead. The company says this "fetal  protection policy" is justified because it protects potential unborn children.  An appeals court in Chicago agreed.  </P> <P> But lawyers for the women say it is a "female-exclusion" policy that blatantly  violates federal laws against sex discrimination. If the policy is upheld, they  say, up to 20 million jobs could be closed to women because of potential danger  to their offspring. The case of International Union vs. Johnson Controls will  be heard Oct. 10. (Regardless of how the court rules, the fetal protection  policy is illegal in California under state anti-discrimination laws.)  </P> <P> DRUGS: Can a state send a first-time drug offender to prison for life without  the possibility of parole?  </P> <P> Michigan did just that to Ronald Harmelin after his car was stopped in 1986 and  he was found to be carrying about 1 1/2 pounds of cocaine. A new Michigan drug  law -- said to be the nation's stiffest -- requires judges to impose a life  prison term for those convicted of possessing such a large amount of cocaine.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union are challenging the law as  "cruel and unusual punishment," arguing that the sentence is grossly  disproportionate to the crime. The case of Harmelin vs. Michigan will be heard  Nov. 5 and will test whether the court will put any constitutional limits on  the new wave of anti-drug laws.  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY: Can a state force a Death Row inmate to take anti-psychotic  drugs so it can execute him?  </P> <P> In 1986, the high court said an insane inmate may not be put to death. Michael  Perry, a Death Row inmate in Louisiana, is psychotic. Doctors say his insanity  can be treated with medication. State prison officials want to medicate Perry  forcibly so he may be executed.  </P> <P> But lawyers for Perry are challenging this move, contending that the  Constitution does not allow a person to be forcibly medicated so he can be  executed. The case of Perry vs. Louisiana will be heard Tuesday and will test  how far the court will go in upholding a state's administration of the death  penalty.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister acknowledged today that the  Tories had "very poor results" in a very low poll in the  European election.    Giving what is believed to be the first news conference in  the garden of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister said that  two-thirds of the electorate simply did not bother to vote and  the turnout in Britain and in other EU [European Union]  countries was "frankly derisory."    But he insisted: "I intend to stick to what I set out to do  because I passionately believe it is in the long-term benefit of  this country."    He also promised that with the co-operation of the  opposition  parties the Government hoped to make progress on reforming the  way the House of Commons conducted its business before the  summer recess.    The Prime Minister, speaking in warm sunshine, went through  the Government's programme both implemented and planned.    He said the results, although poor, were a good deal better  than almost anybody had predicted. "The opinion polls have been  discredited again," he said. "It has been clear for some years  that many people are simply not frank when asked questions by  opinion pollsters. I expect they resent the prying nature of  the questions."    He added: "It is apparent that many people are still both  angry and bruised as a result of the recession. That has  happened here in the UK as it has happened right across Europe."    He said that governing parties in Denmark, France, Greece,  Ireland, Spain and Portugal had all enjoyed a smaller share of  the vote than in their last general elections.    "In the United Kingdom we are firmly back into growth but  that is clearly not yet the general perception of the public.  Many people simply declined to vote on this occasion."    Mr Major: "`Not this time' was the frequent message on the  doorstep."    He said there was irritation with all politicians, certainly  directed at the Government.    The elections were held at a time uniquely favourable to the  Labour Party. In an apparent reference to the death of Labour  leader John Smith, he said some of the reasons were sad, which  everyone understood.    Describing the failure of the Liberals to make any advances,  Mr Major said: "We are back into the politics of clear choice.  The only alternative to a Conservative government is a Labour  government. Any other choice is a good spoiler but unreal.    "We are now back into economic growth and this is going to  continue. I am confident we will meet our growth forecasts. We  have the lowest inflation since the 1960s and I am confident we  will meet inflation targets. Unemployment has fallen  consistently and I am confident that will go on."    Mr Major: "We will continue to pursue long-term policies  that  we believe will lead to success for this country."    Asked about a leadership challenge, the Prime Minister  declared: "I am still here. We have a mechanism if people wish  to challenge in the autumn -- that's a matter for them. I don't  expect one. I will be here waiting for it if there is one. I  will beat it and I will be here through and through the general  election."    Mr Major went on to claim that Labour had shown they would  prefer to spend people's money themselves than to cut taxes.  But he said of the Tory Party: "If and when it is prudent to  cut taxes in the future, our instinct will be to cut them. I  would rather let people decide for themselves how to spend their  money than we should decide on their behalf."    Questioned over claims by some MPs that the Tory European  manifesto had been too Euro sceptic, Mr Major said: "I am not  bowing either to the Euro enthusiasts or the Euro sceptics. I  am saying and doing precisely what I believe is right for  Europe."    On a Cabinet reshuffle, Mr Major said: "There will be one.  It isn't imminent. I think there are appropriate times to hold  a reshuffle both in terms of good management and in terms of man  management."    Asked by one reporter whether he had at any time during the  European election campaign considered resigning, Mr Major  replied confidently: "The question didn't cross my mind."    Mr Major said governments across Europe had experienced a  "mid-term dip in popularity" and a general election could be up  to three years away in the UK. People tended to "protest less  and move back to their natural home" as a general election  approached.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Russian armed forces have very great problems,  being short of both staff and equipment, according to a  so-called analysis of the surrounding world which the Swedish  military intelligence and security service presented today.  Exercises in the Russian armed forces have come to an almost  total halt, says Colonel Erik Rosander.    [Begin recording] [Rosander] There is a very low degree of  exercises in the units, a very small time set aside for pilots  to fly, a low exercise capacity among naval units, but a high  degree of exercises for the highest leadership organizations.  Thus, the staff service is well trained but the units receive  no training.    [Reporter] Can one talk about a tendency toward  disintegration in the armed forces?    [Rosander] No, I don't think one should do that. But one  could speak of a state of weakness owing to the lack of money  and lack of personnel.    [Reporter] How long a period of armament do you reckon is  necessary before Russian units can be deployed against a  potential enemy outside the former USSR?    [Rosander] If they have the economic distribution which  prevails at present, with 6-7 percent of GNP allocated to  military defense, I would think that it will take a considerable  time, and by that I mean in the 10-15-year perspective. But if  there is reprioritization and, above all, if the economy can be  put into shape, it may be quicker, of course. But the Swedish  defense will always have very good advance warning before there  may be any possible Russian threats. That is our assessment  now. [end recording]    [Reporter] Last year, the Russian armed forces commanded  more  than 1.2 million men. That meant that they were 1 million  soldiers short. Many units had no conscripts at all and in  addition there was a shortage of young officers. The exception  is the airborne troops who are still functioning as elite units.  The report also notes that a militarily weakened Russia, which  no longer has the capacity to counter external threats with  conventioned armed forces, relies to a greater extent than  before on strategic nuclear arms.    The current openness displayed by Russia makes it easier  than  before to gain reliable intelligence, says Erik Rosander.    [Begin recording] [Rosander] You can travel freely, you can  move freely, you can visit ports, naval bases, even naval yards.  As I have said before, you can even make a tourist trip to the  Murmansk region which was unthinkable before the coup, or before  the collapse.    [Reporter] Do you judge the information now available from  open sources as credible?    [Rosander] On the whole, we think so. It corresponds well  with the basic data we had before. One can draw analyses from  the changes and try to assess the information. It is largely  consistent. [end recording]</p>

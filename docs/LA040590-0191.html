			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> MCCOLL DUMP PLAN IS REJECTED BY EPA  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it will hold to its  decision to rid the abandoned McColl dump of tons of toxic waste by burning it,  despite a renewed call by a coalition of oil companies to entomb the hazardous  compounds at the eight-acre site.  </P> <P> "Thermal destruction of the McColl waste is not a negotiable issue," EPA  spokesman Terry Wilson said. "Congress has mandated we find a permanent  solution for hazardous dumps like McColl, and leaving waste in the ground is  not a permanent solution."  </P> <P> The oil companies -- identified by federal officials as the parties most likely  to have been responsible for the wastes -- submitted a plan earlier this week  to leave the refinery waste and oil-drilling muds in the ground and cap the  site with a synthetic and clay cover. It is similar to a cleanup approach  proposed three years ago by the oil companies, which organized under the name  McColl Site Group.  </P> <P> In the latest proposal, the oil companies offered to pay for maintenance and  security at the site and a long-term ground water monitoring program to  determine if any toxic waste has reached underground water supplies about 250  feet below the dump. The plan also calls for stabilizing the earthen dump to  help prevent it from rupturing during a major earthquake, said Bill Duchie, a  spokesman for the oil companies.  </P> <P> "We believe the risk posed by the site is very low," Duchie said. "But as long  as the community and (EPA) feel something should be done, we believe this plan  is the most comprehensive in terms of safety."  </P> <P> But EPA's Wilson said capping the World War II-era refinery wastes at the site,  located a stone's throw from neighborhoods of expensive, single-family foothill  homes, is unacceptable. Wilson said the agency will continue testing various  methods to excavate and destroy the toxic materials through incineration. A  final decision on how to clean up the 150,000 tons of waste is not expected  until March, 1991.  </P> <P> Wilson said the agency in February asked the McColl Site Group to submit a plan  for monitoring the ground water for possible contamination after EPA officials  discovered trace amounts of petroleum-based compounds in some test wells. (So  far, no drinking water supplies have been affected.)  </P> <P> As part of the group's response, Wilson said the companies resubmitted their  original cleanup plan to contain the waste at the site, an option that would  cost an estimated $20 million to $25 million and take three to five years to  put in place.  </P> <P> On-site incineration, federal officials say, would cost about $117 million and  take four to seven years to complete.  </P> <P> Officials of the five oil companies -- Shell Oil Co., Phillips Petroleum,  Texaco,, Arco and Unocal -- say they will challenge any attempts to make them  pay for on-site incineration. Federal officials acknowledged at a recent public  hearing that the expected court fight over the cleanup costs could delay the  actual start of cleanup up to 15 years. STEVEN R. CHURM  </P></p>

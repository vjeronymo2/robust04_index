			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROSS CENSUS UNDERCOUNT IN POOR AREAS ALLEGED  </P> <P> Los Angeles' poorest communities with the greatest needs were "grossly  undercounted" by census enumerators, Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz told a  meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Monday.  </P> <P> Officials from 20 cities met to plan a strategy to convince legislators that  preliminary census figures undercounted residents in cities both large and  small, particularly in neighborhoods with low-income and minority residents.  </P> <P> The problems with the methods used to count populations were amplified in Los  Angeles and other large urban centers with significant ethnic populations,  Heinz said.  </P> <P> "Undocumented immigration into California is tremendous," Heinz said. "People  in L.A. don't live in the kind of way where you can use a mail-out, mail-back  process and have it work; a lot of our city doesn't speak English."  </P> <P> Fear of overcrowding and immigration laws also deters residents from filling  out the form, she said, adding, "People don't believe it is confidential."  </P> <P> The complaints will be voiced today before the House Post Office and Civil  Service subcommittee on census and population by mayors from Chicago,  Baltimore, Denver, Brownsville, Tex.; Winston-Salem, N.C., and Meridian, Miss.  The cities hope to win congressional support for adjusting the 1990 population  figures. However, the final decision on whether to revise the count rests with  Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, who has until next July 15 to  decide.  </P> <P> Conference participants agreed that in attempting to persuade the  Administration to adjust the figures, cities should document any measures that  they took to aid their local census bureau in counting residents, particularly  when the information conflicts with preliminary census counts.  </P> <P> For example, in Los Angeles sanitation workers wrote down the address of each  house in 400 randomly selected city blocks. Their numbers showed 4.5% more  housing units than were reported in preliminary census numbers, Heinz said. In  another study, after counting the number of idle gas meters and examining rent  stabilization figures, city workers concluded that vacancy rates in certain  neighborhoods were only half that recorded in the preliminary census, Heinz  said.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau's preliminary figures put Los Angeles' population at 3.42  million -- up 15% from 1980. However, the city claims that at least 49,513  dwellings were not counted, which could increase the city's population count by  123,783.  </P> <P> The mayors also will tell the subcommittee that census officials are failing to  give adequate feedback on whether they are incorporating the data provided by  cities in their post-census studies.  </P> <P> Post-census studies conducted by officials in 1980 showed a 4.65% undercount in  Los Angeles, but the corrected figures were not incorporated into the city's  population total. Since 1990 base figures are based on the previous decade's  census, the preliminary figures are too low even if mistakes in counting were  not a factor, Heinz contended.  </P> <P> In 1986, East Los Angeles was a test area for the census. After a post-census  enumeration study was conducted, significant undercounts of minority groups  were revealed: almost 10% of the Latino community was missed, 7% of the Asian  population was overlooked, and 9% of African-Americans were not counted, Heinz  said.  </P> <P> By knowing how officials used the post-census data, cities could decide whether  to demand an increase in the current 2% limit on the number of housing units  that cities can challenge, the conference concluded.  </P> <P> The mayors will also ask the census subcommittee to move up to April 1, from  the current July 15 date, Mosbacher's deadline for announcing whether the  census figures will be adjusted nationwide.  </P> <P> Many city's laws require them to redistrict before July 15, 1991, which means  that the newly drawn districts will not reflect the latest population figures,  the mayoral representatives said.  </P></p>

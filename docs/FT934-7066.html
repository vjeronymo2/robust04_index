			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Small businesses urge more tax aid A successor to the Business Expansion Scheme that would give a tax incentive for family members as well as business 'angels' to invest in small companies, is urged today by the Small Business Bureau, a Tory party lobby group. In a paper to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the bureau argues for a scheme to encourage investment in unquoted manufacturers. The proposed Manufacturing Expansion Scheme would entitle individual investors to a maximum tax relief each year on investments up to Pounds 250,000, for a minimum of five years.</p>

			<p>Combined   Offensive: Commander `Dismissed'   <F P=102> 94AF0166C Algiers LIBERTE in French 29 Mar 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> 94AF0166C </F> <F P=104>  Algiers LIBERTE </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D.A.: "Combined Forces in Action"] </F>   [Text] An offensive by the combined forces of the security  services--chiefly the Army--is now being visibly confirmed in  the field. Just about everywhere, but especially in the zones  most affected by terrorism (Batna, Lakhdaria, Jijel, Bel Abbes,  Blida, Constantine, and so on), those forces are currently  applying very strong pressure. According to our sources, that  pressure is making itself clearly felt in the pockets of  terrorism thanks to a general redeployment using every means  including aviation, helicopters, and semiheavy weapons.    In recent days, for example, a large contingent of ANP  [People's National Army] special forces occupied the Aures  Mountains, where they wiped out a great many escapees from  Lambese. Those same special forces have energetically gotten the  situation under control over vast areas, particularly around  Ksar El Boukhari, Medea, Ain Defla, Chlef, and Blida, which have  literally been gone over with a fine-tooth comb. It should be  pointed out that the Army's special forces consist of paratroops  from the Biskra Airborne School. They are seasoned elite troops,  one battalion of which can easily rival the equivalent of 10  conventional armed battalions.    The same sources say that the merciless counteroffensive  being conducted by the combined forces actually began the very  next day after the march on 22 March. But the permanent presence  of the state and the organization in stages of general  offensives in the field are in fact the result of decisions made  at meetings by the Army High Command several weeks ago, as  reported by our newspaper around the end of Ramadan.    What seems completely new in the antiterrorist struggle is  the fact that now, as our sources point out, the security forces  are using proven methods for dismantling armed groups. It will  be noted, for example, that false roadblocks have been taken by  surprise and their perpetrators killed thanks to infiltration by  the security services, whose members mix with the public as  ordinary bus passengers.    Tracking down terrorists has become a matter of seconds, so  to speak, for the ANP special forces in simultaneous action with  the police and the Gendarmerie. General Betchine's recent  appointment as minister-adviser to the office of the president  means, naturally, that Betchine is responsible in particular for  coordination of the security services at the highest level in  that simultaneous action.    Especially since Gen. Betchine has had a long career in the  ANP and, before that, in the ALN [National Liberation Army].  Besides being perfectly aware of what is going on, he is also  known as a hard-liner and an intransigent nationalist who was  unhesitatingly among the few key figures to tell Chadli  Bendjedid directly that he should not legalize the FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front].    In what is apparently a new direction being taken in  antiterrorist action, this regaining of control over the  security situation also relies on active participation by the  public.    Feeling concerned, citizens have recently stepped in by  reporting the exact layout of the land and of hiding places  known to them as places where terrorists could be taking refuge.  Significant results have thus been achieved in this  antiterrorist struggle, both in the bush and in the cities, and  it seems that the official figures on the casualties suffered by  terrorism are far from reflecting reality. Apparently they  reflect partial counts, with the correct figures being  considerably higher.    The fact remains that this operation to regain control has  given rise to news reports of all kinds. In Mitidja, for  example, on the day after the "curfew" imposed by the  terrorists, there was a persistent rumor to the effect that the  commander of the 1st Military Region had been dismissed because  a garrison city (29 barracks) like Blida had inexplicably fallen  into the hands of the terrorists.    That report has been neither denied nor confirmed, although  it now seems certain that Blida and its region are completely  under control from the security standpoint. In other words,  communication is still not the government's strong point.</p>

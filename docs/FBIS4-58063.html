			<p>BFN     [Text] Within the framework of contacts being made to  contain the situation set off by influential [mutanaffidah]  military forces in the General People's Congress on 27 April in  the area of 'Imran, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman  of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] Central Committee, continued contacts with  a number of his brother kings and presidents of Arab states.  This evening he spoke on the telephone with the custodian of  the two holy places, His Majesty King Fahd Bin 'Abd-al-'Aziz al  Sa'ud, the king of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, His Excellency  President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the president of the Arab  Republic of Egypt, and His Excellency Colonel Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the 1st of September Revolution.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid briefed the kings and presidents  on  the latest developments in the Yemeni arena, in light of the  massing of troops and reinforcements by these forces, and the  pursuit of soldiers of the 3d Armored Brigade in the mountains  and areas close to 'Imran, as well as the treatment of the  brigade's wounded as POW's in their own homeland.    He clarified that these forces are pushing the country into  the inferno of a destructive civil war. He asked his brothers  the kings and presidents to attempt to prevent this from  happening, and to lessen the impact of the pschological and  physical pressures from which the wounded are suffering.</p>

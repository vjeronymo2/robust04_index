			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bertelsmann 16% ahead but shuns bid for Paramount BERTELSMANN, the German media group, has denied any intention to bid for Paramount, the Hollywood-based film group, after reporting a 16 per cent increase in net profit for the year ended June. But the company said it was continuing discussions with Paramount and with other US media groups with a view to smaller acquisitions in individual divisions. The privately-owned German group had been rumoured as a potential buyer for Paramount because of its healthy financial position and its desire to expand in the electronic media field. The group has repaid all its debt and has accumulated liquid funds totalling DM425m. Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said Paramount was 'too expensive' and that such a 'grandiose investment was beyond imagination'. He stressed that it would be incompatible with Bertelsmann's conservative investment approach. Group operating profits for the year grew by 20 per cent to DM1.43bn on sales 6.5 per cent higher at DM17bn. Net income was DM660m. Bertelsmann achieved its highest growth in its music division which includes the Arista Records company of the US. Sales for the division, which accounts for a third of total, turnover rose 13 per cent to DM4.42bn. Gruner + Jahr, the second-largest division which comprises newspapers and magazines, recorded a 4 per cent rise in sales to DM3.75bn. Book clubs, with 23m subscribers worldwide, continued to show good results. Sales of the printing and manufacturing division were down 3 per cent to DM2.99bn, mainly due to a fall in the price of paper. In electronic media, gratifying results came from RTL, the largest private channel in Germany. But Vox, the private television venture featuring a mix of news and general programmes and launched at the beginning of the year was disappointing. A new design for Vox is planned for November. Premiere, the only pay-TV channel in Germany, was due to break even this autumn, the company said. Bertelsmann stressed it had achieved particularly good results in the US with Bantam Doubleday Dell, the publishing group reporting profits for the year. Mr Wossner said the current business year would be more difficult because of the general recession, but results similar to those recorded in 1992-93 could be expected.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Life becomes risk free Sir, In recent days you have carried a number of suggestions for the government to expand its underwriting activities - for example, in supporting the tourist industry, insuring against terrorism, nationalising certain debts, covering pension scheme losses, and culminating in Mr Pritchard's suggestion (Letters, November 26) in issuing wage linked securities. These all sound like wonderful ways of taking risk out of our lives, and Mr Pritchard's suggestion should be particularly cheap - the one certain outcome would be that the historical outperformance of wages over prices would move very sharply into reverse. Terry Arthur, 23 St Mary's Street, Stamford, Lincs PE9 2DG</p>

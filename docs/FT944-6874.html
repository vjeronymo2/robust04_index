			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / MPs seek views of ministers' energy experts A committee of MPs is seeking advice from a government-appointed panel of experts on next year's flotation of the National Grid and other topical energy matters. The Commons trade and industry committee has asked for the views of the government's Energy Advisory Panel on clean-coal technology, competitiveness in the electricity generation and supply sectors, and the National Grid. It has asked the panel to respond by the end of March. The committee's move is novel because the panel was set up to advise ministers. The Department of Trade and Industry said last week that the question of whether the panel could advise other people had never been raised. If it was, it would be considered, the department said. The National Grid, the power transmission company in England and Wales, which is owned by the regional electricity companies, is expected to be floated on the London Stock Exchange next summer. The flotation price could be as high as Pounds 5bn. The committee has asked for the panel's views on what consequences the flotation will have and how the proceeds should be distributed. The 16-member panel, which was announced in last year's coal white paper, was set up to advise on the 'interpretation' of information in the government's annual energy report and its implications for future market developments.' Members of the panel include executives from the energy sector, conservationists, academics and representatives of trade union and consumer interests. The regional electricity companies are discussing flotation plans with the government, which holds a golden share in the National Grid, and are likely to announce details within the next few months. The flotation is likely to take the form of a demerger whereby shareholders in the regional companies would be given new shares in the Grid. The companies are expected to load the Grid with debt of about Pounds 750m to help pay a Pounds 1bn tax bill and consumer rebates of more than Pounds 200m.</p>

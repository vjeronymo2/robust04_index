The procuratorial officers  performing this mission were besieged for nine hours and were  beaten, while eight police cars were smashed.    At around 1700 on the afternoon of 5 November 1993, a team  of  10 officers from Handan's Wuan People's Procuratorate in Hebei  traveled in three police cars to Shahe, Xingtai to arrest the  accused, Hao Benliang, according to law and to search his house.  Hao Benliang was the deputy director and accountant of a  private ore-dressing plant in Wuan's Shimen village. In doing  business with Hao Xiangxian, a Shimen villager who was also  director of the ore- dressing plant, Hao Beiliang's involvement  in tax evasion was affirmed. Hao Xiangxian was arrested on 1  November, but Hao Benliang escaped.    The officers of the Wuan People's Procuratorate searched Hao  Benliang's house in accordance with legal procedures, finding  some bills and 12,000 yuan in cash. At that moment, Hao  Benliang's son threatened the officers with two knives. Hao's  daughter tore up the bills and cash that had been discovered,  which made it difficult for the search to proceed. The Wuan  procuratorial officers decided to leave. Hao's wife, son, and  daughter stopped them and smashed two police cars, which further  caused a further deterioration in the situation. The  procuratorial officers then decided to take Hao's wife to the  office of the Wuan People's Procuratorate.    At 1830, a police car and four policemen were besieged by  villagers who were unaware of the truth. Hao Benliang's son  pulled two policemen out of their car, beating, kicking, and  handcuffing them. When the officers were taken to the courtyard  of the village committee, Hao's son and son-in-law continued to  beat the two officers until they broke their batons. At around  2300, the two officers were gagged and blindfolded, and were  driven into the wilderness, where they were beaten for four  hours, resulting in serious injuries.    During this period, the leaders of the Wuan People's  Procuratorate led more than 30 officers to the village in six  police cars. The following announcement was made over loud  speakers: "All villagers: Officers of the Wuan People's  Procuratorate have come. Come out immediately!" At that moment,  all the officers were besieged by hundreds of villagers. The  head and political instructor of the village police station  ordered that the road be blocked with a police car and with a  bulldozer from a nearby ore- dressing plant. As he stopped the  procuratorial officers, the six police cars were damaged. He  aimed his pistol at the procuratorial officers and said: "All  officers must get out and no one may leave!" The political  commissar of the Shahe Public Security Bureau and a deputy chief  of the city's procuratorate rushed to the scene. They decided to  move the vehicles to the police station, which avoided further  damages.    To quell the incident as early as possible, Hao Benliang's  wife was sent back to the village and the two detained officers  were released, thanks to the proposals made by the Shahe Public  Security Bureau and Procuratorate. It was already 0700 the next  morning. The released officers were sent immediately to the  Handan Hospital for treatment.    Public opinion here paid close attention to this incident,  believing that the practice of a defendant's relatives detaining  and beating procuratorial officers, smashing cars, and inciting  mass trouble constituted a serious crime of hindering a public  mission, which had an adverse influence. In the struggle to  sternly attack serious economic and other crime, it is  absolutely necessary to seriously handle and punish people who  are involved in inciting trouble.</p>

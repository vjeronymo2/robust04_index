The Supreme Procuratorate has set up a  "Corruption Elimination Supervisory Team;" procuratorate offices  in every jurisdiction have set up "corruption elimination  enforcement teams;" and "clean government offices" are being  studied.    Does the advent of these new "teams" and "cases," and even  "offices," in the "corruption elimination system" truly help  eliminate corruption? Just what problems have arisen in this  system?    Institutionally speaking, the main reason for no effective  action in the elimination of corruption is that in the overall  corruption case adjudication process, the investigation and  judicial organs receive too much "political" interference." This  makes it very difficult for them to handle matters independently  according to law.    [passage omitted] Thus, even though investigative organs  make  a great effort to gather evidence, they lack the authority to  decide whether a case is forwarded to the local procuratorial  office. Although the Investigation Bureau is under the Ministry  of Justice, "daddy is the Ministry of Justice and mommy is the  National Security Bureau," a senior investigator said. "Big  cases," in particular, must be presented to an "advisory  unit"--the National Security Bureau -- which considers "what  effect the handling of a big case will have on social stability"  before deciding whether or not to forward it to a procuratorial  office. The National Security Bureau is, in turn, subject to the  president's direction. Some "big cases" about which there has  been speculation in the media, such as the "Eighteen Bids," are  seemingly quiescent now. Should these "big cases" be tried?  "Whether they are tried depends on the decision of higher  authority. They are not forwarded for prosecution on the basis  of evidence obtained," said an investigator. "Whether a big case  is tried depends on the "determination of higher ups."    After cases are "filtered" by the Investigation Bureau, they  are forwarded to the local procuratorate where they face another  "filtering." This is because, even if the procuratorial officer  in charge feels evidence is sufficient to prosecute, in  practice, the principal procuratorial officer and the procurator  "jointly consider" the case, and it is "considered level by  level" before a final decision is made. Some years ago when Kao  Hsin-wu was a low level procuratorial officer, once he  determined that the evidence was sufficient, Wu T'ien-hui, who  was director of the Judicial Conduct and Discipline Department,  was immediately detained and prosecuted in a bribery case  without notification to higher authority. For this Kao incurred  criticism for not respecting judicial ethics, aruption" as a  result of the opposition party's clamor to get something done.

For this Kao incurred  criticism for not respecting judicial ethics, and for failure to  observe procedures for handling cases. Had Kao Hsin-wu abided by  normal procedures for presenting the case, Wu T'ien-hui might  not have been prosecuted for bribery.    Taiwan's procuratorial institutions are not a part of the  courts, but are subordinate to the Ministry of Justice in the  administrative system. Procurators are judicial administrative  officers who must consider policies.    The declared policy of the government is to punish  corruption  severely. It was on the basis of the "corruption elimination  program" that the Supreme Procuratorate set up the "Corruption  Elimination Supervisory Team," the public procurator-general  convening these teams, which are made up of the head of the  Investigation Bureau, the head of the procurator's office, and  the administrative discipline office director. All local  procuratorial offices set up "corruption elimination execution  teams" for which the procurator is the convener and the members  include the procuratorial officer in charge, the Investigation  Department (Station) chief, and the administrative discipline  office director in the procuratorial organ. The execution teams  hold a meeting once each month. At the end of each month, they  must tabulate cases and report their adjudication to the  "supervisory team."    In reality, the holding of such team meetings only provides  the procuratorial organs a chance to exchange views. They do not  discuss individual cases. "Today it is still a matter of general  discussion about how to proceed. It is idle theorizing, not  using the time to deal with cases," a procuratorial officer in  charge said indifferently.    Since these "teams" function in such a limited way, what  would happen were a "Clean Government Office" set up to deal  with corruption? "To have a system like the one in Singapore or  Hong Kong, the first problem is to amend the law. Only if it is  geared to the law can a clean government office play a role.  Given the Legislative Yuan's present efficiency and attitude  about handling its agenda, with too many laws awaiting  formulation and amendment, I think this is a very difficult  problem," said a deputy magistrate pessimistically. " What units  to set up is a secondary consideration. The most important issue  is the determination and coordination of law enforcement  personnel," said a procuratorate officer in charge who has  handled cases for more than a decade, thereby expressing the  same view.    Even if the determination exists, there are two few judicial  personnel. When it comes to the elimination of cooperation, it  is a case of the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak for  judicial personnel.    Today, every procuratorial office and court has a  "designated" procurator and justice in charge of corruption  cases. In the view of the procurator general and the Chief  Justice, a trait they hold in common is unquestionable personal  integrity. They have enthusiasm for their work and ample  experience in handling cases. They can serve only after being  selected. Nevertheless, despite use of the term "designated",  they must handle other cases as well.    Take the greater Taipei area, for example. Each month, the  local procurator must handle between 140 and 160 cases. On  average, he must handle six cases every work day. At the end of  each month, he is under pressure to conclude cases, in addition  to which corruption case investigations take time. The  designated procurators who are able to "take the initiative, and  actively" investigate evidence are few and far between. The  difficulty is that the job "is impossible to do, but has to be  done." One procurator said with some agitation, "the number of  judicial officials on record is extremely limited, so  procurators want the Investigation Department to help out. The  number of Procuratorate personnel is decreasing rather than  increasing. There are just too few hands..." Every month and  every year the number of criminal cases mounts, but the number  of procurators and justices on record do not rise in proportion  to the number of cases. In addition, the manpower that the  Investigation Department and transferred lawyers can devote to  is consequently insufficient. All the courts and procuratorate  offices agree. People have known this for a long time. This  problem has lingered without solution for many years. It is a  perpetual thorn in the side of the judicial system.    In addition to an insufficient number of judicial personnel,  the system for selecting justices is also currently unable to  ensure the quality of legal personnel. Law officers are  generated by an examination system. If they are not versed in  the law, even the law cannot pass them, much less can it produce  officers having moral character. Examination Yuan member Ti  Tsung-ch'uan believes that testing of justices should emulate  the United States system, increasing moral character checks, and  that a system for eliminating justices should also be instituted.    Second, the provisions of the law are not clear and  punishments are not uniform. This also permits grafters to  suppose they can get away with violations. They are willing to  test the law. Current provisions for the punishment of  corruption include the criminal law's dereliction of duty  articles and a special law's "corruption punishment  regulations." If other laws contained heavier penalty  provisions, in view of the principle that "severe laws are  superior to light laws," sentences would be heavier.    However, in actual enforcement, a sentence may be light at  one time and heavy at another. The explanation that the courts  give is that sentencing depends on the strength of the evidence.  Some evidence only supports a sentence for an attempt to make  money for oneself or for others; others support a sentence for  offering bribes, and still other support a sentence for  accepting bribes. Thus, sentences vary in severity or lightness.  However, in the corruption realm, when distinctions are made as  to whether corruption consists of payment for administrative  action, the conveyance of benefits, profit for oneself, offering  bribes, or accepting bribes, even justices must consider  carefully so how much more so ordinary folk. Thus, everyone  begins to calculate his own risk. Some who are risk takers by  nature take a gamble. If they fail and receive a heavy sentence,  they chalk it off to bad luck.    Only when the provisions of the law are crystal clear will  the people be able to understand how to act.    "When Japan ruled Taiwan, major matters of justice such as  participation in government and political affairs were clearly  not accorded the people, but small matters of justice involving  the courts, taxation, and the police, the Japanese did not  withhold. Moreover, government adherence to these small matters  of justice, which affected the people most, built the people's  confidence about civil rights. No wonder that many people have  fond memories of the past," said Huang Yueh-ch'in.</p>

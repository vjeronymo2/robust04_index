			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: German bottle maker buys stake in US unit Gerresheimer Glas, the German bottle and glass container maker, yesterday announced a move into the US tubing glass market, with the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in OI Kimble FTS, part of the Owens-Illinois group, the US packaging group. The deal will more than double the turnover of Gerresheimer in tubing glass and laboratory products, continuing a steady process of diversification from its traditional manufacture of bottles for the brewing and spirits industries. No price was given for the purchase of the stake in OI Kimble, which employs about 2,000 workers, and has a turnover of some Dollars 200m both in semi-finished and finished glass tubing products. Gerresheimer, quoted on the Frankfurt stock exchange, but 51 per cent owned by Viag, the industrial conglomerate, has diversified from its core production of bottles since it was sold by Owens-Illinois in 1987. Since then it has built up a European tubing glass division with a turnover of DM200m (Dollars 118m), including Kimble Italiana and subsidiaries in the UK and France. The deal would further reduce Gerresheimer's dependence on the highly-cyclical bottle manufacturing industry. Production of bottles had fallen to between 40 per cent and 45 per cent of turnover from 75 per cent of turnover in 1987, he said. Gerresheimer has been hit by recession with turnover for the first six months of 1993 falling by 8 per cent. Its bottles division is in the red.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- A high-quality video phone  system will be in general use by about 2030 enabling people to  talk across the world as if they were conversing face to face, a  government report said Friday [10 June].    The system would be capable of two-way high-quality moving  image and voice transmission, said the 1994 white paper on  communications released by the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications. The report also predicted that  three-dimensional image communications would be possible also by  about 2030.    In the industry and business fields, the ministry forecast  that producers and consumers would be linked directly through an  information network, making the distribution process unnecessary.    The report also predicted that electronic newspapers would  make their debuts, diversifying the means of acquiring  information and revolutionizing the mass media.    The ministry also said "tele-educational" and "tele-medical"  systems would spread, bringing about a major change in the field  of education, medical treatment and administration. The  ministry also prepared a CD-ROM (compact disk-read only memory)  version of the white paper, the first of its kind in Japan. The  CD-ROM version will be offered for rent by anyone up to a month  without charge, starting in July.</p>

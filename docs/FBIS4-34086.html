			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Brazilian President Itamar Franco at the opening </F> ceremony of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de  Indias -- live; in Portuguese]    [Text] Messrs. Chiefs of State and Government, Messrs.  Foreign Ministers, Messrs. Ministers, Mr. Governor of the  Department of Bolivar, Mr. Mayor of Cartagena, Mr. Commander of  the Naval Fleet of the Atlantic, Messrs. Lawmakers, Ladies and  Gentlemen.    Messrs. Chiefs of State and Government: We are beginning the  Ibero-American conference of chiefs of state and government,  which is in its fourth year of existence, based on our mutual  appreciation and our common values, which have given rise to  this conference and which have consolidated it.    I was pleased to welcome you in 1993 in the city of  Salvador,  where I could see everyone's desires to nurture and enhance the  affinities that time and history have bequeathed to us.  Guadalajara, Madrid, Salvador, and Cartagena are stopovers in a  journey leading to a future of solidaristic interaction, heading  for peace, prosperity for our peoples, and social justice.    Commerce and integration as factors of Ibero-American  development -- the topics on this Summit's agenda -- are the  natural consequence of previous debates. Here we will analyze  the factors that condition commercial and economic development  in our nations.    The fact that everyone (?is familiar) with everyone else's  course allows debates to be frank and, above all, friendly.    In the commercial area, we strive for fair rules and for  really open markets.    We conceive of regional integration as a process that  supplements trade between the various regions of the earth. We  agree on the need to couple the efficiency that is essential for  growth with better living standards for our people.    We have a broad consensus at this summit. We are supported  by  the agreements that we reached in the past on the pressing need  for a new agenda for development, which may raise the issue to  the level of a United Nations priority.    Mr. President Cesar Gaviria: In this idyllic and  centuries-old Cartagena, we are moved by the warm hospitality of  the Colombian Government and people.    Under your competent guidance we will move forward in our  deliberations, in an innovative and constructive form.    Different yet supplemental experiences have led us to  believe  in the advantages of integration.    The European Union [EU] is a process in an advanced stage of  implementation that should be carefully studied and analyzed.    Latin American and Caribbean countries are developing their  own development programs with positive results.    Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Andean Pact, the  Central American Common Market, the Caribbean Community, the  Group of Three, and our most recent proposal, the South American  Free Trade Area, are dynamic projects for liberalization of  international trade.    We were greatly satisfied to hear the statements by Bolivia  in Colonia and by Chile in Belem do Para, seeking to join  Mercosur. These are concrete steps for creation of the South  American economic area, which we conceive of as an open, rather  than excluding, area.    In this regard, we hail the North American Free Trade  Agreement, whose evolution we are closely following. We see  NAFTA as a possible bridge between Ibero-American nations and  the large markets of the developed countries of the Americas.    The dialogue between the Rio Group and the European Union is  another route for cooperation and integration. Within this  framework, we found major and encouraging signs of a new and  more concrete approach from the EU to Latin America, an  achievement to which the dialogue we held at this forum must  have certainly contributed.    The current international situation offers new opportunities  for diplomacy. This forum is operating under auspicious  circumstances, based on our peoples' devotion to democracy and  on their leaders' commitment to improving it.    We represent a community of nations marked by its devotion  to  peace. However, the aspirations of (?tranquility) that we share  coexist with the contrasting image of exclusion and violence.    In this regard, the Ibero-American conference has tried to  contribute to the strengthening of tolerance and harmony.  Tolerance and harmony should give inspiration to the relations  between our countries.    The isolating policy of sanitary cordons no longer suits the  pluralistic and dynamic world in which we live.    Mr. President Cesar Gaviria: I would like to conclude my  speech by warmly congratulating you on your election as  secretary general of the Organization of American States, where  I am sure you will do a fine job.    I wish you success in the task that you have undertaken. I  am  now transferring to Your Excellency the direction of the work of  this Fourth Conference of Ibero-American Chiefs of State and  Government. Thank you, very much. [applause]</p>

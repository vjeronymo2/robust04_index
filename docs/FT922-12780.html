			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / An ambitious mission to mend a shattered land: Keeping the peace and arranging elections in war-torn Cambodia is one of the biggest challenges faced by the UN When Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, visits Cambodia on Friday to inspect one of the organisation's most ambitious peacekeeping operations, he will find his UN soldiers and bureaucrats confronting an unfamiliar challenge. The UN in Cambodia is burdened not with the sort of intractable international conflict to which it is accustomed in Cyprus, Lebanon or on the borders of Iraq  - for once all the foreign powers and feuding domestic factions have agreed on a peace plan. Instead, it faces the task of rebuilding a nation and turning it into a functioning democracy in just over a year. The country has suffered more than two decades of civil war encompassing the regime of the Khmer Rouge, the fanatical group responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1m Cambodians between 1975 and 1978, and the Vietnamese invasion which ended its reign of terror. Most Cambodians, from the refugee camps on the Thai border to the flattened beach resort of Kep on the south coast, are looking to the UN to resurrect their ruined land. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the thoughtful 61-year-old Japanese who heads the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), has no illusions about the enormity of the task facing him and Lt-Gen John Sanderson, his Australian military commander. They are seeking to implement the comprehensive Paris peace accord concluded last October between international powers and the four Cambodian factions: the Khmer Rouge, the Vietnamese - backed government of Mr Hun Sen, the royalists, and Mr Son Sann's Khmer People's National Liberation front. By May 1993, according to the agreement, Untac is supposed to resettle 375,000 refugees from neighbouring Thailand, disarm 450,000 soldiers and militiamen from the four main factions, and hold free elections: all this in a country where many of the inhabitants have no experience of democracy, where roads and communications are exceptionally poor, and where much of the land has been made uninhabitable by mines. 'If one was a masochist one could not wish for more,' said Mr Akashi. Moreover, Mr Akashi has yet to be guaranteed he will receive the funds he regards as necessary to do the job. He wants Dollars 1.9bn for Untac and its proposed quota of more than 20,000 soldiers and officials, and a further Dollars 900m in voluntary contributions to rebuild the country and resettle the refugees. He said he was disappointed at the delays in receiving finances. 'We (the UN) are stretched,' he said, 'and many states are more willing to make political commitments than assuring us of the means to fulfil these mandates.' Only Dollars 200m has so far been agreed for the operation, although Mr Hun Sen, prime minister in the existing Cambodian government, is said to have done a good job persuading US, Japanese and French officials of the importance of Untac during a recent tour. Aid is also available from multilateral organisations such as the Asian Development Bank and from charities. But aid workers fear that a world preoccupied with other crises, such as Yugoslavia, will forget Cambodia after the elections. 'There is a danger that the west is going to suffer Cambodia aid fatigue by then,' said an aid worker in Phnom Penh. As if the funding of its own operations were not difficult enough, Untac is being urged by Cambodians to finance the running costs of Mr Hun Sen's lame-duck administration. Aid from the old east bloc countries dried up nearly two years ago, leaving the government with few sources of finance except the printing of new banknotes. Financial shortages threaten the functioning of Mr Hun Sen's administration. The pitiful salaries of civil servants and soldiers in the provinces  - a medical worker at Kampot hospital receives about Dollars 5 a month plus allowances for rice and paraffin  - are being paid about three months late, and soldiers routinely hold up cars to extort cash. Aid agencies are hoping that at least some foreign money can be spent on maintaining basic administration, and the UN itself may be obliged to bear some of the burden. Asked what sort of role Untac would play in the government's finances, Mr Akashi said: 'It might be more extensive than we would have liked. This country faces phenomenal difficulties in the area of finance.' No less substantial are concerns over security. The UN has successfully brokered a fragile ceasefire between Khmer Rouge guerrillas and government forces around the central town of Kompong Thom. But the Khmer Rouge has been slow to fulfil its obligations under the peace accord and has continued to refuse access to areas it controls along the country's borders with Thailand and Laos. More generally, UN officials expect that many Cambodians, accustomed to a lifetime of warfare, will retain weapons in contravention of the peace agreement, and that it will be difficult to reintegrate the demobilised soldiers and guerrillas into society. The biggest challenge will be to accommodate the Khmer Rouge. Although included in the peace accord, western governments and most Cambodians are anxious to ensure the guerrilla group is excluded from power. The Khmer Rouge has tried to distance itself from its past and to promote a reformed image through claims that it now supports democracy. At the same time, its leaders appeal repeatedly to anti-Vietnamese sentiment. But few voters are likely to support the Khmer Rouge in elections, and it is assumed in Phnom Penh that the guerrilla group is biding its time in the expectation that the next government will alienate the rural majority as have previous Cambodian regimes. Already there are ominous signs: Khmer Rouge officials are seeking legitimacy by identifying themselves with the Supreme National Council (SNC)  - which includes the four Cambodian factions and which is responsible, along with the Untac, for implementing the peace plan. The group has also sought to link itself with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the country's influential former leader. The political situation throughout the country is unstable. Several politicians and human rights activists have been assassinated in mysterious circumstances, presumably on the orders of hardliners in Mr Hun Sen's government, and there are doubts as to whether Prince Sihanouk himself, chairman of the SNC, has the vision required to rebuild his country. With so much working against the UN, its mission is having to feel its way carefully. 'It's a country where the social and physical infrastructure has been almost totally destroyed,' said Mr Akashi. 'We have no illusions that Cambodia will become an exemplary democracy at the point where we leave, but at least we can lay the groundwork for Cambodian democracy in the future.' If Untac does that, it will be a remarkable achievement indeed.</p>

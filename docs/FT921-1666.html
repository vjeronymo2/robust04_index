			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown pushes education up agenda THE LIBERAL Democrats have sought to focus attention on the party's plans for a Pounds 2bn increase in education spending by hinting that it could become a condition for their support in a hung parliament. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, was meeting strategists last night to endorse the addition to the Liberal Democrats' terms for a coalition. A party political broadcast this week is being reworked. The Liberal Democrats believe their pledge to raise income tax by 1p to fund education is winning support among voters. One official said the party was determined to present its proposals with 'panache'. By setting extra education spending as a pre-condition for its support in a hung parliament, the party may raise education as an issue. Meanwhile, Mr Ashdown attacked suggestions that the Tories may forge a deal with the Ulster Unionists in the event of a hung parliament. It would be 'utterly discreditable' and would jeopardise moves towards peace in Northern Ireland. The Liberal Democrats would have nothing to do with such a deal, he said. Speaking on BBC Radio, Mr Ashdown said proportional representation at Westminster was the essential pre-requisite for his support in a hung parliament. After that, there would have to be an agreed programme. 'Essential to that programme for government will be a commitment to invest in education of the sort that we have made,' he said.</p>

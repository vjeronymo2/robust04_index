			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Sunderland gives stadium approval Sunderland councillors last night approved proposals by the city's football club for a new Pounds 70m sports, entertainment and conference centre, in spite of strong opposition from Nissan, whose Pounds 900m car plant occupies the adjacent site. The environment committee decided unanimously not to refuse outline planning permission. Because the proposal, for green belt land, is a departure from Sunderland's present development plan the application must be referred to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. A public inquiry is expected by autumn. Nissan fears the centre could block its possible expansion and that traffic would jeopardise just-in-time delivery and production methods.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Dasa warns of 600 fewer aircraft sales THE world recession in the airline industry has forced Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), part of the consortium that builds Europe's Airbus aircraft, to cut its forecasts for aircraft sales and traffic growth over the next 20 years. It lowered its estimate of medium-sized and large aircraft to be sold over the same period by 600 to 10,800. Much of the decline will be over the next three years, with a recovery only in the second half of the decade. Traffic will grow at 4.9 per cent a year over the next 20 years; last year's forecast was 5.1 per cent. The company warned in its latest world market forecast that even these figures might have to be reduced if world economies failed to recover well or fuel taxes rose or the construction of high speed train links continued, especially in Europe. Dasa estimates sale of large and medium-sized aircraft - defined as those with over 70 seats - will be worth Dollars 835bn at today's values over the next 20 years. It raised its forecasts for the share of sales to the Far East and Europe.</p>

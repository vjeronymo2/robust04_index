			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erich Hoorn: "Czech Republic Woos Western </F> Capital; 1.5 Billion From Austria"]    [Text] Vienna/Prague -- About 2,400 of the approximately  10,000 registered foreign companies (joint ventures and  100-percent subsidiaries) in the Czech Republic are Austrian,  which means that Austria occupies second place behind Germany,  Josef Altenburger, the Austrian trade delegate in Prague,  stresses.    However, there are no spectacular Austrian investments such  as Volkswagen (passenger cars) or Philip Morris (tobacco  sector). It is mainly small- and medium-sized Austrian  companies that are investing in the Czech Republic. They not  only participate in local companies there, but also build  factories from scratch. Therefore, Austria's presence in the  republic is wide-ranging both in regional terms and regarding  industrial branches, Altenburger says.  <H5>  Shift of Production </H5>   Austrian companies are shifting certain production to the  Czech Republic, because wages there are only about one-sixth of  those in Austria. However, labor productivity is also lower.  Wages differ strongly depending on sectors and regions. In  Prague there is overemployment, skilled workers are scarce.    Following coupon privatization, Austrian companies have the  opportunity for capital participation in these transformed  companies, which need capital because this kind of privatization  does not yield money for the companies. Therefore, management  is often interested in foreign capital. Generally,  participation is conducted by means of increasing capital in the  form of machinery or equipment. Foreigners can also buy company  shares from investment funds, from banks, or via the stock  exchange.    In 1993, foreigners where, however, restrained: Instead of  the expected $1.2 billion, they invested only $561 million.  According to the Czech National Bank, this is linked with the  separation from Slovakia and with the recession in the West.  Furthermore, foreigners waited for the end of the first wave of  coupon privatization in autumn.    Since 1990, $2.1 billion has been invested: Germany leads  with $641 million, followed by the United States ($572), France  ($259), Belgium ($145), and Austria with $126 million (1.5  billion schillings).    In 1993, the largest investor was the United States with  $255  million, followed by Germany ($82 million), and Austria with $55  million, which corresponded to 9.7 percent of foreign  investments.</p>

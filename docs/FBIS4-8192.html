			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- At least 10 prisoners  of Serb nationality who have been detained in a silo in Tarcin,  30 km southwest of Sarajevo, for nearly two years were killed  last night when refugees from Gorazde broke into the prison,  which is under the control of the Muslim authorities.    Serb intelligence sources say that Muslim refugees from  Gorazde, who are living in Tarcin and the nearby village of  Pazaric, had held the silo under blockade since Friday. The  refugees demanded the lynching of the detained Serbs.    The Muslim police had the situation under control until  Sunday evening when the mob broke into the prison and killed at  least 10 Serbs, using firearms and other objects.    Muslim Sarajevo radio confirmed that the incident had  happened, saying that shooting had been heard amid a totally  chaotic situation, after which -- according to the radio --  three prisoners were missing.    The radio reporter says that it is assumed that there had  been some casualties, but does not give the figure.    Nothing is known about the fate of the survivors of the  massacre, but Muslim sources claim that the police again took  control of the silo-prison.    The Serb side has been trying for 18 months now to organize  the release of over 200 prisoners from the silo on the principle  "all for all" with the Muslim authorities, and with the help of  international humanitarian organizations, but the Muslim  authorities have rejected all attempts to exchange prisoners.</p>

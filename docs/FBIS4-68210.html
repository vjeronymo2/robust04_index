Rozhkov] </F>   [Text] A mobile system developed in the United States for  receiving fuel and issuing it to subunits under field conditions  which approximate combat conditions to the maximum presently is  in the inventory of NATO armies.    As a rule, system equipment includes the following: six  Uniroyal soft rubber-fabric reservoirs with an overall capacity  of 227,100 liters (37,850 liters each);[.sup]1[/] two pump  units (each with a 1,330 liters/min feed rate); and two  separator filters (each with 1,330 liters/min capacity).    In addition, it includes a rubber-fabric pipeline 500 m long  overall for connecting equipment with each other and with the  reservoirs; adapters; valves; and distributing cocks.    The system (see figure) permits receiving (discharging) fuel  into soft reservoirs from three tanker trucks simultaneously and  issuing it from the reservoirs into tanker trucks (fueling  trucks), canisters, barrels, and vehicle fuel tanks over six  lines, and into Sealdrum soft containers over two lines.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-004L-10A>      Flow diagram of fuel receiving </FIG>     The set of equipment can be divided depending on the  situation, setting up two systems on the terrain with a capacity  of 113,500 liters each and using them for receiving and issuing  different kinds of fuel.    The set of equipment weighs 3.2 t and its volume in a form  packed for transportation is 11.3 m[.sup]3[/] (the set is  air-transportable). According to standards, it takes a team of  eight persons around 4 hours to set up or take down one system.    Rear subunits which deploy and operate the fuel receiving  and  issuing points included in fuel supply points are equipped with  such systems. Thus, a company which organizationally is part of  the supply and service battalion is the main subunit in the U.S.  Army corps logistic support area whose personnel and equipment  deploy fuel supply points. The company's structure and technical  outfitting permit it to deploy up to four supply points in the  corps logistic support area. The standard time for a team of 33  persons to deploy one is 8 hours, and to take one down it is 6-7  hours.    In addition to the receiving and issuing point, each supply  point includes a fuel storage sector (five 190,000 liter soft  reservoirs), a helicopter and ground vehicle fueling point (two  1,900 liter containers), a sector for fuel storage in barrels  and cans, and a sector for cleaning and washing containers.    The main tasks of the supply points are to transfer oil  products necessary for rear subunits of divisions and for  separate supply and service companies which supply fuel to units  and subunits not part of divisions, and to keep army corps fuel  reserves at a given level.    A division fuel supply point is established in the division  logistic support area. Its basic elements are a fuel receiving  and issuing point, a field pool of fuel tanker trucks, two  fueling points and a laboratory. It is deployed and operated by  the supply and service company, which organizationally is part  of the logistic support battalion.    Fuel receiving and issuing points included in corps and  division supply points are outfitted with mobile systems which  are deployed on the terrain, usually according to the scheme  shown in the figure.

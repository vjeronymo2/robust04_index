			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Residents of the (Nimacuyu) neighborhood in Zone 21  last Friday tried to lynch a U.S. woman whom they claimed had  stolen a child. The Attorney General's Office denied she had  kidnapped the child, disclosing that there are legal adoption  papers in an auxiliary office of the Attorney General's Office  in Coban, Alta Verapaz. Francisco Daniel Flores, delegate from  the Coban office, explained the case:    [Begin recording] [Flores] Yes, it is true. At the Coban  agency of the Attorney General's Office, we have studied the  legal adoption papers of those gringos who appeared yesterday on  television. They have complied with all the requirements  demanded by the law, and their papers are in order in our office  as well as in the court that has made the financial  investigations. The mother was summoned by our agency, and she  voluntarily turned over the little girl.    [Unidentified reporter] Who are the parents of this minor?    [Flores] I cannot remember the woman's name right now, but  she lives in the Canton Las Casas neighborhood in Coban, Alta  Verapaz. She has 12 children, and there are documents that prove  she has given up another child for adoption.    [Reporter] Did she sell her child, or was the child taken  away from her against her will?    [Flores] As guarantors of the investigations we conduct with  regard to adoption, we summoned the mother, and she testified  that she gave up the child for adoption of her own will. She  says she cannot support this child because she has too many  children. She is looking out for the child's well-being, and  therefore she prefers to give her up for adoption.    [Reporter] She did not sell the child?    [Flores] Not at all, and there are witnesses at the agency  where she said that she had given the child away as a gift and  she had not sold the child, as many people claim. I repeat, the  woman has 12 other children, and she previously gave up another  child for adoption. She cannot support the children; she cannot  buy food for them.    [Reporter] How about the U.S. woman? Who is she, and what  does she do?    [Flores] Prior to legalizing the adoption, we investigated  the dossier. We saw the dossier included authorization by the  U.S. Embassy allowing the woman to adopt the child.    [Reporter] Why was the U.S. woman interested in this minor?    [Flores] The couple has problems and cannot have babies.  They wanted to have a child, and, when the opportunity to adopt  this Guatemalan child arose, they said they wanted this child.    [Reporter] How long have they been working on this adoption?    [Flores] They have been working on this adoption for  approximately six months. They have been in Coban since last  December when they started the legal adoption paperwork.    [Reporter] How many adoption cases have you processed in  this  agency?    [Flores] This is the first adoption case I have processed in  the time that I have been working in Coban.    [Reporter] How does the father of the child feel about this?    [Flores] Unfortunately, the child is not a legitimate child,  and there is no record of who her father is. We have only  talked with the mother of the child. [end recording]</p>

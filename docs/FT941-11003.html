			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: Government Inspector' moved to Dublin - Theatre Nikolai Gogol (1809-52) wrote The Government Inspector in 1834 as a satire on corrupt and craven bureaucrats in Czarist Russia. Now at the Tricycle Theatre, the Dublin-Belfast theatre company Dubbeljoint has transplanted a new version of the play to the peaty environs of county Ulster late last century. At best it is a red-blooded bucolic show; but at worst, the Inspector palls. Gogol's classic of mistaken identity is a gift for situation comedy, ready to be filled out by Marie Jones' rejigged version; and 19th-century Ireland is a fine place for this drama of ossified class and parochial values. But what emerges on stage is more knockabout than thinkabout. A small provincial town, guilty as sin over a local beef swindle, has been tipped off about an Inspector from the capital. The provincials paddling in the peat bogs decide that a new stranger in town must be their man: 'He's incognito' - 'No he's not, he's in the hotel.' The bemused stranger catches on and milks a situation where the burghers feel obliged to laugh at his jokes and ply him with bribes of sex and money. This faux-Inspector's servant is convinced that Swift's Modest Proposal has been written into the local bye-laws and that he is living amongst cannibals. Any mention of beef sends him raving. The harsh Irish accents make Gogol's jokes sound starkly aggressive instead of lightly cynical. At the moment, everything is overdone; the squeamish provincialism James Joyce found even in Dublin is flogged to death. The actors try too hard, shout too much, and need to tone down. But there are some delights: Dan Gordon's playing of the faux-Inspector, and Eileen Pollock's (the Mayor's wife) sex-crazed delight at his arrival in her house; Mark Lambert as the troubled Mayor is a chaotic presence, oscillating between civic propriety and old-fashioned grovelling. Next time the Inspector should be a Brussels functionary or GATT investigator. Pam Brighton directs. The Tricycle Theatre (071 328 1000) until March 6</p>

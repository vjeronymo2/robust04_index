			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COUNTY CLOSURE OF WELFARE FACILITY  </P> <P> Your article on welfare (For Poor, Closure of South County Welfare Office  Spells Hardship, Sept. 29) enrages me and my colleagues! We are the  hard-working stiffs caught in the crunch, losing money, working long hours and  watching our standard of living decrease. We feel that the welfare population  of Orange County should move to San Bernardino. We bust our butts to live here,  and we do not need to hear that the non-working segment of Orange County is  upset because they have troubles getting their free handouts. If these people  are going to be so irresponsible as to have children and not be able to support  them, why should we have to hear of it, and (hear of) material that makes it  sound like the end of the world?  </P> <P> We would all love to have free money and not have the stress, work long hours  and plan children because of economics. In my family, we would love to have  more kids, but I cannot afford it. I drive 100 miles a day to work because I  cannot afford to live in our county right now. I live in Riverside.  </P> <P> We need more articles about the people, such as apartment owners, affected by  the drug issue, or the high rate of drug use in our welfare system, or the  effect of the tax laws on the disappearing middle-class, or the sacrifices that  regular working people make every day just to survive -- and (fewer) articles  on the blight of the poor. We are all going to be poor if any more gets dumped  on the workers who are paying for all these social services.  </P> <P> LUTHER GRIBBLE  </P> <P> Idyllwild  </P></p>

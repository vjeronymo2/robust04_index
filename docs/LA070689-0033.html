			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> College students and working women -- nearly 6 million of them -- who watch  daytime programs on the three major networks are not showing up in the A.C.  Nielsen ratings which only meaure in-home viewing, CBS reported Wednesday in  releasing results of a new study. CBS and ABC commissioned research on  out-of-home daytime program viewing, and CBS executive David Poltrack said the  new data "confirms our belief that the current out-of-home television viewing  audience is both substantial and growing." These unmeasured viewers, considered  two of the most desirable demographic targets for advertisers, include 2.6  million women watching at work and 3.1 million college students who watch on  campus facilities or in temporary residences. Poltrack also noted that "working  women, long believed to be excluded from the daytime network televison  audience, are finding ways to fit daytime viewing into their work schedules."  The impact of the unmeasured female working women and college students on the  audience for an average minute of daytime network programs amounts to a 5%  addition to the measured audience. The study, conducted the week of April 10 by  Bruskin &amp; Associates, involved daily television interviews among 5,076  adult working women and 2,216 personal interviews with students at 19 colleges  nationwide.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi -- The African Development Bank [ADB] ended  its annual meeting in Nairobi on Friday with crucial reform of  its lending policy left up in the air and its soft loan fund  bare.    Western countries declined at the three-day meeting to top  up  the African Development Fund until the bank implemented  internal reforms recommended by independent experts and adopted  policies to tackle mounting arrears on loans to member states.  "Certain steps have to be taken following the report and  certain policies adopted on resource allocation before we can  commit new funds," Britain's senior representative Barry Hudson  told the meeting.    The bank's problems are believed to be behind the caution  shown by SA in joining the bank, now that political objections  to its membership have been removed.    The meeting was attended by two SA observers, Eltie Links of  the Finance Department and Development Bank of Southern Africa  CE [chief executive] Andre la Grange. They presented a letter  expressing SA's interest in negotiating membership, but  indicated this would take some time.    SA's caution is linked to the bank's parlous financial  position -- it has liabilities of $700m [million] -- and the  cost of the shareholding being offered, which is reported to be  $275m over five years, with close to $2bn [billion] on call.    Representatives of the African and non-African members  agreed  to meet again, probably towards the end of June, according to  incoming chairman, Nigerian Finance Minister Kalu Idika Kalu.    In talks that ended late on Thursday, the two sides came  close to agreement on a replenishment worth around $2.6bn to the  Development Fund. However, at the last minute some African  states, led by Nigeria, rejected the country categories wanted  by the Western countries, which would distinguish creditworthy  countries that could borrow from the bank from others eligible  only for interest-free loans from the fund.    As a result, the replenishment pledges were withdrawn. Donor  countries are alarmed at the mounting arrears on loans given by  the bank, now more than $700m. The donors say only those  countries with per capita income of more than $1,054 a year  should be deemed good credit risks. SA would easily qualify on  these terms.    Countries with per capita income of $543 would be able to  borrow only from the fund.    Kalu told reporters the per capita income criterion was too  rigid, especially at a time of fluctuating economic conditions  in Africa. Members should look at supplementary indicators of  economic health.    The bank's vice-president for southern Africa, Adewale  Sangowawa, is due to visit Johannesburg later this month to tie  up arrangements for a conference on the bank in the city in  October.</p>

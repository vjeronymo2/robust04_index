			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Elsavar Ibragimov, head of executive power </F> of the city of Gyandzha, by Vagif Abdullayev; place and date not  given: "The Difficult Daily Routines of Gyandzha"]    [Text] Gyandzha, the second largest city of our  republic in terms of size and industrial potential, is facing  difficult times. A catastrophic fall in production, a large  "hole" in the local budget, a complex crime situation, and the  low incomes of the city folk hamper the accomplishment of many  social and economic tasks. The situation is exacerbated by the  fact that the supply of basic necessities--meat, butter, sugar,  and even bread--in the city is as bad as it gets. This is no  longer about obtaining merchandise with monthly ration cards,  but about supplies to so-called closed institutions as well.  Without exaggeration, many day-care centers and boarding schools  are almost on starvation rations. Under these difficult  circumstances, moral and material aid should also be provided to  350 families of martyrs and more than 30,000 refugees.    There is one more difficulty. It is found in the fact  that the desire to do as much as possible is not matched by the  financial and economic potential and runs into the absence of  clear-cut laws in the sphere of the economy and the banking  system.    How do the city authorities operate under such complex  conditions? What is their vision of solutions to the most  painful problems of the city's economy? Elsavar Ibragimov, the  head of executive power of the city of Gyandzha, discusses this.  Incidentally, let us note that he is the fifth person to hold  this vital position in the last two years.    [Ibragimov] When this office was entrusted to me in November  last year, many people were interested to know whether I had a  specific program for economic and social recovery in Gyandzha.  Of course, there should be an element of planning in the work.  This is certain. Unfortunately, in the last two to three years  the condition of the city had become so lamentable that it was  not easy to decide what to undertake first. There were problems  with bread, gasoline, gas, and electricity; there was a shortage  of cash in banks.... On top of everything, the crime situation  has also become aggravated. Against the background of these  unfavorable phenomena, certain forces have repeatedly attempted  to disrupt the operation of the industrial sector and to  discredit state authorities.    We recall the nightmare of last winter and our powerlessness  to do anything in response to a never-ending stream of  complaints about the absence of gas. They began to use  electricity everywhere to heat apartments. As a result,  overloads caused 42 substations to burn out. In turn, without  the substations it was impossible to provide drinking water from  artesian wells. In a word, conditions were those of a city under  siege.    Everything possible was done in order to mitigate the  situation. Despite their internal difficulties, many enterprises  and organizations provided assistance to the city at that time.    [Abdullayev] As we recall, that time was difficult for the  residents of Gyandzha indeed. However, as we can see, the  situation has more or less stabilized. We would like to know  what the priorities are in the operation of the executive  authorities at present.    [Ibragimov] Locally, be it in a city or rayon, the operation  of the authorities is rated on how good the supply of bread and  water to the people is, what condition the roads are in, how  urban transit operates, and how effective crime-control measures  are. In the process, they entirely lose sight of the economy. I  know that it will appear strange, but a majority of the  residents of Gyandzha for some reason do not see that the city's  facilities are dependent on how the industrial potential is  used. It is no secret that the severance of economic relations  and the introduction of national currencies in all former Soviet  republics have paralyzed all industries almost everywhere.  Certainly, Gyandzha is no exception on this score, either.  Suffice it to mention that the decline in the volume of  production since the beginning of this year comes to 20 percent  of the corresponding period of 1993. As we can see, the causes  are objective in nature in this case. It is understandable why  we are not in a position to eliminate them with our own  resources. For this reason, we focused our attention on areas of  the development of the urban economy which are feasible for us;  these are the roads, water supply, sewers, transportation.  Incidentally, at one time large funds were assigned for these  purposes. However, very little was actually done. There are no  such centralized receipts now. However, the demand of the  population for such services has, on the contrary, increased.  Suffice it to say that one-quarter of the city does not have  sewers; the water supply also leaves a lot to be desired.    [Abdullayev] You said that at one time sizable funds were  allocated to meet the needs of the city, and even stressed that  this was done on a centralized basis. Clearly, all this is a  matter of the past. Everything now depends on the potential of  the city treasury....    [Ibragimov] I will say right away that it is being  replenished with difficulty. Thus, in 1994 the expenditure side  of the budget comes to 3 billion manats, whereas the revenue  side is one-half that amount. Therefore, the budget deficit is  set at 1.5 billion manats from the outset. This is why we are  forced to take out a loan. Recently, we wheedled out 150 million  manats from the Ministry of Finance of the republic. We received  slightly more than this amount from that same Ministry of  Finance last year. Living on credit has already become something  of a norm. Opportunities for an infusion into the budget will  remain quite modest until we succeed in substantially raising  the effectiveness of the national economy.    Some see a way out in raising taxes, floating internal and  external loans, and currency emission. However, this is not the  way. Incidentally, I cannot but recall the high tax rates on  commercial space which were introduced a few weeks ago. In  essence, this is a tax on empty counters. As a result, the  stores divided their sales floors into two parts. One of the  halves is supposedly assigned for storage. Many stores in  Gyandzha have become quite ugly because of this. Yet this could  have been foreseen had they been aware that the condition of the  state trade sector is now lamentable.    Unfortunately, we appear to have forgotten that all of 80  percent of the budget, at any rate in Gyandzha, is replenished  by contributions from the profits of industrial enterprises. So,  if they functioned the way they did before, there would be no  problems at all. However, as we can see, industry turned out to  be powerless in the face of the disintegration of the unified  economic mechanism on which the economy of the Soviet period was  based.    [Abdullayev] In a word, it so happens that now it is  difficult to hope for the implementation of particular large  economic projects. To your mind, is there a way out of this  financial impasse? After all, there are times when you cannot  get loans. Besides, on occasion it is very hard to pay them back.    [Ibragimov] We understand this full well. I admit that the  money received goes into a bottomless pit--this is how expensive  everything has now become. For example, we recently spent 70  million manats we had obtained on credit just to cosmetically  repair the roads. You would agree that under the circumstances  it would be best to use internal reserves. This is what we are  doing. Thus, we began, on a contractual basis, the construction  of a shopping area in which 44 small stores will be located.  Construction was done by a special construction and repair trust  reporting to the city executive authorities, with funding being  used from both legal entities and individuals. This made it  possible to contribute more than 27 million manats to the  treasury. Later, these funds were used to restore a 4  kilometer-long water main as well as sewers within the city  limits. In a word, we saved a lot of funds. This is point one.  Second, a work opportunity was provided for the special repair  and construction trust whose financial situation was difficult.    The search for internal reserves continues. We have several  developed projects whose effectiveness has been evaluated. The  construction of single-family houses, the sale of unfinished  apartments in standard high-rise buildings to the population,  and other measures. We want to thus draw housing and land  allocated for houses and dachas into circulation on the market.  Later, it will be possible to also sell small state enterprises,  especially ones that are unprofitable.    However, these are all forced measures. How are we to  proceed  otherwise if the funds taken in by the budget make it possible  to pay only 60 percent of the wages in organizations financed  from the budget? We have to compensate for the lacking 40  percent through loans. Unfortunately, as I see it, the people in  Gyandzha, like those in other regions, do not always have a  clear notion of the processes that are underway. They forget  that previously the enterprises of the republic operated at full  capacity. At present, many plants and combines in Gyandzha and  everywhere else are on the brink of shutting down production.    [Abdullayev] Actually, this is easy to conclude based on the  fact that many locally produced goods, even basic ones, have  disappeared from store shelves.    [Ibragimov] The trouble is that a catastrophic slump in  production has been registered not only in Gyandzha but  everywhere. This is not to justify our local shortcomings. There  is no dearth of those. Suffice it to say that compared to the  corresponding period of last year, the decline in production in  the first two months of this year comes to five tonnes for  butter, 248 tonnes for dairy products, 720 tonnes for laundry  soap, and 242 tonnes for meat and meat products. Some 110,000  fewer square meters of carpet and carpet products and 296,000  fewer pieces of porcelain products were produced. The list goes  on. How are we to reverse the situation? We think that it is  necessary to either undertake reorientation of industries or  perfect the banking system. It is not ruled out that other  constructive ways out of the impasse exist. Who should show the  initiative? Primarily, reorganization of the industrial sector  is at issue. So far, market reforms have not affected it at all.  This is how it happens that the ministries should act as  helmsmen. However, the ministries work on anything at all except  production. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture responded  with absolute calm to a stoppage at enterprises in Gyandzha such  as the confectionery plant, the meat combine, and the dairy  combine. The same situation has emerged with the production of  industrially manufactured construction materials. The management  of the industry is unconcerned about the fact that finished  products worth billions of manats have accumulated at the  alumina combine. The same is the case at the instrument-making  plant.    I will say this: The countless army of ministerial officials  is of no use at all. Yet, they are good at harming all  endeavors. I will give the following example. By a decree of the  Cabinet of Ministers, the executive authorities of Gyandzha were  authorized to dispose of 15 percent of the products manufactured  at the enterprises of the city. We could bring in to Gyandzha  many types of foodstuffs through barter transactions by taking  advantage of this right. However, the ministries demand that we  prepay the proportion of products which we could dispose of, but  we do not have funds for these purposes "ahead of time." Our  appeals to the heads of departments asking that they themselves  provide foodstuffs to at least the day-care centers and  hospitals reporting to them likewise produce no results. A  vicious circle emerges. The answer is found in shortages, in the  striving to make money off them, make it in any way possible.  For example, overstocked warehouses at wineries, incidentally  not only in Gyandzha, testify to this.    One cannot help getting the impression that such an economic  situation suits some people.    [Abdullayev] How does the community of directors respond to  this?    [Ibragimov] It tries to avoid mass unemployment. For our  part, we support in every way possible all initiatives of  enterprise managers aimed at offering new jobs and becoming  self-sufficient in at least the basic necessities.    We also encourage the development of entrepreneurship and  small businesses. These forms of activity that are new to us  make it possible to provide jobs for many residents of Gyandzha.  Suffice it to say that about 6,000 people work at small  enterprises and in associations.    [Abdullayev] As we know, a slump in production, deficit, and  inflation are always accompanied by mounting crime-generating  tensions. We would expect that not everything is favorable on  this score in Gyandzha, too.    [Ibragimov] You know, even earlier our city was one of the  hot spots on the criminal map of the republic. The motives for  and nature of crimes have now changed in a way. First, organized  crime dominates. Second, if I can put it so, criminal entities  have begun to penetrate industrial facilities, commercial  structures, and banks. Moreover, they frequently attempt to  control the activities of local authorities in the area of  personnel selection. There are things for us to think over in  this area. As is known, in the West organized crime controls  only the criminal sectors of activity, such as prostitution, the  drug trade, and gambling. In turn, our organized crime controls  virtually all types of activities. This is associated with the  fact that for a number of objective reasons, many facilities  have in a way become criminal themselves. For example, in the  environment of the severance of economic relations and absolute  shortages, many enterprise managers are forced to resort to  illegal means in order to obtain the resources necessary to  fulfill production plans. This is how the initial knots of  corruption are tied. Honest people also get caught in its nets  against their will. For example, how are they to avoid the  so-called "payola" which has become the norm when final products  are sold? What kind of measures can one take given that the  criminal elements intertwine with police organs and officials of  all ranks? It is no secret that such intertwining endangers the  political and economic development of our republic as a whole.    In Gyandzha we are particularly concerned about the growth  in  grave crimes. In the last 1.5 years alone, 83 premeditated  murders were committed. Most of them occurred last year when  many firearms were "making the rounds" in private hands. Owing  to the measures taken, bursts of automatic weapon fire are no  longer heard at night, but based on certain facts we can  conclude that by far not all of the weapons have been  confiscated.    [Abdullayev] However, the executive authorities are also  responsible for order in the city....    [Ibragimov] Certainly. However, we are frequently at odds  with the leadership of the republic's Ministry of Internal  Affairs. Thus, a few months ago the chief of airport police was  relieved from his position by a decision of the city executive  authorities. However, our petition on this issue still remains  "unresponded to"--pardon me for unintended bureaucratese. All of  this causes various false rumors. The most terrifying thing is  that people lose their belief in justice.    [Abdullayev] As is known, progress in society as a whole  largely depends on the welfare of all regions. This begs the  question....    [Ibragimov] I understand. I think I will be expressing  everybody's opinion if I say that we first of all need to put an  end to the war by political means. It claims many human lives.  In Gyandzha alone 350 families are in mourning; tens of  thousands of refugees are in a hopeless situation. Putting it  plainly, people are just tired. The republic budget is not  standing up to the war, either. For this reason the citizens of  Gyandzha, like an overwhelming majority of Azeris, entirely  support the peace-loving policy of the president of our  republic. Of course, we understand that not everything will fall  into place, and not right away. However, we believe that even a  bad peace will make it possible to refocus our attention on the  implementation of reforms and the economic revival of Azerbaijan.    [Abdullayev] We second your hopes. Thank you for the  interview.</p>

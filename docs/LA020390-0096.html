			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RESURGENCE OF REGGAE;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC: MAJOR LABELS SIGN MORE ARTISTS AND WATCH SALES RISE. THE JAMAICAN  STYLE ENJOYS RENEWED POPULARITY WITH A NEW GENERATION OF PERFORMERS AND FANS.  </P> <P> Marcia Griffiths didn't expect the second coming of the Electric Boogie.  </P> <P> The veteran reggae singer, a member of the I-Threes vocal group that backed Bob  Marley for years, released a record called "Electric Boogie" in 1983. But the  single wasn't successful outside the reggae scene and didn't even become a  fixture in her own concert repertoire.  </P> <P> After a Washington deejay began playing the record last summer, other stations  picked up on the song, and Griffiths suddenly found herself with a runaway hit  in the nation's capital that spawned a club dance craze, the electric slide.  </P> <P> Island Records released a re-mixed version of the single last summer, and it  has been hovering in recent weeks around the Top 50 of the Billboard pop  charts.  </P> <P> The delayed success of "Electric Boogie" is part of a bigger story: Largely  dismissed within record-industry circles as a Next-Big-Thing-That-Never-Was  after the 1981 death of Bob Marley, the music's greatest star, reggae is  enjoying a renewed popularity.  </P> <P> It's still an underground music, but there are undeniable signs that the  Jamaican style is on the upswing: more major-label deals for reggae artists,  steadily increasing sales for reggae-oriented labels, and the arrival of a new  generation of performers and fans.  </P> <P> Unlike the '70s, when the reggae world was caught in the spell of Bob Marley,  the music's fortunes no longer seem tied to an individual. While the success of  his son Ziggy's 1988 album "Conscious Party" was a crucial catalyst, most  observers agree that the new reggae audience broadly supports the music as a  whole.  </P> <P> "There's more hope now for reggae than I've seen in the years since Bob died,"  said Roger Steffens, a former co-host of KCRW-FM's influential "Reggae Beat"  program. "There is fresh new blood, there are people without long memories and  people willing to take it to a new stream. That's healthy."  </P> <P> The resurgence was brought home forcefully last February when the annual Bob  Marley Day salute filled the 12,000-capacity Long Beach Arena. For longtime  reggae observers who had been there at the beginning and seen the 1982  celebration in MacArthur Park featuring local bands and drawing perhaps 1,000  people, the Long Beach sellout was a shocker.  </P> <P> This year's Bob Marley Day concert, scheduled today from 1:30 to 8 p.m., will  again be at the Long Beach Arena, where another sellout is expected. The lineup  includes the original Black Uhuru (Don Carlos, Garth Dennis and Duckie  Simpson), the Mighty Diamonds, Shinehead and Tippa Irie.  </P> <P> This rise in reggae's fortunes is especially dramatic in view of the pop  industry's pessimism about the commercial viability of the music after Marley's  1981 cancer death.  </P> <P> "There was a definite lull after Bob's death because it was almost like reggae  had not only lost its founding father but its leader," said Los Angeles deejay  Ron Miller. "They were looking for somebody else to spearhead the movement, and  no one came along that could fill those shoes. What took the leadership role  was the music itself."  </P> <P> The shock waves from Marley's death even affected some of reggae's strongest  champions within the record industry. It was one of the factors that caused  Chris Blackwell, whose Island Records label initially brought Marley and reggae  to the world, to back away from the music during the early '80s. But now  Blackwell sees interest in the music rising again.  </P> <P> "I think it's been brought about by Ziggy, who has become a real point of focus  and leader," Blackwell said, by phone from Jamaica. "That was what reggae was  lacking for some time. He brought some attention to himself and through that to  the music and other artists."  </P> <P> The figures may not be dramatic by rap or even underground rock standards, but  the revitalized spirit in reggae is being reflected in record stores and  concert sales.  </P> <P> * Producer Tony Johnson started the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1978 to  provide a live showcase for reggae in Jamaica. Johnson took Sunsplash to London  in 1984, and two years later started the package tours in America that are  bringing the music into new markets. This year's Sunsplash tour should hit  Southern California in May.  </P> <P> * Rick Hocutt, vice president of California Record Distributors in Glendale,  said that West Coast sales on Heartbeat and Mango, the small labels that have  released the bulk of reggae records here during the '80s, have doubled in the  last two years. Mango, for example, jumped from 96,000 in 1988 to 169,000 in  1989.  </P> <P> * Real Authentic Sounds (RAS) Records, the Washington-based label that provides  American distribution for 30 to 40 Jamaican labels, increased its sales by 50%  last year from 1.2 million to 1.8 million. RAS founder Gary Himelfarb expects  to crack the 2-million unit barrier this year, but he doesn't view the  increased sales as a sign of mainstream acceptance.  </P> <P> "To me, reggae and mainstream are oxymorons because reggae is an underground  type music," he said. "It's for people who have deep feelings for humanity, and  a lot of people don't want to be burdened with what's wrong with this world and  how to make it better."  </P> <P> There are other signs of reggae's vitality: the wide array of talent, a variety  of reggae styles and reggae's penetration of the American pop mainstream, even  beyond its influence on hits like Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy."  </P> <P> But the most dramatic new development is that reggae, which has primarily  attracted a white, rock-oriented crowd, may finally be making inroads with the  African-American audience that has long resisted it. Ziggy Marley's "Tumbling  Down" reached No. 1 on the black singles chart, a first for a reggae artist  here, and director Spike Lee included Steel Pulse's "Can't Stand It" in his  acclaimed "Do the Right Thing" film.  </P> <P> More intriguingly, a fusion of reggae and hip-hop has surfaced in the last six  months. Shinehead's canny blend of the two styles on his 1988 album "Unity" was  the first portent, and now Sly &amp; Robbie's "Silent Assassin" collaboration  with rap producer KRS-One has accelerated the momentum.  </P> <P> "Aspects of the reggae rhythm are a tremendous dynamic in the hip-hop field,  and that's starting to merge with rap culture," said Blackwell of Island  Records. "Early Jamaican deejay records were somewhat of a precursor of rap  music, so there's a lot in common in those two attitudes to music."  </P> <P> The situation for live reggae in Los Angeles is volatile. The Rebel Rockers are  familiar with the ups and downs common to American reggae bands -- record label  interest that faded away after Marley's death and offers from producers who  were willing to work with them . . . if they changed their sound.  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach-based quintet went directly to the source, recording and  releasing a few singles on Jamaican labels and even appearing twice at the  Reggae Sunsplash event there.  </P> <P> New-breed Los Angeles artists are making headway by releasing their own records  and plugging into reggae's international tour circuit. Vocalist Swelele went to  Japan for three months last year and is starting to attract major-label  attention after several singles for local labels.  </P> <P> Boom Shaka's "Creation" album was picked up by Celluloid Records last year  after the group initially released it on its own label. They toured Europe and  introduced live reggae to Tunisia at a government-supported cultural festival  there.  </P> <P> "Every time I listen to Bob Marley, I hear Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, so  he was influenced by the things that were around him at that time," said Trevy,  lead singer for Boom Shaka.  </P> <P> "To even think about looking for a new Marley is madness. That's like looking  for another Jimi Hendrix or John Coltrane -- it can't be. Those people just  come like a falling star and you can't duplicate a situation like that."  </P></p>

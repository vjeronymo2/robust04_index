			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Enthusiast for Emu gets finance job THE proponents of European monetary union can breathe a little more easily in the knowledge that the French Finance Ministry is now in the hands of Mr Edmond Alphandery, writes Alice Rawsthorn. Mr Alphandery, 49, who pursued an academic career as professor of economics before opting for politics as a UDF parliamentarian, is not only a staunch supporter of monetary union, but also of the franc fort policy of protecting the French currency. His academic background and international experience - he taught economics at universities in the US as well as in France - made him an obvious choice for Finance. Mr Alphandery certainly thought so. He is believed to have spurned President Francois Mitterrand's offer last December of one of France's two European commissionerships in the hope he would get the job. The cynics in French politics were not quite so confident. They suspected that Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, might prefer a more malleable candidate. Mr Balladur was finance minister in the last cohabitation government from 1986 to 1988 and might well have wanted to carry on controling his old portfolio from the premier's offices in the Hotel de Matignon, just like his predecessor, Mr Pierre Beregovoy. But Mr Balladur, aware that he could come under pressure to devalue the franc from RPR chauvinists, such as Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Philippe Seguin, may well have calculated that his interests would be better served with a forceful figure at Finance. The RPR chauvinists are the least of Mr Alphandery's problems. The new government needs to cut interest rates as quickly and as deeply as it can, to revive the economy and curb unemployment which has broken through the 3m mark. If the Bundesbank makes substantial cuts in German rates, all will go well and French rates can follow. But if German rates remain high, Mr Alphandery will face the grim prospect of speculative assaults on the franc from abroad, calls for devaluation from home and a big question mark over his hopes for European monetary union.</p>

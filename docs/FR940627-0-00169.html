			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Registered (and registrable) F/FAs required to undergo Tier 3 testing will retain their registration for that time determined to be necessary for the completion of Tier 3 tests. This registration will be contingent on the satisfactory compliance with the Tier 3 requirements according to a timetable determined by EPA to be appropriate to those requirements. When Tier 3 is prescribed for new F/FAs (i.e., those not meeting the registrable criteria), EPA may withhold registration until completion of all testing requirements. For new F/FAs, EPA will determine whether the Tier 3 requirements have been met within one year of receiving the Tier 3 submittal. If Tier 3 requirements are satisfied, then EPA will send a notification to the manufacturer granting registration to the new F/FA product. Registration of new F/FAs will not occur until that time when EPA determines that all Tier 3 requirements have been satisfactorily met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described above, EPA's review times for data on new F/FAs are shorter than those for registered F/FAs. The reason for this discrepancy is that manufacturers of new F/FAs are barred from marketing such products until EPA approves their compliance with all testing requirements and grants them registration. On the other hand, manufacturers of registered products can maintain their registration, and thus their ability to sell their products, while EPA is reviewing their submitted data. Thus, to ensure that undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hindrance is not created for manufacturers of new products wanting to enter the marketplace, EPA has abbreviated the review times for new F/FA products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding the granting of a registration (or continued registration for registered F/FAs), if EPA determines that a fuel or fuel additive causes or contributes to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare, then EPA could invoke available regulatory authority under CAA section 211(c). Referral to Tier 3 is not required for EPA to begin a regulatory action under 211(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If additional testing is needed to make up for deficiencies in information content or testing technique/procedures related to Tier 1, Tier 2, and/or Tier 3, then the original compliance deadlines will still be in force. Manufacturers of existing products who fail to submit data in the prescribed time frames or who submit data from tests that do not comply with the specified guidelines will be in violation of this rule and will be subject to the penalties specified in CAA section 211(d). According to CAA section 211(d), persons who fail to submit any information or conduct any tests required by the Administrator under CAA section 211(b) shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for every day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such violation plus the amount of economic benefit or savings resulting from the violation. Each day after the due date for submission of data will constitute a separate day of violation. Civil penalties will be assessed in accordance with CAA sections 205(b) and (c), which permit EPA to proceed either in court or in an administrative action. If a group of manufacturers commits to performing joint testing, each manufacturer would separately be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of the rule. However, the Administrator would retain the authority to remit or mitigate any penalty under CAA section 211(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above penalties, the district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to compel the furnishing of information and/or the conduct of tests required under CAA section 211(b). This means that, in addition to the financial penalties, persons failing to submit data or comply with the specified guidelines would still need to submit the data originally required. Furthermore, if EPA determines that the data requirements of the rule were not met, EPA could revoke the registration of the fuel(s) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive(s) in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because EPA recognizes that unusual circumstances, outside the control of the manufacturer, may occasionally interfere with the manufacturer's ability to comply with the provisions of the rule, today's rule contains a mechanism to allow manufacturers to request modification of the requirements under some specific circumstances. This special mechanism allows persons who experience unforeseen problems or accidents in conducting the EPA-prescribed tests to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request modification of the requirements in order to avoid being in violation of the rule. This mechanism would apply to unusual mechanical problems or other unavoidable problems that could arise during the performance of the required tests. The modification requests must be submitted as soon as the manufacturer is aware of the difficulty, but not later than thirty days following the event precipitating the request. Additional details on this special mechanism for modification of requirements is included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory text of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XII. Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The materials to be submitted to EPA include the basic registration data, a summary report with Tier 1 and Tier 2 results, and associated appendices. If the results of Tiers 1 and 2 are submitted at the same time, then the summary report must include both Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and associated appendices, as described below. If Tier 1 and Tier 2 results are submitted separately, then two individual reports must be provided to EPA, i.e., Tier 1 report and Tier 2 report. In such a case, each individual report must include the summary information applicable to the respective tier (including a cover page, executive summary, test substance information, a summary of tier results, conclusions, and associated appendices). If the Tier 2 report for registered F/FAs is not submitted within three years after the effective date of the final rule, then evidence of a suitable arrangement for completion of Tier 2 (e.g., a copy of a signed contract with a qualified laboratory to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct the required Tier 2 tests) must be submitted to EPA prior to that date. F/FA manufacturers who must conduct additional testing under Tier 3 are required to submit a Tier 3 report when the designated Tier 3 testing is complete. The nature of the information to be included in the basic registration data, reports, and associated appendices is described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

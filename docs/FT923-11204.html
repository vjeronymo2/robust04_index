			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Arabs cautious about moves to curb Israeli settlements ARAB foreign ministers meeting in Damascus have described as 'ambiguous' moves by the new Israeli government to curb settlement activity in the occupied territories. But officials at the meeting, convened by Syria to plan tactics for the next round of Middle East talks, were expected to agree to the session going ahead, perhaps as soon as next month in Washington. Briefing reporters after discussions involving representatives of Lebanon, Syria and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian team, Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said steps taken by the new government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin had not provided the 'minimum level required to push forward the peace process'. Israel's Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians, are demanding that it freeze all settlement activity, and reaffirm its commitment to negotiate within a framework of United Nations resolutions that call for withdrawal from land occupied in the 1967 war. Arab and Israeli participants in the US-sponsored peace negotiations launched in Madrid last October will decide soon whether to bring forward the sixth round of peace talks, originally scheduled to be held in Rome in September. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, who concluded a Middle East tour in Saudi Arabia yesterday, pressed the Arabs and Israel to resume talking quickly to capitalise on improved prospects for peace following the defeat of the hardline Shamir government. In Damascus yesterday, Palestinian delegates from the occupied territories, led by Dr Haider Abdel-Shafi, joined Palestine Liberation Organisation officials in the discussions. The previous Israeli government had banned contacts between Palestinians in the territories and the PLO. Mr Rabin has indicated greater flexibility.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Dramatic currency surge both mesmerises and horrifies: Manufacturers fear a decline in profitability Small huddles of Japanese salarymen broke off their early morning journey to work in central Tokyo to pause outside the numerous banks and brokers whose shop windows bear the latest electronic news from the financial markets. They were hoping to catch a glimpse of the moment when their currency hit the magical figure of parity with the US cent. But if they were mesmerised by the ascent of the mighty yen their bosses were stunned at the blow to nascent recovery hopes. Some thought the drama apocalyptic. 'The abnormally strong yen will not only damage the Japanese economy which has been gradually recovering but bring about the collapse of manufacturers in the country,' said Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren). What hurts most is that they had thought it could not get any worse. Last year corporate Japan expected the yen to hover around the 120 mark, and were caught on the hop when it stayed below 110. Chastened, this year most have planned for a dollar/yen rate of 105. Suddenly even that caution starts to look optimistic. Only last month equity analysts were forecasting a healthy return to profits growth this year after a record-breaking four straight years of decline. But the yen's climb could halt that. According to Nikko Research, each one yen rise in the yen against the dollar knocks 3.4 per cent off manufacturers' pre-tax profits. Some companies have insurance policies in the form of forward hedged yen positions, but all acknowledged the key test would be whether a 100 yen dollar proves durable. 'The economy was at a turning point,' said Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, 'but if the yen stays above 100 the upward trend will be halted and growth could be flat.' Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, thought that unlikely, as the country's huge trade surplus was at last beginning to shrink. 'We are in the last stage of yen appreciation, and it's not going to stay long,' he said. But Japan's battered manufacturers have been told for years that the yen's rise cannot go on for ever. On a depressingly historic day for them, many were beginning to doubt it.</p>

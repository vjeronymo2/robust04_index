			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not defending a high-cost Logitech operation Sir, Ian Rodger, in his article about Logitech, 'Almost caught in a mouse trap' (August 22), states: 'With the factories in Taiwan and Ireland running well and a new China venture in the works, the high-cost California factory could be shut down. Marini, who was responsible for US operations, resigned in protest, but profitability was restored . . .' From the tone and the context of the sentence, it may appear that I was defending a high-cost and unprofitable operation, thus damaging the best interest of Logitech. In 1992, I was executive vice-president and chief operating officer and my responsibilities included all Logitech factories worldwide, including Taiwan, Ireland, China and California. Each of them had a vice-president or general manager reporting, directly or indirectly, to me. I had no more vested interest in the California plant than in any of the other plants. The manufacturing strategy at the time called for different roles for the plants. The California plant was used primarily for new product introductions, being close to the main design centre. I had managed the transition of products to lower cost plants in a systematic and orderly way. As the pressure on costs was increasing, I had a very specific plan of accelerating the transfer of products to lower-cost plants. The California factory was not shut down in 1992 and it is still in operation today. It continued to operate with about the same number of employees after I left and until the first quarter of 1994. Only recently has the headcount been reduced. Giacomo Marini, 1035m Trinity Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025, US</p>

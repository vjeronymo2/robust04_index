			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Arts: Moody at Scott's A FUNNY man and a fun player, roly poly saxophonist James Moody and his quartet extended Ronnie's season of ribaldry this week. For the last three weeks we have had Roy Ayers' funk and fusion interspersed with harmless double entendre and now it is Moody's turn to make 'em laugh. An early bopper who started out with Dizzy Gillespie in the mid-1940s, his career has seen stints as a sideman to that most serious of musicians, Miles Davis, as well as front man in Las Vegas clubs. British audiences last saw him in the Albert Hall, blowing behind BB King as a part of Gene Harris's big band. Nowadays his gigs as a quartet leader feature comic vocal antics ('More Frankenstein than Billy Eckstine,' he admits), as well as short and punchy versions of standards like 'Wave'. Why Moody need bother with quite so much fooling around is anybody's guess. He's an old hand and can get around a tenor, not to mention the alto and flute, and stirs up unlikely tunes like 'Roll Out the barrel'. The improvisation on all three instruments, which are employed in equal measures, is clean and snappy and the accompanists - Todd Coolman (bass), Marc Copland (piano) and Akira Tana (percussion) - take their solos by rote and willingly enough. Copland and Coolman (a good name for a jazz man) work especially well on the former's ballad, 'But not for them'. But the gags and patter dominated in a show more suited to the supper club than jazz club. Not that he's unfunny: the one about a pet dog which liked cantaloups - 'My Melon Collie Baby' - was good. It's just that Moody is an original bop saxophonist and it would be good to hear more of the playing which influenced so many of today's tough young tenors. The supper club atmosphere had already been set by Judith Owen, however, whose name betokens someone more dull than the personable singer seated at the piano. With a style located somewhere between Joni Mitchell and Kate Bush, leather trousers and blonde good looks to boot, Owen has the voice and songs which deserves to succeed on American FM radio.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by G. van Oudtshoorn] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 5 SAPA -- Elections cannot be  held in kwaZulu in the current political climate, according to a  unanimous conclusion reached by a joint working committee of the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] and the South African and  kwaZulu governments.    Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler said in a statement on Tuesday [5 April] he had  reported the working committee's conclusion to State President F  W de Klerk, the Transitional Executive Council, African National  Congress leader Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister  Mangosuthu Buthelezi. "The IEC has indicated that in the light  of the report, political measures were required. As such  measures fell outside its brief, the IEC, as in the past, did  not make any proposals," the judge said. The IEC is  nevertheless continuing with its planning of elections in the  province as a whole, and envisages providing the optimal level  of voting facilities possible in those areas unaffected by the  political climate in kwaZulu."    He said the effect of the recently-proclaimed state of  emergency in kwaZulu/Natal could not be gauged as yet, but the  IEC anticipated it would "significantly contribute to the  performance of its mandate". An in-depth study was under way  and would be followed by an inspection in loco by two IEC  commissioners later this week. They would report to the full  commission on April 9.    Mr Justice Kriegler said the working group, set up on March  28, consisted of heads of relevant kwaZulu government  departments, representatives of the South African Department of  Home Affairs, the South African Police and the IEC.    He said the working committee gave the following reasons for  its assessment that an election was not feasible in kwaZulu:     -  "the high level of political intolerance and fear, as well  as large-scale intimidation, which factors have led to the  current state of emergency;    -  "the kwaZulu civil service and tribal structures/authorities  are, at present, unable to fully assist the process for a free  and fair election;    -  "due to time constraints, the IEC will not be able to follow  the prescribed protocol required to confirm, evaluate, and  secure the voting stations; (and),    -  "the South African Police and the kwaZulu Police do not  foresee  that they will be in a position in the present political climate  to adequately ensure that the elections are free and fair. This  is due to the additional demands on its manpower resources  relating to the level of violence (present as well as future),  normal policing duties and normal election-related duties."</p>

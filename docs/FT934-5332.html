			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mexico proves magnet to foreign insurers - Growth and a poor domestic service is attracting US and European investors US and European investors are manoeuvring swiftly to take stakes in Mexico's fledgling insurance sector. They are drawn by a market that has been ill-served by domestic companies and is growing rapidly as the country's incomes rise and inflation stabilises. In the past three years the US's Aetna, Metropolitan Life, New York Life Insurance Company, and Principal Financial Group, Grupo Santander of Spain, and Commercial Union of the UK, among others, have taken up to the maximum permitted 49 per cent stake in Mexican insurance companies. In all, some 13 foreign insurers are minority owners of Mexican insurance companies. Asemex, the insurance group recently privatised for Dollars 582m, is looking for a foreign partner, according to Mr Angel Rodriguez, the new company president. The insurance company and Mr Rodriguez's financial group, Mexival-Banpais, then plan to make a public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Foreign insurers hope to bring to their Mexican counterparts capital, technology, and global distribution. The Mexicans, meanwhile, will contribute knowledge of the local market. Foreign companies generally have better distribution systems, financial management and product development skills than Mexican insurers, says Mr Bill Poortvliet, executive vice-president of Metropolitan Life. But is there sufficient room for all the foreign companies seeking a stake in Mexican companies? While profit margins are high, many Mexican insurers have high costs, and may be unprepared for competition. 'We expect some consolidation,' says Mr Poortvliet, whose company joined last year with Santander to take a 49 per cent stake in Genesis, a new Mexican life insurance company. 'Not every company is going to be a winner.' The North American Free Trade Agreement will intensify competition by fully opening up the sector to US and Canadian insurance companies. Under the treaty, US or Canadian companies with at least 10 per cent of shares in an Mexican insurance company can increase their holdings to 100 per cent by 1996. Other companies will have to wait until the year 2000. Mexico's foreign investment law will permit up to 49 per cent investment in Mexican insurers for non-US and Canadian companies. There are also doubts as to whether foreigners are prepared for doing business in Mexico, and ready to join forces with Mexican partners. Commercial Union, the UK insurer, this year wrote off its 44.3 per cent stake in Seguros La Republica after several executives defrauded the company, and the UK insurer refused to inject more capital. CU complained at the time that regulation in Mexico's insurance industry was insufficiently advanced, and warned other companies to pick their partners with caution, and conduct extensive due diligence. The foreigners nevertheless keep coming, attracted by an under-developed market. The average Mexican only spends about Dollars 55 a year on insurance, while insurance premiums account for just 1.5 per cent of Mexico's GDP, against 3 per cent in Chile, and 8.8 per cent in the US. Investors tend to dismiss cultural explanations - such as Mexicans' tolerance of risk and a somewhat fatalist attitude to death - for such low insurance penetration, Instead, they blame Mexico's economic crisis in the 1980s. Mexico's wages fell 40 per cent between 1982 and 1990, leaving little money for insurance policies. Inflation was high throughout the decade, playing havoc with calculations of the future value of life insurance coverage, and reducing the incentive to save through such schemes. Insurance companies are now convinced the conditions are present for a sharp increase in the market. Mexico's inflation is down to single digits; incomes have been steadily, if unspectacularly, rising; and the savings rate is picking up. This should bode particularly well for life insurance, which comprises just one-third of the total Mexican insurance market, a much lower proportion than that in other countries: only 2 per cent of Mexicans own a life insurance policy. However, the sector is now growing fast, posting an average 28 per cent a year gain in dollar terms since 1987. The government's new state-sponsored individual pension scheme should increase savings, and further boost the life industry. Mr Palden Namgyal, vice-president of JP Morgan, which has advised on several insurance transactions in Mexico, reckons that life insurance companies will play an important part in managing savings generated by the retirement scheme. The extension of credit - for the first time in a decade - is having a beneficial impact, by increasing the number of first-time car and house owners, and generating demand for car and property insurance. Banks in Mexico generally demand insurance policies as a condition for lending money. The question hanging over the new insurance companies is whether they and their partners are the best equiped to meet the explosive demand all participants predict. Mexico's growing financial and industrial integration with the US is likely to ensure that profit margins in the industry eventually fall to levels in the US, and that, over the long term, only the most efficient companies will survive.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- INSURERS FORGING MEXICAN LINKS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Foreign Partner          Mexican Partner     Transaction  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Aetna Life Insurance     Seguros Monterrey   Participate in fast                                              Mexican market, joint                                              venture, 30% stake Chubb                    Grupo Mamhos        Greenfield investment                          Equitativa          to follow customers to                                              Mexico, 30% stake in                                              Equitativa Reliance Group           Proteccion Mutua    Bought 30% stake                                              in Proteccion Mutua Commercial Union         Seguros La          Build domestic Mexican                          Republica           presence, 44.3 % stake Cigna                    Seguros Progreso    Purchased 49% to write                                              domestic business New York Life            Olmeca              Purchased 30% stake in                                              Olmeca to participate in                                              the Mexican life business Metropolitan Life/       Genesis             Santander sold half of Santander                                    its 49% participation to                                              Met Lift Liberty Mutual           Nacional            Strategic alliance,                          Provincial          Liberty provides loss                                              prevention services Generali                 Anglomexicana       Holds 49% stake Mapfre                   Seguros Tepeyac     Holds 49% stake Zurich International     Seguros             Holds 30% interest                          Chapultepec AGF                   Aseguradora         Holds 32.5% stake                          Territorial Adriatica                Aseguradora         Holds 20% stake                          Cuauhtemoc N Y Life                 Colmena  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: J P Morgan  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

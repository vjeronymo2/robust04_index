			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHERYL KROTT; GLENDALE MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE  </P> <P> A Glendale judge, whose dedication to the bench kept her working months after  surgery for a terminal brain tumor, has died, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Glendale Municipal Judge Cheryl Krott died Saturday at her Glendale home,  presiding Judge Charles Horan said.  </P> <P> She was 48.  </P> <P> Horan and other court officials said Krott was reserved and private, a tough  but fair judge respected by attorneys for her commitment.  </P> <P> Her brain tumor was diagnosed last August and she underwent surgery in  September. Yet she returned to work about two weeks later, scheduling painful  treatment sessions on Fridays so she could rest on weekends to avoid disrupting  the court's calendar, colleagues said. Krott's tumor eventually returned and  she left the bench June 22, vowing she would be back.  </P> <P> "She never gave up hope," Karla Olson, the court's administrator, said. "She'd  come in on Mondays, and you could tell that her treatment had ravaged her. She  was in pain just putting on her robe. But she'd always stay late on the bench."  </P> <P> Krott, born in New York, graduated from Glendale College of Law in 1974. She  was a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney and deputy public defender  before becoming a Glendale municipal court commissioner in 1982 and a judge in  1986.  </P> <P> She is survived by her father, Robert Krott, and a sister and a brother, all  living in New York. Services will be Thursday at 1 p.m. at Forest Lawn  Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills. Donations on her behalf can be sent to  the Brain Tumor Research Fund at the UCLA Medical Center, Olson said.  </P></p>

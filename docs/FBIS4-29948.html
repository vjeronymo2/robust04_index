			<p>CSO     [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT),  Sumitomo Corporation, Itohchu, and two Indonesian firms will  form a consortium to place a bid in the international bidding  process for Indonesian telecommunications projects. The project  will involve the installation of 2 million circuits and the  minimum investment value is expected to be $2 billion. The  project will be handled under the build, operate, and transfer  (BOT) format involving the construction of facilities, recovery  of costs after operating the system for a given period, and  transfer of the system to local personnel. The three Japanese  firms have reached the assessment that the telecommunications  market in Indonesia will expand rapidly along with economic  growth and hope to participate in such prospects. NTT has been  designated a domestic telecommunications operator, but it has  stated that it will not be subject to regulation in connection  with the proposed projects because it is limited to the  Indonesian domestic market.    The three Japanese firms including NTT will form a five-firm  consortium with an Indonesian corporate giant called Salim Group  and one more local firm, which plans to submit papers to the  Indonesian Government at the end of June to qualify for the  bidding process. The qualifications screening process will  designate about 10 qualifying consortia, which will be asked to  submit formal bids. Results of the bidding process will be  announced at the end of the year or in early 1995. It appears  the Indonesian Government will divide the area to be covered by  the new system into four or five areas, each to be handled by a  separate group designated to handle a maximum of 500,000  circuits.    Under the five-year telecommunications construction program,  a total of 5 million new circuits are to be installed, but it  was decided that the Indonesian National Telephone Company would  not be able to handle the entire project, leading to the  decision to subject 2 million circuits to bidding by foreign  firms.    Under the BOT format, consortia with winning bids handle the  planning, construction, management, and maintenance of installed  systems. Since the new projects will make partial use of  existing telecommunications networks, consortia with winning  bids will split revenue, such as that for telephone calls, with  the Indonesian National Telephone Company. The share for the  consortia will be 70 percent.    It appears that European and U.S. telecommunications firms  will submit bids, but it is expected that Japanese-affiliated  consortia are favored to win bids. The reasons for such an  outlook are that Japanese-made switching systems are widely used  and Japan commands a technical advantage, while the Indonesian  Government is expected to seek funds from the Japan  Export-Import Bank in the form of loans to install  telecommunications circuits.</p>

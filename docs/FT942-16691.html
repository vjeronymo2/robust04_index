			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Former IBJ head joins Goldman Sachs Japan Goldman Sachs, the US private investment bank, has appointed Mr Hideo Ishihara, a former deputy president of the Industrial Bank of Japan and president of IBJ Leasing, as the chairman of Goldman Sachs Japan, the Tokyo arm of the US investment house. Mr Ishihara, who will join the company as a general partner, the equivalent of a board member of a listed company, said that the appointment reflected Goldman's wish to expand business with Japanese companies. The move comes as other leading US houses are scaling down their Tokyo operations and focusing on other parts of south-east Asia. Mr Ishihara, 63, is known for his connections in international finance. He became deputy president of IBJ in 1990.</p>

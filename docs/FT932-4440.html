			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / France agrees to ratify EC-US oilseeds deal FRANCE yesterday agreed to ratify the EC-US agreement on oilseeds, but stressed that it still could not accept the parallel deal on the farm chapter in the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations. Both agreements were reached last November in Washington but had been held up by French objections. The oilseeds accord, passed last night by EC foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg, is a vital building block for an overall deal in the Uruguay Round talks on trade liberalisation. The deal will, for the first time, allow the EC to present a unified position on other unresolved issues in the talks. However, French ministers emphasised that they were not withdrawing their objections to the Washington farm accord. 'We have obtained from our partners and the Commission a certain number of clarifications which enable us to participate in the accord,' Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's minister for European affairs, said. Mr Gerard Longuet, the French trade minister, said France's acceptance meant it had 'broken out of its isolation' within the EC on world trade. The breakthrough on oilseeds came when EC farm ministers decided on May 27 to increase substantially compensation to farmers for 'set-aside', the land they have to take out of production to comply with reduced output targets under farm reform. France will get a large share of the extra spending. But Mr Lamassoure said yesterday that France had also secured a declaration from its partners that the oilseeds agreement was separate from the farm chapter restraints on subsidised exports agreed with the US. Mr Alan Juppe, the French foreign minister, described that agreement as 'totally unacceptable'. Under the previous French government, France had strongly opposed the Washington deal, even though it was a better outcome than the then French bottom line. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, is due in Brussels tomorrow to press the case outlined in France's recent memorandum on the Uruguay Round talks, which Mr Juppe said had been well received by the EC. But Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany, France's closest ally, said the memorandum was 'not God's gift to world trade'. There is growing irritation within the EC - echoed publicly yesterday by the Dutch and privately by the British - at indications by French officials that Paris will require more expensive concessions to consider a Uruguay Round farm settlement.

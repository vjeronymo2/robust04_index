			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Europe's governments resort to hard sell - A tide of advertisements and publicity campaigns is sweeping the continent EUROPEAN governments are turning to public relations managers to sell European union, a concept which once seldom needed marketing. The continent-wide tide of advertisements, brochures and publicity campaigns to increase the popularity of the Maastricht treaty seems, in many cases, to be inspired less by idealism than by desperation. The EC's regular Eurobarometer opinion surveys show majorities in favour of the treaty in most countries. Yet among the 12 EC members, as well as in the Nordic and Alpine states hoping to join the community later in the decade, individual voters are becoming increasingly sceptical about whether the treaty is good for them. Governments are fighting a psychological battle, says Mr Svend Auken, a pro-Maastricht Danish deputy who up until spring was leader of the Social Democratic party. He was shocked to see 60 per cent of his party's members voting against the treaty in the country's referendum in June. 'The rhetoric of Europe no longer sells. Three years ago Europe had a good ring to it. It represented prosperity, the fall of the Berlin Wall. But in 1992 it spells Yugoslavia, racial turmoil in Germany and a Eurospeak further and further away from everyday realities.' According to Mr Philip Huckin, group account director at CME-KHBB, the London-based advertising agency which has just established a European branch network: 'One of the problems about the EC and Maastricht is that there is a lot of ignorance.' He says advertising can be a useful tool to enable people to make more sound judgments, but adds that campaigns need to be conducted 'sensitively' to avoid sparking anger among voters who believe taxpayers' money should be put to more constructive purposes. This is a particular problem for Britain, whose electorate has traditionally been more sceptical about European integration than elsewhere in the community. Assuming France votes Yes on Sunday, the UK Foreign Office is pondering whether to step up promotional efforts in favour of Maastricht to accompany planned parliamentary ratification later this year. Negative feelings about Maastricht have been clearly evident during the run-up to the French referendum. The French government drafted in Mr Jacques Seguela, a prominent French advertising executive who is a close confidant of President Francois Mitterrand, to orchestrate the Yes drive. He devised a series of media advertisements focusing on the slogan 'L'Europe est adulte. Donnons-lui sa majorite' (Europe has grown up. Let's give it a majority). The government set aside FFr25m (Pounds 2.6m) to spend - but then had to scrap plans for radio and TV campaigns after complaints from broadcasting author-ities. Press and poster advertisements went ahead as planned. But, in its attempt to draw on extra media glamour, the French government has had to rely on support from a group of 300 celebrities - academics, actors, pop stars and industrialists - as well as on a big pre-poll pop concert. The German government, preparing to push Maastricht ratification through parliament from October, will launch its own pro-treaty campaign next month. Large advertisements will be carried in the German press on October 1 and 8, with special promotional 'packages' prepared for radio stations. The Bonn press and information office, which is spending DM22.5m (Pounds 8m) on Euro-promotion this year, is also sending a 272-page brochure on European integration to 120,000 German executives and managers. In view of growing popular opposition to abandoning the D-Mark, Bonn's campaign will have to tread particularly warily over the issue of economic and monetary union (Emu). An earlier advertising series aimed at increasing Emu's popularity ran into difficulties when a leading Bundesbank official complained that the campaign distorted the central bank's statements on the issue. If promoting co-operation within the EC is a struggle, the task is even greater for governments on the outside. The Swiss government is facing problems in developing an effective information policy on the question of Switzerland's entry into the European Economic Area (EEA) next year and its application to join the community by 1995. Both decisions will be subjected to referendums - and the campaign promises to be robust. Mr Jakob Kellenberger, state secretary for foreign affairs who has the job of negotiating Swiss adhesion to the community, admits that many Swiss view the EC with hostility. The Berne government has decided on a SFr5.9m (Pounds 2.4m) EC information campaign which, although modest, is more aggressive than anything previously attempted. The brochures produced by the campaign team carry phrases such as: 'The EEA: a practical guide', or 'Being Swiss in Europe: Yesterday, today and tomorrow'. Throughout Europe, not just in Switzerland, governments trying to push their voters down the trail of integration are emphasising practicality rather than vision.</p>

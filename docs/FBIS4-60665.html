			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jerusalem, May 27 (AFP) -- Israel prefers to  shrug off the remarks of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat about a  "jihad" for Jerusalem and will judge the Palestinians on their  "actions" rather than their words, Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin's spokesman said Thursday [26 May].    "For us, what is important are the actions on the ground and  not wild statements," spokesman Oded Ben Ami told AFP.    Rabin initially reacted angrily to remarks made by 'Arafat  in  South Africa urging a "jihad" or holy war to recover Jerusalem  and implying in veiled terms that Palestinians were not  necessarily bound by their agreement with Israel.    Rabin first talked of sending troops to reconquer the  autonomous areas but he "soon realised that he risked  jeopardising the entire peace process and changed his tune," an  Israeli minister who asked to stay anonymous told AFP Thursday.    The minister said Police Minister Moshe Shahal and met [as  received] two prominent Palestinian leaders from Jerusalem on  Sunday to convey a warning to the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) leader.    Shahal told them to tell 'Arafat that his remarks could  force  Israel to reject further concessions to the Palestinians,  because of the effect of his statements on Israeli public  opinion.    "The two Palestinian leaders admitted that their leader had  no idea of the role of Israeli public opinion and promised to  get the message to him," the unnamed minister said. [passage  omitted]</p>

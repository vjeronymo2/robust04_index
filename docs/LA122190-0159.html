Final  </P> <P> COOL COWS SPELL CHILL FOR FARMERS  </P> <P> To beat the lack of heat, some dairy farmers are using cow brassieres and hair  dryers to keep their animals from udderly freezing.  </P> <P> "You've got to try to keep a cold cow comfortable, or you're going to lose a  lot of milk production," said Barry Steevens, a University of Missouri dairy  specialist.  </P> <P> Today's forecast called for highs around zero.  </P> <P> Some Missouri farmers use nylon mesh udder supports on animals that calved  recently and have udders swollen with milk, Steevens said. Others use hair  dryers and towels to keep moisture off the animals.  </P></p>

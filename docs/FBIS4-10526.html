			<p>BFN     [Text] Priest-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is not  qualified to fill the high office of president of the Republic  of Haiti, according to Louis Dejoie II, acting minister of  commerce and industry, advancing the opinion that the latest  communique on the Port Tortuga matter has demonstrated the  meanness of the president and his lack of political maturity and  ability to analyze state affairs. In a letter to the general  director of the weekly HAITI EN MARCHE, Dejoie assails the  president as audacious. He writes: It seems odd that I can be  accused of being a traitor -- unless this accusation comes from  a mentally ill, malicious, racist, and embittered Haitian  jealous of my democratic stands in favor of the Haitian people.    Louis Dejoie II explains that he is not seeking revenge and  has not raised a destructive weapon against Haitian brothers,  political clans, or social strata but has always preached  national reconciliation. Dejoie says he is the victim of a plot  against him hatched by the lavalasians. A lavalas brigade from  Miami is allegedly already in Port-au-Prince for the purpose of  assassinating Minister Dejoie. That would be something! he  exclaims, in this letter to the general director of HAITI EN  MARCHE.</p>

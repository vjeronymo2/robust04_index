"As far as I am concerned, I see no reason why  Scalfaro should not complete his term of office, in accordance  with the provisions of the Constitution." Therefore, Scalfaro  should stay on the Hill [president's palace] until 1999, the  Knight [Berlusconi nickname] said.    [Coppola] So, in your opinion, Scalfaro is untouchable?  However, your allies, [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi and  Gianfranco Fini [leader of the Italian Social Movement, MSI] are  saying, instead, that...    [Berlusconi] Please do not put words in my mouth. I never  said "untouchable." I could never be so arrogant as to state or  pronounce my opinion in those terms. I am only saying that the  issue of the president of the republic has never been presented  by the allies.    [Coppola] This may be so, but Bossi is saying the opposite,  he is saying that Scalfaro should pack his bags.    [Berlusconi] By now Bossi is making it his profession to  make  statements against everything and everybody.    [Coppola] However, Fini is also saying that the president  will have to step down.    [Berlusconi] I believe this is not the right moment to  address this issue. I have expressed my opinion. We will see  what happens later. They have never taken up this issue with  me. I believe it ought to be discussed at the right moment. We  must first see how Italians vote, see the actual figures.    [Coppola] Some people are suggesting that a change is taking  place in the "institutional" political scene -- namely, that you  are undermining the agreement between the PDS [Democratic Part  of the Left] and Scalfaro.    [Berlusconi] I do not believe you can speak of alliances as  far as the president of the republic is concerned, because the  head of state must be above the opposing sides. I believe that  Scalfaro is very much aware of this rule, and that he is fully  observing it. [passage omitted]</p>

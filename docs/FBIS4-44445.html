			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Qiu Xiaohua (6726 2556 5478) and Wan Donghua </F> (8001 2639 5478) of the State Statistics Bureau Comprehensive  Department: "Report on the National Situation---Concerning  Inflation; Concerning the Scale of Investment; Concerning the  Current Tightness of Funds---Three Problems in Current Economic  Operations"]    [Text] I. Concerning Inflation    In 1993 market prices started high and rose greatly. For the  year, retail prices rose 13 percent over the previous year and  residents' cost of living prices rose 14.5 percent. For the  year, cost of living prices in 35 large and medium-sized cities  rose 19.5 percent. From the perspective of the yearly price  changes, the following four new trends appear:    1. Urban and rural prices rose simultaneously. While in 1993  urban prices continued their high increase, inflation of rural  prices also clearly increased, and the increase was rather high.  It is estimated that the annual rise will be 12.5 percent. And  the differential with urban price rises shrank from 3.8  percentage points to 1 percentage point.    2. The new price rise factor had a great affect. According  to  calculations, in 1993 retail market prices and residents' cost  of living price rises, the affect of new price rise factors in  the current year (including the adjusted price structure and  spontaneous price rises) was 80 percent or more, clearly higher  than the previous year.    3. Residents' basic cost of living prices were highly  inflated. The 1993 urban residents' basic necessities prices,  greatly influenced by reform of prices in such areas as grain,  housing, and fuel, rose rather greatly. It is estimated that the  annual rise will reach 18 percent, 2.5 percentage points higher  than overall urban cost of living price increases. Within that,  grain prices rose 38 percent, pork prices rose 14 percent, and  fresh vegetable prices rose 13.5 percent.    4. Service prices rose sharply. For the year, it is  estimated  they will rise about 28 percent, effecting a 3.2 percentage  point rise in residents' cost of living prices. Within that:  rent rose by 23.4 percent; transportation fees rose 26.7  percent; miscellaneous education and child care expenses rose by  37.8 percent; entertainment expenses rose by 52.3 percent; and  water and electrical fees, post and telegraph fees, and medical  and health care expenses rose by 16.2 percent, 16.5 percent, and  38.6 percent, respectively.    The main causes of the large prices increases are, first,  that the country has further increased the extent of price  reforms. On the base of successive extensive price reforms in  the past few years, the prices of grain, steel products, and  some unified distribution coal have been freed up; the producer  prices of timber and unified distribution cement have been  adjusted and raised; and the prices of some heavy oils have been  "leveled." This has a positive function as regards smoothing  price relations, changing the long-term low price situation of  basic products, and forming mechanisms to gradually establish  market prices, but it also brings with it rather large increases  in overall price levels. The second thing is that the large  overall scale of fixed assets and the large amount of currency  put into circulation have increased the pressure to demand price  rises. The third thing is that while increasing the extent of  price reforms and accelerating economic development, there have  not been effective checks on arbitrary price rises, covert price  rises, and ever rising prices. The fourth thing is that the  adjusted exchange rate fluctuated for a while. The fifth thing  is the influence of such non-economic factors as residents'  changing psychological expectations and the orientation of  public opinion.  <H5>  II. Concerning the Scale of Investment </H5>   Our basic judgement regarding the scale of 1993 investment  is  that the scale of investment was already large and with an  excessively large scale, the structure was not altogether  reasonable.    From the perspective of the scale of investment already  achieved, the 1993 rate of fixed asset investment for the whole  society was 37.5 percent. If we discount the influence of such  factors as the fact that the prices of investment items were  more inflated than consumer items and actual use of foreign  funds increased rather greatly, the approximate investment rate  was about 33 percent, three percentage points higher than former  years averages, making it large. Presently China is in a rather  stable period in the growth of consumption and rapid economic  growth relies even more on the pulling power of investment and  the function of investment to stimulate and curb the economy is  more pronounced than at any time in the past. To maintain the  rapid growth of the economy, we must have the support of a  rather high rate of investment.    From the perspective of establishing the overall scale, this  obviously is too large. It is estimated that the overall scale  established by state units for the year will reach 3.3 trillion  yuan, 40 percent greater than the previous year. If we discount  the fact that at the end of the year after the investment totals  are completed, incomplete projects still require the investment  of 1.9 trillion yuan, the increase is close to 60 percent and  the ratio that it occupies reaches as high as 57.6 percent, far  exceeding normal limits. The root cause of the establishment of  an excessively large overall scale is that reform of the  investment system is lagging, and it lacks effective investment  risks and responsible restraint mechanisms. A considerable  number of regions do not arrange their investment based on the  capability of their regions to utilize such aspects as their  area's resources, technological advantages, market prospects,  and funds, but blindly keep raising them, craving to rashly put  up establishments, increase projects, and expand the economic  scale, forming low-level duplication and unchecked development.  Based on the situation in 1993, not only does this make the  entire atmosphere of economic operations tight, but in the area  of investment itself, it brings about the following two  problems: First it lowers investment returns, reflected in the  fact that all indicators for overall investment returns declined  from the same period the previous year. Secondly, it exacerbated  the tight funds.    As regards the structure of investment, there are some not  altogether reasonable places: One is that the share of  investment in energy and raw material industries has declined.  The share of investment completed in the first eleven months  declined from 42.9 percent in the same period the previous year  to 36.9 percent. The second is a clear tendency toward extension  of investment. In the first eleven months, investment used in  newly extended projects increased by 78.3 percent and the share  rose from 34.1 percent in the same period of the previous year  to 38.6 percent. Among transformation and renovation funds, the  share used for newly expanded investment rose from 48.8 percent  to 53.8 percent, but the share used for reconstruction and  replacement of equipment declined from 43 percent to 40.3  percent. The third thing is that wasteful government buildings,  first class villas, vacation villages, and recreational places  have increased too much.  <H5>  III. Concerning the Contradiction of the Current Tightness </H5> of Funds    In the past few months, the state has several times in  succession injected large amounts of currency, used mainly to  support the normal production and operation of key industries  and key enterprises, key development of the railroad, coal, and  petroleum industries, the purchase of such agricultural products  and byproducts as grain and cotton, and good performing foreign  trade purchase and export production enterprises. This is  helpful in alleviating the contradiction of the tightness of  funds widespread in the previous period. But the fact that  several areas presently reflect a shortage of funds still is a  pronounced problem and the cry for an increased supply of funds  is extremely strong.    Why is it that with the state putting so much money in  circulation several sectors still generally feel that the "blood  supply" is inadequate? On the surface, there is a problem in the  total supply of funds and a more intense influence from market  restraints:    1. Channels for social funds are changing and the overall  supply of funds is shrinking. In the first half of the year  before the central government implemented strengthened  macroeconomic control measures, there were six channels for  regions' funds: Bank loans, short-term interbank loans, raising  funds, non-bank credit, bonds, and foreign funds. But since the  second half of the year, this situation has changed greatly.  Short-term interbank loans and raising of funds have been  stifled, they have stopped issuing bonds, and non-bank credit is  strictly controlled. In addition, the repayment of short-term  interbank loans has caused the overall supply of funds to  society to clearly shrink. It is estimated that for the year,  social credit funds for other than state banks will be reduced  by upwards of 100 billion yuan from the previous year.    2. Market circulation is not smooth and fund sedimentation  is  increasing with a corresponding decrease in the currency in  circulation, aggravating the the tight situation in the supply  and demand of funds. Beginning in August, along with the  changing market supply and demand circumstances, the industrial  production and sales ratio has declined somewhat and  overstocking has clearly risen. In addition, arrearages among  enterprises are becoming increasingly acute, further aggravating  the tightness of enterprise funds.    3. Some newly added loans are being used for such  expenditures as supplementing tax revenues and paying off water  and electric fees. From analyzing the deep-seated causes, the  present tight money is an inevitable reflection in the current  period of enterprises' for a long time in the past disregarding  the capabilities of their funds and resources, wantonly  competing to invest and in many ways pushing in and seizing  their own circulating funds, along with slow adjustments in the  structure of savings and low efficiency in the use of funds.  Strengthening macroeconomic controls only serves to set it off  and causes the contradiction to appear by being concentrated.    As regards enterprise automatic circulating funds, because  enterprise operating mechanisms still have not been converted,  self-development capabilities and self-restraint awareness are  not strong, and automatic circulating funds are constantly being  seized and diverted, leading to a decline in the share of  automatic circulating funds from year to year and a great  weakening of the ability to withstand market risks. Once the  money supply is tightened, tightening of enterprise funds is  unavoidable.    In the 1983 national budget, state industrial enterprise  automatically circulating funds made up 55 percent of the  circulating funds quota. By the end of 1992, it had declined to  21.4 percent, and nearly 80 percent of funds relied mainly on  bank loans. The factors influencing the constant decline in the  share of enterprise automatically circulating funds are: First,  multiple extrusions and nibbling have caused automatically  circulating funds to run off. Quite a few newly established or  expanded enterprises have not proportionately arranged for  corresponding underlying circulating funds for their investments  or they have not arranged for enough. Some even rely on  diverting circulating funds and construction enterprise advances  to wantonly compete for projects. Some automatically circulating  enterprise funds also are used to dilute losses found in  successive years' appraisals of fixed assets and circulating  funds. The second thing is that they have not been promptly  replenished. Some enterprises even divert funds for use in  speculating on real estates and stocks. In addition, high rising  inflation also eats away some funds.    As regards the adjustment of the structure of enterprise  reserves, because they have been influenced by numerous factors  such as unclear property rights relations, unsound social  guarantee systems, and the vertical and horizontal separation of  localities and departments, it is difficult for enterprises to  get state guarantees for selecting the superior and weeding out  the inferior and good or bad operations and gradually enduring  the difficulty of adjusting reserves. Enterprises that have  fallen into losses and whose funds are the tightest yell the  strongest. In addition, the low efficiency of the use of funds  to a certain extent aggravates the current tightness of funds.    The problems described above should be resolved by  intensified reform, a sound legal system, and stronger controls.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Dipping a toe into foreign waters - A look at funds that allow British investors to keep part of their portfolios overseas THE big international investment trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial and Edinburgh, are the doyens of the industry. But in the world of unit trusts, the international growth sector is still something of a backwater. Admittedly, there was around Pounds 5.25bn of funds invested in the sector as of November 1. However, just under Pounds 920m of that money was in the Standard Life Overseas Larger Companies Trust which, with a minimum investment of Pounds 50,000 and a bid-offer spread of 7.86 per cent, is hardly aimed at the private investor. There are good reasons why a unit trust investor should consider the international growth sector. For a start, the recent weakness of the UK economy and the decline in the pound has emphasised that the smart British investor would be wise to keep at least part of his portfolio overseas. And the small investor who ventures overseas might be wise to rely on the diversification provided by a broadly-based international trust. Short-term performance tables are often dominated by single country trusts as markets go in and out of fashion. But picking the short-term winner can be a dangerous strategy. Take the Schroder Japanese Smaller Companies Fund, for example. At the end of last year, it regularly appeared in the lists of top performing unit trusts over a five-year period and in one newspaper survey of investment experts was selected as a tip for 1992. In fact, over the year to November 1, an investor who had backed the fund would have lost 31.5 per cent of his capital. This is no particular fault of Schroders, since the fund is still top of the sector over three, five and seven years. The Japanese market, 'undervalued' according to many experts at the start of 1992 with the Nikkei 225 at 22,300, has fallen sharply. An international growth fund would have only a small proportion of its fund in Japan and so would have avoided the worst of these problems. Broadly speaking, one would expect most of these funds to have a portfolio spread across the major markets - the US, Japan, Europe and the UK. But not all funds are broadly spread. The Framlington Health fund, top of the sector over two, three and five years, is really a specialist trust, with a large exposure to the US, over-the-counter stocks and biotechnology. Framlington features rather strongly in the tables with two more general funds - International (fifth in the sector over three years) and Recovery (fourth in the sector over 10 years). The tables are based on Finstat figures and reflect offer-to-bid performance, with net income reinvested. According to George Greig, investment director at Framlington, the International fund starts with an asset allocation approach and has benefited in the last few years from being overweight in the US (although this has changed in 1992) and underweight in Japan. The recovery fund looks for companies which are in turnround situations and has had a heavy concentration is US and UK stocks. Charges on the funds are five per cent initially and 1.25 per cent annually. The minimum investment is Pounds 500. The other fund management group which stands out from the table is St James's Place, which has two out of the top five funds over ten years. These funds used to trade under the Bishopsgate label, with the international fund a regular star of the long-term performance tables. (The former Bishopsgate Progressive, another long-term star, was merged with a special situations trust and is now in the European sector). Minimum investment in the St James's Place funds is Pounds 1,500, with the initial charge at five per cent and annual at 1.5 per cent. Consistency can be more important than top-of-the-table performance. Those funds with above average records in the sector over one, two, three, five, seven and 10 years are: Allied Dunbar International; Bank of Ireland British Overseas; Fidelity Managed International; GT International; M&amp;G International Growth; Martin Currie International Growth; Perpetual Worldwide Recovery; and Prolific Technology. But what international unit trusts really need is a general improvement in performance. The average trust in the sector has grown 235.6 per cent over ten years but fallen by 0.2 per cent over three years. That compares with growth of 449.9 per cent and 30.7 per cent for international general investment trusts over the same periods. (The method of calculation slightly favours investment trusts, but nowhere near sufficiently to account for the difference). Investment trusts may have benefited from a narrowing of discounts in the 1980s but international investing still seems one area where they are ahead of their unit trust rivals.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP PERFORMING INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                    % rise    Fund                       % rise                     over 3 yrs                          over 10 yrs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Framlington Health       106.6    St James Pl Int             461.4 Perpetual PEP Grth        53.6    Mart Currie Int Grth        451.9 Prolific Techno           53.3    Merlin Jup Intl             435.8 B of I Wldwide           141.6    Framlington Recov           395.7 Framlington Intl          36.6    St James Pl NAm &amp; Int       370.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

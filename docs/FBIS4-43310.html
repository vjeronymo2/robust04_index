			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Gregor Gysi, chairman of the Party  of Democratic Socialism [PDS] Bundestag Group, is confident that  his party will have the strength of a parliamentary group in the  next Bundestag. It is very likely that it will not be possible  to prevent the PDS from entering the Bundestag again, Gysi told  DPA on Monday [13 June].    After the very good performance in the municipal elections  in  the east and the European elections, Gysi stated that the PDS  will at least get three direct mandates, "but it might also be  five to 10." The 5-percent hurdle can also be overcome. In  Gysi's opinion, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  still has not been able to gain a foothold in the new laender.  It does not have any relation to reality and to history in the  east.</p>

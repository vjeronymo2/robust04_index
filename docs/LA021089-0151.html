			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CATTLE HERD REPORT HURTS FUTURES PRICES  </P> <P> A government report showing a larger-than-expected U.S. cattle herd knocked  cattle futures prices to the mat Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  but analysts were skeptical of the report's accuracy.  </P> <P> On other markets, cotton futures prices fell sharply, grains and soybeans were  mixed, precious metals futures declined, and energy futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Prices for all cattle futures except the February live cattle contract plunged  the permitted daily limit of 1 1/2 cents at the opening bell and stayed  limit-down for the rest of the session. The contract for February delivery of  live cattle settled 1.40 cents lower at 73.97 cents a pound while the  near-month feeder cattle contract, for delivery in March, settled at 82.92  cents a pound.  </P> <P> Pork futures prices fell in sympathy with the cattle market. Live hogs finished  .50 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February at 41.90 cents a pound; frozen pork  bellies were .12 cent to 1.13 cents lower with February at 37.57 cents a pound.  </P> <P> The sell-off was triggered by Wednesday's semiannual USDA cattle inventory  report, a head count of the nation's cattle herd. The USDA reported that there  were 99.5 million cattle and calves in the United States as of Jan. 1, only a  few thousand fewer than the previous year.  </P> <P> The industry consensus expectation was for the herd to total fewer than 98  million cattle. The USDA report implied that after 6 years of thinning cattle  numbers, producers were starting to rebuild their herds.  </P> <P> But many analysts said they did not believe the report, especially its  implication of an extremely high birth rate in the second half of 1988.  </P></p>

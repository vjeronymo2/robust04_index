			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LADY TOROS 'POUND' CHAPMAN COLLEGE, 8-0  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills soccer Coach Marine Cano was fuming when his  second-rated Division II women's team played poorly in a 4-1 home field loss  last Tuesday against Division I powerhouse UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "This really hurts us. We've got to go out and pound some goals Saturday. I  mean, pound some goals," Cano said.  </P> <P> And pound some goals they did, racking up a single game school record in  shutting out Chapman College, 8-0, in Carson.  </P> <P> In the men's game:  </P> <P> Pat Fitzgerald made good on a penalty kick in the 84th minute of play as  Dominguez Hills defeated Chapman, 3-2, in a California Collegiate Athletic  Assn. game. The Toros (8-6-1 overall, 2-3-1) also got goals from Willie Ayala  and Mark Merino.  </P></p>

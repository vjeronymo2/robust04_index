			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / How to Spend it: A shopping expedition down the old Silk Road - The changing political complexion of Central Asia means the great bazaars are open to the outside world again. Charlotte Eagar reports on the bargains to be found FOR 70 years, the People's Flag flew over the bazaars which lined the great Silk Road. When Marco Polo went to Xanadu, he travelled this shopaholics' highway, the ancient trade artery linking the mysterious East to the sack-clad barbarians of Europe. Strung along its miles of arid dust, like so many precious stones, were the desert oases where weary merchants refuelled. Through these medieval Little Chefs - Bukhara, Khiva and Samarkand - passed the luxuries that corrupted Rome: silk and porcelain, melon and saffron, Persian carpets and Russian slaves. Now the Red Flag flies at half-mast and the great bazaars of Central Asia are open for business once more; the Soviet straitjacket could not stamp out the central Asian's desire to sell. Even in the museums, they sell you stuff; the curator can see you have an eye for culture, so he brings out a little something he brought from home which his great grandfather used to wear. Or are the exhibition cases looking a little empty? A frenetic jumble of noise, colour and smell, the Samarkand bazaar hits Soviet-dulled senses like a 10-ton truck. Stall after stall is piled with lurid Tadjik silks, beach-striped cotton moire and bales of corduroy, jostling old women sell hats, coats, shoes, tomato sauce, embroidered velvet jackets, car tyres, paisley scarves and garlic - an eclectic mess of local specialities and anything they can lay their hands on. Dotted between their rickety trestles are men selling plates of steaming plov, the fried rice and vegetables speciality of Central Asian, shashlik (kebabs) and piping hot onion pasties, cooked as you watch in a waist-high stone dome; fire at the bottom, the vendor bends in through a hole on the oven's flattened top and sticks the raw pasties to the inner wall like little bats. Whatever your intentions in former Soviet Central Asia, it is impossible to escape the shopping frenzy. Everything is so cheap. Silks in a myriad of reds, yellows, greens and pink sell for 160 roubles a metre. Why not buy 50? What matter if you do not know what to do with it, you will never buy silk for that price again - at around 350 roubles to the dollar, it works out at about 30 pence a metre. Anyway, the silk looks great as curtains. In the Khivan Karavanserai, a state department store located with rare taste in an ancient inn, Uzbek pottery sells at 30 roubles a plate; bowls, vases, butter dishes, teapots, sheets, pillows, mattresses, towels - you could furnish a whole house. Plus, of course, the ubiquitous yards of silk. Peter Jones is never knowingly undersold but they have not heard about Khiva. Beneath every honey-coloured dome, wizened old men in white embroidered, black silk skull-caps and striped, padded coats sit and talk. In Bukhara, the coats cost around 500 roubles. An English photographer bought six - a dressing gown for every member of his family. Central Asia has this effect, people stop shopping rationally and start just buying. It is similar to an American supermarket race, except there is no time limit and you can come back anytime. For serious shoppers with real money, carpets are the greatest pull of Central Asia; every Sunday is carpet day. Early in the morning in Ashkabad, the rug bazaar gets going. The ruby sheen of the Turkmen carpets transcend their hideous setting, a large concrete car park on the outskirts of town fenced off from the desert by strands of chicken wire. Here you can buy carpets from Bukhara, from Baku, old carpets, new carpets, silk, wool and cotton. Crouched in the dust, carpet addicts count the knots on the carpet back. At Dollars 100 or so a throw, these carpets are not ridiculously cheap, but they are still a fraction of the price in the west. Carpets are big business in Central Asia. In the lobby of the Hotel Samarkand, an Afghan carpet manufacturer grabs the Intourist group as they while away the time between guided tours. His carpets are nearly double the cost of the bazaars but they are clean, it is inside and he sells all week long. Sitting out the fighting in the Hotel Tadjikistan in Dushanbe, his cousin waits in the hope the chorus of visitors will return. Dushanbe is not shopper-orientated but, despite the inconveniences, it has its rewards. The origin of the stripey silk, Tadjikistan offers the widest choice of colours; the locals make really interesting felt rugs which you cannot find anywhere else; or you can wrestle with your conscience about buying old jewellery from refugees (well, he says he needs the money to emigrate). One problem: if you are going to shop in Tadjikistan, shop there first. Neurotically obsessed with gun-running, Uzbek customs will not allow vehicles over the border, and shoppers have to get out and walk. Hauling 50 metres of silk, 24 Khivan plates, six Kirdiz hats, two Uzbek coats, a butter dish and a carpet over half a mile of No Man's Land under a Central Asian sun could be avoided with a little careful forward planning. Sadly, the bazaars of Samarkand, Khiva and Bukhara are inside Uzbekistan. One of the last great bastions of communism, Uzbekistan takes its visas awfully seriously although the other Central Asian republics have relaxed their rules. However, they love tourists. You need visas for every town you want to visit but you can pick them up at Tashkent airport without great difficulty. Central Asia is the shoppers' paradise. The only problems are getting in and out. Aeroflot flies to all major cities, except Dushanbe, where flights are cancelled until further notice. Aeroflot is cheap if you can pay roubles (either a local, or a journalist or student accredited in the CIS) but if not, you have to pay in dollars. Even so, it costs only a few hundred dollars to Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. The really cheap ride is the train. It costs about 1,500 roubles from Moscow, unfortunately the journey takes five days. Alternatively, you can fly Afghan Air from Kabul for Dollars 125. Aeroflot has a maximum baggage allowance of 20 kilos, but nobody cares how much you carry on to the plane; most CIS citizens travel with at least two sacks of potatoes. If the shopping frenzy takes too strong a hold and you buy so much you can not lift it, then for Dollars 3,000 you can buy a Niva, a brand new Soviet jeep. Load it up, point it west and drive the whole lot home.</p>

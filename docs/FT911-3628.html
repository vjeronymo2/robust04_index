			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: UK market conditions push Ward down 31% THE WARD Group, the steel and building components combine, blamed the worst UK market conditions in its 45 year history for a 31 per cent drop in pre-tax profits. For 1990 the profit came to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 12.6m). The final dividend is 4.8p, for an unchanged 7.2p, payable from earnings of 25.2p (36.4p). Mr Nigel Forsyth, chief executive, said the 'bitterly disappointing' results would have been worse without the help of the European business, which remained relatively buoyant. Non-UK turnover increased slightly to Pounds 67m (Pounds 63m) while overall sales were down to Pounds 172.8m (Pounds 175.3m). The group was planning to expand further on the Continent, into eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, increasing those sales from 39 per cent of turnover to more than 45 per cent. It already has manufacturing plants in Belgium, France, Italy and Germany. However, Mr Forsyth warned that difficult market conditions would continue throughout the year. He could not see any improvement in overall profits until 1992. The slump in profits led to the company reducing its employees from 2,360 to 1,852. Gearing fell from 39 per cent to 26 per cent as borrowings were reduced from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 7.4m. Interest payable amounted to Pounds 2.04m, covered five times by operating profit of Pounds 10.76m (Pounds 12.9m). The group continued its investment programme, spending Pounds 7m on developing new machinery and equipment. That brought the total invested over the past four years to Pounds 30m, and a further Pounds 8m is allocated for 1991.</p>

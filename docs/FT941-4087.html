			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues Beazer Homes, one of the UK's four biggest national house-builders, is being split off from the Hanson conglomerate and floated into a buoyant stock market sector, writes John Thornhill. The placing and public offer, arranged by Lazard Brothers, values Beazer Homes at Pounds 463.4m. The issue price of 165p a share equates to 14.5 times historic earnings and gives a notional gross dividend yield of 3.8 per cent. That is a modest rating relative to the sector. Beazer Homes has strong management, a relatively cheap land bank, and a sound balance sheet. It will receive Pounds 50m of the flotation proceeds to help fund its expansion programme. Its earnings growth is likely to prove less dynamic than that produced by many other house-builders, though. The company already has high margins and will rely chiefly on volume growth to expand profits. House-building is a highly cyclical industry which is in the early stages of an up-swing. Last year, the industry had its first year of growth since 1988, with the number of new completions rising 5 per cent to 148,100. At the last peak, in 1988, builders completed 203,000 new houses.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich/London (DPA) -- The European Airbus  partners, together with U.S. aircraft builder Boeing, will delay  their studies for a superjumbo with more than 500 seats until  mid-1995, for the time being. Then a decision is to be made  whether or not the development of the new VLCT plane (Very Large  Commercial Transport) will be continued together. This was  decided by the European Airbus companies Aerospatiale (France),  British Aerospace (Great Britain), Casa (Spain), and Deutsche  Aerospace (Dasa/Germany) as well as the U.S. Boeing corporation  (Seattle) at a meeting in London on Thursday [3 March], Dasa  announced.    At the meeting, it was agreed that, in the future, the  umbrella organization of the Airbus partners, Airbus Industrie  (Toulouse), will itself be involved in the studies. In the  studies for a plane that is larger than the Jumbo Jet currently  produced by Boeing, which were initiated in 1993, only the  Airbus shareholders have talked to each other so far, since  Airbus Industrie and Boeing are direct competitors.  Speculations about the departure of Aerospatiale from the  project were denied by a Dasa spokesman. According to the  agreement, it is also to be examined whether other companies,  for instance from Japan or Russia, may be included in the  project.</p>

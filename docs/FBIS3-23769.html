			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by unnamed correspondent: "First Impressions: </F> Telemarathon on Assigned Subject"]    [Text] A little less than a month remains before the  elections to the Supreme Council, but the election campaign is  still somewhat like the wind in the forest: there is much noise  at the top while all is quiet at the ground level. The average  voter has not yet become interested (because he has not had the  opportunity) what kind of choice is offered to him today, or why  the future Supreme Council will be better than the current one  in reality and not in theory. Starting last Monday, then,  Channel Two of the Ukrainian television began to review all  registered movements and individuals. The television offered  voters live coverage of candidates in the Pryrichnyy election  district No. 14.    Let us state from the start that the candidates from that  district (as well as their voters) struck out with this  broadcast. First of all, because they were the first ones in  this telemarathon. By the time the elections come around, the  people (at least those who were able to see that broadcast) will  have long forgotten their impressions of the candidates.  Unfortunately, it fell to that district to go first.    It missed out on the broadcast time, as well. On this  subject, candidate Georgiy Andreev declared openly that for this  extremely important broadcast the Ukrainian television had  purposefully selected the hour in which the smallest possible  number of viewers would see their candidates. What is surprising  is that under pressure from voters the Ukrainian television  changed its schedule for other districts.    Finally, the organization of the broadcast also turned out  to  be the proverbial first try. The television not only failed to  inform viewers about the candidates' platforms (even though the  broadcast was called "Candidates' Platforms") but did not even  make an effort to represent those respectable people as normal  human beings.    Instead of showing us individuals, the program was dominated  by guesswork, having put to the candidates a question (which  sounded more like an attempt to embarrass them): who is still  watching and listening to you?    If the goal of the Ukrainian television had been to  discourage them, it achieved it fully.</p>

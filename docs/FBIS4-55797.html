			<p>BFN     [Text] The Executive Committee of the KNSB [Confederation  of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria] decided today to call  off mass strike actions until parliament reaches a final  decision on the fate of the Lyuben Berov cabinet, but the KNSB  structures are to remain ready to strike.    The protests that are planned to begin on 25 May in various  parts of the country are to be supported by KNSB union  federations and regional structures. This decision was adopted  after the Executive Committee had reached the view that at the  moment no parliamentary majority exists and that the country has  no legitimate government able to adopt responsible decisions.</p>

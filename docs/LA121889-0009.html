			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS SONG IS YOUR SONG AND SHOULD BE EVERYONE'S;  </P> <P> ANTHEM: WE OUGHT TO SCRAP 'THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER,' BUT NOT FOR 'AMERICA THE  BEAUTIFUL.' LOOK INSTEAD TO OUR MASTER SONGWRITER, WOODIE GUTHRIE.  </P> <P> A font of originality, Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) is again watering the  nation's imagination. He wants to change the national anthem from "The Star  Spangled Banner" to "America the Beautiful." His idea, proposed as legislation  in Congress last January, has won the support of 315,000 Parade magazine  readers who responded favorably to the question, should we change our national  anthem? About 74,000 said "no".  </P> <P> The Jacobs theory -- that "The Star Spangled Banner" is a martial song that  should be scrapped in favor of "America the Beautiful," which "celebrates our  power and our ability to live and work in peace" -- is on the mark, but only by  half.  </P> <P> The Star Spangled War Song deserves to be ditched, or at least dispatched to  the parade grounds at West Point. But its replacement with "America the  Beautiful" is little improvement. What's the appeal of a psuedo-patriotic hymn  that turns God into a nationalistic prop and America into a surreal Shangri-La?  </P> <P> "America the Beautiful" is provincial, not national. It's about Colorado. The  words were written by a sub-minor poet -- Katherine Lee Bates -- who ascended  Pikes Peak in 1893 and was apparently turned giddy by the rarefied heights.  </P> <P> What's odd is that the congressman, strong in democratic populism, didn't come  up with the one song that gives full expression to the popular will: "This Land  is Your Land."  </P> <P> Woodie Guthrie's treasure, called "the greatest song ever written about  America" by Bruce Springsteen, begins with the familiar lines:  </P> <P>  This land is your land, this land is my land,  </P> <P>  From California to the New York island  </P> <P>  From the redwood forests to the gulfstream waters,  </P> <P>  This land was made for you and me.  </P> <P>  Then, these verses:  </P> <P>  As I was walking that ribbon of highway,  </P> <P>  I saw above me the endless skyway,  </P> <P>  I saw below me that golden valley,  </P> <P>  This land was made for you and me.  </P> <P>  I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps  </P> <P>  To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,  </P> <P>  And all around me a voice was sounding,  </P> <P>  This land was made for you and me.  </P> <P>  Singable, hand-clappingly lively and populist, Guthrie's work is a fit  national anthem because it is a song of the folk. "I am out to sing songs that  will prove to you that this is your world," he wrote in the early 1950s when  the Library of Congress established a collection of his recordings. "I am out  to sing the songs that make you take pride in yourself and in your work. And  the songs I sing are made up for the most part by all sorts of folks like you."  </P> <P> From 1936 to 1952, Woody Guthrie produced about 1,000 songs, every one of them  as truthful as the minstrel who sang them. The songs were messages of  affirmation. "The main secret about singing," Guthrie wrote, "ain't so much to  have other folks listen as it is to pick up your own spirits."  </P> <P> With such a national anthem as "This Land is Your Land," the picking up will  lift the country higher than any bombs bursting in air or purple mountain  majesties, whatever they are.  </P></p>

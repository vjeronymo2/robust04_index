			<p>BFN     [Text] The 36th provincial people's government executive  meeting was convened on the morning of 21 June and was chaired  by Governor Ruan Chongwu.    The meeting discussed a draft of the Hainan Special Economic  Region Regulations on Protection of Old People, People Injured  on the Job, and Unemployed People. It also made proposals on  levying civil aviation and airport management and construction  fees.    Executive Vice Governor Wang Xiaofeng; Vice Governors Wang  Xueping, Mao Zhijun, and Liu Mingqi; and provincial people's  government Secretary General Cui Hongjun attended the meeting,  which also was attended as guests by persons in charge of  various provincial people's government departments and units  concerned.    The meeting adopted in principle and decided to promulgate  as  a provincial government order for implementation the  abovementioned Hainan Special Economic Region Regulations on  Protection of Old People, People Injured on the Job, and  Unemployed People. The promulgation of these regulations is  believed to be exerting a positive impact on the development of  the province's social security system.    Since becoming a province, Hainan has witnessed rapid  aviation and civil aviation development. In order to further  strengthen the province's airport management and construction,  and to introduce airport management and construction fees, the  meeting deliberated and studied all the relevant issues in this  regard and decided to levy airport management and construction  fees on foreign and domestic flight routes, well as foreign and  domestic passengers. However, no airport management and  construction fees will be levied on flight routes inside the  province. The airport management and construction fees thus  collected are to be used for improving airport safety  facilities, airport technical renovation, as well as the  construction of new airports.</p>

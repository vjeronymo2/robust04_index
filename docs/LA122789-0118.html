			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INDEX BUYERS BOOST TOKYO MART  </P> <P> Share prices in Tokyo sailed ahead today, propelled by index-linked buying and  scattered buying by investment trust funds, arbitragers and individual  investors.  </P> <P> The 225-share Nikkei rose 120.32 points or 0.31% to a record 38,801.63 after  soaring 257.69 points Tuesday. Turnover today was about 900 million shares, up  from 600 million Tuesday.  </P> <P> Both high-priced and bargain stocks were magnets in brisk trade.  </P> <P> Traders attributed the two-day market revival to widespread relief over the  discount rate rise on Monday, year-end binges and bulging pocket books of  Japanese corporations and institutions.  </P></p>

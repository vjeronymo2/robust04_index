			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Pensions case at EC court THE oral hearings in the Coloroll Pension Trustees' equal pension rights case took place at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg yesterday, writes Robert Rice, Legal Correspondent. The court must decide whether equality is required only for pension benefits earned by service since May 17, 1990, the date of the Barber judgment, or for benefits which were earned by service before that date. The difference in the cost of these interpretations to British pension schemes has been estimated at Pounds 40bn. In the Barber case the court ruled that EC equal pay rules were applicable to pension claims, but only from the date of that judgment. This restriction was enshrined as a protocol in the Maastricht treaty. The Coloroll case will now be considered by an advocate general of the court. The court's final judgment is not expected until July.</p>

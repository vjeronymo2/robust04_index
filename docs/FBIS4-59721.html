			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ruba al-Husari and Ibrahim al-Humaydi: "Sources </F> in Damascus Talk of Five-Point Plan; Last Point Concerns  Normalization"]    [Excerpts] Occupied Jerusalem, Damascus -- [passage  omitted] Well-informed sources in Damascus have told AL-HAYAH  that Syria has defined a view of five sequential points to  advance negotiations with Israel. They did not rule out that  normalization would be discussed in the final stage. While an  Israeli source said yesterday that the main aim of the current  Christopher tour "is to form a joint Syrian-Israeli committee to  be entrusted with drawing up draft future border security  arrangements between the two countries." [passage omitted]    The sources added that Syrian officials have rejected a  phased withdrawal. They cited the affirmation by a Syrian  source on the eve of Christopher's arrival in Damascus that  "Syria is not willing to deal with any Israeli proposals not  containing a clear commitment to withdrawing from all the Golan  within a reasonable and acceptable period."    The sources stressed to AL-HAYAH that progress on the  Syrian-Israeli track should follow the following sequence:    -- the Israeli Knesset decision to annex the Golan and to  apply Israeli laws on the Heights should be revoked;    -- the principle should be accepted of Syria's absolute  sovereignty over the Golan territory and willingness to withdraw  completely from it should be announced;    -- the peaceful solution should be within the framework of  a comprehensive settlement on all fronts;    -- security measures on both sides of the border should be  equal, and the security of all states should be guaranteed;    -- Syria is willing to discuss the other questions related  to relations (normalization, the opening of an embassy, trade  exchange) within the framework of the land-for-peace principle.    The sources stressed that recognition of Syria's sovereignty  over the Golan is a "base" for discussing all the other  questions between the two countries. [passage omitted]</p>

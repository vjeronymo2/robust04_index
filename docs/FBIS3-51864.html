Camacho Solis'  latest communique was sent in response to the communiques  released 25 January by the EZLN's Indigenous Revolutionary  Committee -- communiques in which Commander Marcos demanded that  the government clearly state the degree to which it recognizes  the EZLN. Commander Marcos made the demand in an effort to  assess the value of any guarantees he might receive from the  government during the dialogue process.    In his communique, Camacho Solis says a proposal that will  be  released on Thursday will formalize the terms for an honest,  serious, and responsible meeting. Camacho Solis says the  groundwork is being laid for a cease-fire, and he assured the  EZLN that the government is giving humanitarian assistance to  the communities that require food and health care. Finally, he  said the communities, society, political parties, and  institutions are all working to find more respectful ways of  achieving the pacification demanded in Chiapas by way of a  national commitment toward democracy, justice, and freedom.</p>

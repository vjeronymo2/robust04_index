			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Observer: Holed up in the bunkers Diane Graham, owner of a US engineering company, has caused a minor explosion in the male-dominated recesses of the US golfing establishment. She has dared question one of the great traditions of golf clubs - restricted teeing-off times for lady golfers. Lawyers have been briefed to fight at least a dozen lawsuits which challenge a practice common at some exclusive golf clubs. The argument for restricting the ladies' rights to tee off when they want is based on a belief that women play more slowly. Off the record, old boy, they also occupy the greens for too long during the so-called 'power hours' when big business does its deals. Diane Graham, of Halbrook Country Club, is not amused. 'If you went out to the club and saw a sign that said blacks and Jewish people can't play until 2 in the afternoon, people would be outraged.' She obviously hasn't tried out the bunkers in some of the darker corners of Britain's home counties.</p>

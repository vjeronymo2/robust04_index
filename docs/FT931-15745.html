			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Economics: Higher UK input prices expected SEVERAL INDICATORS on UK inflationary pressures are published this week with producer prices figures on Tuesday expected to show another rise in raw material and fuel prices in December. However, the increase was probably not as sharp as in November when sterling's devaluation had a severe impact on the index. Then input prices rose by 2.4 per cent month-on-month, taking the annual rate of increase to 4.1 per cent. The effects of a weaker pound on commodity prices still linger and a rise of one per cent on the month is forecast for December. In spite of this, producers are not expected to pass the higher costs onto consumers and the annual rate of output price inflation is forecast to increase only slightly. Credit business figures today may add weight to anecdotal, and some statistical evidence that retail sales are recovering. However, many UK economists remain sceptical about the strength of the apparant upturn, believing that private consumption will be restrained by continuing job uncertainty and heavy personal indebtedness. In Germany retail sales figures for November are forecast to have fallen by just under 1 per cent, confirming that the hoped-for rise in retail sales after the temporary income tax was lifted in July never materialised. Other highlights of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company.

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> SLAYER OF SUSPECT WON'T BE CHARGED  </P> <P> Prosecutors have decided not to press charges against a 29-year-old Anaheim man  who fatally shot a suspected car burglar while waiting for police to arrive.  </P> <P> Harvey Dean Dunn told investigators that he tried to hold Tony M. Martinez, 20,  of Santa Ana and another suspected burglar at gunpoint in his car until police  arrived.  </P> <P> But he fired a shot when Martinez got out of the car, threatened him and began  walking toward him.  </P> <P> Martinez was pronounced dead of a single gunshot wound to the head outside an  apartment complex at 900 S. Park Circle, police said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick H. Donahue said Thursday that he concluded that Dunn  acted in self-defense because of Martinez's threats.  </P> <P> "They were definitely threatening words," Donahue said. "They were threatening  to his life."  </P> <P> Murder charges will not be filed against the second burglary suspect, Martin  Rodriguez Valdez, 23, of Santa Ana, but he has been charged with felony auto  burglary.  </P></p>

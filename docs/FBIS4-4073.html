In addition, foreign capital totalling $489 million actually  had been used, 80.8 percent more than in the same period last  year. The city's export volume reached $820 million,  registering a 23 percent increase over the corresponding period  last year.    Last year, the development of Guangzhou's foreign-related  economy and foreign trade were marked by the following five main  features: 1) The actual amount of invested capital increased by  a greater margin owing to direct investment by foreign  businessmen; 2) The scale of investment was larger and the  quality of investment projects was higher; 3) The areas in which  foreign businessmen made direct investments achieved diversified  development; 4) There was a smooth transition of foreign trade  and export to a new system, and a faster increase in exports,  changing the previous situation of insufficient exports at the  beginning of the year, and excessive increases at the end of the  year; 5) New progress was made in opening up a diversified  market. During the first quarter, Guangzhou examined and  approved the establishment of three enterprises from abroad, and  six enterprises were registered.</p>

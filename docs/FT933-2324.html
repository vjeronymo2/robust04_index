			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Izetbegovic undermines Bosnia compromise hopes BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic at the weekend cast doubt over whether he would endorse a plan for the republic's partition after international mediators failed to win concessions from Serb and Croat leaders. 'Peace is everybody's dream in Bosnia-Hercegovina, but not peace at any price,' Mr Izetbegovic told Sarajevo radio on Saturday. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, accelerated their efforts at the weekend to clinch a deal between the three leaders of Bosnia's rival communities. 'If there is no sign of getting signatures on the agreement then the meeting (tomorrow) may not take place,' Lord Owen was quoted as saying. Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, played down speculation that he would sign the 'compromise' package dividing Bosnia into three ethnic republics unless his mostly Moslem mini-state received more land. 'What was offered in Geneva we rejected and we will reject again if they make the same offer,' he said. 'I personally don't see it and I told Owen that.' But Serb and Croat leaders at the weekend reiterated their refusal to cede any more land than already agreed at the Geneva peace talks. The peace envoys met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban, in an attempt to persuade them to give the Moslems access to Adriatic ports. But Mr Boban dismissed any possibility of giving up Neum, a fishing port on Bosnia's patch of Adriatic coastline. 'We will never concede any Croatian territory,' he said. Fighting appeared to subside yesterday after separate ceasefires came into effect. But Sarajevo radio reported that 15 people were killed and 27 injured in south-western Mostar, where 50,000 Moslems are under a Croat siege.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Schlesinger puts on a brave face - Bundesbank cites market pressures and future German policy changes as reasons for cuts IF Mr Helmut Schlesinger felt any embarrassment yesterday, he hid it well at the press conference called to announce the Bundesbank's about-turn on interest rates. After months of maintaining a solidly anti-inflation stance, and asserting its determination to bring the wayward money supply under control, the German central bank has cut both its key rates under acute pressure from financial markets and, clearly, politicians. Since the cuts in the discount rate from 8.75 to 8.25 per cent and the Lombard rate from 9.75 to 9.50 per cent come as the west German economy is weakening and the east German economy recovering more slowly than hoped, Mr Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, was able to state that the consequences of the move 'should certainly fit into the present situation'. The German economy was not in a recession, but showing signs of weakness. Also giving the rate cuts - the first since 1987 - a domestic gloss was the hope that Chancellor Kohl's call for a solidarity pact, including low wage deals, with industry, unions, and regional states, to sort out the problems of unification and its financing would bear fruit. Thus Mr Schlesinger said the rate reductions, accompanied by a move to lower money market rates from 9.7 to 9.2 per cent by moving to a fixed rate tender at this week's securities repurchase operation, were also 'a certain advance concession' to possible changes in wage and fiscal policies. But he emphasised in the same breath that it was the predicament the Bundesbank had been pushed into by external market pressures that caused its move. German inflation was still 'markedly high'. Last week's inflows caused by intervention to prop up the lira in the European Monetary System had totalled some DM24bn. Thus the Bundesbank asked the Bonn government to press for a quick realignment. The government could have rejected this. 'Then our foreign exchange window would have been open today - and billions (of D-Marks) more would have poured in, and tomorrow, and the day after', Mr Schlesinger said. As it is, funds should now flow out, easing the extra strain on money supply. The fact that the Bundesbank was forced to lower its rates long before even the most optimistic observers had expected shows the extent of the predicament it was in. Last week, Mr Otmar Issing, a prominent director of the central bank, reasserted its commitment to firm money supply targets and said there was no reason yet to 'sound the all clear' on policy. Yesterday, Mr Issing did his best not to look like someone forced to eat his words. 'This was outside our calculations'. Today, the bank was in a better position than last week. 'You can forget M3 and so forth if a situation like last week continues. You have to imagine the dimensions involved'. Not that M3, the broad monetary aggregate, has been forgotten. M3's rapid growth, well outside the 3.5-5.5 per cent target range and inflated by the pressures of unification, has been a main reason for Germany's high interest rates. Yesterday, Mr Schlesinger said M3 growth may have eased slightly from the 8.5 per cent annualised rate of July, but the target would not be achieved in 1992. It would remain a medium term objective, however. The scale of the intervention needed had put at risk the Bundesbank's ability to maintain its policies. 'The amount was extraordinarily high, higher than ever before in a speculation crisis'. He added: 'We were in a situation in which we, with the strongest EMS currency and thus having to absorb all the funds, were really no longer in a position to continue our monetary policy'. He compared the inflow with the DM16bn of Bundesbank intervention during the 1973 currency crisis as the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates collapsed and the DM15bn before the last EMS realignment in 1987. Why was the Lombard not cut by more, Mr Schlesinger was asked? He said the decision to push money market rates down to 9.2 per cent at the next tender would ease foreign exchange pressures and keep these rates below the Lombard emergency funding rate. 'It is the money market rate which defines the problem on the foreign exchange market, not the Lombard rate'. Asked if he had considered resigning, Mr Schlesinger replied: 'This question does not arise for me, in view of the circumstances.' His deputy, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, said the rate cuts were not made under pressure from EC partners. 'The decision is a sovereign decision of the Bundesbank itself.' Mr Tietmeyer said the realignment showed that the EMS rules, allowing for parity adjustments when necessary, still applied. He denied it was a move against Maastricht, where EC leaders last year agreed on progress towards European monetary union. 'Until then, the EMS applies - with fixed, but adjustable rates.'</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CABLE TV COMPANIES SUE COUNTY ASSESSOR OVER INCREASES IN TAXES;  </P> <P> ASSESSMENTS: JACOBS IS ACCUSED OF A 'VENDETTA' THAT WILL BOOST CUSTOMER PRICES  AND COST TAXPAYERS. THE ASSESSOR SAYS HE'S FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF OTHER  COUNTIES.  </P> <P> Seeking at least $13 million in damages, 10 Orange County cable TV operators  sued Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs Wednesday, accusing him of waging a "vendetta"  against them by charging illegally high taxes that will boost customer prices  and cost taxpayers millions more in legal fees.  </P> <P> Cable representatives warned that the suit, filed in Orange County Superior  Court, could drag on for six years and end up forcing the county to pay $50  million to $75 million in damages, costs and backtaxes.  </P> <P> Through Deputy Assessor Ron Cooper, Jacobs declined comment on the suit. But  Jacobs, who is running for reelection in June, defended his assessments in a  campaign statement earlier this week.  </P> <P> "I'm going to see that no one gets special treatment just because they have a  lot of money to throw around," Jacobs said, in a reference to a massive media  blitz that the cable industry has undertaken to drum up public opposition to  the taxes.  </P> <P> Jacobs has said he is only following the lead of several other California  counties that have initiated similar assessment methods to more accurately  reflect the soaring value of cable properties. But the companies say no other  assessor has done it as aggressively as Jacobs.  </P> <P> While expressing confidence in their case at a news conference Wednesday, cable  representatives have continued a behind-the-scenes effort to enlist the Board  of Supervisors in an arm-twisting campaign against Jacobs.  </P> <P> Supervisor Roger R. Stanton confirmed in an interview that industry  representatives met with him for an hour last Friday, urging that the board  deny Jacobs the legal fees necessary to defend against the suit. The  representatives met with the other four supervisors in a series of private  meetings earlier this month. (Although the assessor is an independent  constitutional officer, the supervisors approve his budget.)  </P> <P> Cable spokesman John Gibbs described the lobbying effort as "simply pragmatic"  and said it had nothing to do with the strength of the industry's case. The 10  companies allege that their tax bills climbed from a total of $2.5 million last  year to $13.5 million this year because of a new -- and unconstitutional --  method of assessing their properties.  </P> <P> "We will prevail . . . , " Gibbs said, but added, "I think if they hire a law  firm and pay them a million or more we will be doing this for at least six more  years. We'll be litigating this forever."  </P> <P> Stanton said he told cable representatives during their private meeting that it  would be "absurd" to deny legal fees to Jacobs after paying to defend numerous  lawsuits against other elected officials, such as Sheriff Brad Gates.  </P> <P> "All of the sudden we don't do it with Jacobs? Do you have any idea how that  would look?" Stanton said he told them. "As a citizen I would be outraged that  the board is favoring one industry."  </P> <P> As for the industry's public relations campaign, which has consisted of  full-page newspaper ads and thousands of mailers urging residents to complain  to the supervisors, Stanton dismissed it as "nonsense."  </P> <P> At issue in the legal battle is a method of computing the tax value of a cable  company's property, including buildings, equipment, cable lines and public  rights of way granted by the county to lay those lines.  </P> <P> Under Jacob's new assessment method, the county now also considers how a cable  company's value is enhanced by its exclusive franchise to provide service to an  area.  </P> <P> The county contends that, mostly because of that franchise, the cable companies  have tripled or quadrupled in market value since the late 1970s, as reflected  in the selling prices of companies that have changed ownership in recent years.  </P> <P> The industry contends that company values have soared largely because of  intangibles, such as business enterprise and community goodwill engendered by  good service.  </P></p>

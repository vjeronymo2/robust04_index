			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 1 SAPA -- Two Eskom [Electricity  Supply Commission] protective services employees suspended on  Friday pending the Goldstone Commission investigation into the  cancelled arms sale that could have seen 1,000 automatic weapons  sold to kwaZulu, have been relieved of their duties for their  "serious error of judgement".    Eskom spokesman Kevin Morgan said on Friday night the  service's departmental manager and the employee who negotiated  the arms deal had, however, acted "above board".    He would not identify the arms dealer other than saying he  was from Johannesburg.</p>

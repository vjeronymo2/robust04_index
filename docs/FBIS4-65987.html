			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- France reserves the right to  resume nuclear testing, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said on  Tuesday [24 May], opening a debate in parliament on the  country's military programme from 1995 until 2000.    Balladur said France was "not under any international  constraints" on nuclear testing," alluding to a dispute between  his right-wing government and socialist President Francois  Mitterrand, who opposes a resumption of tests.    "I can assure you that this freedom of choice (to resume  testing) will be preserved," Balladur said.    France has observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since  April 1992, along with the United States, Russia and Britain.  China carried out a nuclear test on October 5 last year.    Mitterrand, who under the constitution has sole power to  decide on testing, said recently his successor would in any case  be unable to order a resumption because his hands would be tied  by the 1995 renewal of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to  be followed by a nuclear test ban treaty.    Mitterrand will step down in May 1995 and his successor is  expected to be a conservative.    Balladur told parliament that the military planning bill,  which calls for an increase in spending of 0.5 percent, urged "a  major unprecedented effort" to simulate and miniaturise the  nuclear weapons of the future which would guarantee "the  credibility of our nuclear arsenal."    The Gaullist component of the ruling right-wing coalition,  the Rally for the Republic (RPR), has campaigned for a  resumption of testing, but RPR parliamentary leader Bernard Pons  said Tuesday his government would vote for the bill.    Nuclear test campaigner Jacques Baumel, vice-chairman of the  National Assembly's defence committee, would agree to withdraw  an amendment calling for a resumption of tests in 1995 to  acquire simulation capacity, Pons said.    He said an overwhelming majority of RPR MPs favoured a  resumption of testing to develop a system of simulation, but  that it would be up to the next president to decide.    Defence Minister Francois Leotard told parliament Tuesday  that in 2000, France would have the second biggest defense  budget in the West, after the United States, and "the biggest  force on the European continent."    He said there would be nearly 580,000 soldiers and civilians  serving in the armed forces.</p>

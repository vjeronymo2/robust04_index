Asked if the IRA suported a cease-fire, Mr Adams said: "I  don't speak for the IRA, I speak for Sinn Fein." But he added  "the largest military presence in the north of Ireland is the  British Army, followed by the allies of the Loyalists and then  the IRA. I want to see them all disarmed."    Asked if the British should leave Northern Ireland, Mr Adams  said that was not necessary if they became part of the peace  process.    "They have to become the persuaders. Once they become part  of the peace process then we will be able to build a peaceful  country."    Asked what he thought John Major was thinking, Mr Adams  joked: "Probably how long he will stay in office."    He added that he hoped that Major was willing to take the  necessary steps to bring peace to Ireland. "If John Major is  willing to go the extra mile, I am too. Let's bridge the gap,"  he said.</p>

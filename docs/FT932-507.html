			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / IMF ready to agree Russian reform aid THE International Monetary Fund is this week expected to agree to grant Russia the first stage of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) lending facility, in the first large wave of international financial assistance to promote economic reform. The so-called systemic transformation facility is being prepared so it can be agreed before next week's summit in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading industrialised states. It is thought the IMF board will meet in the next few days to grant the facility, which would form the centrepiece of the summit's commitment to help promote Russian reform. The pressure on the IMF to agree it has been increased by the stiff opposition to a US proposal to set up a Dollars 4bn fund to help the privatisation of big state-owned enterprises in Russia. G7 officials say a much smaller fund, close to Dollars 500m, is being discussed as a face-saving measure to satisfy the US administration. The systemic transformation facility was one of the most important measures agreed at an April meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers in Tokyo. They decided then that it should be available in two tranches of Dollars 1.5bn. It is conditional upon Russia delivering to the IMF credible promises that it will tackle inflation, restrict credit to ailing enterprises and reduce its budget deficit. G7 finance ministers hope this will help jump-start economic stabilisation in Russia and so make it easier for Russia to draw upon two further IMF facilities worth about Dollars 10bn.</p>

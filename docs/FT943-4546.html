			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Halifax held to 18% rise by higher expenses Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, yesterday reported an increase of 18 per cent in pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31, taking the total from Pounds 411m to Pounds 486m. The percentage increase was less marked that that reported by some other mortgage lenders, but as has been true across the sector, it was primarily attributable to a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts, from Pounds 156m to Pounds 56m. Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, said that Halifax had produced strong results against a very weak housing market. There was a small increase in net interest receivable, from Pounds 738m to Pounds 783m. This reflected a narrower margin - 2.29 per cent compared with 2.31 per cent - on a higher volume of business. Administrative expenses rose from Pounds 357m to Pounds 385m, an increase of 8 per cent, while other income and charges fell back slightly from Pounds 183m to Pounds 176m. Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager, said that there had perhaps been a slight fall in the sale of endowment mortgages which had affected commission earnings. Much of the increase in expenses came from the rising cost of meeting financial services regulators' requirements, he said. In January, Halifax will take on all the compliance costs when it sets up a wholly-owned life insurance subsidiary, ending its current arrangement by which it sells financial services policies produced by Standard Life. Mr Gilchrist said that if the mortgage market remained flat, then the savings side of the society's business could become increasingly important and an area of growth. In the six months to July 31, Halifax's retail balances fell slightly by Pounds 151m, even when interest automatically credited to customers' accounts is included. Mr Gilchrist made it clear, however, that the society was determined to maintain its retail savings base. It had, for example, increased savers' rates in July. As a result of the slight outflow while the society was competing for mortgage business, the proportion of funds raised on the wholesale money markets rose to 21.1 per cent. This is well within the regulatory limits on societies' wholesale funding ratios, but higher than the 15.2 per cent in the 1993 interim results.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Hong Kong Urban Engineering Institute, </F> Baptist Institute, and Study Friendship Society (Xueyou She)]    [Excerpts] Those concerned at the Hong Kong City  Engineering Institute, the Baptist Institute, and the Study  Friendship Society recently did a study of citizenship education  entitled "The Political Transition Period in Hong Kong:  Political Attitudes of Senior High School Students." [passage  omitted]    Approximately 50 percent of senior high school students  support direct elections to all levels of the Legislative  Council and Legislative Council members: 1994 regional  legislative councils (53 percent), 1995 municipal and regional  councils (51 percent) and 1995 Legislative Council bureaus (48  percent); however, 30 percent of those interviewed had no  opinion. When calculated on a scale from zero to one hundred,  (where zero represents all disagree strongly and 100 represents  all agree strongly), a rather low 62 points of students gave  average support for third-level Legislative Council direct  elections. Originally, it was generally thought students were  rather idealized; therefore, 62-point support was quite far from  our predictions. More students born in Hong Kong support direct  elections (by five points) than those born in China.  Statistically, this is a notable difference, indicating that  cultural and attitudinal factors affect whether senior high  school students support direct elections. [passage omitted]    Although 38 percent of senior high school students agree  that  "the Basic Law can ensure rule by law of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region after 1997" and 50 percent agree "one  country with two systems in Hong Kong is feasible."  Nevertheless, less than one-third of senior high school students  agree that "the government in Beijing respects the Sino-British  Joint Accord" (29 percent) and "will respect the Basic Law" (28  percent). On a zero to 100 scale, the average value of  confidence in China's promises by those interviewed was 51. More  students born in China (by eight points) than in Hong Kong  believe China's promises. Likewise, this is a statistically  significant difference. From this it can be seen that senior  high school students' differing opinions regarding support of  direct elections and confidence in China's promises are related  to place of birth. [passage omitted]    Approximately 50 percent of those interviewed agree "if a  communist desires to publish a speech supporting communism, he  should be allowed to do so" ( 49 percent) and "when a communist  is elected legally as a Hong Kong Legislative Council member,  the residents of Hong Kong should allow him to hold office" (51  percent). The Hong Kong government has promoted citizenship  education for eight years now. Surprisingly, only 60 percent of  those interviewed agree "minorities should have the freedom to  criticize majority decisions." Senior high school students'  average political leniency value was 60 on a zero to 100 scale,  which is rather low. The concepts of freedom and democracy in  middle-school education are not broadly accepted by senior  high-school students. [passage omitted]    Some 30 percent of senior high school students oppose  lowering the voting age to 18 years; 25 percent had no opinion  and 45 percent agreed. Comparatively speaking, the senior high  school students who disagreed were mainly females or those 18  years and older. As expected, they have no intention of  registering to vote or casting ballots in the 1995 elections.  The aforementioned results indicate that citizenship education  has not been effectively promoted among senior high school  students, or else perhaps the students were unable to accept  sufficient citizenry education training as expected. [passage  omitted]    Senior high school students will vote for Legislative  Council  members according to the following factors: Record of past  experience (87 percent), political affiliation (86 percent),  degree of education (78 percent), professional qualifications  (73 percent), political party background (56 percent), eloquence  (41 percent), relationship to China (40 percent), age (36  percent), glamour and looks (13 percent), and sex (nine  percent). Senior high school students pay relatively greater  attention to the first four "rational factors" in voting for  Legco members. A "candidate's inclinations" and "inclinations  towards matters" more strongly influence students' voter  behavior rather than "political party inclination." [passage  omitted]    Some 69 percent of those interviewed indicated that if they  were qualified to vote in the 1995 elections, they would  register to vote in the 1995 Legco elections; 75 percent of them  indicated that if they register to vote in the 1995 Legco  elections, they will do so. If we subtract the influence of the  "social desirability effect," fewer will actually register to  vote and cast ballots. This brings up the old issue of how to  turn intention to vote into actual voting in the Hong Kong  environment. Although the older the senior high school student,  the relatively greater the indication to register to vote and  cast a ballot, but the relationships therein are not so clear.  School seniority has a positively clear influence: Those  interviewed of higher seniority comparatively tend to register  and vote. Other social and cultural factors such as sex, place  of birth, religious beliefs and family income had no significant  influence. [passage omitted]    Hong Kong senior high school students lack confidence in the  Chinese Government, engendering rather low political tolerance.  Rather low political tolerance is unfavorable to promote  democracy in society. Their low support for direct elections and  a lower voting age reflects insufficient citizenship education  in school. On the contrary, they indicate a rational side to  voting for Legislative Council members. They have appropriate  support for registering to vote and casting ballots. In the  future 1994 and 1995 elections, this group of new electorates  can be seen as politically conservative. They will not be  aroused by those political parties who try to please the public  with claptrap. [passage omitted]</p>

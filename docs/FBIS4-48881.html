			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scholar Li  Zhibin has recently been appointed as the chairman of the  Sino-American Computer and International Software Development  Bilateral Committee.    This was announced here today by A. Nattrass, executive  board  member of the Sino-American Trade Development Council.    Li, an associate professor of the Institute of Software of  the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was chosen from an impressive  list of nominees from the United States and China.    Nattrass said that Li's appointment is a credit to the very  high standard of expertise in China in the field of  international software development.    Robert E. Goodman, chairman of the Sino-American Trade  Development Council, said that the 12-member bilateral  committee, composed of distinguished computer experts from both  the United States and China, would play a vital role in  advancing cooperation between the two countries in the field of  international software and computer development.    The chairman also paid tribute to the Chinese Government's  efforts and commitment to advancing technology to meet the needs  of the computer age and said that U.S. business needs the  Chinese to collaborate on mutually beneficial partnerships in  the vital area of computer and software development.    At a press conference here today, Nattrass also said that  the  Sino-American Trade Development Council has recommended to  President Bill Clinton to renew China's most favored nation  (MFN) status unconditionally and permanently, and his council  predicted that the United States would do so.    The Sino-American Trade Development Council was formed last  year in Washington with a goal of helping set up cooperation  between China and America in the fields of economic development,  cultural understanding and business relations as well as  bridging the gap between medium and small business enterprises  of the two countries.</p>

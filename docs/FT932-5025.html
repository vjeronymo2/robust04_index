			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Leonardo falls flat A MUSICAL about Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) promises painting by numbers, but threatens to put the great draftsman in the singing and daubing Rolf Harris mould. Now at the Strand Theatre, 'Leonardo The Musical: a Portrait of Love' has arrived, lamentably reworked from its opening at the Old Fire Station in Oxford last November. This musical is less exciting than watching Leonardo's paint dry - the show lacks passion, the songs want subtlety and the issues beg credibility. The story fixes on the relationship between Leonardo and the Milanese Francesco Melzi, 'a very handsome boy and much beloved by him,' according to Giorgio Vasari the art historian. When the Florentine Francesco del Giocondo commissions a portrait of his wife, Mona Lisa, Leonardo falls in love and fathers her child. Lisa marries Giocondo in haste, Leonardo repents at leisure, and Melzi pines like a lost courtier in the blue distance of a Renaissance fresco. This amounts to 'The Patron, the Wife, her Painter and his Friend.' 'Leonardo' is a wonderful idea gone astray. The ultimate Renaissance man, all the unfinished work in Florence and Milan, 'that' painting with her smile. But a glance at the period shows a fine opportunity squandered. Leonardo was a contemporary of Il Perugino in Umbria, of Raphael and Michelangelo at Rome, Bramante in Milan, of Andrea del Sarto and Bartolommeo in Florence, and of the Bellini family in Venice. He met Machiavelli at Cesare Borgia's court in 1502. Not one appears in the plot. It has been written as if the Renaissance was not happening. The plot fails to excite on its own terms. Leonardo's love of Lisa and his love of painting sit uneasily together. He did actually have music playing while she posed sometime between 1500 and 1504. But neither songs nor action dramatise the creative process or the relations between the principals. The lyrics beggar belief: 'She's a flower on the tree, the very heart and soul of me', Leonardo sings. The dialogue is a close second; 'My late 'usband, Gawd rest 'is soul' chirps a cockney Landlady. Rolf Harris aside, the other antipodean connection is the show's finance from the people of the guano and phosphate rich South Pacific island of Nauru. Only the United Arab Emirates has a higher per capita income, and the island's 8,000 inhabitants are celebrating 25 years of independence. Now there is an interesting musical waiting within their own eight square miles, a tale of Australian exploitation, phosphate fortunes, and coral island romance.</p>

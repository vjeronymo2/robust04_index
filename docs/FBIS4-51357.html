			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "990 Morning News" program] </F>   [Text] The municipal planning commission, economic  commission, foreign affairs office, public security bureau,  tourism administration, and foreign investment office recently  issued a joint circular, in which they called for continuing  efforts to further halt and remedy covert overseas or  out-of-country travel at government expense, as an important  aspect of the effort to curb unhealthy tendencies.    The circular urged party and government leaders at all  levels  to improve their understanding, to strengthen leadership over  the screening of overseas or out-of-country travel on government  business, and to further halt and remedy covert overseas or  out-of-country travel at government expense.</p>

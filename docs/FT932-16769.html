			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax on gilts income I AM 65 years and my gross income is above Pounds 14,200, the higher personal / married man's allowance for this age. My wife and I have joint holding of gilts. We share the income. If I arrange for the whole gross income to go to my wife I can reduce my income to Pounds 14,200 gross. Is this allowed or must I sell the joint holding and repurchase in my wife's name? My wife is 63 and still working. Both our basic personal allowances (Pounds 3,445) are used up. As well as having the interest paid into an account in your wife's sole name (to which you have no access), you would have to transfer the stock into her sole name. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR68 (Accrued-income scheme). The phone number of the Bonds and Stocks Office (Blackpool, FY3 9YP) is 0253-697333. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

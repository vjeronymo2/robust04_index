			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (19): Emphasis switches to smaller engines - Merits of the latest business vehicles on the market assessed by Stuart Marshall ALL THE emphasis among business car buyers and users is now on vehicles costing no more than Pounds 19,250 and having engines of less than 2-litres cylinder capacity. This is nothing new for fleet cars but the business car user has become uncomfortably aware that going over Pounds 19,250 and two litres brings an unwelcome rise in personal taxation. As a result, the best sellers among executive cars are now the smaller-engined ones. They include the newly facelifted and much improved Rover 820s and such 4-cylinder familiars as the Granada and Carlton, Audi 100, BMW 518, Mercedes 190, Saab 9000 and Volvo 940. Some even slip into the under Pounds 19,250 category when fitted with automatic transmission. This is something fewer and fewer business users, faced with city centre crawls and the aggravation of motorway tailbacks, are prepared to do without. There is no doubt that a modern 4-cylinder engine, often multi-valved and fitted with contra-rotating balance shafts, performs so smoothly it is hard to distinguish from an in-line or V6. This is certainly the case up to moderately high revolutions. It would, of course, be idle to suggest there is absolutely no difference at all between driving, say, a 2.7-litre Rover Sterling and an 820i, or a 2-litre Peugeot 605SLi and 3-litre 605 SEV. Of course, there is in terms of sheer acceleration and unusable top speed. But most user-choosers have decided it is not enough to make the tax penalty worthwhile, even if their employers should be in a position to provide the larger-engined car. Many front-wheel-driven executive class cars of similar size and price are so similar that the choice may depend more on subjective matters such as appearance and image than on actual performance. The manufacturers may be reluctant to acknowledge it, but there is not a great deal of difference in performance or general ambience between a Rover 820i and a Lancia Thema, a Saab 9000i and an Alfa-Romeo 164. Standard power steering makes them easy to drive and park; they have comfortable seats, electric windows, big boots, effective heating-ventilation systems and decent stereo radio/tape players and, most important, are quiet enough for easy listening on motorway journeys. The same can be said of 2-litre front-wheel-driven cars whose cheaper, smaller-engined versions are either the staple of company fleets - the Vauxhall Cavaliers and Peugeot 405s - or family cars. Now that the bitter conflict between Nissan's erstwhile UK distributor and Nissan Motor has been resolved, the admirable, British-made Nissan Primera deserves to pick up a lot of sales in the business market this year. From the entry model 1.6L to potent 2.0e ZX, the Primera - every one 16-valve-engined and power-steered - sets a class standard for refinement, build quality, handling and equipment. There are, of course, still some executive-type under 2-litre cars of individual character. Among the front-wheel drives, the Citroen XM and the veteran Saab 900 spring to mind. For users who prefer rear-wheel drive (or who never think about such things), the BMW 518i and 520i look and feel athletic, the Mercedes 190 oozes status and quality; and the roomy Volvo 940 carries real but undefinable overtones of safety and environmental acceptability. If size is not first priority, the user-chooser is well catered for by highly specified cars such as the new Audi 80, BMW 3-Series, Fiat Tempra, Lancia Dedra and the Rover 200/400 Series. They offer everything that most business drivers expect of larger cars except their bulk. If not more than two people are regularly to travel long distances in them, they are often to be preferred. They feel nimbler on winding roads and are easier to park. One of the best newcomers in this segment is the SEAT Toledo, in effect a Spanish-built Volkswagen between Golf and Passat in size and most competitively priced. Other new entrants that would appeal to younger business motorists include the Citroen ZX, Honda Civic 1.6 VTi and, insurers willing, such hot hatchbacks as the 16-valve-engined Renault Clio, Fiat Tipo, Ford's admirable Escort RS2000 and the new Vauxhall Astra 2.0 GSi. At the moment, Japanese makes are handicapped in the business market simply because they are Japanese and most companies feel they should support British or at least European manufacturers. In so doing they deprive their employees of an opportunity to drive cars that are often ahead of class rivals for creative design as well as for reliability, refinement and equipment.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / A journey along Europe's fault line: Edward Mortimer travelled through the linguistic borderlands between Romance and Teutonic and found the scars of history everywhere THE IDEA first came to me 10 years ago, on the way back from a holiday in Italy. We found ourselves driving through a series of countries or regions - Switzerland, Alsace, Luxembourg, Belgium - where Romance languages (mainly French) overlap with Teutonic ones (German and Dutch). It occurred to me that this was the great historic and cultural divide in western Europe. On one side of us were lands where the Roman empire had put down such deep roots that, 1,500 years after its disappearance, people still spoke languages derived from Latin. On the other were the linguistic descendants of those 'barbarian' tribes which were never fully Romanised, but stuck to their Germanic speech. I remembered my old headmaster, Robert Birley, telling us about the Treaty of Verdun in 843AD, when Charlemagne's empire was divided between his three grandsons. Charles the Bald got the west, which became France; Louis 'the German' got the lands east of the Rhine; and the eldest, Lothair, got a long, thin middle kingdom stretching from Friesland to the border of Calabria. 'And you know,' Birley would say, swinging his spectacles with excitement, 'the whole of subsequent European history can be seen as a struggle between the heirs of Charles and Louis to control the kingdom of Lothair.' The kingdom of Lothair: the great battleground of western Europe, but also its richest, most productive region - today's 'golden banana.' The clash of cultures, I thought, had been both destructive and creative on a dazzling scale. The land was soaked in blood, but from it sprang cathedrals, cloth halls, colleges, chateaux. There is, after all, something stimulating about cultural hybridity - perhaps something quintessentially European. Certainly this is the region where 'Europe' has aroused the greatest enthusiasm: it offers peaceful exchange instead of violent conflict, and makes dilemmas about national identity less agonising, because less absolute. I formed a plan to explore the region a little more systematically: to attempt a journey along the fault line, observing in greater detail both its historical residue (buildings, statues, inscriptions) and the way it is experienced by those who live on it today. This summer a sabbatical leave from the FT gave me the chance to do it. Leaving England on May 28, I started at Dunkirk (an old Flemish port, now the northernmost city in France) and for the next five weeks worked my way south and east along the language border, travelling a short distance each day, usually by bus or train, sometimes on foot, staying in pensions or cheap hotels, or quite often - unashamed of my grey hair - in youth hostels. (There is in fact no age limit, other than one's own tolerance for dormitory life). My proudest moment came when I strode into an Alsatian village, weighed down by my rucksack, and made friends with a resident who turned out to be the German writer and comedian, Philipp Sontag. I asked if there was a path through the forest to the next village, and he consulted his neighbour, introducing me with the words 'hier ist ein englischer Wanderer.' I did not quite fulfil my ambition of carrying on 'until I meet my first Slav.' Time ran out on me in South Tyrol/Alto Adige, the predominantly German-speaking province of northern Italy. But I did reach Innichen/San Candido, founded as a Benedictine monastery in the 8th century 'to Christianise the Slavs.' Evidently they were there then, even if later they were pushed east. From the summit of Mount Helm (Monte Elmo), I had a fine view of the river Drava flowing down through Austria towards Slovenia, Croatia and the Danube; and also of the Italian-Austrian frontier, running eastward along the top of the Carnic Alps. From there on, it coincides with the language border. As the crow flies, the distance from Dunkirk to Innichen is 540 miles. The language border, anything but crow-like, is probably double that. Yet in remarkably few places between those two points does it coincide with a national frontier. Perhaps the only stretch where it incontrovertibly does so is between the Matterhorn and the Corno Gries, where the high Alps form a natural barrier between Italy and a purely German-speaking part of Switzerland. To the west French is spoken on both sides of the frontier, and to the east Italian. The other obvious exception was the short stretch right at the beginning of my route, between Dunkirk and Lille. Here France marches directly with Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. But even that statement has at once to be qualified, because the land on the French side of the frontier is also Flanders. True, you do not hear the Flemish dialect spoken there much these days, but almost any middle-aged native will tell you that his parents spoke it, even if he himself no longer does. In other words, when the frontier was drawn people spoke the same language on both sides, but over time the French language has imposed itself on the French side. Three hundred miles further on, in Alsace, I observed the same process at work, but at an earlier stage. There you cannot help hearing German spoken - or rather the Alsatian dialect, 'related to German,' as some Alsatians will tell you. But the people speaking it are almost invariably over 50. Their children understand it, and may reply in kind if spoken to in it, but feel more natural speaking French among themselves. Which means, of course, that the grandchildren are usually not learning it at all. Thus the French state, with its firm insistence on a single national language and culture, is gradually pushing the language border north and east. In another generation it should fully coincide with the state frontier. If the process has further to go in Alsace than in French Flanders it is because for nearly half a century, between 1870 and 1918, Alsace and northern Lorraine were incorporated into Germany, and their inhabitants firmly taught to think of themselves as German. That experience was briefly but much more brutally repeated in 1940-44. Ironically enough, this second dose of Germanisation, under Nazi rule, may have sealed the fate of Alsace's German cultural identity. The Alsatians emerged from it doubly traumatised. In many ways being part of the Third Reich was worse than being merely occupied: Alsatians were liable, for instance, to conscription into the Reichswehr, sometimes even into SS units. But once liberated and reunited with France they found themselves tainted with guilt by association, when not accused of direct complicity in Nazi crimes. Nothing could have been more politically incorrect, in post-war France, than to declare oneself German. Hence the insistence that the Alsatian dialect is not actually German, only related to it. And hence the indignation which drove the father of a friend of mine - a retired village baker - to protest formally to his MP when a well-known French actress opined recently, on television, that the Alsatians were 'really German.' The contrast with South Tyrol is striking. There too a historically German-speaking region finds itself, as a result of the first world war, within the borders of a non-German nation state. There too the spoken language is a dialect, if anything less easily understood than Alsatian by a visitor from Germany. But no one in South Tyrol tries to tell you it is a separate language 'related to German.' On the contrary, the majority unhesitatingly identify themselves as German-speakers and exercise their right to have their children educated in that language. They have to learn Italian as their first foreign language, but this is reciprocated by the Italian-speaking minority, who are obliged to learn German. Every street and place name is written up in both languages, and it is actually the German-speakers who are now contesting this, on the grounds that many of the Italian names are 'artificial,' invented under Mussolini. The administration is bilingual, with fixed quotas of jobs at various levels for the different language communities. The province enjoys broad autonomy, and the German-speaking Sudtiroler Volkspartei is permanently in power. There is even an open, if not too serious, nostalgia cult for the days of Austrian rule: in a bookshop in Meran (Merano) I was able to buy a 1993 Franz Joseph calendar, inscribed 'Dem guten alten Kaiser zur Erinnerung.' (In rememberance of the good old Kaiser.) Why are such things possible in Italy, but not in France? Because Italy was on the losing side in the second world war, and because the German identity of South Tyrol is associated with Austria rather than with Germany. Whereas in Alsace the moral burden of association with fascism fell entirely on Germany, obliging the local population to suppress their German identity and proclaim their Frenchness, in South Tyrol it fell, if anything, more heavily on Italy. The Italian elite were anxious to dissociate themselves from Mussolini's policies, including his attempt to Italianise the South Tyrol by forced assimilation and colonisation. The local Germans, on the other hand, were largely spared any association with Hitler. It was only in 1943, after Italy switched sides, that Hitler annexed South Tyrol. Before that, in 1939, he had agreed with Mussolini that each South Tyrol family should be given the choice (die Option) between emigration and complete Italianisation: an episode still remembered with great bitterness. After the war Austria, as an independent 'liberated' state, was able to negotiate an agreement under which Italy allowed those who had emigrated to return, and promised regional autonomy. Although this agreement was not fully implemented until 1972 (after a period of low-level terrorism in the 1960s) it put the problem in a legal and psychological context different from that of Alsace. One noticeable thing about my route was that it lay not only well inside the limes of the Roman empire, which ran along the Rhine and the Danube, but also outside the Staatsgrenze of present-day Germany. In fact I did make two day-trips into the federal republic, but they were rather in the nature of pilgrimages: to Aachen, where Charlemagne is buried, and to Trier, which was the capital of Roman Gaul. Both are today, and have been for many centuries, purely German cities. The fact that the linguistic frontier is located south and west of them testifies to the thorough Germanisation, in the Dark Ages, of what had been Roman frontier provinces. That today's political frontier passes so close to them testifies to the politico-military success of France, and failure of Germany, in modern history. The French state expanded north and east into German-speaking territory during the 16th and 17th centuries, when Germany was divided and weakened by the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War. The creation of a strong German state in the late 19th century came too late to reverse this process, although its attempt to do so was defeated only with terrible bloodshed, in three successive Franco-German wars. But while the French state absorbed significant numbers of German-speakers, it never incorporated all the French-speakers in Europe, except for a brief period after the French revolution. Such an aim would have meant little to Henri II, who occupied Metz in 1552, or even to Louis XIV, who gave France more or less its present frontiers. To them land might be of strategic or economic interest, but the language spoken by its inhabitants among themselves was of little consequence. Educated people could be relied on to communicate in a language of high culture - Latin, or later French - whatever their mother tongue might be. In the Thomaskirche in Strasbourg is a magnificent sculpture by Pigalle: the mausoleum of the Marechal de Saxe. It shows France in tears, trying to hold back the marshal from his tomb. Her banners fly victoriously aloft, while her foes - lion of Holland, leopard of England, eagle of Austria - are hurled downwards in defeat. Saxe was the main French general in the war of the Austrian succession, in the 1740s. Oddly enough in Brussels, in the Musee Communal, there is a print celebrating France's defeat and Austria's victory in that same war. It shows Charles de Lorraine, the Austrian governor, entering the city, and declares that 'Ce pais desole sous le joug de la France, jouit d'un doux repos apres sa delivrance.' (This country laid waste under the yoke of France enjoys a sweet repose after its deliverance.) For both sides to claim victory is not unusual. What interested me was the linguistic cross-over: Saxe, a German princeling, devoted his life to winning land and glory for the king of France, while the Belgian poetaster found it equally natural to denounce the 'yoke of France' in French couplets. Fifty years later things had changed. The French 'nation' sprang into existence, got rid of its king, and set off on a crusade to liberate the rest of Europe. But while more distant and indubitably foreign countries were turned, first into sister republics, then into satellite kingdoms, France itself also expanded, especially into areas where French was spoken. Brussels found itself in the 'departement de la Dyle,' Namur in the 'departement de Sambre-et-Meuse'; the Swiss Jura became the 'departement du Mont-Terrible,' and Luxembourg, rather charmingly, the 'departement des Forets.' But France had to retreat after Napoleon's defeat. In the half-century that followed, the three buffer states of Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland emerged in their modern form. In all three both French and German are spoken, alongside other languages, but the form of coexistence is different in each case. Luxembourg is the odd one out, the smallest and perhaps also the happiest. It has its own national language, which is related to German and which everybody speaks. But nearly everybody speaks French and German as well. French tends to be used for official purposes, German for more informal ones. There seems to be no sense of compulsion about it, and no one takes offence at being addressed in one language rather than another. Things are different, alas, in Belgium, which has just changed from a unitary state into a federation based on regions and linguistic communities. Flanders is Dutch-speaking, Wallonia French-speaking, and you know at once which you are in because notices and road-signs are strictly unilingual. Thus Liege, for example, is in Wallonia, but signposts to it in Flanders call it only by its Dutch name, Luik. Brussels, the federal capital, is for the time being still bilingual. The small German-speaking community, in eastern Wallonia, does not have a region as such but does have its own schools and cultural institutions. In its area the signposts are bilingual (French and German), but the French names of German-speaking towns and villages have usually been scratched out. Otherwise the German-speakers seem happy with their lot, and have no desire to join Germany. 'We are the only real Belgians,' one of them told me. 'If Belgium breaks up, we'll probably ask to join Luxembourg.' Certainly Belgium as such seems to inspire little affection in either of the other communities. The French-speaking Walloons now feel that it is run by the Flemish majority, while the Dutch-speaking Flemings still resent the way they were ignored and patronised by the French in the past. In Brussels I saw a Flemish film, Daens, which explains this attitude very effectively. It is about a Flemish priest who stood up for exploited textile workers at the end of the last century, and founded the Social Christian Party which dominates Flemish politics. In the film all the educated and upper- class people speak French to each other, from King Leopold II to the Flemish employers and bishops, while the workers speak only Dutch. A parliamentary commission is sent to look into working conditions in the town of Aalst, where the film is set, but fails to discover the flagrant abuse of child labour because its members cannot understand what the workers are saying, and rely on the wicked foreman as interpreter. Things are not that bad in Switzerland, but some French-speaking Swiss intellectuals have almost as big a chip on their shoulder. Their feelings were aroused especially by last year's referendum on the European Economic Area, in which the French-speaking areas all voted overwhelmingly Yes but the national result was still No. In fact, the German-speaking majority was itself deeply divided on the issue, with urban voters generally in favour, but many French-speakers began to feel they were prisoners in a kind of folksy Teutonic museum. At least, that was the rhetoric. Behind it lay a host of local issues, with education, as always, being the most sensitive but signposts and street-names sometimes the most symbolic. French-speakers believe (though official statistics say the opposite) that German is gaining ground at the expense of French, and many of them have latched on to what is awkwardly known as 'the principle of territoriality' in an attempt to stop it. This means that the local majority has the right to determine the language that can be used in courts, schools and official notices. Such is already the practice in many parts of Switzerland, and there is now a proposal to have it enshrined in the constitution. That looks uncomfortably like a 'Belgification' of Switzerland. Not surprisingly, some Swiss legislators are having second thoughts. Fulvio Caccia, an MP from the Italian-speaking Ticino, worries about the loss of individual freedom implied in the territoriality principle, and fears that it 'contains within it the germs of linguistic cleansing.' The echo of 'ethnic cleansing' in former Yugoslavia is, of course, deliberate. By that standard Switzerland and even Belgium have done well, since they have largely avoided violence in working out their differences. Whatever happens to Maastricht and the EEA, it would be unduly alarmist to predict new wars anywhere along the Roman-German frontier. But the lack of real communication across language barriers, even within cross-cultural entities like Switzerland, remains striking. At Salgetsch, where French gives way to German as you go up the Rhone valley, I had two conversations with two waitresses in bars less than a mile apart. One spoke French, the other German. Neither knew the other's language, nor saw any need to. 'Either they speak French, or we make do with gestures,' said the French one. 'Oh yes,' said her German counterpart cheerfully, 'we understand each other all right, mit Hand und mit Fuss.' And she mimed, with clenched fist and outstretched foot, the exact nature of the relationship.</p>

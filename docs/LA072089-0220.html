			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL DRAFT TO CONTINUE  </P> <P> Owners of the 16 teams in the Continental Basketball Assn. decided today to  continue with the scheduled two-day draft, even though the plane crash in Sioux  City, Iowa, has cast a pall over the activities.  </P> <P> Commissioner Jay Ramsdel, 25, and his deputy commissioner, Jerry Schemmel, were  flying from the league's headquarters in Denver to Columbus aboard the United  DC-10 that crashed Wednesday in Iowa. Schemmel was listed as one of the  survivors, but Ramsdel was still missing as of this afternoon.  </P> <P> "The crash will have no effect on the operations of the draft," said Tim Sise,  general manager of the Columbus Horizon. "Tonight we're looking at some of the  best basketball players, and to halt the growth of the league is something he  (Ramsdel) wouldn't have wanted."  </P></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Bowater to pay Pounds 444m for two packaging companies BOWATER, the UK printing, packaging and industrial films group, is to buy two specialist packaging companies for Pounds 444m. The purchases of DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging would be financed mainly through a Pounds 333.5m rights issue, Bowater said yesterday. The move will strengthen Bowater's position in the medical and pharmaceuticals packaging sector and expand its business in mainland Europe. Mr David Lyon, Bowater chief executive, said the opportunity to buy both businesses had arisen because of their over-extended financial position. The companies had been the subject of acquisitions, funded by high levels of debt, in the late-1980s. 'If we had not gone through a recession of this depth then we do not believe that these businesses would have become available. They would have gone for public flotations,' he said. Bowater's acquisitions may signal the start of a series of similar deals as companies which took on substantial debts to fund leveraged deals during the bull market era of the 1980s seek to escape their financial constraints. DRG, which will be bought for Pounds 212m, was the subject of a controversial takeover bid in 1989 when Mr Roland Franklin, the corporate raider and one-time associate of Sir James Goldsmith, paid Pounds 697m for the Bristol-based packaging group. The Pembridge Investments takeover vehicle has subsequently sold most of the assets it acquired for Pounds 622m. The company yesterday accepted that the acquisition had not been a great success for its backers. Cope Allman, which will be bought for Pounds 232m, was formerly run by Quoteplan, which is 49 per cent owned by ADT, the security and car auction business run by Mr Michael Ashcroft. Quoteplan paid Pounds 210m for Cope Allman in 1988 but quickly encountered tough trading conditions as recession hit both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Lyon said he believed the recession would continue to produce more acquisition prospects for Bowater. 'There will be some businesses that will remain weakened and there may be the opportunity for some add-on acquisitions that we can sensibly make. We want to have enough headroom to spend another Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m on acquisitions,' he said. Bowater's 1-for-3 rights issue is priced at 605p, against yesterday's closing share price of 765p, down 3p. The issue has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. The broker is Hoare Govett. The UK-based Bowater demerged its US operations in 1984. They are run as a separate business, Bowater Inc. Lex, Page 24 A timely move by sober management, Page 25 Results, Page 26</p>

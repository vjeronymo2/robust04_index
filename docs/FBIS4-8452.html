			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament  today approved the programme of Premier Jozef Moravcik's  government, with 80 out of the 119 deputies present voting in  favour.    "For the government such discussions are a test of how  various groups of the population react to its proposals,"  Moravcik said, commenting on the parliamentary debate. "However  I must say that the objective criticisms to the government  program, although there were not many of them, will help us  further improve it," he added.    Regarding the accusations voiced during the debate that the  new cabinet had simply rewritten the program of the previous  government, Moravcik said that the fundamental macro-economic  goals stemmed from the approved law on the state budget and that  his cabinet did not want to interfere with the law.    "However, analysis of developments did not testify to the  possibility that all the goals put up by the former cabinet  could have been fulfilled. We will therefore seek  implementation of the basic macro-economic goals," Moravcik  added.    Moravcik was reacting to an accusation by Tibor Cabaj,  chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)  deputies' group, who called on Moravcik to resign from his  office. The reason Cabaj gave was a report submitted by the  Foreign Ministry headed by Moravcik in May 1993 before Slovak  President Michal Kovac's visit to the Vatican. There were  passages in the report reminiscent of assessments of the Vatican  common before the November 1989 revolution.    Moravcik said that Cabaj had merely quoted working material.  The part which he criticized was an archive document which  appeared in the report by mistake. "As soon as the mistake was  discovered we put it right and the people responsible were taken  to task. What was read out by Cabaj had never been an official  document of the Foreign Ministry," Moravcik said.    In his closing speech before the vote of confidence in the  government was taken Moravcik said that his cabinet would aim at  speeding up the process of transformation in the economic and  social spheres, creating favorable conditions for investors and  stopping the collapse of health care and education.    The government intended to restore citizens' trust in the  state, improve their security and prepare early parliamentary  elections, Moravcik said.</p>

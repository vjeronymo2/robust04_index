			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari held a meeting  late Tuesday night with representatives of the three Chiapas  cattlemen's organizations. The ranchers said the president  pledged to restore order in the state and to prevent more land  invasions. They will see solutions within a week, the president  said. The cattlemen said they would not take up weapons as a  group but added that they are willing to defend their lands.    [Begin recording] [Jorge Constantino Kanter, president of  the  Regional Cattlemen's Union of Chiapas] The cattlemen of the  state of Chiapas support dialogue and negotiation in favor of a  worthy peace in Chiapas. Peace, along with a state of law, will  be our best guarantee. That is what we basically told the  president. We are willing to hold a dialogue with the governor,  the peasant organizations, and the EZLN [Zapatist National  Liberation Army] itself in an effort to find practical solutions  to the current conflicts. A worthy peace will provide us the  necessary tranquillity to contribute to coexistence among the  people of Chiapas, to resume our productive activities, and  promote the region's economy. That will be the basis of the new  relations among the people of Chiapas.    President Salinas' commitment is to find solutions through  the agrarian reform secretary within a week. He will hold talks  with the governor to provide realistic solutions for the  problems we are experiencing in Chiapas.    We have been very clear. We are not prepared to take up  weapons, but there are people in the area who are willing to  defend their land -- no matter what -- because of the difficult  situation. This does not mean we are taking up weapons as a  group. It would be too complicated for the state and for the  country. If we are going to sit down and talk to peasant  organizations is because we are going to reach an agreement. If  it is a negotiation both sides have to give things up. It is  that simple. We have said that we want to be treated fairly as  Mexicans.    [Unidentified reporter] What did the president ask of you?  Did he urge you to be prudent?    [Constantino] He did not do that because we have been  prudent. He recognized the tranquillity and peacefulness of the  cattlemen. I repeat, the situation of the cattlemen is Chiapas  is very different from any other land invasion in the republic.  On Monday at 1930 we are going to sit down in the government  palace for a meeting between small landowners, the state  governor, and peasant organizations.    [Reporter] When can a meeting be held with the EZLN?    [Constantino] We do not know. It would be through the peace  commissioner.    [Reporter] Was he there?    [Constantino] Yes, he was there.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Constantino] The state governor has done everything  possible  to solve things, but it is a very difficult, critical situation.  We cannot ask for a quick solution to such a serious problem.  We believe that if we are going to sit down to talk, we have to  negotiate as intelligent people. If we do that I believe there  is no need to take up weapons. We do not want to create  problems, let alone create more problems for the country.    [Reporter] Are you willing to wait?    [Constantino] If we came here it is because we are  desperate.  We are supposedly going to sit down to talk and hold a dialogue.  We have said that we believe in the country's institutions. We  trust the president. If we did not trust the president, we  would not be here.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Constantino] There is an agreement. The governor was clear.  Starting on 14 April there would be no more invasions, otherwise  the authorities are going to start evicting people. I believe  the government will help us out. We believe they will take  action.

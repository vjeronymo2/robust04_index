			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Afghans fuel war on ex-Soviet territory: Tajikistan's Islamic rebels find ready allies to take on former communists FOLLOWING a month of combat training, Ismatullah was posted as a guard outside a new office in the Afghan city of Taloqan - the headquarters of the Islamic Renaissance party of Tajikistan. However, he is unlikely to be there for long. He and hundreds of other Tajiks, assisted by Afghan leaders, plan to return to their native country, 50 miles north, to try to depose the former Soviet government. 'When the snow melts, in about a month, we will go back to Tajikistan and fight,' Ismatullah said. A comrade named Manon agreed: 'People think communism has been destroyed. But they are being stupid. It is still alive in central Asia. But if we are victorious, it will die.' Until a year ago, when Afghanistan's government fell in an Islamic revolution, Taloqan was the guerrilla headquarters of Mr Ahmad Shah Massoud, known as the 'Lion of the Panjshir'. Since then, however, Mr Massoud has become the Afghan defence minister, and has opened his capital to like-minded friends in ex-Soviet Tajikistan. There, the Tajiks receive uniforms, weapons and training, along with encouragement to emulate the successful Afghan revolt. 'To stop the bloodshed and make the region stable, the whole world should help us remove these bandits from power,' said the IRP leader, Mr Saeed Abdullah Noori, 45, a soft-spoken Islamic scholar. 'We are asking the United States to pressure the government to step down and allow the people to decide their fate through elections.' Through their backing for the rebels in the year-old Tajik civil war, the Afghans have broadened the conflict, attracting foreign military backing to both sides. Fearing the Islamic-led rebels, Russia and Uzbekistan have given armour and MiG fighter aircraft to the Tajik government in Dushanbe. Thousands of Russian and troops from neighbouring Uzbekistan are also massed on Tajikistan's southern border, the Amu Darya river, to block the Afghan-based rebels from returning home to fight. Hostility toward the Uzbeks is already apparent among the 60,000-strong Tajik refugee population in Afghanistan, forced from their country as suspected opposition supporters. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan share large populations of each other's ethnic groups, and long-feared violence between them could flare at any time. A Tajik named Abdul Kahor, for one, cannot forget how his village of Shartus was attacked. 'Their tanks and helicopters pushed all of Shartus towards the border. Uzbeks from Shartus helped. Many of us drowned in the river,' he said. 'Now we are thinking of revenge.' The Tajik republic of 5m people has been racked by clan warfare since the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 and the republic gained its independence. The fighting has pitted regional clans associated with democratic and Islamic forces such as the IRP against others connected with the former communist leadership. The hardliners finally consolidated power in December, after thousands of Tajiks died and 350,000 were displaced, including those who fled to Afghanistan. Like all of Afghanistan's key figures, Mr Massoud insists he provides only humanitarian aid to the Tajiks. But IRP fighters in Taloqan said Mr Massoud's Shura Nazar (supervisory council), provided their two-acre compound, their military training and weapons. The men's crisp, new fatigues are identical to those worn by Mr Massoud's men in the Afghan capital of Kabul. Mr Massoud has had little choice. He is himself an ethnic Tajik, and is not alone in supporting the rebels. Aid also comes from the Arab-financed Afghan parties Ittehad-i-Islami and Hezb-i-Islami. The latter is run by Afghanistan's prime minister designate, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. 'We have already trained about 1,000 of them,' Mr Mohammed Zaman, a Hezb-i-Islami leader, said. 'If this is really an Islamic government, we should help our brothers. Most of the people who have been trained have already gone back to Tajikistan.' If the Russian and Uzbek support continues, the Tajik rebels will face a difficult time against superior forces.</p>

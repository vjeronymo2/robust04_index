This year's anti-corruption drive will be more firmly and  thoroughly carried out, said Wei Jianxing, secretary of the  Party Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.    Wei, also a member of the party's Politburo and Secretariat,  made the remarks at the opening of the commission's third  plenary session, which lasts for a week.    He said that leading officials at and above county  (division)  levels must strictly follow the rules concerning the building of  a clean government made by the party Central Committee and the  State Council.    At today's session, the Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection set a package of five requirements for leading  officials to keep clean and honest:    -- No-one is allowed to violate regulations and buy or  change  to imported and luxury cars, or use power to change with and  borrow cars from subordinate enterprises and units, or collect  money from them for buying cars; it is not allowed to buy cars  for leading officials with loans, money gathered from people and  funds for special projects; party and government administrations  and units above county level which still owe wages to staff are  not allowed to buy cars.    -- No-one is allowed to run against the regulations of the  State Council on reforming the housing system and buy houses at  prices lower than promulgated, or use power to provide  preferential treatment for spouses, children, relatives or  friends, or decorate private houses lavishly with public funds.    -- Leading officials should attend domestic public  activities  in a simple manner; their accommodation should not exceed the  local criteria for reception and no special dance parties should  be organized for them.    -- No-one is allowed to organize lavish activities and spend  without restraint at occasions of marriage, funeral, change of  jobs, birthday and moving to new housing, either for oneself or  family members. Using public money and materials for such  activities or earning money through these occasions are  especially forbidden.    -- No-one is allowed to mis-use power and refuse to return  public money, or buy or build houses with public money for  oneself, relatives and friends, or engage in profitable  activities.    Addressing the meeting, Wei Jianxing said that China has  made  big headway in the struggle against corruption since the holding  of the second plenary session of the commission last August.    However, he pointed out, the fight against corruption  remains  a protracted and arduous task that should be unremittingly  carried on.    He said investigation into and crack-down on major cases  involving corruption of leading officials at various levels will  still be put on top of the agenda in 1994. The commission will  known [as received] to the public typical cases of corruption.    Efforts will be made further to check unhealthy tendencies  of  random collection of fees and using public money for overseas  tours.    Problems such as officials and employees acquiring cars and  computers through unfair means will be probed, while burdens of  farmers will be further alleviated.    While stepping up the fight against corruption, Wei said  various discipline inspection bodies should strengthen  supervision over enforcement of the law.</p>

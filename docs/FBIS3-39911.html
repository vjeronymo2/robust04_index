The PvdA [Labor Party] minister says that the compartments  between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Development  Cooperation and Defense should be removed, because the world is  a global village crying out for an integral approach.    If Pronk is looking for an illustration to prove he is in  the  right, then he has to look no further than Netherlands policies  on the crisis in Bosnia. While the "Sarajevo formula" has  gained an almost magical ring to it at the Foreign Ministry,  thanks to the success of the NATO and UN ultimatum, it is in  fact reticence which is steadily gaining the upper hand at the  Defense Ministry under the influence of the deployment of the  reinforced airborne battalion in turbulent eastern Bosnia.    It is very understandable that Foreign Minister Kooijmans  wants to use the momentum from Sarajevo to progressively set  ultimatums in other parts of Bosnia which cannot easily escape  the stranglehold of the civil war. It is less understandable  that he should choose the town of Mostar as the next test case  for the determination of the international community. Unless  the aim is to keep up the pretense of impartiality and balance,  because Muslims and Croats are fighting in this town.    The understanding for Kooijmans' crusade in political  circles  in The Hague ends there. Mostar is not among the six areas  which were designated as safe havens for Muslims by the United  Nations last year. Therefore a new resolution would be  necessary to set a military ultimatum, which would virtually  certainly run up against a veto from Moscow. After the Russian  diplomatic success of last weekend, Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev has warned that Moscow has little enthusiasm for a  repeat of the Sarajevo formula.    It is a cast-iron law in international diplomacy that the  countries which shout the loudest must be prepared to put words  into deeds. In the case of Bosnia the Netherlands has nothing  to be ashamed of. In fact, in relative terms it makes the  biggest contribution to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force].    But Defense Minister Ter Beek repeatedly emphasizes that The  Hague, with its promises to the United Nations of some 3,000  troops, has reached its ceiling. As far as he is concerned  there can be no possibility of sending more Netherlanders to  Mostar.    Moreover Sarajevo has revealed the limited possibilities of  UNPROFOR. Even the "soft" UN option of 7,600 UN troops for the  six safe areas to be protected is a long way from having been  reached. For this reason, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia,  General Rose, was forced last week to call in reinforcements  from other parts of the former Yugoslavia to monitor the  withdrawal or disabling of Serbian tanks, artillery, mortars,  antiaircraft artillery, and multiple rocket launchers.    Because several hundred Russians were not able to carry out  this task alone, Jordanians came from Croatia and Malaysians  from Bihac. Dozens of observers were even used. But two British  companies from Vitez were also brought in. They were exactly  half the battalion of British infantrymen who are supposed to  offer protection to the humanitarian aid convoys of the  Belgian/Netherlands transport battalion in central Bosnia. This  is an area where there is strong fighting and the area where  some 440 lightly armed Netherlanders are operating.    Last but not least, another reason why the Defense Ministry  and Parliament have reacted sceptically to relief of the  Herzegovina capital is the position of the Croats.  Countermeasures from Zagreb are definitely not to be ruled out  if the international community were to turn against the Croatian  troops who are determined to make Mostar the capital of Bosnian  Croatia.    The hundreds of thousands of refugees are not the only Croat  "trump card." From the harbor of Split, they manage what could  be called the lifeline of the Netherlanders who are to be  stationed in central Bosnia (Lukavac) and eastern Bosnia  (Srebenica and Zepa) during March. The closure of the Dalmatian  coast would have disastrous consequences for the successful  running of the entire UNPROFOR operation in Bosnia.    Last March the United States decided to drop food over  eastern Bosnia using Hercules transport planes. The Foreign  Ministry felt the Netherlands really ought to participate as  well and that the Defense Ministry would just have to use F-27s  and Orions. From the humanitarian point of view everything  favored this; the only problem is that every royal airforce  Fokker or Orion crashes every time a door is opened when it is  airborne. A year later the lack of coordination between The  Hague's foreign and security policies is again taking its  revenge.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS string correspondent Aleksandr Shuvalov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- The Russian Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural resources declared against  signing the Russo-hungarian protocol ``on burying glazed  radioactive waste products on the territory of the Russian  Federation,'' the Ministry's press centre said on Wednesday.    The protocol supplements a Hungaro-Soviet agreement signed  in  1966.    The protocol contradicts Russia's ``law on environmental  protection,'' a relevant presidential decree and the ensuing  order of receiving radioactive waste'' passed by the Russian  Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry.    The Ministry of Environmental Protection has expressed  bewilderment in respect of a governmental instruction, which  mentioned that it had supported the protocol.    According to the Russian legislation, the reprocessed waste  products should be returned to the exporting country, the  ecologists had warned. But their opinion was not taken into  account by the authors of the protocol.    The planned burial of 66 tonnes of radioactive waste  products  from the ``Paksh'' Hungarian nuclear power plant will aggravate  the hard situation in such burial places in Russia.    The move infringes upon Article 50 of the ``Law on  Environmental Protection," which prohibits ``imports of  radioactive waste products or materials from abroad with a view  to storing or burying.''</p>

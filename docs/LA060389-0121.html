			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART, CERRITOS TO PLAY FOR 4-A BASEBALL TITLE  </P> <P> A list of the top baseball teams in the Southern Section 4-A Division is taped  to a wall in the Cerritos High dugout. As the playoffs progressed, teams that  were eliminated were crossed off.  </P> <P> Now only two -- Cerritos and Hart -- remain.  </P> <P> Richard Emard, the second-year coach at Cerritos who posted the list, would  like to cross off Hart (23-6) after the 4-A title game at 4:30 p.m. today at  Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> To do so, Cerritos (26-6) will have to shut down a high-powered offense that  boasts seven starters batting better than .300 and has produced 57 hits and 57  runs in four playoff games. Mark Mattingly (10-2), a senior right-hander, will  start for the Cerritos. Mattingly, who has three wins and a save in four  playoff games, has lost only to Westminster, a 7-4 winner over Hart in March,  and Lakewood, ranked 13th in the nation by USA Today.  </P> <P> Center fielder Cobi Cradle, a three-year All-San Gabriel Valley League  selection, is batting .470 and has 23 steals. Cradle, who has signed with Long  Beach State, is one of seven starting seniors.  </P> <P> Cradle is joined by Robert Hinds, a UCLA-bound shortstop who is batting .390  and has 29 steals. Second baseman Curt Knabe is batting .410.  </P></p>

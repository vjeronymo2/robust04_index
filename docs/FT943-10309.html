			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Strong first-half growth at Keppel Keppel, the Singapore government-linked group mainly involved in shipping, engineering and financial services, has announced pre-tax profits for the six months to end-June of SDollars 178.4m (USDollars 119m), a 22 per cent rise on the corresponding period last year. Group turnover was SDollars 927.2m, a 27 per cent rise on the previous term. Keppel, one of Singapore's biggest listed companies, said all divisions of the group had higher revenues though earnings from shipyard activities were lower due to weak market conditions, particularly in the VLCC (very large crude carrier) segment of the market. The group said growth had been particularly strong in the shipbuilding and banking and financial services sectors. Earlier this week Keppel Bank announced a 71 per cent jump in net earnings for the first six months of the year to SDollars 26.6m. The group said that though ship repair is likely to continue to operate under difficult conditions in the second half of the year, it expects strong growth from other core activities and better earnings performance. For the past two years Keppel has been moving aggressively into a variety of businesses overseas as it aims to become Singapore's premier multinational company. Keppel, which is 37 per cent owned by Temasek Holdings, the government's investment company, has shipyard interests in the Philippines, rig building in the US, shipping and engineering units in Hong Kong and a metal fabrication business in Australia. The company is targeting Vietnam and also has interests in Burma. Among its more prestigious projects is its role as leader of a Singapore consortium which is developing a new industrial township in Suzhou, near Shanghai in China. It is hoped that when completed, the town will attract around USDollars 20bn of investment.</p>

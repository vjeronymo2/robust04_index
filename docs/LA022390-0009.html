			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO SHOOTS FOR FIRST FINALS SPOT IN 23 YEARS  </P> <P> A confident El Segundo High School basketball team will attempt to reach the  CIF Southern Section finals for the first time in 23 years when it faces  top-seeded Laguna Beach at 7:30 tonight in the 2-A playoffs at Rolling Hills  High.  </P> <P> "We're looking forward to it," El Segundo Coach Rick Sabosky said of the  semifinal match-up. "I know Laguna Beach is a good team. But I feel if we play  a strong game defensively, we can handle them."  </P> <P> The Eagles (15-13) have been impressive in both of their playoff victories,  beating Crossroads, 81-67, last week and fourth-seeded Orange Lutheran, 80-63,  in the quarterfinals Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "Our defense has been the key in the last few games," Sabosky said.  </P> <P> El Segundo figures to focus most of its attention on Laguna Beach forward Dain  Blanton, a 6-foot-4 senior who averages 17.5 points and six rebounds. A good  leaper, Blanton is rated one of the West Coast's top college volleyball  prospects.  </P> <P> "He's a slashing-type player," Sabosky said. "He's really strong going to the  hole."  </P> <P> Blanton's supporting cast is headed by guards Josh Borella, who scored 28  points Tuesday in a 73-62 victory over Bishop, and John Trevino, who averages  15 points and 3.3 assists. The Artists (21-5) were runners-up to Trabuco Hills  in the Pacific Coast League.  </P> <P> El Segundo features a balanced lineup led by 6-5, 230-pound center Kenny  Talanoa, 6-3 forward Tate Seefried and guard Scott Panfil. In Tuesday's win  over Orange Lutheran, Panfil and Seefried combined for 40 points and seven  three-point shots.  </P> <P> Panfil averages 19.5 points, Seefried 16.5 and Talanoa 13.5 points and 13  rebounds.  </P> <P> "If Seefried and Panfil are both on, we're pretty tough," Sabosky said.  "They've both been contributing in the playoffs."  </P> <P> The coach also lauded the recent play of guard Craig Friesen and reserve  forward Chris Hansen, a 6-4 junior who has been a welcome addition in the 2-A  tournament after missing most of the regular season because of grade problems.  </P> <P> The winner of tonight's game will advance to the 2-A championship game at 9:45  a.m. March 3 at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> El Segundo last appeared in a CIF basketball final in 1967, when a team coached  by Cliff Warren (now the coach at Rolling Hills High) and starring Dana Pagett  (now the coach at Rancho Santiago College) lost in overtime to Monrovia in the  major division title game.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach is going after its first Southern Section title since 1962, when  it won the Small Schools championship under present Coach Ed Bowen.  </P></p>

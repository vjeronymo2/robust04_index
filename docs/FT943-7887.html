			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Companies House staff call for halt to sell-off proposals Staff at Companies House have launched a national campaign to win support from businesses against government plans to transfer its services to the private sector. The campaign, led by the Civil and Public Services Association, aims to kill off proposals by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to contract out most of the functions of Companies House, the official repository for corporate financial information in England, Wales and Scotland. Mr James Normansell, campaign co-ordinator, said yesterday: 'The changes mean that those who rely on quick, cheap and up-to-the-minute company information will find Companies House unable to help.' Last month Mr Heseltine asked consultants to report by the end of October on the feasibility of the proposals, which envisage the appointment of contractors to take over most activities. Companies House, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, is based in Cardiff and has five regional offices. Last year it handled the incorporation of more than 100,000 new companies and it holds details on nearly 1m companies. Under Mr Heseltine's proposals, chosen contractors would within three years sell all company search services to intermediary business information organisations. Staff unions, which intend to contact hundreds of Companies House corporate customers, claim contracting out will mean an end to several free services while fees will rise for remaining services. They say up to 500 jobs are at risk. Campaigners hope that the recent decision to halve from October existing company registration charges and fees for annual returns could undermine the attractiveness of Companies House operations to potential bidders.</p>

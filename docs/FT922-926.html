			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Fondiaria tensions force board change GROWING differences between the two main shareholders of Fondiaria, Italy's third-biggest insurer, yesterday led to the appointment of Mr Carlo Sama as a second managing director to flank Mr Alfonso Scarpa. Mr Sama is managing director of Montedison, the industrial group controlled by Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), of which he is also deputy chairman. Ferruzzi, which used to own the majority of Fondiaria, shares control through a holding company owned jointly with Mr Camillo De Benedetti. Under Mr Scarpa's guidance, Fondiaria has managed to steer a course through changes of ownership and the vicissitudes of the Italian market to emerge as one of Europe's most dynamic insurers. It has drawn closer to Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB) in Germany and Royal Insurance in the UK. Fondiaria now owns 20 per cent of AMB, while earlier this year it was a founder-member with AMB and Royal of European Partners for Insurance Co-operation, a joint venture to co-ordinate the three companies' future expansion in Europe outside their home markets. But although Fondiaria has remained profitable, there have been growing rumours that Ferruzzi has been dissatisfied with its performance. The comments have gained credence in view of the decline in the Ferruzzi group's own financial performance. Ferfin has regularly denied any plans to pull out of Fondiaria. However, the carefully-orchestrated leaks about keeping a close eye on Mr Scarpa's management, indicates a growing concern with Fondiaria's future. Both men stressed yesterday that the appointment was harmonious. 'Carlo Sama was nominated to underline the Ferruzzi group's interest in Fondiaria and scotch certain rumours about disinvesting", said Mr Scarpa. 'Ferruzzi has a very important investment in Fondiaria and it is right that there should be a manager-entrepreneur who occupies himself more directly in its running,' according to Mr Sama.</p>

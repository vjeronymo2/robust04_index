			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Keith Damsell, assisted by Alena Zivnustkova: </F> "Labor Pact Falls From Favor Before Ink Is Dry"]    [Text] Before the ink has even dried, the government,  unions and employers--the three parties that signed the 1994  general agreement on labor practices--are dismissing the  document as a bureaucratic waste of time that will fail to  achieve its lofty aims of social good will and peace.    Union officials who signed the agreement last month say they  have little faith in its idealistic tenets and can no longer  trust a government that continues to deceive them.    "The social tension is going to grow, and we won't be able  to  stop the strikes. That's what we're warning the government,"  said Jifi Tejkal, vice president of the Czech-Moravian Chamber  of Trade Unions, which represents 3.5 million workers at 40  unions throughout the country.    Meanwhile, business representatives say the deal fails to  address the issues of most importance: wages and productivity.    The general agreement "means nothing," said Jaroslav Hosek,  personnel and administration manager at the Prague-based heating  supply company Prazska Teplarenska. He said the negotiators  "wasted their time."    And the government, which acted as the honest broker during  the negotiations leading up to the agreement, would prefer to  walk away from any lingering disputes.    "If they have some objections about something they signed,  it's their bloody problem," said Otakar Veverka, spokesman for  the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.    The general agreement, which was first drawn up in 1991 and  has been amended every year since, aims to preserve social peace  in the period of transition from a state-controlled economy to a  market system.    The agreement specifies obligations regarding collective  bargaining, employment, wages, and social and legal security.  The conditions are binding on all levels.    Representatives from unions, the Ministries of Finance,  Labor  and Economy and the Union of Employers, a 55-member organization  that represents the management interests of the country's  largest employers, all take an active role in forming a new  agreement each year.    After two months of negotiations, consensus on this year's  agreement was finally reached and the deal was signed Jan. 21.  But labor, which had talked about rejecting the agreement for a  month, supported it by the narrowest possible margin: 16 to 14.    Tejkal voted against the agreement after deciding there was  nothing concrete backing it up. "The general agreement is less  binding now than it was in 1992 or 1993," he said.    Labor does appear to be losing ground. Last year the  agreement promised a "real increase in nominal wages...in  comparison with the same period last year." But in this year's  agreement, the clause simply says that management and labor will  find a mutually acceptable wage-settlement without "unreasonable  pressures on wages."    Worse still, Tejkal believes the government bargains in bad  faith. After agreeing to wage increases last year, the  government overruled the general agreement by passing separate  wage-control legislation, he said.    "If we cannot force [the government] to follow these  articles, we cannot force them to do anything," he said.    In addition, the government is considering legislation that  will ban civil servants from organizing unions and restructuring  pension laws to drastically reduce benefits.    "I'm very critical of what's happening to our rights," he  said. "It's a very sad thing to realize we are fighting the same  battles that our grandfathers fought 100 years ago."    Jan Uhlif, president of Kovo, the 800,000-member metal  workers' federation--who voted for the agreement--conceded that  he also has qualms about it.    "We don't trust the government too much. But we admit it is  also bad to close the door. It's best to push the partners to be  more serious," he said, adding that he's "not the type to stand  on the barricades."    Business representatives appear to be less concerned.    Hosek said he isn't considering the general agreement during  ongoing collective bargaining with the two unions that represent  Prazska Teplarenska's 2,200 employees. The unions are pushing  for a shorter work-week and a 25-percent wage increase.    "It's unacceptable to our company because we're regulated by  the state," Hosek said, referring to last year's wage-control  legislation. "If there was only the collective agreement, I  wouldn't be against it. I don't like the goals of the general  agreement. It's like central planning by the state."    Milan Smutny, a spokesman for automaker Skoda, supports the  general agreement's social aims but adds that, in the future,  more emphasis should be placed on productivity.    "If you see [the 1993 statistics for Czech industry],  salaries went up but productivity went down," he said. Many  companies continue to give unions everything they want, he said.  "It is economic nonsense leading to loans for salaries and  wages."    Officials within the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs  respond that management and labor's complaints regarding the  agreement amount simply to political posturing.    The government had no choice but to impose wage controls  last  year because wages were simply rising too quickly, said Pavel  Michal, head of the ministry's collective-bargaining services.    Ministry spokesman Veverka said, "The government had to  allow  itself an avenue out in case wages continued to rise this year."    Michal and Veverka scoffed at labor's claims that the  government had acted in bad faith. The government would always  be a strong social partner interested in keeping the peace,  Michal said. But both officials said that the government's role  in negotiations may change drastically soon.    "In the future, [the general agreement] should be a creation  of social partners alone. It doesn't mean, of course, that the  government won't be listening," Michal said.    Michal added that some unionists are complaining about  change  because they miss the luxuries they enjoyed under communism. "Of  course, they want to have it back. The person who wants a return  to the old system--I feel sorry for him."    George Kopejtko, head of the ministry's territorial section,  added, "We can only hope there won't be too many [unions]  around"--a comment that could help explain some of labor's fears  about the conservative Klaus government.</p>

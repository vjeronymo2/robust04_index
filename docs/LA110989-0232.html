			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> RESTORED RIGHTS MAY BE WORTH THE CHAOS  </P> <P> On Wednesday morning, 1,500 NFL players awoke to find an old truth suddenly in  question. There was no talk about one for all and all for one. The talk was  about every man for himself.  </P> <P> The subject was the decision by the executive committee of the NFL Players  Assn. to surrender its bargaining rights and begin the process of decertifying  itself in its latest skirmish with management. For the San Francisco 49ers,  reaction to the prospect of life without a union ranged from disbelief to firm  support.  </P> <P> One thing is certain. If decertification occurs -- and there is a solid  possibility it won't -- the result could be chaos. As 49ers player  representative Bubba Paris put it, "Every player will be his own individual  negotiating unit" under the new system, a scenario that would, by all accounts,  prompt a flurry of lawsuits and unusual contract negotiations.  </P> <P> To Paris, the move to decertify was necessary.  </P> <P> "Right now, it's been a crazy, long, roundabout way to come to these  circumstances, but the players have slowly lost their rights to collective  bargaining," he said. "Everything we've fought to gain is in the process of  being taken away. In essence, we've been pushed up against the wall."  </P> <P> The only other option, Paris said, was "a long, lengthy appeals process," but  some see the decertification as a ploy similar to the one used by the NBA  Players Assn. in 1988, when the NBAPA threatened to decertify, did not follow  through and then signed a six-year plan with management two months later.  </P> <P> "The union isn't going to decertify," 49ers running back Tom Rathman said.  "We're going to get a contract before that."  </P> <P> Even though Paris, who said the 49ers was the team that paid the highest dues  in pro football last season, insisted the NFLPA isn't abandoning the players,  some players may not agree.  </P> <P> The players must vote on the final move to decertify.  </P> <P> "As much as I'd like to see free agency, I don't see how it could work," 49ers  backup quarterback Steve Bono said. "I would vote to not decertify. I think  everybody needs a union in some respects. Everybody would be abandoned."  </P> <P> Paris acknowledged that the NFLPA and Executive Director Gene Upshaw have  something to prove to the players. Upshaw was given generally poor marks for  his performance during the 1987 strike, and this latest setback can't help his  reputation any.  </P> <P> "We never had any doubt we'd win," said Paris of the union's reaction to the  defeat. "We're extremely shocked. It's completely against what we'd been led to  believe.  </P> <P> "It's beyond muscle-flexing. A lot of players lost faith in Gene when we went  out on strike and didn't win. And I think others lost faith when the agreement  went against them. To save face, we've got to do something in the players' best  interests."  </P></p>

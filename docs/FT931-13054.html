			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Freedom for central bank only hope for stability Sir, The attack on the idea of central bank independence by Sir Bryan Hopkin and Sir Douglas Wass (Personal View January 22), which was made more topical by that day's announcement of Eddie George's appointment as governor, was redolent of the 1960s. They even quoted the Bank's responsibility for exchange controls as an argument against its independence, as if this ghost of policies past was about to walk again. They point to the lack of an anti-inflation culture in Britain while at the same time arguing that we should maintain that deficiency by pretending that there is a choice between high unemployment and inflation, and by denying ourselves the one weapon which could institutionalise price stability. Without making monetary policy the independent responsibility of the central bank, we have no hope of convincing the markets that price stability will be maintained: the political pressures arising from our home loans system and the short term nature of much small business finance will obviously weigh heavily on any chancellor, and if he has the likes of Sir Brian and Sir Douglas advising him, he will be explicitly invited to regard other factors as more compelling than price stability. Mr George is pleased to have been invited by the chancellor to support the government's policy of defeating inflation. What will he do if the policy changes or if his advice on what is necessary to achieve price stability is ignored? Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Famine deaths soon in Sarajevo, warns WHO THE PEOPLE of Sarajevo could face famine on the scale of Somalia this winter if the relief effort is not greatly expanded, the World Health Organisation warned yesterday. Sir Donald Acheson, WHO special representative for the former Yugoslavia, said that unless 240 tons of food went into the besieged Bosnian capital every day from now on, 'children will begin to die of starvation in about four weeks' time, adults about four weeks later, and in January we might expect to see pictures in one of the capitals of Europe which we have become familiar with in the Horn of Africa.' Warehouses were empty in Sarajevo, where 380,000 people are trapped. The humanitarian airlift, which resumed on Saturday after a four-week suspension, is being curtailed by short daylight hours and bad weather. At its peak, however, it carried no more than 220 tons of food a day. His warning came on a day of fierce fighting in which more than a dozen people were killed. Fires ignited by incendiary shells from Serb guns blazed in the Moslem quarter of Hrasno during what its defenders called 'the worst day of the war'. Flames whipped by winds swept three blocks of flats and two office buildings in the district on the south bank of the Miljacka River dividing the capital. The shelling started with an attack on the nearby Holiday Inn. Three floors were set on fire by direct hits from tanks firing incendiary shells. Sir Donald said the numbers dying in Sarajevo this winter would depend on the action taken by governments to deal with the emergency. But if the population did not get more than a few tons of food a day for the next three months, 'perhaps the majority' would starve to death. To get the required amount of food into the city, the UN needed bigger transport aircraft, more trucks, and opening of road and rail routes from the Croatian port of Ploce via Mostar. Last week the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said 400,000 people in Bosnia-Hercegovina could die of hunger and cold in freezing winter temperatures. About 300,000 displaced people in Bosnia have no shelter at all, and hundreds of thousands more lack window coverings. Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, said only a quick cessation of hostilities in Sarajevo would prevent widespread starvation and deaths from exposure. He and the United Nations mediator, Mr Cyrus Vance, urged Mr Radovan Karadvic, Bosnian Serb leader, not to jeopardise talks planned for today in Sarajevo between military commanders from the warring factions. Mr Karadvic has threatened to withdraw from the peace process if the UN Security Council imposes a 'no-fly' zone over Bosnia.</p>

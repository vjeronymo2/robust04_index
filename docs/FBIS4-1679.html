			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 1 (XINHUA) -- The China foreign  exchange center will officially go into operation in this the  country's largest economic center April 4.    "This will be the first national foreign exchange center  since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,  and a key step in the national banking reform this year," an  official of the center said.    "It will pave the way for the country to develop a market  economy," he noted.    Serving as an inter-bank foreign exchange market, the China  foreign exchange center will adopt a membership system and  develop into a non-profit and independently accounting  organization. The membership is believed to include 30 large  banks of China and 90 other banks involving foreign capital and  monetary institutions.    Already the center has linked itself with foreign exchange  markets in Beijing, Tianjin and Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang  Province, and Shenzhen and Guangzhou in Guangdong Province,  during the trial operation in March.    China succeeded in unifying the dual-track foreign exchange  rate system with a smooth market operation and a stable foreign  exchange rate in the first quarter of this year.    It will begin an overall reform of its foreign exchange  system starting today.</p>

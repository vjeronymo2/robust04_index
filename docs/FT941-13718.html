			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: News Round-up PAKISTAN Pakistani share prices were hit hard by yesterday's 'black Sunday' as the Karachi Stock Exchange index, the KSE-100, fell by 129 points or almost 5 per cent of its value - the largest drop in a single day in recent history. The heavy selling of shares, which came after a three month boom, was led by the financial sector and some textile shares, stockbrokers said last night. However, many brokers and market analysts were confident that the fall was a temporary correction rather than indicative of a heavy selling trend. 'This was the reaction that everybody was waiting for,' said Mr Yasin Lakhani, president of the Karachi Stock Exchange. The KSE-100 index has risen by approximately 1,000 points, or roughly 70 per cent, since the October elections won by Ms Benazir Bhutto. HONG KONG Hong Kong's stock exchange might extend trading hours to accommodate the increased investor interest, Mr Paul Chow, the stock exchange's chief executive, said in London last week. This would also mean that trade could overlap with the London Stock Exchange's Seaq International trading system. Professor Liu Hongru, chairman of China's Securities Regulatory Commission, said at the same presentation that he was studying the possibility of establishing a stock exchange in the north of China. This should introduce more competition between the country's two other exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. LEBANON Lebanon's stockbrokers have called for the reopening of the country's stock market, closed since 1984. This move came as a secondary market was due to be established to start trading next month in shares of Solidere, a company that has been formed to rebuild central Beirut. Central bank officials have said that the new market is a temporary measure and that the Beirut bourse will eventually be reactivated.

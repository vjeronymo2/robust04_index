			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Discount on Belgian Fords Ford, the US carmaker, is to offer cash incentives in Belgium - a discount of BFr60,000 (Pounds 1,195) - to persuade owners of old cars to trade in their vehicles for new Ford models. The French and Spanish governments launched incentive schemes earlier this year to encourage owners of cars 10 years old or more to scrap their vehicles and replace them with new cars, but Ford is one of the first carmakers to take an independent initiative. The schemes launched by the French and Spanish governments in the spring have had an immediate impact in boosting new car sales above last year's depressed level, and the Spanish motor industry is campaigning to have the six-month scheme extended beyond October.</p>

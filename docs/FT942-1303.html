			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Recapitalisation recommended for Australian retail chain The voluntary administrators of Brash Holdings, the Australian electronics retail chain which ran into financial difficulties when its banks refused to roll over ADollars 61m (USDollars 46.9m) of borrowings last month, are recommending that the company be recapitalised. The recapitalisation would be undertaken via a ADollars 40m injection from interests connected to Mr Ong Beng Seng, a Singaporean businessman. The administrators are recommending that the investor take control of Brash's trading assets. They said that under the agreement with Hotel Properties/Reef Holdings - two companies associated with Mr Ong - unsecured creditors would get an estimated 38 cents in the dollar, while secured creditors could receive up to 75 cents in the dollar. Banks, whose security was established in February 1994, would get 64 cents in the dollar. HPL/Reef has sizeable interests in Australia, as well as Asia, the US and UK. Its Australian assets range from the Planet Hollywood restaurant in Sydney, to Hyundai Automotive Australia. According to the administrators, Mr Ong has no plans to break up Brash's, a 170-store chain. They expect the new owner to try to relist the Australian group. The administrators have been soliciting offers for the company since they were called in on May 2. They said that 10 proposals or indicative offers had been received, but that the HPL/Reef solution was 'the best offer for the business'. Creditors must approve the plan, and a meeting has been called for June 30. MIM, the Queensland-based metals group, has signed formal loan agreements for the financing of the McArthur River zinc-lead-silver project in the Northern Territory. The facilities allow for USDollars 153m of base funding and contingencies and a further ADollars 15m in working capital facilities. The banks involved are Westpac, NatWest Markets Australia, Credit Lyonnais, AIDC and Citibank. The project will cost ADollars 250m and the mine is due to begin commissioning in mid-1995.</p>

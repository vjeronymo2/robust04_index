			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (6): Taking a chance on the unknown - Launches in a sector seen as the domain of institutional investors have attracted money from ordinary savers Specialisation has become an increasingly notable feature of the investment trust industry. Perhaps because there are already plenty of general funds doing a perfectly good job, the only way that fund managers can entice investors into a new trust is by giving some novel, possibly unique, twist to its investment strategy. The more cynical might describe these as gimmicks. But, to be fair, there is often a good investment idea hidden somewhere behind the hype. Flourishing areas recently have included Latin America and Japan, while there have also been many single-country or narrowly-based regional funds for previously untouched regions, including India, Israel, Taiwan and central Europe. Other specialisms popular at the moment are smaller companies, venture capital and privatisations, while last year's launches included the giant Mercury World Mining fund, as well as plenty of smaller company and emerging markets funds. The general rule is that the more specialist a fund is, the riskier and more volatile it is likely to be. For example, buying shares in a single-country fund for Indonesia would be a much bigger gamble than buying a regional Far Eastern fund, or a global emerging markets one. Obviously, the risk-rating of a specialist trust also depends on the riskiness of its holdings. A venture capital fund, which invests in small start-up companies and management buy-outs, is inherently more risky than, say, the two European privatisation trusts, which buy shares in large formerly state-owned companies. As usual, the flip side to this argument is that the greater the risk, the greater the potential reward. So the European privatisation trusts are likely to move steadily ahead with performance comparable to general European trusts, while a good venture capital manager in the right economic climate could produce outstanding returns. There is no doubt that you are more likely to find a specialist trust at the top of the performance tables than a general one, but the specialists often hog the bottom end of the scale as well. For example, if you had invested Pounds 100 in the TR Property investment trust in April 1989, by April this year your investment would have shrunk to about Pounds 76 - hardly a sparkling performance. But if you had invested Pounds 100 in April last year, it would have turned into about Pounds 182 a year later - outperforming most other trusts over the same period. Extremes like this are usually to be found only in highly specialised, cyclical areas like smaller companies, venture capital, commodities and single-country funds in emerging markets. Poor timing can be disastrous, but if you judge the moment correctly, the rewards can be great. The added risk with investment trusts launched to cash in on a fashion, as many of them are, is that if a specialist area falls out of favour, probably because it is underperforming, the shares of trusts in that area will become difficult to sell. The share price may then drop to a wide discount to net asset value, compounding the effect of poor investment returns. Specialist trusts have traditionally been the domain of the institutional investors, who use them as a way of sub-contracting the management of part of their portfolios, while all but the most sophisticated private investors have stuck to more general trusts. However, some of the recent specialist launches have pulled in large amounts of money from the general public. The Fleming Chinese trust, launched last year, was extremely popular with private investors, who had been reading about the booming Chinese economy. It was heavily over-subscribed - Pounds 15m worth of shares were available through a public offer, but applications were received for Pounds 40m. Some sections of the industry are, no doubt, delighted by this extra source of demand, but it is causing concern to others, who worry that people are buying inappropriate investments without taking advice about the implications. Legal restrictions mean that new issues can be advertised much more freely than existing trusts. So new issues tend to grab all the attention, while longstanding general trusts cannot advertise their attractions except indirectly by promoting Peps or savings schemes. Fund managers are always alarmed when they discover that, among their investors, are elderly people who have put a substantial chunk of their savings into an emerging markets trust, with all the rest in a building society. This is not a good spread of risk. All the industry can do is plaster health warnings across application forms, but often these seem only to whet the appetite further. Most financial advisers emphasise that, unless you are very sure of your investment nose and can afford to lose the money you are investing, highly specialised trusts should form no more than 5 or 10 per cent of your portfolio. But there will always be people who see investment as an entertaining and occasionally profitable hobby, akin to doing the pools. They tend to put a little money into whichever exotic fund is being promoted each month, and will follow its progress with interest. The good news for that breed of investor is that the supply of exciting new specialist funds shows no sign of drying up in the foreseeable future.</p>

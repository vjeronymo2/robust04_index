			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Nedlloyd - Other Companies The Dutch shipping and road-haulage group is expected to show a further rebound in profits when it publishes second-quarter results on Wednesday. The company, which launched quarterly reporting earlier this year, swung into a slim Fl 10m (Dollars 5.6m) profit in the first quarter from losses in 1993. The pace of recovery is expected to have accelerated in the second quarter, thanks to strong growth in world trade flows and firmer shipping rates.</p>

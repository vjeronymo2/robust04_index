			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Budget will be a test of the government's nerve: The risk is that Finance Minister Singh might prefer fudge and compromise DR MANMOHAN SINGH, the Indian finance minister, is a man with a reputation for caving in too easily under pressure. His strength of nerve will be severely put to the test when he faces parliament tomorrow to present the nation's budget and during the acrimonious weeks of debate that will follow as his critics savage the content. The budget marks the second wave of liberalisation and economic restructuring measures since the government launched its reform programme in July. For a minority administration - Prime Minister Narasimha Rao is still just short of a parliamentary majority - this is almost certainly the last chance it will have to put through a comprehensive package addressed to the issues of fiscal stabilisation, tariff reduction and overmanning in the public sector. The risk is that, under the onslaught he faces, he will prefer to fudge and compromise rather than accept confrontation. There are already signs of Dr Singh's readiness to yield. The opposition, whose attack on the budget is being co-ordinated by the Hindu BJP, the Janata Dal and the left, received a boost on Wednesday when they forced Dr Singh to disclose to parliament the terms of a Dollars 500m loan with the World Bank. Notwithstanding the government's bold intentions, little progress has been made over reducing public sector employment or in devising a mechanism to allow loss-making companies to retrench their workforces or to close. Mr Singh is expected to announce that the 1991-92 budget deficit has been brought down to the target of 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) agreed with the International Monetary Fund. But, with a shortfall on customs revenues this year, and fertiliser subsidies and credit to the Soviet Union costing more than expected, Dr Singh has had to use cosmetics to achieve the desired result. Some subsidy and other payments due this financial year will be carried over to the next budget. At the same time, the BJP, the Janata Dal and the left - bulldozed into silence last year by the magnitude of the economic crisis facing India - have rediscovered the joys of populist socialist economics and of hammering the IMF. With the help of the trade unions, they hope to mobilise public opinion to counter what they call 'anti-poor' policies. Worst of all for the government is that many of the ruling Congress party's members of parliament share the doubts of the left about India's conversion to market economics and the slashing of subsidies. The opposition's hope is that this build-up of pressure will force Prime Minister Rao to abandon Dr Singh or his chief advisers, or force the government to back down from the more unpopular measures. Criticism of the government's economic policies has gained momentum because the economy has performed more poorly than Dr Singh forecast in his budget last July. Inflation, which he said would come down to 9 per cent by March, is at 12-13 per cent and has yet to absorb further increases in administered prices. Industrial production has slumped from 8 per cent growth last year to below zero this. The growth in real GDP has dropped from the 4 per cent expected by Dr Singh in his last budget to 2.5 per cent. Private forecasting institutes estimate probable real growth for next year at between 1.6 and 3.9 per cent, meaning that India will for the first time in 15 years have two consecutive years of such low growth. The government's strongest card is that none of the political parties wants an immediate election and is unlikely to push for a vote that could bring down the government. Its other strength is that it has plentiful support from the IMF and the World Bank, which see India as a major test case of their policies and therefore seem likely to be more generous with funds and more accommodating in negotiation than they would be with other smaller developing nations. As agreed with the Bank and the IMF, the budget's main task is to bring down the fiscal deficit while accelerating structural reform. Unless the deficit is cut (the target is to reduce it to 5 per cent of GDP in 1992/93 from 6.5 per cent this year), inflation will not fall. Lower inflation would enable the government to bring down interest rates and thus ease the recession in industry. The priority the government is giving to bringing down inflation means that the bulk of the cut in the deficit will come from cutting expenditure. Dr Singh is anxious to avoid new taxes that could add to inflation, though he wants to widen the tax base to bring in rural and urban groups who currently pay no direct taxes. The cuts in expenditure will have to come from reductions in subsidies (particularly fertilisers), curbs on government employment and from reducing budget support to the public sector. It is over these measures that Dr Singh will face the toughest opposition. His task is made more difficult by having to combine fiscal stabilisation with cuts in tariff duties. The budget will give the first public signal of how far the government is ready to go in opening up the economy by reducing protective tariffs, which in India average more than 110 per cent. But, as customs duties provide almost 50 per cent of government revenues, Mr Singh will need to offset tariff cuts by raising excise duties, a move that will meet fierce opposition from domestic manufacturers.</p>

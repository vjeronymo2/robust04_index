			<p>SUMMARY                                             Announcing a sharp swing away from its dependence on imported  food in recent years, the Russian government, prompted by the  agrarian lobby's desire to protect farms from foreign  competition, has declared it will import no grain in 1994 and has  slapped import duties on most other food products.  The moves  were made despite a poor grain harvest in 1993 and an expected  further decline this year and provoked outcry by the mayors of  Moscow and St. Petersburg, whose constituents face higher food  prices and possible future shortages as a result of the cutoff of  their large-scale food imports.  But the moves were accompanied  by reformist measures seeking, for example, to reduce the state's  role in agriculture in order to develop private marketing  channels.                                       END SUMMARY     Russian President Boris Yeltsin told reporters on 9 March that  "for the first time in three or four decades, Russia will not  import grain, linen or wool this year" and "we have enough grain  to last us until the new harvest'' (ITAR-TASS, 9 March).  He told  Interfax (9 March) that he had made this decision after talking  to Deputy Premier for agriculture Aleksandr Zaveryukha that  morning, and on 12 March Zaveryukha publicly applauded Yeltsin's  statement and said that his own calculations showed that there is  sufficient food and no grain need be purchased abroad (Russian  TV, 12 March).  In a further move against food imports, Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin on 10 March signed a decree ordering  imposition of duties on many types of food imports, including  fish, shellfish, milk, potatoes, vegetables, and apples, although  not on grain (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 March).  Previously, most  foods were imported duty free (Interfax, 16 March).     Reaction     The import duties brought an outcry, especially from big city  leaders who had been trying to prevent this move for weeks.  Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov in mid-January had written an open  letter to Chernomyrdin complaining that some members of the  cabinet were trying to push through a plan to "protect the  interests of Russian agricultural producer5?? by eliminating  federal food stocks, introducing high customs duties on imported  food, and abolishing subsidies for foreign food prices.  He  argued that by raising prices for foreign foods the duties would  enrich Russian farmers at the expense of Russian consumers,  pointing out that foreign sugar sells for 600 rubles a kilo  whereas Russian sugar costs 900 rubles (ITAR-TASS, 17 January;  Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 January).  After the 10 March decree, the  mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg and the head of the  Yekaterinburg Administration sent Yeltsin an appeal protesting  the increase of import duties (Krasnaya Zvezda, 22 March).  Luzhkov on the television program Itogi on 20 March assailed the  increases, which he attributed to Zaveryukha, and said he had  gone to Chernomyrdin to complain and try to defend the interests  of cities.  Izvestiya reported on 22 March that Moscow's food  suppliers ''immediately jacked up prices'' after import duties were  raised, especially for livestock products.     Zaveryukha and Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun held a news  conference on 22 March to defend the decision, arguing that  Russia can feed itself, but an influx of foreign food is hurting  Russian farming.  They complained that Moscow and St. Petersburg  consumed 70 percent imported food and ignored Russian-produced  food (Russian TV, 22 March).  Zaveryukha complained that imported  food ''has started to flood in from abroad via various commercial  structures'' and that big city leaders, primarily in Moscow and  St. Petersburg, prefer imported foods to Russian foods (Selskaya  Zhizn, 24 March).  In a 24 March Rossiyskaya Gazeta interview he  argued that ''we have plentiful supplies of our own food products''  and therefore food prices will not rise.  As an example of how  imports have damaged domestic agriculture, he complained that  last year's importation of large amounts of dried milk had cut  demand for milk in Moscow and disrupted Russian milk production.  He said that "unless the chaotic situation with imported  products--which are often of poor quality--is stopped, entire  sectors in our own country, such as livestock raising, poultry  farming, and flax growing, are doomed to disappear" (Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 24 March).     Food Supplies     Zaveryukha has long talked of cutting or ending imports, and in  fact, imports had been reduced to 10.4 million tons in 1993--the  lowest in 15 years (Interfax, 14 January) and down from 25.5  million in 1992 (Interfax, 20 January).  Zaveryukha had told a  press conference in early March that Russia will export 3-4  million tons of grain this year (Interfax, 2 March).  He recently  argued that Russia has enough grain reserves to last until  October when the new harvest comes in and may actually be able to  export 2 million tons (Interfax, 16 March).  Aleksandr Kudelya,  first vice president of Roskhleboprodukt (the company that buys  grain for the government), at the beginning of this year  contended that farms really have more grain than they admit and  indicated that Roskhleboprodukt has already contracted with  farmers for 32 million tons and has actually bought 26 million  tons of this, compared to 25 million tons actually bought in 1992  (Interfax, 14 January).     Despite this optimism, the decision to end imports is clearly not  based on increased production, since last year's harvest was not  very high and domestic production this year is expected to be  much worse.  Khlystun has forecast a grain harvest of only 89  million tons for 1994 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 17 March)--far below  the 99 million tons produced in 1993 (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11  March), reflecting dim prospects for 1994 as farmers continue to  experience financial difficulties in buying fuel, equipment, and  seed.  Others assert that even predictions of 89 million tons are  far too optimistic and that Russia will run out of grain,  pointing out, for example, that fall planting of winter grain was  down 20 percent from 1992 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 23 March).  An  Agriculture and Food Ministry official, speaking before Yeltsin  and Zaveryukha announced that there would be no imports, said the  country will need 113.9 million tons of grain (28 million for  food, 28 million for seed, and about 62 million for fodder) and  will have to import 13-14 million tons this year (Interfax, 17  February).     Zaveryukha's optimism seems based largely on reduced demand,  especially for livestock fodder, rather than increased  production, and he has said that his calculations show that  Russia has enough fodder grain this year (Selskaya Zhizn, 29  January).  Much of Russia's grain has traditionally been used to  feed livestock--more than in other countries--and much of the  imported grain is precisely fodder grain.  Under the pressure of  higher grain prices and limited grain supplies, livestock herds  have been cut recently, reducing the amount of grain going to  fodder and cutting grain consumption markedly.  An agricultural  institute estimated that grain consumption by livestock has  fallen from 70 million tons in 1988 to 56 million tons in 1993  (Interfax, 14 January).  Roskhleboprodukt President Leonid  Cheshinskiy recently said that the lower import needs were based  on lower fodder consumption since the number of hogs had fallen  36 percent since 1992 and cattle and poultry 19 percent  (Interfax, 23 March).  Kudelya said that last fall's freeing of  bread prices had led to a 15 percent drop in its consumption  (Interfax, 14 January), discouraging human consumption as well as  feeding cheap bread to animals.  Ironically, the reduction of  livestock herds now seems to be treated as a positive step-  -reducing wasteful use of grain--even though in the past cutting  herds because of fodder shortages was viewed as a major setback  to agriculture, reducing meat and dairy production for years to  come and setting back efforts to improve the Russian diet.     Zaveryukha has also raised the idea that demand will be reduced  by cutting the state's role in procurement.  He argued that a new  procurement system being introduced will decrease the number of  consumers dependent on the federal food fund and make more of  them depend on regional food funds and non-government markets  (Selskaya Zhizn, 29 January).  He has also claimed that federal  food reserves would be reduced this year and would cover fewer  areas, and that wholesale markets would form "the basis of stable  food provision'' (Interfax, 2 February).  An edict ''On  Liberalizing the Grain Market in Russia'' adopted by Yeltsin on 24  December formed a federal grain fund and regional funds and  announced that the federal and regional governments would no  longer require mandatory deliveries from farms (Sobraniye Aktov  Prezidenta i Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 27 December  1993; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 January).  The state set a target of  only 10-11 million tons for its 1994 federal grain fund (10  million, according to Interfax, 14 January 1994; 10.7, according  to Russian TV, 16 March; and 11 million, according to Cheshinskiy  in the 23 March Rossiyskaya Gazeta).  A 23 March Rossiyskaya  Gazeta article called the decree on liberalizing the grain market  "essentially aimed at considerably reducing state purchases of  grain for the federal fund" and creating competition in the grain  market by privatizing grain procurement centers and creating  grain markets.  Reducing the federal food fund would directly  allow a cut in imports because this fund is largely formed from  imported grain (Interfax, 17 February).     Despite Zaveryukha's assertions, however, the new procurement  system does not seem likely to bring a drastic reduction of state  grain needs compared to last year since most of its features had  already been introduced last year.  The government had also  established separate federal and regional food funds in 1993,  with the federal fund only covering the military, Moscow and St.  Petersburg (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 16 February 1993) and had set  federal reserves at only 11.8 million tons for 1993--as against  about 30 million in previous years (Interfax, 2 March 1993).  The  federal fund actually bought 11.5 million tons in 1993 (Interfax,  14 January)--not much more than this year's target.  Total needs-  -including regional as well as federal--may be not much smaller  than the 30-some million purchased in most past years.  Interfax  on 20 January said that present federal and regional funds  comprised 27 million tons.     Financial Aid     Zaveryukha's drive against food imports is part of his campaign  to rescue the ailing farm sector by increasing government  financial aid.  He stated at a February Ministry of Agriculture  and Food meeting that the main thing this year is to prevent  ''disintegration'' of Russian farming and ''preserve Russia's food  independence" and that farms are counting on financial support in  a new government decree on the agroindustrial complex and on  introduction of customs duties on imports (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18  February).  Zaveryukha appeared to achieve considerable success  recently in protecting agricultural interests by pushing through  cabinet approval of a decree "On Functioning of the  Agroindustrial Complex in 1994?' that orders the government to pay  farms for the products they sold to the state in 1993, to allow  farms to postpone payment of their debts, and to retain existing  state subsidies for equipment, parts, fuel, and fertilizer.  According to the Agriculture and Food Ministry, the decree,  approved by the cabinet on 3 February, was to cost the government  14 trillion rubles, but according to critics, its cost would more  likely be 34 trillion, and this big sum from an already hard-  pressed budget caused a big political uproar.     Even after the cabinet decision, controversy over the decree's  financial aid to agriculture continued, and Chernomyrdin delayed  signing it, alarming agrarian lobbyists.  Zaveryukha assured the  Agriculture and Food Ministry on 15 February that the premier  would soon sign the decree (Segodnya, 17 February), but 39  worried Agrarian Party Duma deputies visited Chernomyrdin on 18  February to urge him to sign, and Chairman Aleksandr Nazarchuk of  the Duma's Committee on Agrarian Matters afterward announced the  premier would sign it before the 25 February cabinet discussion  of the budget (Segodnya, 19 February), presumably to nail down  agriculture's allocations before final decisions on the budget.     When finally signed, the controversial decree, now titled "On  Economic Conditions for Functioning of the Agroindustrial Complex  of the Russian Federation in 1994," did include big financial aid  for farms but less than the draft approved on 3 February.  Chernomyrdin signed it on 23 February, and it was published in  the 26 February Selskaya Zhizn and 28 February Sobraniye.  Like  the earlier version the cabinet approved on 3 February, the final  decree ordered paying off of 1993 state debts to farms and  subsidizing of farms' purchase of electricity, fuel, fertilizer,  equipment, and seed, but, according to Nazarchuk, it provided for  considerably less funding for spring sowing and other items  (Segodnya, 24 February).  Zaveryukha portrayed the decree as a  "victory for agrarians," although he admitted that he was ??not  entirely satisfied?? with it (Trud, 26 February), and he insisted  it will provide enough to finance spring sowing (Interfax, 24  February).  Later, farmers complained that banking and finance  officials are dragging their feet in distributing the funds  allotted for the 1994 spring sowing, leaving farmers without the  needed financial help at this critical time (Selskaya Zhizn, 24  March).  It is still unclear whether the amounts promised to  agriculture by the decree conform to the draft budget's  allocations.     Prospects     Zaveryukha's moves to bar imports, accepted by Chernomyrdin and  Yeltsin, seem prompted more by the desire to protect Russian  farmers than by the prospect of satisfactory food supplies.  It  may, however, give needed incentives to farms and help restore  proper domestic production by making the government and others  buy from farmers rather than seek food abroad.  Moreover, the 23  February agroindustrial complex decree, in addition to  protectionist and subsidy aspects, appears to contain reform  features.  It ordered creation of a network of "food markets'' and  agromarketing services'' as "alternative channels" for selling  grain, helping create free market conditions for farmers and  following up on Yeltsin's 24 December edict that abolished  mandatory deliveries and ordered other steps to create a freer  market for food.  But little has been seen yet about the new  system of private markets and regional food funds, and it is not  clear how well it will ensure supplies.     (AUTHOR:  HAHN.

At  this significant armed forces day parade, I would like to  emphasize to the leaders about the [words indistinct] emerged  along with the economic endeavor; traditions of the Defense  services; our present efforts to build political, economic, and  social conditions with the aim of a peaceful and prosperous  country; and the efforts to make our Defense Services a skillful  one to defend our country. Continuing, he said: Comrades know  that the country was under servitude for over 100 years. Our  people lost everything politically, economically, and socially  under this servitude. National pride was degraded. Forty-nine  years ago, on 27 March 1945, our Defense Services, together with  the national people, took whatever weapons were available and  staged a resistance. They sacrificed their sweat and blood for  the return of our people's political, economic and social  rights. Armed Forces Day, or resistance day, has been held  annually to mark that day for the last 49 years in our country.  He added that the Defense Services, while fighting the  enslavers to free the nation from servitude and to make the  country a sovereign state, was founded with the full support of  the national people. The fundamental spirit and attitude that  the Defense Services has always upheld since its inception in  December 1941 until today are: to defend the country and  interests of the people with its life, and to work for the  interests of the nation and the people. He said the comrades  must note that this spirit and attitude are the fundamental  quality and good traditions of the Defense Services.    The commander in chief of the Defense Services continued and  said: Our country was freed from servitude for over 40 years.  For over 40 years, our people have been suffering from the pain  of the internal insurgency that emerged with independence. Due  to this suffering, our country is not as developed as it should  be and it lagged behind and (?became poor). Our country has  good landscape and weather, and has an abundance of forests,  food, and natural resources. While having the basics to become  a rich country, our country is poor because of internal  instability and insurgency. Our country can become a modern,  prosperous, and developed state if we -- the whole nation --  (?discuss) and build the nation in a peaceful and united way.    He then said: Due to historical responsibility, the Defense  Services took state power on 18 September 1988. The whole  nation knows that our Defense Services dutifully and honestly  controlled the country when disturbances and uprisings were  going on all over and the country was on the verge of collapse.  Besides our original responsibility of defense and security, we  have to shoulder the responsibility of restoring peace and  stability in the country and to modernize and develop the  country. The comrades know that this is why the Defense  Services are trying to build the nation and work day and night  with good intentions and goodwill for the utmost betterment of  the country even as it takes responsibility for the country.  The comrades have also seen our country's improved political,  economic, and social conditions.    Continuing, he said: Our country's situation is one where we  are at a crossroad. While the country's old system has stopped,  the country's new system has not exactly emerged yet. At  present, there are two responsibilities to be carried out for  the emergence of a peaceful and modern country. They are:  national reconciliation [two preceding words rendered in  English] and the emergence of a new constitution. Continuing on  national reconciliation, the commander in chief said the  fighting among our national people has been going on for over 40  years since our independence. We all are relatives and brethren  national people, so the killing and bloodshed should be enough  by now. He said: Seek repentance. See the wrong and make it  right. For the sake of the country and the people, repay the  historical debt. We see that while the country possesses the  basics to become rich, it is poor due to disunity, fighting, and  killing among one another. During this time -- while we are  taking responsibility for the country -- we, with the good  intention and goodwill and with the aim of building a modern and  developed state together with all the people in a peaceful and  united way, have discussed, coordinated, and invited the armed  organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. Due to  the invitation, 10 armed organizations in the jungle, which  understood our goodwill, have returned to the framework of a  peaceful political system. They are working hand in hand with  us to implement development programs in the states and we have  achieved considerable success.    He then added: Some armed organizations are still holding  discussions with us. At the same time, some groups do not  understand our genuine goodwill and sincere overture. Some  groups are conspiring to exploit the situation politically and  militarily by saying that we are offering peace because we are  facing political crisis and we are weakening. We, however, are  still patiently waiting for them to return because these groups  still hold on to old political ideas and ignore the development  of the country. They are only working for the interests of their  own group or party.    Continuing, Than Shwe said: Peace overtures were made not  because we are facing a political crisis nor are we weakening.  You must understand that national reconciliation is  indispensable and for this reason we are making the overtures.  This is not only the responsibility of the Defense Services,  but it is also the historical duty of the national people and it  must be carried out today.    Another point is the responsibility and effort to draw up  the  constitution. While there must be national unity for the  emergence of a stable and developed country, it is also  necessary to have a constitution. The comrades also know that  we, on the one hand, have been inviting the armed groups in the  jungle to return to the legal fold; on the other hand, we have  organized and held the National Convention to successfully draw  up a constitution by organizing the delegates from all social  strata -- workers, peasants, intelligentsia and technocrats,  etcetera -- and parties and organizations in the country.  Today, the National Convention has laid down the basic  principles to draw up a constitution and it is being held with  momentum. He addedd: You must not forget the responsibility  with which we, with good intentions and goodwill, must work up  to the stage where the country is governed peacefully by the  forming the organs in accordance with the constitution that will  emerge.    Continuing, the commander in chief of the Defense Services  said: While carrying out these two political responsibilities,  we are also working for the development of economic life --  welfare of the national people etcetera. We are also  transforming from the former Central Plan Economy [three  preceding words in English] -- Socialist Economic System -- to  the present Market Economy [two preceding words in English].  The freedom to do business and trade is also granted. Our  national people are allowed to do business and trade and live  freely depending on their caliber and skill. The right to  freely control a legal business and one which does not affect  the major interests of the country are also granted. These are  implemented to facilitate the economic transformation which will  be suitable to the new country to emerge in the future. While  we are carrying out the political transformation on one side, we  also are carrying out the suitable economic transformation on  the other side. For the transformation of economy, we are  working on private sectors and also creating an atmosphere for  the public sectors to boost the country's economy. Due to  today's position, our country has to base its economy on  agriculture. We have to develop our country Targeted and based  on agriculture. That is why, to [words indistinct] the comrades  are participating in irrigation works to develop our nation's  economy, which will be based on agriculture. Our country has to  base its economy on agriculture and gradually develop other  areas. While the country is not in a position to become an  industrialized nation overnight or to become a rich nation, the  country must base its economy on agriculture, which is favorable  to our country and will gradually transform it into a modern and  developed nation. He also said that comrades have to  participate energetically and enthusiastically in agriculture,  which is the basis for our country's economy, and in other  nation building programs. He added: Comrades, after building  good political and economic foundations, the country will have  good foundations for establishing a peaceful, modern, and  developed state of the future. The comrades should understand  that we, with genuine goodwill, are working day and night on  political and economic matters during this transitional period  to avoid getting into trouble due to frequent political and  economic instability and to allow a new government -- whoever it  may be -- to govern peacefully, prosperously, and with stability.    The commander in chief of the Defense Services said: The  comrades know that we all are trying to build our country into a  modern and developed state. To defend our country and to  perpetuate national sovereignty until the end of time, there is  a need for a strong and skillful Defense Services. It is an  inevitable responsibility to build a strong and skillful Defense  Services to secure and defend our country. He said: As  physical materials are indispensable for the Defense Services to  be strong, the spirit of the comrades is also very important.  He then said spirit and discipline are the lifelines of the  Defense Services. The comrades must have a spirit of not giving  up easily and a spirit to discharge duty with responsibility.  The three national causes -- nondisintegration of the union,  nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of  national sovereignty -- are the belief and pledge of our Defense  Services. Our Defense Services have to [word indistinct] these  national causes. The Defense Services have to be build upon the  training, leadership, welfare, and spirit to become strong and  skillful. Only then, will the units and comrades have the five  essential qualities -- spirit, discipline, loyalty, unity, and  efficiency. He told the comrades not to forget that they can  defend the country only when they have these qualities.    In conclusion, he solemnly urged the comrades to observe the  good traditions of the Defense Services; to carry out dutifully  the national political responsibility, which is being shouldered  by the Defense Services; to participate in the all-around  development of the nation's economy; to strive for a strong and  skillful Defense Services to protect and defend our country in  accordance with the motto -- the nation will have strength only  when the Defense Services have strength; and to observe the code  of conduct of soldiers.</p>

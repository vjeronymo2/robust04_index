			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Caribbean clothing exporters fear new textile regulations CLOTHING exporters in Central America and the Caribbean say they will be damaged if proposals for new rules governing the textile and clothing trade are implemented. The producers, who ship mainly to the US, say their industries will be damaged if quotas are phased out over 10 years, as proposed in the current negotiating text for the industry in the Uruguay Round of trade talks. The producers say their fears have been compounded by the conclusions of a report prepared by the Fiber, Fabric and Apparel Coalition for Trade, a combination of US textile and clothing groups. 'The report projects severe damage to the US industry which would decline by 40 per cent to 60 per cent in the face of unfettered competition by Asian economies, including the large non-market economy of China,' the producers said in letters sent recently to the White House and US congressmen. 'This would occur by the year 2002 if quotas were phased out over the 10-year period proposed in the text tabled by the chairman of the negotiating group on textiles and clothing.' Much of the region's clothes trade with the US is based on bilateral treaties in which clothes are assembled and re-exported. They are assembled from fabric made and cut in the US. On re-entry to the US, duty is paid only on the value added in assembly. The letters say the proposed changes could lead to a reduction of jobs in the US industry from 1.74m to 780,000. 'Consequent job loss and disruption in the Caribbean and Central America would be devastating because 80 per cent of the region's exports of textiles and garments to the United States is through the assembly and re-export programme,' the letters say. The Caribbean interests say the proposed 10-year phase-out of quotas is inadequate protection for the region's fledgling industry. 'The impact on small exporters must be taken into account in any consideration of a timeframe. 'We have concluded that a 15-year period is required. In arriving at this figure, account was taken of the experience of countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.' US clothes imports from the Central American and Caribbean countries last year totalled 718m sq metres, representing an 8 per cent increase over 1989 volume, in a year in which the volume of total US imports declined by 1 per cent. The region's share of the US market last year was 12 per cent, and the exports earned Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 980m), 12 per cent more than 1989 earnings. The leading regional producers are the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Haiti, Jamaica and Honduras.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: And then there were four - Norway's vote to stay out of EU has saved Efta from extinction The European Free Trade Association (Efta), which next month will lose three of its seven members and two thirds of its population to the European Union, can survive in truncated form, ministers of the four remaining nations decided yesterday. The association, set up in 1960, was effectively reprieved from execution by Norway's rejection of EU membership in last month's referendum. It will nevertheless be a shadow of its former self after Austria, Finland and Sweden join the EU on January 1. The Efta population will shrink from 33m to just 11m, comprising two small nations - Switzerland and Norway - and two tiny ones, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Norway and Iceland will continue to be members of the European Economic Area, which ties them into the EU single market, while Liechtenstein hopes to join the EEA shortly. Swiss voters rejected the EEA in a referendum two years ago. Efta ministers meeting in Geneva also agreed yesterday that the Efta court and the Brussels-based Efta surveillance authority set up to oversee operation of the EEA will be retained on a smaller scale. Surprisingly, however, they showed little enthusiasm in encouraging Slovenia's expressed interest in joining the association. Ministers decided first to restart negotiations on a free trade accord with Slovenia which were interrupted when almost complete because of uncertainties over Efta's future existence. Consideration of possible Slovenian membership, which would require further free trade negotiations, has been deferred until early next year. Efta already has free trade agreements with half a dozen former communist states as well as Israel and Turkey, and these will continue. There had been hopes that Efta could find a new role as a 'half-way house' for central and east European nations preparing to join the EU. But Mr Kjartan Johannsson, Efta's Icelandic secretary-general, said this week that apart from Slovenia, whose attempts at forging EU ties are being blocked by Italy over a property dispute, these countries had shown little interest in Efta. 'They are focused firmly on the EU and seem to think we would only be a diversion,' he said. A final decision on the future size and structure of the Efta secretariat in Geneva will be made by mid-January, and put into effect by the middle of next year. But with finances heavily constrained many, and perhaps the majority, of the 270 staff in Geneva and Brussels look set to lose their jobs.</p>

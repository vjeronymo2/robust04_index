			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: TALES OF THE DARK KNIGHT: BATMAN'S FIRST FIFTY YEARS:  1939-1989 BY MARK COSTA VAZ(BALLANTINE: $17.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> This big, elaborate volume traces the history of the Caped Crusader from his  first appearance in issue No. 27 of Detective Comics through Tim Burton's hit  film. "Batman" underwent numerous shifts in tone, graphic style and content  over the decades: The earnest crime fighter of the early '40s bears little  resemblance to the cynical, aging loner in Frank Miller's '80s graphic novels.  Mark Vaz chronicles these transformations with the affection of a devoted fan,  but offers little serious analysis or criticism. Lavishly illustrated with film  and television stills, as well as comic-book pages and covers, "Tales of the  Dark Knight" will delight comics fans.  </P></p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Bonn wants safe havens in Bosnia GERMANY wants the European Community and the United Nations to establish safe havens in Bosnia-Hercegovina to stop further destruction of the republic and dissuade Islamic countries from arming Bosnian forces, officials in Bonn said yesterday. They also said the war in the former Yugoslavia could spread if the EC failed to find a compromise with Greece over what an independent Macedonia should be called. The dispute is holding up the Community's recognition of Macedonia. The officials, speaking at the end of the two-day Franco-German summit in Bonn between President Franc,ois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, admitted any decision to set up safe havens would require tens of thousands of troops deployed under the UN flag. 'It is clear we need safe havens in Bosnia, but the political will is lacking among EC states,' a foreign ministry official said. Germany's constitution prevents it from participating in UN peacekeeping operations. France and Germany are together carving out a 'mini' safe haven in the north-western corner of Bosnia, around Bihac. France, which has committed 2,000 UN troops to the region, and Germany, which is providing humanitarian and medical back-up, yesterday together called for greater humanitarian assistance from their EC partners in providing shelter and safety for the 50,000 refugees already in Bihac. Mr Mitterrand and Mr Kohl called on the EC to find a rapid solution to the Macedonian question. Macedonia will be discussed at the pre-Edinburgh summit meeting of foreign ministers which opens in Brussels on Monday. The outcome will determine whether Macedonia should be placed on the agenda at Edinburgh. 'It is pointless raising the issue at Edinburgh if all 12 Community states do not agree to recognise the independence of the former Yugoslav republic, yet further delay could ignite this part of the Balkan peninsula,' said a German official. Mr Jurgen Chrobog, head of the political directorate at the Bonn foreign ministry, last week visited Croatia, Serbia, the Serbian province of Kosovo and Macedonia to try to find a solution to the Macedonian conundrum as well as apply pressure on Croatia to withdraw its forces from Bosnia-Hercegovina.</p>

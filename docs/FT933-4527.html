			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu cuts R&amp;D to save costs FUJITSU, the Japanese electronics and telecommunications company, is planning to cut the number of research and development projects by about 20 per cent in an attempt to reduce costs and focus its R&amp;D efforts better. The decision is part of a wide-ranging exercise in reducing costs and will involve all leading business fields - from computers and telecommunications to semiconductors - in all parts of the world, Fujitsu said. In the current business year, the company, which owns ICL, the UK-based computer company, is aiming to reduce R&amp;D costs by about Y10bn (Dollars 94.33m) from an initially planned Y295bn. Additionally, Fujitsu plans to cut capital expenditure. It is targeting a reduction of up to Y100bn in capital expend-iture. It hopes to reduce distribution and inventory costs as well. Last year, it was able to cut inventory costs by as much as Y100bn by shortening the shelf life of inventories, but additional reductions have been difficult, the company said. Fujitsu said earlier this year that it was looking to reduce the number of employees on its payroll by 6,000 over the next two years through natural wastage. Fujitsu, which is Japan's largest computer company and a leading manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and semiconductors, has suffered heavily amid the downturn in capital expenditure and consumer spending in Japan. The company has also been hit by the trend away from large mainframe computers, which have been a significant profit earner for the company, to networks of personal computers. In the year to March, Fujitsu reported a loss of Y8.7bn. It expects restructuring efforts will help it return to profit in the current year.</p>

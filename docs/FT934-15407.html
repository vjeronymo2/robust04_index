			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Observer: Hand in glove Kenneth Clarke's pre-Budget insouciance continues to astound. Far from hiding away with a wet towel around his head, Clarke is off tonight to the Mansion House to address a fine, but less than mainstream, gathering, the Worshipful Company of Glovers. Observer presumes Clarke will speak off the cuff at the annual banquet of the 609-year-old livery company, but he should not omit to congratulate one corner of the rag trade that has handled recession fairly well. John Wood, a Tory party activist who lives in Clarke's Nottinghamshire constituency, is probably the first 'master' to secure a chancellor for the event. But the chairman of Ilkeston-based fabric company W. Ball and Son has known Clarke for a good 25 years and says he stands out as a 'good, steady' local politician. Well done the chancellor, who obviously has one section of British industry in the palm of his hand.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Redwood stems NHS controversy MR JOHN REDWOOD, the Welsh secretary, moved swiftly yesterday to defuse a cabinet row over bureaucracy in the National Health Service. Mr Redwood was forced to contact Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to explain remarks he was said to have made in a briefing for journalists on Tuesday. He was reported to have said that there was 'restlessness' among Welsh medical staff 'about the number of men in grey suits'. He was also said to have complained that the government's NHS reforms had led to the appointment of 1,500 more administrators in Wales in the last three years and only 20 more doctors. Mr Redwood said last night that much of what he was reported to have said was 'a lot of nonsense'. He said Mrs Bottomly was 'very happy' with the text of his comments, which showed they were 'both pursuing very similar policies'. Mr Redwood's prompt move to smooth raised hackles means that Mrs Bottomley's unhappiness about his blunt intervention in NHS matters is likely to abate. The episode is an embarrassment to Mr Redwood, a standard bearer of the Tory right who is one of the strongest supporters of the government's health reforms. The health department said there was no truth in claims that it was making the NHS too bureaucratic. Officials said the elimination of regional health authorities in the next two years and the creation of eight regional offices inside a new management executive would reduce bureaucracy. Meanwhile there were new calls yesterday for NHS executives to seek private-sector finance for capital projects. Mr Tom Sackville, parliamentary secretary for health, said that too few hospital trusts and district health authorities were giving fair consideration to private-sector alternatives when purchasing programmes.</p>

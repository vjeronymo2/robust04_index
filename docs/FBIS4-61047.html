			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own information" report: "`Myasishchev-Avia' Will Become </F> Financial-Industrial Group"]    [Text] Right now in connection with the obviously  inadequate nature of the State Defense Order and the lack of  budget financing in the aviation industry a situation has taken  shape which is fraught with the danger of a drastic reduction in  and even the complete stoppage of the development and production  of promising types of aircraft, the loss of skilled design and  production personnel, and, as a result, the loss of Russia's  preeminence in this field.    The Russian Federation Defense Ministry leadership and  leading aviation firms are examining the most diverse ways out  of the situation which has taken shape. One way could be the  attraction of nonbudget funds to finance promising scientific  research and experimental design developments, authorized by the  government's 9 March 1994 decree. To this end the experimental  machine building plant named for Myasishchev, the specialized  "Russkoye oruzhiye" corporation, the Smolensk aircraft plant,  and the "Aviainvest" joint stock company have concluded an  agreement on cooperation and joint activity and the creation of  a new corporate body -- the "Myasishchev-Avia' closed-type  joint-stock company.    The main aims of the "Myasishchev-Avia" joint-stock company  will be the development, production, sale, and servicing, both  on the domestic and the foreign market, of promising  developments of the Myasishchev experimental machine building  plant. It is a case of the "Geofizika" high-altitude aircraft  designed for optical and radar monitoring of the earth's surface  and the monitoring of the environment's ecological situation,  the "Gzhel" light multipurpose freight and passenger aircraft  (up to 500 kg of payload or up to six passengers), the joint  Russian-Indian project for the "Duet" passenger liner for  medium-distance routes, the M-112 freight and passenger  aircraft, and other programs.    The joint-stock company which is being created is viewed as  the prototype for a financial-industrial group in the field of  planning, producing, and selling aircraft including on the  foreign market. Using both state and nonbudget funds.    In implementing this project the Myasishchev experimental  machine building plant will monitor the development of promising  competitive models of aircraft, the "Russkoye oruzhiye"  specialized corporation will monitor the development of the  financial strategy for the development of the "Myasishchev-Avia"  joint-stock company, the attraction of nonbudget funds, and  marketing, the Smolensk aircraft plant will monitor the  production of experimental models of aircraft developed under  the leadership of the "Myasishchev-Avia" joint-stock company and  their subsequent series production, and the "Aviainvest"  joint-stock company will monitor collaboration with the air  force and quality control through the institute of military  representatives.</p>

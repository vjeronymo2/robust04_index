			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Price competition prompts Nestle to cut 515 more jobs A further 515 jobs are to be cut in the UK by Nestle following the Swiss multinational's decision to end processing in the UK of all canned foods other than its milk products. The company said the decision had been prompted by price competition in canned foods and the fact that its Crosse &amp; Blackwell brand had only a 2 per cent share of that market sector. Mr Graham Millar, managing director of Nestle Food Division, said the food canning operations were 'unprofitable in the face of intense competition'. Its baked beans, for example, had been selling for 29p a can two years ago, but other processors' own-label beans for supermarkets were now selling for as little as 7p a can. Nestle added that the Crosse &amp; Blackwell brand, which it acquired more than 30 years ago, would be kept for products such as Branston Pickle and low-calorie dressings. The cuts, following the loss of 450 administrative jobs this summer, will hit three factories. The plant at Milnthorpe, Cumbria, will close by next August with the loss of 190 jobs. The plant's tomato ketchup and standard salad cream lines will be withdrawn, its fruit juice contracted out to a subsidiary of Coca-Cola and its low-calorie dressings transferred to Nestle's plant in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire. The group's Staverton, Wiltshire, plant will lose 145 jobs when canning ends next March, but its chilled food operations will be retained. The Peterhead plant will lose 180 jobs when canning of soups, beans and pasta ends next June - but it will become Nestle's 'centre of excellence' for Branston Pickle. Nestle UK employs 17,000 people. The prospect of widespread job losses was raised earlier this year when it began a review of all UK operations to improve competitiveness.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Inco offsets slump in nickel price LOSSES at Inco, the nickel producer, were virtually unchanged in the second quarter. A further slump in nickel prices was offset by improved results from the company's alloys business, lower interest charges and favourable currency movements. The Toronto-based company suffered a loss of Dollars 2.2m, or 3 cents a share, in the latest period, compared with a Dollars 1.5m loss, also 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues slipped to Dollars 608m from Dollars 681m. Operating earnings of the primary metals division dropped to Dollars 31m from Dollars 46m. The price of nickel realised during the quarter fell by 16 per cent to Dollars 2.93 a lb, while copper, cobalt and rhodium prices were also lower. However, unit production costs for nickel were 9 per cent lower in the second quarter, reflecting reduced employment costs and the weaker Canadian dollar. The alloys and engineered products division, which is restructuring, turned a Dollars 5m loss last year into an operating profit of Dollars 4m, due to lower operating costs and higher alloy shipments. Third-quarter earnings will be boosted by Inco's recent sale of its 62 per cent stake in TVX Gold, a gold producer, which brought an after-tax gain of about Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.14 a share.</p>

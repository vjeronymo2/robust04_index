			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Observer: Express delivery Eve Pollard, resplendent in a skin-tight navy-blue dress and high heels, was yesterday morning in fine fettle, looking 'much happier than normal', according to Observer's pals within United Newspapers' HQ. Apart from a moan about the UN board getting agitated about competition from colour magazines, Pollard was positively beaming, if a little perturbed about budgetary pinches. And lo] A couple of hours later the news broke that she was resigning as editor of the Sunday Express, the circulation of which has declined from 1.6m to below 1.5m since she joined the paper in 1991. Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.</p>

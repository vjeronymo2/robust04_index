			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: City Site deal Glasgow-based property group City Site Estates rose 10 to 80p after UK Active Fund, the investment group which recently led the successful refinancing of Greycoat, took a near 10 per cent stake. The 1.5m shares were part of the 2.229m - 14.5 per cent of the shares - sold by Scottish Provident, the remainder being placed with institutions by James Capel, City Site's broker, which crossed the bulk of the shares at 62p. Capel is forecasting a rise in the group's net asset value from 32p to approaching 100p this year. In January, City Site reported a return to profits for the first time since 1989. There were some big casualties in the composite insurance sector. Dealers fretted about the impact on big financial institutions of the retreat by international bond and equity markets since the US Federal Reserve embarked on its tightening of monetary policy in February. The whole of the sector was hit yesterday but the keenest action in the market was in General Accident, whose shares dropped to 594p before settling a net 23 off at 599p. The slide came after what was described as a split selling order - when a broker's simultaneous dealings with a number of marketmakers was seen as a bearish signal. Turnover was a relatively heavy 1.2m shares. Elsewhere, Commercial Union lost 11 to 590p, Royals 10 to 264p and Sun Alliance 12 to 323p. Merchant banks also suffered from similar concerns. SG Warburg, one of the biggest and most influential bond traders in London, and badly affected on Tuesday by a BZW downgrade, were hammered again after talk of a broker sell recommendation. Warburg shares slumped 48 to 690p. Hambros lost 13 to 365p and Schroders 10 to 1215p. Kleinwort Benson eased 7 to 465p. In the clearing banks Barclays slipped 6 to 516p and HSBC 12 to 745p while Lloyds edged up 2 to 537p after UBS recommended switching into the last named. There was also talk that James Capel had taken HSBC, its parent, off its global buy list. There was speculation that HSBC was about to launch a 240p a share bid for Hogg Group, the insurance broker where it recently built up a 7.3 per cent stake; Hogg rose 2 to 224p. Favourable US comment on Merck, the leading pharmaceuticals group, hit Zeneca whose shares fell 15 to 687p, the first time they have been below 700p since last August. The comment focused on Merck's heart drug and led to some competition concerns for Zeneca's hypertension treatment, Zestril. Zeneca also suffered in line with weak international stocks which all slipped in response to a weak Wall Street. Wellcome lost 13 to 514p, in spite of the potential boost from a series of company presentations to Scottish investors. But Glaxo held steady at 564p, although some dealers suggested the threat to its anti-ulcer treatment, Zantac, from Ciba Geigy would not go away. Hoare Govett, a former supporter of the company, now believes that sales of the headline product will experience a 40 per cent annual decline in the US once it comes off patent at then end of next year. The overseas effect also overhung Reed International whose shares shrugged off the effect of a positive annual meeting to shed 5 at 833p. Pearson held steady at 654p ahead of its seminar on Monday, while Reuters Holdings added 3 1/2 to 489p ahead of its presentation to analysts in Geneva early next week. Some speculation moved in the market that Eurotunnel will make a surprise launch of its rights issue today in tandem with the company's annual announcement. The middle of May has been widely tipped as the date for the rights issue and one transport analyst was quick to discount the idea that Eurotunnel will move any earlier as 'extremely unlikely'. The shares lost 20 to 476p. Bryant Group, the upmarket housebuilding company, was the pick of the construction stocks, the shares racing up 6 to 164p, following upgrades from two of the leading broking houses, Kleinwort Benson and NatWest Securities. Vodafone closed 4 higher at 500p after NatWest said the stock had been oversold. Allied Lyons steadied in a weak drinks sector, off a penny at 576p, as Kleinwort Benson reiterated its positive stance. There was continued bid speculation around Laura Ashley, the shares buoyed up 6 to 86p. The two names being linked with the upmarket women's clothes and furnishings group, Next and Sears, slipped 2 to 236p and a half to 124p, respectively. Cash-rich Great Universal Stores, off a penny at 603p, was another potential bidder being mooted. Continued strength in Dorling Kindersley, the publisher, reflected gathering bid speculation over the company which came to the market almost two years ago. Analysts said the group might appear expensive but the recent hefty premium paid for Software Toolworks of the US had redefined the appetite for groups with a multi-media tag. The shares closed 2 up at 280p. Fears that next month's results from USAir will disappoint helped to drag down the shares of British Airways, which has a large stake in the US airline. The price tumbled 10 to 406p in turnover of 2.6m. MARKET REPORTERS: Steve Thompson, Christine Buckley Chris Price, Peter John. Other statistics, Page 40</p>

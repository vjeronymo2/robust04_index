			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Manila urged to curb security force killings THE Philippine government should take urgent action to stop unlawful killings by its security forces, according to Amnesty International, the human rights movement. In a report published today, it says that at least 550 unarmed people, including children and elderly people with no connection to the opposition, have been killed by government or government-backed forces since 1988. Members of the army, police and officially-backed militia groups and civilian groups have carried out killings, as well as paramilitary and vigilante groups working in collusion with security forces or with their acquiescence. In addition, hundreds of people have 'disappeared' while in police or military custody, Amnesty says. Abuses of human rights reflect the strong influence of the military in Philippine politics even after the restoration of democracy under President Corazon Aquino in 1986. The military has been given considerable freedom to counter armed opposition groups. Amnesty said the practice of 'red-labelling' - publicly identifying alleged opponents of the government as subversives - particularly contributed to the killing. The Philippines: the killing goes on.

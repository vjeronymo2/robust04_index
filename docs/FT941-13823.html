			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Smith keeps focus on big prize Mr John Smith would be delighted if tomorrow's Commons debate on the finance bill implementing Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget ended in government defeat. And he would be overjoyed by a strong Labour showing in this year's local and European elections. But the big prize from which the Labour leader's eye will not be diverted is victory at the next general election. That is the context in which the deepening political row over tax should be seen. Of course, Labour whips would welcome with open arms any Tory rebels in the vote on the government's proposals to impose value added tax on domestic fuel that will follow tomorrow's debate. But they hold out little hope of more than a token defection. The generosity of the government's compensation package for pensioners hit by the tax has seen to that. Not even Mr William Powell, arguably the foremost Tory rebel over VAT on fuel, plans to support the Labour amendment. The MP for Corby reasons that tomorrow night's vote will not in fact be about VAT on fuel, but about whether to give the finance bill a second reading. What Labour leaders really hope will be achieved by tomorrow's debate - and the argument that raged at the weekend over the respective tax burdens imposed by Labour and Tory governments - is a further chipping away at the image the Conservatives have traditionally enjoyed as the party of low taxes and economic competence. It is a slow and deliberate process. If in a couple of years during the next election campaign the Tories are deterred from plastering Britain's billboards with an updated version of the 'Labour's tax bombshell' posters of 1992, it will be a sign that the Labour leader's strategy is working. But so far the party is operating at only half-throttle. It can ruthlessly attack the high taxes the Tories are levying in their efforts to bring the public sector borrowing requirement under control. What it cannot do is state categorically that taxes would be lower under Labour. This is because the party has - quite deliberately - given not the faintest inkling of the detailed economic policies on which it will fight the next general election. Its economic commission is just beginning the process of constructing a watertight economic platform. Until the party unveils the fruits of its labour, Mr Clarke can keep arguing that the Conservatives would tax less than their principal opponents in any given year.</p>

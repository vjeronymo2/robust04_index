			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Improve state aids controls Sir, Your leading article on state aids in Europe ('Controlling state aids', October 19) rightly highlights the distortion they cause to competition and the threat they pose to the single market. In no case is the danger of inadequate regulation of state aids greater than in sectors which already have excess capacity, and where growth in demand is inadequate to restore equilibrium between demand and capacity. That is why the European synthetic fibres industry has consistently supported the European Union guidelines which prohibit subsidies for creation of new capacity in our sector. Such guidelines may, as you point out, lead to inconsistency between sectors. However, the way to deal with such inconsistency must be to improve the standards of monitoring and control of state aids to the best possible level - not to reduce the level of safeguards, where they exist in a relatively effective form, to a low common denominator.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 21 Jan -- This year's first session of the  new government was held today at Government House on  Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya. Journalists were informed of  this by Valentin Sergeyev, head of the Russian Federation's  government press service at the end of the session, which lasted  for an hour behind closed doors.    He said that questions on the organization of the work of  the  Cabinet of Ministers in 1994 were examined at the session.  Viktor Chernomyrdin, who chaired the session, said that the  government would probably now meet more frequently than it did  last year, and that the Presidium would meet perhaps twice a  week. The prime minister is also confident that the 20 percent  reduction in the apparatus of the government and the ministries  will in no way affect the quality of their work; rather it will  improve its effectiveness.    Viktor Chernomyrdin focused particular attention in his  speech at the session on relations between the government and  the Federal Assembly. He stressed that "The government must  learn to build its work with the Federation Council and the  State Duma in a new way." "We must establish close, businesslike  cooperation. There should be no confrontation, because we have  common interests," he said.    There was also brief discussion today of the question of  holding, possibly on 17 February, an extended session of the  government. It is anticipated that Boris Yeltsin will take part  and that the heads of the constituents of the Federation will be  invited.    Viktor Chernomyrdin also drew considerable attention to the  fact that a number of enterprises are lying idle. He described  this situation as one of the leading questions of today, which  requires a government solution. Ways and means must be sought  to assist these enterprises, which must restart and bring  revenue to the budget.    Valentin Sergeyev said that the question of the minister of  finance was not examined at today's session.</p>

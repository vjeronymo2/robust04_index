			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Brussels urges Greece to cut debt GREECE is at last making progress on economic reform but must take further steps to reduce a ballooning public debt, the European Commission says in its latest report on the Greek economy. The confidential report was made available by Greek officials before next week's meeting of the EC monetary committee, where Greece is expected to ask for the second Ecu500m (Pounds 406m) tranche of a special Ecu2.2bn loan. Greece postponed asking for the loan tranche, due to be paid last February, after being criticised sharply by the Commission for falling short of 1991 targets for trimming the public sector deficit and failing to introduce structural reforms. The reforms were agreed when the first Ecu1bn tranche was transferred. Officials in Athens hope this year's improved performance will help to ensure payment of the loan early in 1993, after Greece's plan for economic convergence with its EC partners has been approved. 'Grounds for optimism, albeit restrained, have emerged for the first time,' the report said. 'Since the spring of 1992, the government has pursued a more determined course to attain its fiscal objectives and to reform the economy.' It noted the government had implemented reforms of the tax and social welfare systems, speeded up privatisation, and kept a tighter control on spending by public enterprises. A budget surplus, amounting to 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product, is expected this year, the first in over a decade. The deficit is being contained, with central government borrowing down from 13.1 of GDP in 1991 to 8.3 per cent this year. But despite the rescheduling of about Dr3,100bn (Pounds 10.2bn) of domestic debt in the past year, the public debt will rise by 5 percentage points this year to an estimated 130 per cent of GDP, as a result of increased interest payments. The Commission's report warned that Greece's financial stability was threatened by such a high level of debt, adding: 'Debt stabilisation is a key fiscal question which remains to be addressed in an adequate manner.' Mr Sotiris Hadzigakis, the Greek agriculture minister and a strong opponent of privatisation, resigned yesterday in protest at a cabinet decision to seek bids from international companies for a forest fire protection programme for Greece.</p>

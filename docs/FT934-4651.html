			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drinks cheer The drinks sector was buoyant following the chancellor's decision not to increase excise duties. Bass, which yesterday reported respectable but dull figures, according to analysts, was one of the star performers, surging 34 to 537p in its biggest ever turnover of 16m. Other domestic-based drinks stocks also bounded forward, Scottish &amp; Newcastle rising 25 to 512p, Whitbread 21 to 557p, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 31 to 531p, Allied-Lyons 25 to 620p and Greenalls also 25 to 408p. Poor results from Argyll Group confirmed the market's worst fears over the impact of the price war currently under way among the country's food retailers. As well as announcing figures at the bottom end of forecasts, the company was telling analysts that the continuing price pressures might affect second-half profits. The stock dropped 23 to 256p in record turnover of 23m. Bank shares were among the market's best performing stocks and interest in the sector was additionally boosted by news that SG Warburg Securities had launched a call warrant into a basket of four UK bank stocks, underlining the broking firm's bearish stance on the stocks. Each basket is the equivalent of seven Barclays, seven National Westminster, six TSB and three Royal Bank of Scotland shares, and was priced at Pounds 104.57 as at 4.30pm on November 30. Warburg said the warrant would enable holders of the underlying stocks who want to lock in profits but also wish to maintain exposure to the sector to do so by selling the stock and purchasing the warrant. National Westminster was the strongest performer in the sector, climbing 27 to 586p, closely followed by Barclays, up 25 at 609p. HSBC climbed 20 to 762p, Lloyds 11 to 604p, Abbey National 18 to 424p and TSB 7 to 221p. Merchant banks showed SG Warburg 40 higher at 897p and Kleinwort Benson up 16 at 539p. Composite insurances delivered strong gains across the board, confirming the view prevalent in the market after the Budget that the imposition of a 3 per cent tax on general insurance would have only a minimal impact on the companies' business and that their stock prices would anyway be big beneficiaries of the market's surge. Commercial Union, where dealers cited large-scale switching out of the convertible bond, jumped 19 1/2 to 626p. Sun Alliance rose 11 1/2 to 381p. Leading property shares bounded forward as hopes of sustained low interest rates underpinned the rises. Dealers said the immediate response was to the hardening gilt yields, which will impact in turn on the yields in the direct property market. Even after yesterday's big rises, one leading agency broker said: 'All the bull arguments are still valid. The sector still has plenty of value.' MEPC, which reports results today, advanced 17 to 550p, Land Securities 20 to 763p and Hammerson 17 to 394p, leading the risers. Rothmans International softened 2 to 411p after a disappointing trading statement and profits of Pounds 233.4m, which were in line with forecasts but affected by Pounds 16.6m of restructuring. Publishers recorded sharp gains on relief that the chancellor did not impose VAT on books, newspapers and magazines in the Budget. United Newspapers soared 34 to 583p, EMAP forged ahead 38 to 401p, The Telegraph was up 19 to 404p and Reed International gained 32 at 797p. Airline and foreign holiday companies shrugged off worries over the new airport levy. BAA rose 22 to 951p, British Airways 8 to 428p, Airtours 22 to 457p and Owners Abroad 4 to 79p. Euro Disney was helped by a report in the French press that US parent Walt Disney may be prepared to put up Dollars 700m in loans and fresh capital if banks follow suit. The shares jumped 45 to 413p. The strong market rescued an oil sector still beset by worries about crude oil prices. Shell was run up 14 to 694p and BP edged up 4 to 337 1/2 p.</p>

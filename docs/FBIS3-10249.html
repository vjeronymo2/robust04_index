			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colombian President Cesar Gaviria has stated in  Tokyo that the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba is rooted in  strictly commercial grounds. Gaviria pointed out that Colombia  feels entirely free to continue trading with Cuba and will in  fact do so, since such is the treatment any country in the world  deserves.    Colombia announced last week that it will begin selling  between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba as of  mid-1994.</p>

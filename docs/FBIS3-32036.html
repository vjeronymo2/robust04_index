			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Venezuelan President-Elect Rafael Caldera in </F> Caracas -- live]    [Text] Venezuelan people, I fulfill with pleasure the offer  to announce this evening the names of the Venezuelans who make  up the work team that will accompany me in the government tasks  we will begin on Wednesday. I promise the viewers I will not  take one minute from their opportunity to see the historical  game that will start at 1900 in Valencia, where the two  traditional rivals -- the Caracas and Magallanes teams -- will  participate in a traditional game and decide who will represent  Venezuela in the Caribbean games.    I proceed to indicate the names of the cabinet ministers and  personalities who will accompany us in the government tasks,  which shall be difficult but which we will take on with great  faith in Venezuela, great love for the country, and great hope.    The Interior Ministry has been accepted by Ramon Escovar  Salom, whom, suffice it to say, earned the Venezuelan people's  admiration and respect as prosecutor general of the Republic  during five years of the administration which is about to end.    I have appointed Dr. Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas, a diplomat  with great experience and an important politician, to the  Foreign Ministry. He was presidential candidate with a  substantial number of votes; and he is respected and appreciated  by the Venezuelan people in general.    Julio Sosa Rodriguez has accepted the post of finance  minister. He is a man who refused, although he was insistently  asked to do so, to occupy any ministry in previous  administrations. During my first administration he was an  excellent ambassador to the United States of America, and he was  an efficient negotiator for Venezuela's admission to the Andean  Pact. Julio's experience, his reputation, his moral stature  qualify him to handle the tremendous fiscal and economic  problems Venezuela will face.    Army Division General Rafael Angel Montero Revette will be  defense minister. He is a 49-year-old military officer with a  brilliant service record who is currently inspector general of  the Army. He will be accompanied by a distinguished list of  officers in the military High Command: Rear Admiral Rafael  Huizi Clavier, Armed Forces inspector general; Air Force  Division General Maglio Montiel Arguello, chairman of the Joints  Chiefs of Staff; Army Division General Moises Antonio Orozco  Graterol, Army commanding general; Rear Admiral Carlos Ramos  Flores, Navy commander; Air Force Division General Otto Garcia  Rivera, Air Force commanding general; and Armed Forces of  Cooperation [FAC] Division General Egberto Arruza Delgado,  National Guard commanding general.    The Development Ministry will be occupied by Architect Luis  Carlos Palacios, a university professor, a man with a vast  knowledge of economic issues, and an honest and hard-working man.    The Education Ministry will be occupied by Dr. Antonio Luis  Cardenas, former rector and founder of the Libertador  Pedagogical University, a teacher with a vast experience who  recently has been in charge of the Education Directorate in  Merida State, where he conducted some experiments that earned  the admiration and approval of experts in education issues.    The Health and Social Welfare Ministry will be occupied by  Dr. Vicente Perez Davila, 39 years old, a brilliant doctor with  a post-graduate degree from the United States. Furthermore, he  will be supported by a National Health Council which includes  Dr. Fernando Ruben Coronil, who will act as chairman, Dr. Pedro  Rincon Gutierrez, Dr. Jacinto Convit, Dr. Pablo Pulido, Dr.  Alberto (Guidan) Baldo, Dr. Hernan Mendez Castellanos, Dr. Blas  Bruni Celli, Dr. Luis Manzanilla, and representatives of the  most important organizations in the health sector: the medical  schools, the pharmaceutical schools, and professional  organizations. They will meet on an ad honorem basis at least  once a month to advise the Ministry on critical issues  pertaining to health.    For agriculture and livestock minister, I have chosen Ciro  Anez Fonseca, a man who is also well-known in economic sectors,  specializing in agricultural problems. He has been president of  Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers  of Commerce and Industry] and Pro-Venezuela. He has broad  support from business sectors, especially from the small and  medium business sectors.    For labor minister, I have chosen Dr. Juan Nepomuceno  Garrido, with broad academic training, with post graduate  studies in Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. He has been my  closest aide in drafting the basic labor law, in passage of the  bill through the legislative chambers, and topics dealing with  labor issues.    For transport and communications minister, I have chosen  Engineer Cesar Quintini Rosales, who also has several post  graduate degrees from U.S. universities. He has undertaken  specialized studies on transportation and has a solid reputation  in his professional area.    For justice minister, I have chosen lawyer Ruben Creixems,  the youngest in the cabinet at 36. He is currently director of  the law school of the Andres Bello Catholic University.    For the Energy and Mines Ministry, I have chosen Eng. Erwin  Jose Arrieta Valera. He has been president of the Mining  Chamber and secretary general of the Petroleum Chamber. He is  deeply concerned about and involved in petroleum issues. He has  gained interesting experience by being ambassador to Kuwait and  the United Arab Emirates in the past six months.    For the Environment and Natural Renewable Resources  Ministry,  a specialist fully dedicated to these problems, especially to  the problem which is so important, serious, and essential for  the Venezuelans: the supply of water not only in the  metropolitan and rural areas but in the neglected areas of  cities which suffer so much due to this lack of water. [No name  provided by Caldera; Madrid EFE at 0003 GMT on 1 February in a  report on the cabinet announcement indicates that Roberto Perez  Lecuna is the environment and natural resources minister.]    For the Urban Development Ministry, I have chosen Eng. Ciro  Zaa, from Barquisimeto. He is currently a member of the board  of directors of the Yacambo dam project. He is 44. I hope that  in the area of housing, especially lower-income housing, he will  carry out important tasks.    For the Family Ministry, I have chosen Dr. Mercedes Pulido  de  Briceno. She is well-known in media circles and well linked to  the university sectors. She is very concerned about social  issues. She will have to work hard due to the importance of  this Ministry which in a future state reform will become a  social development ministry.    For the Secretariat of the Presidency, I have chosen a team  that has my most absolute trust. Andres Caldera will be  minister; Fernando Egana will be deputy minister; Fernando  Febres Villalba will be private secretary; Guillermo Alvarez  Bajares will be chief of the Central Information Office, with  rank of minister of state; and Enrique Alvarado will be director  of presidential relations.    For chief of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning  of the Presidency, Cordiplan, I have chosen Enzo del Buffalo, a  young economist, well respected, well-known, and well viewed in  the circles involved in the national economy.    I note that we have returned to the original situation when  Cordiplan was created. At that time, Manolo Perez Guerrero and  the comrades who helped him in creating this organization  insisted that this should not be a ministry, rather it should be  an office under the umbrella of the Presidency to be removed  from the differences that exist between the diverse ministries.    Asdrubal Batista, 46, minister for the reform of the  national  economy; professor of Yesa [not further identified]; professor  in [word indistinct], and Harvard professor. He will be in  charge of the study and planning of long-term measures for the  in-depth reform of the Venezuelan economy. We believe that the  government, through the economic institutions, must face the  current situation, it must take immediate measures, it must look  for ways to solve for Venezuela the difficult situation it is  experiencing. We cannot be satisfied with this, we must look at  the petroleum policy, at the economic policy in general, new  horizons, new ways to mark the road for Venezuela toward the  21st century that is at our doorstep.    Decentralization Minister Jose Guillermo Andueza, professor  of Constitutional law; secretary of the commission that drew up  the 1961 Constitution; adviser of the bicameral commission that  presented the draft bill for the general reform of the  Constitution in 1992. He is a man of great experience and  authority on this subject. This subject is undoubtedly very  sticky as we must find satisfactory solutions so that the  coordination between the central government and the regional and  municipal institutions is not broken. In this way these  decentralization tendencies will be channeled positively toward  what the people are demanding: the solution to their grave  problems.    As youth minister: Sociologist Pilarica Iribarren de Romero.  I have asked Pilarica to accept this task with the desire to  have the presence of the younger generation felt at all times,  through the national government's concerns and actions. I have  perceived that the younger generation complained that during  political campaigns they are praised and courted. Nevertheless,  once the campaigns are over, once the elections are over, the  government has so much to do, it has neither the time nor the  willingness to take them into account. I have asked Pilarica  Iribarren to take up this task and I am certain she will be  successful.    I have appointed a state minister for higher education,  science, and technology. This does not imply, if this is  decided, that there cannot be a [word indistinct] director who  of course would be under the direction of and with the  representation of the state minister. [sentence as heard] The  Education Ministry is undoubtedly too big. The work load the  education minister has does not leave him time for anything  else. The problems and the demands to find adequate solutions  in higher education are very serious. This is why I have take  this initiative. When I announced this decision to the  presidents of the national universities, they were very pleased.  That is, to appoint a state minister for higher education,  linking him with science and technology so as not to increase  excessively the number of ministers. The candidate chosen is  Guido Hernan Arroyo, who was, I think, president of the Andres  Bello Catholic University Andres Bello for 18 years. He solved  many difficult situations there and he won the admiration and  appreciation not only of the Catholic University community but  also of the university community in general.    Special Minister Pompeyo Marquez, who has, according to what  is provided for in the Constitution, the task of advising the  president and assisting him in whatever duties with which he may  be entrusted. I believe that Pompeyo will be a link between me  and the political sector. At the same time he will take over  enthusiastically, with the dedication for work that has always  characterized him, a series of very important matters. For  example, he has mentioned to me overhauling the national border  council which has been very neglected lately; this would be  dealt with. Another matter would be to find a way to stimulate  small and medium industry, the handicraft industry, which can  and should be a very important part of the solution to the  economic and social problems of Venezuela.    Economist German Luis Soriano has been appointed president  of the Tourism Corporation. I must say that I believe that  tourism is one of the activities that we should immediately get  involved in because that task, that sector has great  possibilities of solving Venezuela's current deficit. German  Luis Soriano is a very capable man, he has held important posts.  He was vice president of Santa Maria University. He is a  capable, intelligent, and enthusiastic person. I have also  appointed him as a state minister to give the tourism industry  all possible support from the Executive Branch.    Economist Abdon Vivas Teran has been appointed president of  the Venezuelan Investment Fund. He is well-known in political  and economic circles.    Alberto Poleto, 46, has been appointed to the Foreign Trade  Institute.    Abdon Vivas Teran is another younger member of the  government  team. In this team I have insisted on achieving what I call  generational gap solidarity as there are very important senior  citizens who are still very active, there are also very young  members in whose performance I have a great deal of hope.    I must explain that these presidents of institutions who are  appointed state ministers do not represent for the state, for  the national budget, any additional expense. While they are  presidents of those institutions they do not need to have  another or a special remuneration as state ministers. As state  ministers, however, they are given the opportunity to attend the  cabinet meetings. It may be said that the cabinet is quite  large but if the sessions are conducted orderly and  constructively, I believe there is no danger that these meetings  will become boring and unfruitful.    Ricardo Conveias, appointed president of the Presidential  Commission for State Reform, Copre, is currently president of  the National Association of Constitutional Law professors. He  is closely linked to this subject and he will undoubtedly give  this matter of constitutional reform a high level of importance.    To conclude, I have appointed Asdrubal Aguiar Aranguren, 44,  federal district governor. He is young but his life has been  full of diverse activities; he has a great deal of ability,  intelligence, and has a thorough understanding of the nation's  problems. Currently, Asdrual is a member of the Inter-American  Court for Human Rights. This undoubtedly promises that he will  have the human rights problems and its surveillance present as  governor.    I have kept my promise to the fans of the dramatic game  between Caracas and Magallanes that will take place shortly in  Valencia. I hope that the game will match the hopes and  expectations of the public. I hope that the winner will also  reward us by winning the Caribbean Series at Puerto La Cruz.  Thank you and good night.

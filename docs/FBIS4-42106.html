			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dick Ljungberg: "Worn-Out Ministers Tough It </F> Out"]    [Excerpts] The hair on the ministers who entered the  coalition government in October 1991 has turned considerably  grayer. They had no idea of the extent of what was waiting for  them: a budget crisis, a foreign exchange crisis, a bank crisis,  and mass unemployment. But despite what many people were  predicting, they are still in office as we approach the finish  line.    The most competent government's trip down the only path, as  the saying went at the time, got off to a flying start. But it  may end this spring with the government going from setback to  setback in the Riksdag and, like a groggy boxer, staggering  around the ring waiting to be rescued by the sound of the bell.    The New Democrats are the ones who may mess things up again.  A little over a year ago, when Carl Bildt threatened New  Democracy with new elections, he brought Ian Wachtmeister to his  knees. At least the New Democracy group thought so, and now it  is coming back with renewed opposition strength.    So far, the threat of new elections has been the minority  government's only serious crisis in the Riksdag. And on one  occasion it was almost made from within the coalition: in  January of this year over the issue of the bridge over the  sound. Olof Johansson argued with the other three party leaders  about the bridge for 25 hours, he says, and at one point he  yelled at the prime minister: "What the hell do you think you  are doing?"  <H5>  Center Party Made Threats </H5>   There were also a few near-accidents during the negotiations  over the emergency package in the fall of 1992. The Social  Democrats were demanding that the KDS [Christian Democratic  Party] and the Center Party be ignored on the issues of the home  care allowance and agricultural subsidies respectively, but in  the interest of solidarity, Bildt firmly refused.    During the negotiations, Bengt Westerberg wanted to raise  the  value-added tax on food items back up to 25 percent.    "If that happens, I'm walking out the door," Johansson  threatened, and no more was said about it.    So why has the government managed to hold together despite a  series of splits that often grew worse because they were leaked  to the mass media?    The simplest answer is that the four parties had no choice.  One more fiasco after the mess they made from 1976 to 1982 would  have discredited the nonsocialist alternative for government for  the rest of the century.    And it is nonsocialism, not bourgeois ideology, that has  been  the cement holding the government together.    Carl Bildt, Bengt Westerberg, and Olof Johansson were also  together the last time around, and they benefited from that  experience when the new government was being formed. [passage  omitted]    Johansson has his own explanation for why things have gone  better than the last time. He says it is easier with four  parties than with three. Four parties provide more opportunities  for getting support from some other party on an issue -- it is  not just a matter of two parties ganging up on the third.    As prime minister, Bildt gets good marks from the other  parties. He is considered to be a surprisingly good team leader  who has the ability to enliven the atmosphere while also being  very dexterous when it comes to finding solutions.    But there is a general complaint: Bildt likes to put off  difficult decisions, something that irritates the more  executive-minded members of the Cabinet Office.  <H5>  Bildt Lacks Warmth </H5>   It is also said from the inside that there has been a lack  of  "warmth and feeling" in the political message. That criticism is  directed against the entire government, but as prime minister,  Bildt sets the tone.    The government has also been helped by the Social Democrats.  Broad agreements have been reached regarding the European Union  [EU] negotiations and changes in the Constitution. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Loyal KDS </H5>   Johansson was regarded as the doubtful card, especially by  the Liberal Party, when the Center Party entered the government.  But despite the ups and downs regarding the bridge and nuclear  power, Johansson has been a surprisingly positive member of the  government. Anne Wibble says in her new book that while  Johansson has certainly not been a driving force in the  government when it comes to saving money, neither has he been an  obstruction.    Concerning the negotiations on the government's  81-billion-krona reorganization program, Wibble reports that  Olof often said "think about its distribution," while Alf  Svensson was constantly interjecting: "We must find room for the  home care allowance."    The KDS ministers have been very loyal members of the  government. In Svensson's words, they have "sat still in the  boat." They have almost always stayed close to the Moderates.  The KDS' immediate entry into the government put great pressure  on the party's political and personnel resources. Its fast  promotion was also something of a culture shock as far as the  party's voters were concerned, and this can be seen in the  public opinion polls.  <H5>  Liberal Party a Concern </H5>   The man who has caused the most concern among the voters is  Bengt Westerberg. After the matter of the New Start program with  Bildt was settled, the Liberal Party leader began distancing  himself more and more from Moderate Party policy, chiefly on  welfare issues.    Westerberg has played a very constructive role in the  government, but he has also won a few rounds. His defense of  general welfare -- and of the tax burden -- has not really  caused any serious crises in government work. His Ministry of  Social Affairs has probably saved more money than all the  Moderate ministers combined. On the other hand, he does not rate  highly with Moderates in the Riksdag. Even Center Party and KDS  members think that the Liberal Party leader "jumps in everywhere  with his lecturing."    The four coalition parties would like to view the program  agreed on after the 1991 elections as a contract. They pledged  to stick together on a policy along those lines, but this did  not mean that the parties lost their right to defend their own  identities and core issues.    That is what we are going to see in the election campaign:  each of the four coalition parties going out on its own to  attract as many voters as possible with a smorgasbord of good  proposals. But not all of those proposals are going to be  consistent with that contract. If the government survives the  elections, it will soon have to face new and vexed negotiations  on nuclear power, welfare and basic security, tax reductions and  tax changes, municipal finances, our EU policy when it comes to  defense and foreign exchange, and a long list of issues that  will face us over the next four years.</p>

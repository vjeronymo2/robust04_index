			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Lopez encounters GM's action: VW executive will issue complaint defending professional reputation THE CLASH between Volkswagen and General Motors, two of the world's leading volume carmakers, threatened to develop into an open court battle after a new outbreak of hostilities at the weekend. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production and purchasing director, is to issue a complaint against General Motors, his former employer, to counter legal moves made by the US group against him. Mr Lopez's professional reputation had been so damaged that he wanted to defend himself legally, a VW spokesman said. His move followed GM's announcement on Friday that it had filed a legal complaint in Germany against Mr Lopez 'for what we believe is the taking of confidential documents'. Officials from the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt are expected to question Mr Lopez, his colleagues and representatives of the US concern to find if there are grounds for further action. The renewed eruption follows successful legal action last month by Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, in which it won an injunction preventing VW from poaching its employees. Opel had alleged that some 40 German personnel had been approached by Mr Lopez or his associates. Mr Lopez, formerly head of GM's global purchasing, with a formidable reputation for cost-cutting, was lured to VW in March by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's new head, who recently announced a DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss for the first quarter. Although VW said at the weekend that the group had 'absolutely no' GM documents, Mr David Herman, managing director of Adam Opel, said responses from Mr Lopez to a series of requests for assurances that he had not taken confidential information had not been 'satisfactory'. The news magazine Der Spiegel added to the controversy on Saturday with allegations that Mr Lopez had thousands of documents, including parts purchasing lists and details of all Opel's engine and model plans for the next 10 years. VW dismissed the claims as 'untenable and unbelievable'. According to Mr Herman, settling the issue was 'of the utmost importance for the future competitiveness of Opel and GM'.</p>

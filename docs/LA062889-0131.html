Gorbachev inside the Kremlin to deliver the document, which was signed by  250,000 American schoolchildren and is designed to further world peace.  </P> <P> When his 47-day around-the-world trip is completed, Tony will present President  Bush a friendship scroll signed by Soviet youngsters.  </P> <P> Tony, accompanied by his father, began the global flight in his blue-and-white  Cessna Centurion on June 5. His flight plan will take him 19,000 miles around  the world in short hops averaging three hours each and, if completed  successfully, would make him the youngest person to fly around the world.  </P></p>

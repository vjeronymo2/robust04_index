			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Anti-Sheehy drive launched THE BIGGEST police demonstration in history last night launched a campaign to compel the government to abandon the Sheehy committee's recommendations for changing the service's pay and conditions. More than 16,000 police officers from throughout the UK filled London's Wembley Arena and overflow halls to protest against proposals which include introducing fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay. Mr Alan Eastwood, chairman of the Police Federation which represents all ranks up to chief inspector, warned that if the government took up the Sheehy recommendations, the rally would prove 'only the very small beginning of our struggle'. Legislation to make police authorities more businesslike, and to introduce whatever recommendations of the report accepted by the government is due in the autumn. The associations representing all ranks of police officers, including chief constables, are particularly concerned that nobody on the committee had any policing experience. Mr Eastwood said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary when the Sheehy inquiry was established, had assembled a hand-picked team to 'produce a report that would confirm his prejudices'. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is considering responses to the recommendations until September.</p>

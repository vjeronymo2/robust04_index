			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- SPD [Social Democratic Party]  Chairman Rudolf Scharping has expressed his firm support for the  integration of Germany into NATO and the European Union (EU).  NATO and the EU had managed to make relations between the  member states peaceful in the long-term, Scharping said at the  conference on security policy today in Munich. The SPD leader  conceded that sections of his party had not always seen it like  this in the past.    Scharping spoke in favor of integrating all East European  countries into a European security system. But there would  possibly be varying degrees and speeds of East European  integration, he said.    It was, however, important to retain "a clear perspective,"  he stressed. In this context the transcript of Scharping's  speech included a proposal for forming joint military units with  East European states. Thus, a German-Polish or German-Czech  corps would be feasible.    The SPD was ready to relinquish national sovereignty in  favor  of European integration, Scharping added. Automatic obligations  must not, however, arise with respect to the United Nations.  Until now the German Government has reserved the right to take  part in UN measures. This would also remain a "basic conviction  of German foreign policy" in the event of an SPD-governed German  Government. In any case, events in Somalia had "not increased  acceptance of UN obligations"; rather the opposite, Scharping  added. While the SPD also pursued the goal of a permanent UN  Security Council seat for Germany, he did not attach any  "special priority" to this over other tasks.    Scharping issued a strong warning against Germany going it  alone in Europe. Those who thought aloud about Germany  withdrawing from the European Union -- even only in the sense of  a legal possibility -- signaled an attempt to abandon European  integration. Without mentioning names, Scharping was thus  alluding to remarks by Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber  (CSU) [Christian Social Union, who criticized the Maastricht  Treaty as too centralized]. At the same time Scharping stressed  that there were "no really serious differences" with the present  German Government as regards foreign and security policy.</p>

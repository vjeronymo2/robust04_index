			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- Bulgarians today saw their  pockets get still emptier as the prices of electricity, heating,  coals and liquid fuels went up. The situation is further  aggravated by the entry into effect of the new Value-Added Tax  (VAT), which also starts operating as of today.    Reports on the market situation across the country create a  picture of complete chaos. This situation was brought about by  the traders' ignorance as to the VAT in spite of the large-scale  promotion campaign, rather than by the tax itself. Most regions  are witnessing a considerable price rise. In others, like the  Turgovishte region (northeastern Bulgaria), prices are still  unchanged but the shops are closed waiting for the new prices to  be set. A report from Petrich (southwestern Bulgaria) says the  shop shelves have been emptied in spite of the fact that the  prices fetched dramatic heights compared to other regions and  one would have difficulties in providing even goods of prime  necessity.    Prices have not yet gone up in most Sofia shops. Demand  today is tending down from its peak in the past days, when  people were buying virtually everything. An opinion poll found  that Sofianites are stocking up goods: 27 percent of the  respondents said they were stocking foods, 5 percent household  appliances, and another 15 percent other commodities. About 38  percent did not stock anything only because of financial  difficulties.    According to figures of the Consumers' Federation, 70  percent  of Bulgarians are living under the social minimum. The data  also said that a month ago the monthly cost of living for an  adult was 1,468 leva; for a child of 14 to 18, 1,492 leva; and  for elderly people 1,219 leva. At the same time the average  December pay was 3,900 leva, and the minimum pay, 1,565 leva.  The entry into effect of the new VAT and the higher  electricity, heating, coal and liquid fuel prices will directly  hit consumers and push up the figures cited above, says  Consumers' Federation expert Iveta Minkova.    According to analysts, the new prices of fuels and  electricity and the high exchange rate of the dollar against the  lev will be felt in the next few months. In practice, however,  shopowners marked up prices a couple of weeks ago, not waiting  for the official markup. Household appliances and audio-visual  equipment were the first to go up, followed by a substantial  price markup for staple foods. Dairy prices reported the  steepest rise, with yellow cheese soaring nearly twofold and  white cheese more than 50 percent.    The National Statistical Institute said the retail prices of  goods monitored and controlled by the Government climbed up 5.37  percent between March 15 and 31.    Chicken rose 16.40 percent, cow's cheese 15.24 percent, veal  9.77 percent, and yoghourt 8.18 percent.    The government, parliament and President's Office have 4  million children, elderly people and unemployed to take care of  who cannot be left at the mercy of fate, says Velichka Rangelova  of the National Statistical Institute. According to her, urgent  steps have to be taken to fend off an inflationary spiral and  hyperinflation.    IMF resident representative Gregory Dahl also warned of such  a danger yesterday. According to him, the new energy source  prices, VAT and high dollar rate are three factors that will  have a one-time impact on the price level. In his view it is  very important that government incomes policy does not  immediately respond to the price rise, as it would render the  fuel and electricity markup meaningless.</p>

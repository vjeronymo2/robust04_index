			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: IT TAKES PLANNING, A KEEN EYE AND LUCK TO CAPTURE THE BIG PLAY  </P> <P> You hear the crack of a ball against Bo Jackson's bat and, if luck is on your  side, you get the picture. However, it takes a little luck, because as a  professional photographer you may just as likely be focusing on the pitcher at  that crucial moment.  </P> <P> Baseball is one of the most difficult sports to shoot because its long periods  of inactivity lull you into a false sense of security. Then, in a split second,  the third baseman makes a dive for a ball rocketing down the third-base line.  Or perhaps the center-fielder and shortstop collide in the outfield.  </P> <P> There are things you do have control over -- such as focus, exposure,  composition and timing -- but then you also have to worry about being blocked  by the batboy, the umpire, the on-deck batter or the first-base or third-base  coach.  </P> <P> The Major League Baseball All-Star game, which was played Tuesday at Anaheim  Stadium, is a good example of the trials and tribulations professional  photographers must go through on an almost daily basis. There were 748 members  of the media covering the game, 70 of whom were photographers.  </P> <P> The preparation for the game was typical of what photographers go through to  get pictures of an event in the next morning's paper.  </P> <P> The day started about 1 p.m., even though the game didn't start until 5:30 p.m.  First there was the planning meeting attended by all photographers and film  editors. Things such as messenger pickup for film, game-shooting strategy and  the type of film to be used were discussed and decided on.  </P> <P> All the pictures were shot in color, even though most would appear as black and  white in the morning newspaper. Kodak Panalure paper was used for making  black-and-white photographs from color negatives.  </P> <P> A lottery was held to determine which photographers would shoot from what  locations. The best shooting locations are the field-level spots on both sides  of the dugout. Those locations provide the best shooting angle of second base,  third base and home.  </P> <P> The photographers arrived at the stadium at 2:30 p.m. As usual, there were  plenty of photo opportunities both inside and outside the stadium. For example,  outside the stadium you could take pictures of vendors, tailgate parties and --  on this July night -- parking attendants wearing tuxedo shirts and ties. There  was even a booth making personalized baseball cards.  </P> <P> Inside the stadium, the players were warming up and taking batting practice.  There was little spontaneity because of the crush of photographers all trying  to get the same pictures.  </P> <P> The talk at game time was about how difficult it would be for the batters at  twilight. It's no different for photographers who have to deal with half the  field in sunlight and the other half in shade. You can't just pop up a strobe  and fill the picture in with fill-in flash. The action is too far away.  </P> <P> The big play of this night came early -- Bo Jackson's home run in the first  inning -- which is not normally the case. The best angle for this picture was  the first-base photo well. It showed Jackson swinging and then watching the  ball fly out of the stadium. There was a smattering of action the rest of the  game, but it was clear that Jackson's home run was the picture everyone wanted  to see.  </P> <P> After the game, Jackson came out of the dugout to receive his Most Valuable  Player trophy. It's a moment that most athletes hate but most photographers  want. In this case, Jackson stayed for about 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Baseball pictures look as if they are spontaneous, but they actually require a  lot of preparation. Photographers get only one chance to shoot a picture, so  they want to make the very best of that chance.  </P> <P> Even if it requires a little luck.  </P></p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Leading vineyard for sale ONE OF the UK's largest vineyards, responsible for a tenth of the country's wine production, has been put up for sale at a price of about Pounds 1.5m. Lamberhurst Vineyards, near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, is being sold by Mr Kenneth McAlpine, a director of the Sir Robert McAlpine construction company. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the estate agents, said that it was extremely rare for one of the dozen large UK vineyards to come on the market. The UK has about 450 vineyards, mainly in the south-east of England, of which about 200 are cultivated on a commercial basis. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley said it expected the vineyard to attract interest from drinks companies, private individuals and overseas wine producers seeking access to its distribution outlets. The sale has been advertised in New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and the US. Turnover is expected to rise from last year's Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 1.25m this year, as the amount of English wine sold through supermarkets increases. The vineyard's best selling line is a blend of white wine that is sold at just under Pounds 3 a bottle. The vineyard pioneered the production of English brandy and fruit liqueurs and recently brought into production one of the UK's few red wine varieties. It has won 42 wine awards. The Lamberhurst vineyard is on 75 acres, with 42 acres cultivated with vines. It produces 210,000 litres of wine a year. The winery has a tank capacity of 630,000 litres and bonded storage for 500,000 bottles. Half the vineyard's production capacity is taken up with grapes from other producers which do not have their own processing and bottling facilities. The vineyard was established in 1972 and came into full production in 1982.</p>

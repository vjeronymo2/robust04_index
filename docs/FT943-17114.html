			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Cazenove quits as Telegraph group's broker Mr Conrad Black's Telegraph group suffered a blow to its prestige yesterday as Cazenove, one of London's most respected stockbrokers, resigned as broker to the company. No reason has been given for the resignation, but it is understood that the move was related to last month's sale of Pounds 73m of Telegraph shares by Mr Black's private company. Last week the Telegraph slashed its cover price, causing the shares to fall by more than a third. It was also announced yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading is to make inquiries into the newspaper price war being waged between The Daily Telegraph and The Times, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch. The OFT said it expected its director-general, Sir Bryan Carsberg, would spend most of July looking at the issue before deciding whether formal action was required. Cazenove's decision was taken after detailed discussions with the Telegraph, after which both sides said they agreed that this was an 'appropriate time' to part. A senior Cazenove official said this was the first time in recent memory that Cazenove had voluntarily resigned as stockbroker to a company. The Telegraph's shares fell 15p yesterday to 364p. A Telegraph official expressed regret at Cazenove's decision. 'We are obviously sad that they felt they had to make that move in response to their own business pressures,' she said. The Telegraph is to remain with its other broker, Panmure Gordon, which was not involved in last month's share sale nor in the Telegraph's initial flotation. Cazenove became corporate adviser to the Telegraph in 1985, when Mr Black first acquired his stake, and stockbrokers on its flotation in 1992. Cazenove declined to comment on its decision. The Times first cut its price in September last year. The Telegraph annual report, signed off on March 24, said 'at the end of 1993, it was clear that brand strength and editorial quality were winning against price discounting'. The Telegraph's first-quarter report, issued a week before the share sale, referred to 'a good start to 1994'. Since announcing the price cut, Mr Black has said it could cost Pounds 40m in revenues, which would be offset in part by tax and cost savings. One leading institutional fund manager who had declined the offer of shares last month said: 'No serious analyst of the media industry could fail to see there is a newspaper price war going on.' The fund's main reason for turning down the share offer was that 'we were uneasy about buying shares in a company which is a subsidiary of the company through which Conrad Black controls his personal wealth'. The OFT's announcement was welcomed last night by Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, Mr Nigel Griffiths. He described The Daily Telegraph's role in the price war as 'reactive', and the role played by Mr Murdoch as 'predatory'. Last October the OFT held back from launching a formal investigation into The Times's first price cut, on the ground that it reflected a calculated commercial decision that could not be considered as predatory.

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: McLeod Russel in merger talks with Wheway McLEOD Russel Holdings, the paints producer and distributor, has approached Wheway, the battling Midlands clean air and design engineering group, with a view to a possible merger. Wheway's announcement yesterday of 'preliminary' merger discussions was coupled with a warning that the engineering group's pre-tax loss in the year to October would exceed last year's Pounds 720,000 deficit. Wheway's shares fell 5p to 12p, down from a high this year of 34p, knocking its market value to Pounds 9.8m. A deal may see McLeod obtain the engineering arm it wants, while bringing badly needed finance to Wheway to help it accelerate development of its main businesses. McLeod, which reported a 9 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profit on Thursday, is in the hunt for a new business to add to its paints division and textile machinery operation. It has a strong balance sheet with net cash balance reserves of Pounds 10m. Wheway has struggled to make profits in the past two years from its core businesses to cover interest charges and costs from its shift out of heavy engineering.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV CALLS FOR 'GUMPTION' IN REFORM PUSH  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a televised New Year's address  Saturday, called on the Soviet people to stop sitting on the sidelines and to  show greater "gumption" in pursuing his policy of economic reform.  </P> <P> Gorbachev acknowledged that perestroika, his program to restructure Soviet  society, had raised high hopes among the citizens that had not yet been met.  The 57-year-old Kremlin leader, who took office in March of 1985, blamed  conservative forces in part for the slow pace of reform.  </P> <P> But, using tough language, he also said that every Soviet citizen should do  more to improve the quality of consumer goods and to end the shortages that  have typified Soviet life since the 1930s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Greater Resoluteness'  </P> <P> "One cannot just outwit life and sit back on the sidelines," Gorbachev said.  "It is essential to act with greater resoluteness."  </P> <P> He said his attempt to revamp Soviet society "lends wings to real champions . .  . and gives them added energies and gumption. And this is just what we need now  most of all."  </P> <P> His remarks seem to respond to critics who complained bitterly to him during a  trip to Siberia in September of long -- and often unsuccessful -- waits to  obtain basic consumer goods.  </P> <P> Those dramatic encounters were carried on Soviet television, and Western  analysts said the complaints helped to push Gorbachev to make major  governmental changes in October, putting reform-minded supporters in positions  of power.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's year-end speech was broadcast across the country on Soviet  television just minutes before midnight and was probably widely seen. New  Year's Eve in the Soviet Union is a family holiday that traditionally includes  the exchange of gifts and the viewing of special television programs until  early morning hours.  </P> <P> "I do not want, and have no right, to paint a rosy overall picture," the  Communist Party leader said in the broadcast. "Perestroika gave rise to great  expectations to society, but changes are not coming as fast as we would all  like them to . . . . Demand still outstrips supply, especially when it comes to  quality goods.  </P> <P> "This," he added, "is explained in a large measure not only by the inertia of  the past but also by the novelty of problems and the real difficulties of  organizing life in a new way."  </P> <P> Letters to officials have revealed Soviet concerns about how perestroika would  affect individuals in the society where everyone is guaranteed a job and the  state subsidizes everything from bread to apartments.  </P> <P> In his address, Gorbachev warned that perestroika would mean greater individual  responsibility. He said the changes would include more reliance on "the  pay-your-own-way system . . . and a broadened scope for initiatives and social  enterprise."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Have to Get in the Mood'  </P> <P> "We all have to get into the mood for such work," he added.  </P> <P> On the topic of international relations, Gorbachev claimed that the Soviet  Union, acting "in the spirit of the new political thinking," was largely  responsible for the thaw in the Cold War between East and West. The Soviets  have learned to listen to the positions of other countries while still "abiding  by our own principles," he said.  </P> <P> "Of course, the shadows of the past are present in world politics," the Soviet  leader added. "But they are fading already. A new vision of the world is being  established."  </P> <P> On other subjects, Gorbachev referred briefly to the nationalist unrest that  has torn parts of the Soviet Union. At least 31 people were killed in November  in ethnic violence in the southwestern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> "We are proceeding to another important phase of political reform, which will  aim to harmonize inter-ethnic relations," he said.  </P> <P> He also spoke of the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia, which the Soviet Union has  said claimed tens of thousands of lives.  </P> <P> "The end of the year was darkened by anguish," he said. "Our misfortune has  evoked warmth, sympathy and response around the world."  </P></p>

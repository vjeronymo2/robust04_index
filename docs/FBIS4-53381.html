			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 (YONHAP) -- Russian Ambassador to  South Korea Georgiy Kunadze said Wednesday that North Korea, as  a member of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), should  fulfill all of its obligations under the treaty.    He told a symposium in Tokyo titled "Peace and Stability in  East Asia" that, even though North Korea has been insisting that  it be given a special position ever since it announced its  intention to withdraw from the NPT, there are no other positions  in the international convention than that of either a member or  a non-member. His remarks were seen as tantamount to urging  Pyongyang to accept full-fledged inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    "As a main member of the NPT, Russia will make the maximum  effort in trying to see to it that nuclear weapons do not appear  in Northeast Asia," he said. But Kunadze struck a cautious note  on the issue of sanctions against North Korea, saying that  isolating the communist state might produce unwanted results.    Meanwhile, former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama  pointed out that international countermeasures against North  Korea, assuming that it persists in rejecting nuclear  inspections, depend on the stances of Russia and China. Japan's  diplomatic ability, he added, will be tested as a result because  Tokyo may have to control remittances from pro-Pyongyang Koreans  in Japan to North Korea.    Professor Izmi Hazime addressed factors which could trigger  a  crisis should the nuclear standoff continue to drag on. He said  the major factors are whether North Korea could endure extreme  economic difficulties and whether the United States could  tolerate the situation. He captured attention by saying that  the world needs to prepare to use military power under the  worst-case scenario.    An Pyong-chun, a professor at South Korea's Yonsei  University, said that in order to settle the nuclear problem  North Korea should remain in the NPT, accept special inspections  and agree to mutual checks with South Korea.    "Although not desirable," he added, "we can think of  economic  sanctions by the U.N. Security Council on North Korea. If the  sanctions are imposed, Japan's exertion of its economic  influence including suspension of remittances to North Korea is  essential."</p>

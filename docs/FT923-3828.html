			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Technology: Life's little ups and downs - Escalators may have a humdrum role but building the longest in western Europe has proved to be no easy task The diary of Richard Burbage, manager of Harrods in 1898, recalls that shoppers overcome by the experience of travelling on Britain's first escalator were revived with brandy or sal volatile dispensed by an attendant positioned at the top. Burbage, according to the Shell Book of Firsts, had 'an unreasoning dislike of lifts,' and persuaded the Knightsbridge store to instal the 40ft-long Reno Inclined Elevator, patented by Jesse W. Reno of New York just six years earlier. Nearly a century later, would-be passengers on the longest escalators in western Europe, at the new Angel station on the London Underground, might feel they deserve similar resuscitation after the problems of the past month. Dogged by difficulties, the three 60m-long escalators are still not functioning properly, delaying the opening of the long-awaited Pounds 70m new station for Islington's commuters. But an end to their long wait is in sight. The delay has been irritating for passengers, who have been shuttled around by bus while the new station stays closed, and embarrassing for both the London Underground and Construction Industrielle de la Mediterrannee (better known by its logo CNIM), the big Marseilles-based company which designed and built the escalator. But the saga has also been embarrassing for the escalator industry, which is not used to having the reliability of its products questioned. Escalators, after all, are relatively simple people movers which are built to last, and normally do. Some of the London Underground's escalators are now being replaced after as much as 60 years of sterling service. 'These escalators are very heavy duty. They take a hell of a beating,' says one producer. Switched on in the morning, and off late at night - or occasionally left on permanently - escalators simply keep on going, requiring routine maintenance but rarely any fundamental rebuilding during their working lives. The basic technology is tried and tested. The first step-type escalator with a comb-plate landing device was introduced commercially in 1921 by Otis, the US lift and escalator producer which is now part of United Technologies, and the basic combination of an electric motor driving a chain held by two sprockets has not changed since then. There have, naturally, been developments in escalator safety circuits, such as systems to stop the motor if a passenger's hand goes too far down the handrail at either end, and in the use of materials. Again safety has been the prime consideration, with wooden escalators now seen as a fire risk following the King's Cross disaster in 1987. There have been innovations such as energy-saving stop-start mechanisms  - approach an apparently resting escalator on the Munich subway and it will start rolling just before you step on it - and gimmicks such as helical escalators, which are both technically daunting and commercially dependent on booming markets for swanky offices and department stores. In general, though, escalators, because of their humdrum, continuous task, have missed out on the major developments in lift technology introduced by the same big producers over the past 20 years - variable speed drives, talking lifts, lifts with memories and remote monitoring techniques. This is what makes the Angel saga so frustrating for commuters. Things happen in lifts, because the relationship between the passenger and machine is much more complex, but escalators are simply not expected to break down. Angel Station first started having capacity problems in the mid-1980s, when Islington became an increasingly popular place to live, and passenger volume rose about six-fold when volumes elsewhere were shrinking. At that time the station had no escalators, only three lifts, each with capacity for about 30 people, and which were slow and unreliable. The station serves 8m people a year (about 20,000 a day) so the lifts were clearly inadequate. Reconstruction of the station started in 1989, and preliminary work on construction of the escalators started more than a year ago. Everything went according to plan until the last few days before the escalators were due to come into service, on Sunday August 9. Safety regulations require a commissioning test, when the escalators must run for 24 hours continuously with no problems. This was carried out on Friday 7 and Saturday 8 August, when the first problems emerged with the power supply. The supply in the area was not sufficient to serve the whole station and the escalators at the same time. While adjustments were carried out, the opening was delayed until Wednesday August 12. The station was then open for a day and a half, after which further problems emerged with the control electronics, partly related to the earlier power supply problems, causing the escalators to cut out when fully loaded. A faulty chain brake switch was erroneously signalling that the chain was sagging as soon as passengers got on the escalator, thus bringing it to a stop. The glitch was corrected, and a final extensive test carried out on August 18, when some 400 LU employees travelled up and down the escalator to ensure it was running smoothly. This was crucial for safety reasons, as the sudden stopping of a fully-laden escalator - about 180 steps with two people on each one - could be potentially disastrous by causing a human avalanche. The escalator passed that test, but in the process engineers discovered gaps between the steps and the skirtings of as much as 9mm in total on both sides, large enough for a child's finger to become caught, or for small objects to slip down into the machinery. The opening was delayed once again. London Underground and CNIM will not go into detail about the causes of the problem, but industry observers suggest some possibilities. First, the Underground traditionally specifies a fabricated step, which is welded together from pieces of steel and then has an aluminium alloy tread bolted on top. It says this lasts much longer than the one-piece die-cast step used on other metro systems. There is some debate about how much more durable the fabricated step is, but at about 45kg it is three times heavier than a die-cast step and much harder to manufacture to very tight tolerances because of the welding and subsequent cooling which distort the steel. Die-cast steps, in contrast, can be milled to very high levels of precision, says one escalator producer. And LU requires the gap between the steps and the skirting to be no more than 5mm in total over both sides - tougher than the 7mm British Standard recommendation. With wear and tear, the gap will widen, so the tighter specification gives LU some leeway. The features of a fabricated step become particularly important on a long escalator, which is like a bicycle chain on two sprockets. The weight of so many fabricated steps may have contributed to the earlier power problems, and the longer the chain, the more opportunity there is for lateral movement. That could have increased the gaps between the treads and the skirtings. Historically, escalators have simply been 'side-guided' - the skirting keeps the train in line on the track - but a number of guidance systems are now used, such as a lipped edge to the track, or a ridge into which the chain interlocks. CNIM says that the guidance system it is using at the Angel is the same as it uses on all its escalators, long or short. The French company has been given three weeks to sort out the gaps, and the deadline elapses next Thursday. But yesterday London Underground said it was hopeful of being able to run a further 24-hour test to ensure that the problem has been resolved, and open the escalators to the public, before then. The gap is now down to about 6mm, spread over both sides, and the target is 4mm. Islington's long-suffering commuters will then have their new station, but that might not be the end of the affair. LU will reportedly claim hundreds of thousands of pounds compensation from CNIM, but says officially that seeking compensation will depend on the final length of the delay. Its managers, meanwhile, might be forgiven for resorting to the Burbage remedy for escalator angst.</p>

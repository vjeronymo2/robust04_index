			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Break with tradition in a quest for former glory: Trafalgar House faces a difficult future The assets of Trafalgar House, the UK conglomerate, read like a roll-call of famous names from the past: Cunard, John Brown, Davy, Scott Lithgow, the Ritz. A year ago, Trafalgar's standing on the UK stock market displayed the same faded grandeur. Though its shares had underperformed the market for years, it was still valued at almost Pounds 2bn and had just raised more than Pounds 300m from its shareholders. Since then the shares have tumbled, the dividend has been halved and the company is worth just Pounds 390m. Subtract from that the cash raised last year, and the market is saying that all those famous names, plus Pounds 800m-worth of housebuilding land and commercial property, are worth Pounds 78m. As one City analyst privately remarks, this kind of valuation suggests the market is no longer worried about minor matters such as cuts in the dividend. It is starting to ask whether Trafalgar might go under. The simple answer to that is no. Whether Trafalgar can ever regain its former glories is another matter. Since its foundation in 1956, Trafalgar has been not so much a normal conglomerate as a loose collection of household names. At one time these included the Daily and Sunday Express, which were hived off in 1982. They still include housebuilder Ideal Homes and contractor Trollope &amp; Colls. How did such an apparently solid business get into such a mess? The simple answer is one which has become sadly familiar across the UK corporate landscape: cashflow. Insofar as Trafalgar ever had a traditional business, it was property and housebuilding. In the 1980s, these were dangerously deceptive markets to be in. Year by year, as property prices rose, housebuilders, property dealers, brewers and retailers found they could generate cash by the simple expedient of buying and selling their property assets. When the asset inflation stopped, at the tail end of the decade, they had no means of servicing their borrowings: unless - like the brewers and some of the retailers - they could still generate cash from their normal operations. In Trafalgar's case, it is not clear how cash-generative its other operations ever were. Whatever the history, the pressures have lately become acute. In particular, last year's acquisition of the engineering contractor, Davy, has caused a cash outflow this year of more than Pounds 100m. Davy, one of the world's most distinguished engineers, had been brought to its knees by a single disastrous contract on a North Sea oil rig. Trafalgar paid just Pounds 60m for it, then wrote its net worth down to minus Pounds 131m. But that was a mere book-keeping exercise. Trafalgar then discovered the reality: that Davy was seriously behind in paying its bills. It had to inject more than Pounds 100m of working capital. 'I have to say,' says Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's deputy chairman and chief executive, 'that in my experience since the mid-1960s of taking over UK quoted companies, you generally find things slightly worse than you anticipated. In Davy's case, the unexpected bit was the cashflow.' Otherwise, he claims, Trafalgar's underlying cashflow is not too bad. 'Our construction and engineering side is very cash positive. There's very little capital expenditure - mostly computer-related stuff for the engineering side. There are whole sections of that business which work on negative working capital. That will throw up very positive cashflow in 1993-94. The hiatus in 1992 is entirely to do with Davy. 'In housing, we have a land bank which is too big for our present business, so we don't need to buy any land. On each sale we recover some of the underlying book value of the land, even if the business is not making any profit. And in commercial property, we have almost no developments going on at present. That means the only cash outflow is interest charges on the debt. 'In hotels, the cashflow is negligible. But the cruise ship business is positive - the only cash outflow is the improvements you have to make to the ships. Across the group,the pressure on cashflow has emanated from having two legs of the business - leisure and property - not generating the cash they should have done: that, plus Davy.' Trafalgar is certainly in a tight spot, but its finances look safe enough. Its agreements with its bankers are: Net worth should be at least Pounds 500m. Last year's figure was Pounds 716m. This year it will be lower, but not much (though it is worth noting that the figure has been falling since 1989). Net borrowings should be no more than 1.75 times net worth. The borrowing figure at this year-end, including some Pounds 50m of off-balance sheet debt covered by the agreement, will be only around Pounds 500m. The average interest charge should be covered at least twice by profits before provisions. Last year it was covered more than three times. Besides that, Trafalgar has lines of credit with its bankers - committed facilities, in the jargon - totalling Pounds 800m and good for another five years. But its future remains problematic. The kind of conglomerate Trafalgar represents is these days deeply unfashionable. The new fashion is to strip companies back to their original business and concentrate on what they know best. The snag in Trafalgar's case is that UK commercial property and housebuilding are so moribund that no business would concentrate on them if it could possibly help it. Trafalgar's strategy is rather the opposite: to concentrate on the businesses it bought most recently and knows least about. These are the engineering contractors John Brown and Davy, acquired in 1986 and 1991 respectively. Cunard and the Ritz will probably be sold off as soon as their markets recover, or possibly demerged. By the late 1990s, property and housebuilding may have gone too. Looking 10 years ahead, says Sir Eric, the only essential part of the company's strategy is to be like the giant US contractor, Bechtel. The trouble about that industry is the risk involved in huge contracts. Both John Brown and Davy ultimately owed their loss of independence to such contracts going wrong. Trafalgar, says Sir Eric, is the best in the business when it comes to risk control. But, as he concedes, the big risky turnkey contracts are where good profit margins are to be found. Nevertheless, he insists, 'our engineering and construction business is in the books for virtually nothing. This year it will produce operating profits of Pounds 100m or so. If you look at the fancy earnings multiples in process engineering elsewhere in the world, that could theoretically be worth another Pounds 1bn on our shareholders' funds.' In theory, Trafalgar's shareholders should be profoundly glad to hear it. The reality is slightly different. Their once-proud company still has a value. But however far they look into the future, it becomes no easier to establish what that value really is.</p>

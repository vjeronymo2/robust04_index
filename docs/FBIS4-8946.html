			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Momcilo Perisic, chief of the </F> General Staff of the Yugoslav Army, by Miroslav Lazanski; place  and date not given: "We Are Ready for Any Surprise"]    [Text] [Lazanski] Mr. General, to what extent does the  shelling of the Serbian territory near Gorazde influence the  security and defense of the FRY?    [Perisic] The shelling of the Serbian territory near Gorazde  by NATO is certainly complicating the military-political  situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Besides, such an action  by the NATO air-force can undoubtedly result in immense  consequences for peace in the Balkans and in Europe. In the  case of further air-strikes on Serbian territory, the danger of  the war escalating to an uncontrollable level will increase.  Which is to say, this act encourages the supporters of the war  option, which makes all those who have peace at their heart very  worried. I want to emphasize particularly that it is an act of  aggression against the Serbian people, which has a legitimate  and natural right to self-defense, guaranteed by the UN Charter.    The Yugoslav Army is following the development of the  situation that has come about after the NATO bombardment  continuously and with the greatest attention. Consequently, we  are undertaking all necessary measures to protect the  territorial integrity of our country. In the case of a possible  major violation of the FRY's air-space, the army will implement  the course of action anticipated in the case of its combat  deployment.    [Lazanski] What phase of the transformation is the Yugoslav  Army going through at the moment?    [Perisic] The process of the army's transformation is based  on the transfer of the authority in the matters of defense to  the state, on a new military doctrine, and changes in the  normative-legal regulations. The command posts and units have  been more rationally organized, and many staff changes have been  made. Effectiveness in command and security in the rear echelons  have been increased. The army is now in the final phase of the  process of depolitization and professionalization. In that  context, the curriculums in the system of education and training  in the Yugoslav Army have also been changed. Now, the staff is  employed according to the new formation-organizational patterns.  The replacement of the old insignia with the new ones is  underway. All in all, during the past two years, the changes  starting from the concept of defense to the visual symbols of  the Yugoslav Army have already been made.    In the oncoming period, the units within the corps will be  reorganized in accordance with the new demands that have been  imposed on the Yugoslav Army regarding the country's defense.  Consequently, we shall modernize the command posts and units by  providing them with new sorts of armament. We believe that the  transformation of the army, generally seen, is going on in  compliance with the economic potentials of the FRY and the  planned spirit.    [Lazanski] Are you satisfied with the army budget that was  adopted recently?    [Perisic] The resources apportioned from the federal budget  for the financing of the Yugoslav Army in 1994 amount to 43  percent of the estimated GNP. The means that have been  approved, provided that the Yugoslav Army gets the real value,  will enable us to meet some 57 percent of the estimated needs in  1994. While estimating the total of the funds foreseen for the  federal budget, starting from the adopted economic policy for  1994, the Program of Reconstruction of the Monetary System, and  other measures of the recuperation of the country, the Federal  Government could not provide the proposed level of funds, so it  had to cut it by half. Regarding the difficult economic  situation in the country, and the measures that are undertaken  for its recuperation, we have accepted the aforementioned  percentage as a necessity in the current circumstances.  Therefore, we have been forced to make great cuts in the  development, and to postpone some aspects of the transformation  program until later.    In general, however, we are not satisfied with the inflow of  resources in the federal budget cash-box. In the first three  months of this year, the army was allotted 51 percent of the  planned amount for that period. At the moment, we owe some 50  million dinars to the army suppliers. Therefore we have great  problems getting regular food supplies, with the maintenance of  equipment, and the disbursement of salaries. Many firms, the  army's traditional partners, have been in an extremely difficult  financial situation because of our debts.    In such difficult circumstances, in the command posts,  units, and army institutions, certain planned measures have been  undertaken, aimed at the rationalization of the utilization, and  the maximal economizing of the material-technical and financial  means.    Compared with other countries in the world, we spend  considerably less money per soldier. For instance, in other  countries the costs per soldier in U.S. dollars are as follows:  Italy -- $47,881; Belgium -- $38,555; Austria -- $31,923;  Greece -- $27,683; Hungary -- $14,358; Bulgaria -- $11,028,  Turkey -- $8,923; and the FRY -- $5,500. We are doing  everything we can to prevent such a difficult economic situation  from considerably affecting the country's security.  <H5>  New Concept of Defense </H5>   [Lazanski] What will be the priorities of such a military  budget?    [Perisic] Differing from earlier years, when the army budget  was allotted as a single amount, this year, following the  proposal by the Assembly deputies, the budget for the Yugoslav  Army in 1994 has been apportioned according to the particular  purposes, that is, planned commitments. Thereby the priorities  have already been established. Keeping this in mind, and also  the fact that the funds are insufficient, I would point out only  some of the priorities: Covering the expenses that considerably  influence army readiness, the payment of running expenses for  food, clothes, energy, and the renewal of material reserves.    Despite the existence of objective difficulties in society  and the lack of necessary financial means, we are endeavoring to  keep up the necessary technological-technical level of providing  the army with armament and military equipment. In addition,  particular attention is paid to the Air Force and Anti-Aircraft  Defense [RVPVO], and other systems.    [Lazanski] What is the doctrinal approach to the defense of  the country like now?    [Perisic] The basic goal of the FRY is to secure the  existential survival of the Serbian and Montenegrin people, as  well as of all other citizens, and the entire civilizational  development of society. From this basic goal all other goals,  like national, political, economic, defense, and similar goals,  are derived. The basic political and doctrinal determinations  are: First, the protection and defense of the sovereignty,  independence, and territorial integrity of the FRY from all  forms of outside aggression; Second, the betterment of the  defense ability of the society, and the protection of peace on  the state borders; Third, planned and organizational  preparations aimed at the effective functioning of the defense  system in all conditions; Fourth, the defense of the country is  a vital function of the state and society, that is to say, a  duty and right of all citizens and institutions that are  organized as a unique and effective system; Fifth, the repulsion  of any form of armed aggression against the country; Sixth, the  FRY does not identify any country as its enemy in advance, but  rather intercedes for the establishment and maintenance of peace  and security in the neighboring countries, Europe, and world in  order to make possible equal cooperation among different  countries; Seventh, in the case of armed aggression against the  FRY, the Yugoslav Army and society in general would withstand it  by using any means, until the final defeat of the aggressor is  accomplished.    The new concept is characterized by the nationalization,  rather than the socialization of the defense system. While  making a choice between certain forms of military organization,  we chose a smaller, highly professional, mobile army in  peacetime that is capable of preventing any kind of surprise,  and of creating conditions for the development of a mass army  trained and determined to wage a war in any conditions, until  the final victory.    [Lazanski] In which way does the Yugoslav Army intend to  school young people now, and thereby to obtain reserve officers?    [Perisic] Since September 1991, the schools for the  education of reserve officers have been closed down. However,  the role of the reserve army staff is derived from the military  doctrine and the concept of defense of the FRY, so that we shall  soon begin with the fulfillment of those demands of defense.  With the Bill on Military Schools and Army's  Scientific-Research Institutions, a new system of educating the  cadre is founded. The future reserve army staff will be  composed of the people educated in the schools for reserve  officers, of conscripts that have already served in the army,  but whose skills are of particular interest to the Yugoslav Army  -- perhaps some additional schooling or specialization will be  necessary afterwards -- then also of the people who are employed  in the army under two-year contracts and who have acquired  certain skills of particular interest to the Yugoslav Army and  also of the active army personnel that will be transferred to  the reserve, regarding their own desires or the army's needs.  The schools for reserve officers will admit mostly candidates  who already have a university degree.  <H5>  Military Alliances </H5>   [Lazanski] Is the military top brass aware of the military  alliances that are being formed around our country, and that  they may be dangerous for the FRY?    [Perisic] With respect to the former SFRY [Socialist Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia], which was a non-aligned country, the  military and political position of the FRY has been changed.  Our incipient stance is that the defense of our country may be  organized and carried out according to the following  possibilities: A defense without allies, a defense with  potential allies, a defense relying upon subsequent allies, and  a defense with clearly defined allies. In that sense, the choice  of allies and models of defense is taken by the government.    In the circumstances of a blockade, the possibility of  joining military alliances is excluded. We are not interested  in entering aggressive military alliances. In peacetime we do  not consider joining military alliances, because, in our  opinion, there are no particular reasons for that. The FRY  would enter a military alliance with those countries that are  not aggressors, that have been attacked, or whose vital  interests are endangered. We base any prospects for a military  alliance on the congruence of strategic and political interests.  Rather than believing that a military alliance provides a  greater degree of security, or of defense potential, we feel  that one's own independence and sovereignty may be endangered  through such alliances. The Yugoslav Army attentively follows  the developments in Europe and in the world, and particularly  those in our direct neighborhood, in order to be able to  undertake necessary measures in the organization of the defense  system and the prevention of possible surprises.    [Lazanski] To what extent is the Partnership for Peace  program attractive to the Yugoslav Army, and to what extent is  it a serious military challenge and threat?    [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army must understand, rather than  form state policy. It is designed by the FRY's leadership.  Consequently, the answer to this question must be given by the  state leadership.  <H5>  Current Military Programs </H5>   [Lazanski] When does the Yugoslav Army intend to purchase a  serious amount of the most up-to-date air-force weapons, as well  as surface-to-surface missile systems? Does that depend  exclusively on the sanctions and the country's finances?    [Perisic] Regardless of a certain technical-technological  inferiority in relation to the most high-tech armies, the  Yugoslav Army is even now capable of fighting for, and defending  the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the  FRY, which also includes inflicting intolerable losses upon any  aggressor. The Air-Force and Anti-Aircraft Defense of the  Yugoslav Army has at its disposal such weapons that make  possible the elementary protection of the civilians, vital  buildings, and the territory. In the case of a more serious  violation of Yugoslav air space, the Air-Force and Anti-Aircraft  Defense is ready to react in an appropriate way.    Because of the war in our neighborhood, and many threats,  the  Yugoslav Army is certainly in need of the most modern weapons  for aviation and of missile systems. However, their purchase is  limited by the economic circumstances in the country.    [Lazanski] By what percentage can the current military  industry can be correlated with the military industry of the  former SFRY?    [Perisic] The capacities of the military industry that have  remained in the republics that seceded, and the majority of such  industrial capacities are located in those republics, are lost  to the Yugoslav Army. Those are very important capacities, some  of which, like the overhauling works in Travnik, were among the  most modern. A part of the military industries that has  remained in the FRY has been designed and constructed to meet a  considerably greater demand than there is currently. Those  capacities will be adjusted to objective production  possibilities, and will be partly converted into the production  for civil needs of the society. Only economically acceptable  programs will be financed.    In our institutes we have considerable scientific and  laboratory capacities for researches and development. We have  the technical documentation on all the weapons that were  manufactured in the former SFRY. We have managed to reorganize  the production quickly, so that today we manufacture all kinds  of rifles, aircraft and anti-aircraft guns and ammunition,  anti-aircraft and mortar ammunition, guided and nonguided  anti-tank rockets, aircraft bombs, the means of personal  nuclear-chemical-biological protection, light piston aircraft,  certain electronic signalling devices, reconnaissance radar,  radar detectors, and so forth. The domestic industrial plants  also manufacture various ignition devices that are a great  priority, gunpowder, rocket fuel, some types and calibers of  artillery ammunition, explosives, mines, and hand grenades.  There are fields in which we are among the very top  manufacturers in the world, in view of our achievements and  quality: For instance, the increase in range of artillery  shells by some 30 percent (using gunpowder of better quality,  better subcaliber ammunition and cumulative projectiles), new  systems of fire regulation installed in anti-tank and  anti-aircraft guns, the modernized T-55 tank, the production of  pyro-cartridges [as published] for pilot seats, the modernized  G-4M plane, the new pilotless plane, and so forth. Besides, the  overhauling of a considerable part of the machinery and military  equipment has been carried out. This is to say, thanks to the  dedicated engagement of scientists and many smaller and larger  firms, we are managing to eliminate some consequences of the  existing inferiority in the field of armament and military  equipment manufacture.    [Lazanski] Are the projects of manufacturing the M-84 tank,  dubbed Vihor, the Vidra fighting infantry vehicle, and the G-4  plane still of current interest? Is there any clear deadline by  which those projects may be continued?    [Perisic] Those production lines are still of current  interest. There are expert cadres entrusted with the  realization of those projects, and also a major part of such  manufacturing capacities is still functioning. The introduction  of those projects in the process of realization directly depends  on the economic situation in society, and on available financial  means. The dynamics will be continuously harmonized with the  realistic potential of the Yugoslav Army for the purchase of  those weapons. When the sanctions are lifted, those projects  will be orientated toward exports, which will certainly speed up  the process of their realization.  <H5>  The State Decides on Priests in the Yugoslav Army </H5>   [Lazanski] Which of the most sophisticated weapons that are  not manufactured in Yugoslavia will the Yugoslav Army go for?  Will they be Western, Russian, or perhaps Chinese weapons?    [Perisic] We have gone for the production of arms and  military equipment in our factories. We shall be purchasing the  most modern fighting systems abroad, but those will be of  various origins. In that way we shall avoid dependency on  particular dealers regarding spare parts, maintenance, training,  and so forth.    In view of the fact that the procurement of arms and  military  equipment from abroad has been very difficult for us because of  the sanctions, for the time being we are not considering that  possibility very much. When the time comes for us to be able to  purchase certain fighting systems, contemporary arms, and  equipment on the world market, we shall endeavor to purchase  those categories that are compatible with the FRY's defense  system. In addition, we shall pay particular attention to the  quality, price, and maintenance conditions of those arms, rather  than to the countries those arms come from.    [Lazanski] How do you, Mr. General, view the war in former  Yugoslavia, since you took part in the 1991-1992 operations?  Could the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] have settled  certain things in a more elegant way, or perhaps prevented them?    [Perisic] The war in the former SFRY was triggered, in the  first place, by the secession of the Republic of Slovenia, then  by the secession of Croatia, and finally, of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  in which the ongoing war has characteristics of an ethnic,  religious, and civil war. In that context, the former JNA was  not a key factor in the disintegration of the SFRY. A different  question is whether the JNA, given a deep economic crisis and  political instability at the time, could have prevented the  secession by force. I personally think that it could not, but,  anyway, the assessment of that question should be given by  expert institutions, viewing it from a certain distance of time.    [Lazanski] Will army service in the Yugoslav Army involve  also the ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, and the Muslims from  Sandzak in the future?    [Perisic] According to Article 63 of the Constitution,  Article 279 of the Law on Army, and Article 21 of the Law on  Defense, army service is stipulated for all the citizens of the  FRY, regardless of national or religious affiliation.  Therefore, that also applies to the ethnic Albanians from  Kosovo and Metohija, as well as to the Muslims from Sandzak.    There are certain difficulties regarding the call-up of  conscripts and the mobilization of reservists for army  maneuvers, due to the war in our neighborhood, the activities of  separatist groups, propaganda, various manipulations, and the  dodging of the fulfillment of duties toward the country. We are  doing everything to prevent those occurrences from considerably  diminishing the readiness of command posts and units to carry  out their tasks.    [Lazanski] Are you considering the engagement of army  priests in the Yugoslav Army?    [Perisic] The regulations on the service in the Yugoslav  Army, in compliance with the Constitution, say that persons  serving in the Yugoslav Army are allowed to visit religious  centers, to worship, and wear amulets and relics, as well as to  use religious books, but the dissemination of religion is  forbidden. In addition, it has been made possible for believers  whose faith forbids carrying arms to serve in the army under  special conditions. Therefore, a particular need for the  employment of priests in the army does not exist. However, the  decision on whether the Yugoslav Army should have priests or not  should be made by the authorized state institutions.    [Lazanski] If and when the embassies of the FRY are  inaugurated in the former Yugoslav republics, will you send  Yugoslav military attaches there, or will that be carried out  from Belgrade, because the distances are not so great?    [Perisic] The decision on possible military attaches within  the diplomatic-consular missions of the FRY in the former  Yugoslav republics should be made by the authorized state  institutions. When an overall political solution for former  Yugoslavia is adopted, when the mutual diplomatic relations  through embassies are established, and the questions of the  partition balance and boundaries are settled, then the question  of military attaches will be settled as well.</p>

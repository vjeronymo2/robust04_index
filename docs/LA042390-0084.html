			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MASTER CHORALE CLOSES ITS SEASON AT PAVILION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Master Chorale closed its 1989-90 season Saturday night in the  Dorothy Chandler Pavilion by demonstrating in nearly equal measure its greatest  virtue (elegant massed choral singing in major works) and most regrettable  weaknesses (giving over big program segments of important music to overparted  vocal soloists; fiddling with insubstantial new repertory of doubtful value).  </P> <P> The equivocal impression left by the group's recent work now becomes its  temporary legacy; its loyal constituency deserves better.  </P> <P> For this valedictory, director John Currie surrounded the world premiere of  Gordon Getty's "Annabel Lee" with Bernstein's "Chichester Psalms," Schubert's  Mass in E-flat and three great Mozart concert arias for soprano.  </P> <P> On any occasion, Chorale and Currie could vanquish skepticism by doing  everything on the level of the Bernstein and Schubert they gave here.  </P> <P> From the longest, softest legato lines to the crispest staccato syncopations,  this was a colorfully sung, scrupulously musical, firmly led "Psalms" that  obeyed its own Hebrew enjoinder: "Make a joyful noise!" Boy soprano Jason  Domantay acquitted himself pitch-perfectly. In the Mass, sopranos and tenors  sustained the Schubertian tessitura with admirable ease and security, and tenor  Agostino Castagnola was standout quartet soloist.  </P> <P> Getty's attractively orchestrated setting of Poe, for male voices only, follows  speech rhythm relentlessly. The sweet, accessible melodic line doesn't stretch  single syllables over many notes, or soar with emotion or color. A whopping,  self-indulgent exercise in overkill might have gotten nearer the hyper-Romantic  tone of the poetry than this tepid solecism.  </P> <P> Soprano Patrice Michaels Bedi ventured Mozart's "Vado, ma dove?" (K. 583),  "Bella mia fiamma, addio!" (K. 528), and "Ah se in ciel" (K. 538) in a mere  peep of a voice. Poise, musicianship and impressive fioritura didn't produce  drama or pathos. She could not sustain her highest pitches and everything in  her lower octave was covered by the orchestra. And reading the score enhanced  neither spontaneity of utterance nor communication with her hearers. BRUCE  BURROUGHS  </P></p>

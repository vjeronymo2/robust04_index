Provincial trade union federation President Gao Yingin, on  behalf of the federation, first extended his holiday greetings  to all present, then gave his regards to the broad masses of  workers and staff members on various fronts and to their family  members. He said: [words indistinct] In the face of  difficulties and problems arising in reform, what we need is  understanding, support, and active participation so as to enable  state-owned enterprises and workers to row in the same boat.  Only this is the desired attitude of the working class, and the  best way to turn the corner. The party and government have done  precisely this for many years, which has enabled us to deepen  the reform step by step. [passage omitted]    After listening to the speeches by some participants, the  provincial party secretary spoke.

Brande said he will  not return as Corona del Mar's coach.  </P> <P> Thomas confirmed Sunday that the hearing has been postponed and has not yet  been rescheduled.  </P> <P> Brande was suspended in August in the wake of an investigation into his  coaching of club players with high school eligibility remaining.

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas dips to Dollars 15m loss in third quarter MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially-stretched US aerospace group, yesterday announced a third-quarter loss of Dollars 15m after taking a Dollars 167m after-tax charge to strengthen the wings of its controversial C-17 military transport, which were damaged during stress tests at the start of this month. The company announced a drop in both revenues and profits at its commercial aircraft division and an increase in the debt burden of the aerospace side of the business. The loss for the period would have been even larger without a Dollars 37m gain from the sale of TeleCheck Services, a cheque acceptance service. The Dollars 15m loss worked through at 39 cents a share, and compared to profits of Dollars 77m, or Dollars 2.02 a share, in the same period of last year. Revenues dropped from Dollars 4.45bn to Dollars 3.96bn. The C-17, which McDonnell Douglas is developing for the US military, has been dogged by delays and cost over-runs. The company said the quarter's charge reflected the estimated cost of strengthening the wing, and the growth of other costs in test, assembly and procurement. The charge also provided increased reserves for estimated work remaining on the programme. Excluding the C-17, operating earnings in the company's military aerospace business totalled Dollars 122m, up from Dollars 99m, thanks to increased earnings from the F/A-18 Hornet, the AH-64 Apache and AV-8B Harrier programmes. The missiles and space business had Dollars 78m in operating earnings for the quarter, compared to Dollars 18m a year ago. However, the commercial aircraft side saw earnings dip from Dollars 92m to Dollars 52m, which the company said was due mainly to higher research and development spending. It delivered 20 MD-80 twin jets during the quarter, compared to 40 a year ago, and eight MD-11 trijets, up from six.</p>

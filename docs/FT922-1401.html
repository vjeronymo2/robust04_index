			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The Pounds 500m positive swing in the balance of payments between April and May is less encouraging than it appears. Take out the oil and erratic items and the visible trade balance is in much the same rut as it has been for most of the past year. Besides, it is difficult to know what constitutes good news on trade. In volume terms, imports were up only 4 per cent in the three months to May compared with 6 per cent in the three months to April, but the drop owes much to a slowdown in imports of basic materials, semi-manufactures and capital goods. If that suggests manufacturers are lowering their sights on the recovery, it is in contrast with a continuing quarterly volume rise in imports of passenger cars and consumer goods. The explanation may be that prolonged recession has indeed left the UK with a supply side problem. British manufacturers increasingly doubt not only the timing of recovery, but their ability to exploit it when it finally appears. Against that background, the continuing volume gain in exports looks suspicious. Unit labour costs have fallen sharply in the UK, but exporters seem condemned to charging ever higher prices while those of imports have been falling, especially for manufactured goods. The overall picture suggests industry continues to labour under an over-valued real exchange rate, in which case exports cannot run at record levels indefinitely. One has to wonder how many are already being won at the expense of margin.</p>

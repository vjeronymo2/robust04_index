			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with ANC Youth League President Lulu </F> Johnson by Deon Lamprecht; place and date not given: "Lulu Wants  To Fight for Freedom for All; Mokaba Successor Is No Dove"]    [Text] Lulu Johnson, new president of the African National  Congress (ANC) Youth League, is not a dove. Political observers  and journalists quickly began to compare Mr. Johnson to his  controversial predecessor, Mr. Peter Mokaba, but he is a  diplomat and not a fighter--the right choice to lead the youth  in this time of reconciliation. Or so they say.    It is easy to come to such a conclusion. Where Mr. Mokaba's  speeches are full of passion and fire, Mr. Johnson is cool,  calculating, and logical. But on Saturday, shortly after Mr.  Johnson's inauguration at the Youth League's annual convention  in Soweto, Mr. Tokyo Sexwale, the ANC district leader for the  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area, warned that the  young lion's bite should not be underestimated. The enthusiastic  singing and dancing with which the approximately 1,500 delegates  greeted his inaugural address attested to his popularity among  the militant youth.    When you sit in his office high above Plein Street in  Johannesburg, his eyes keep you riveted to your seat. He is not  put off by a joke, and he does not smile during the interview.  As is the case with most of the offices in Shell House, the  ANC's headquarters, there is a long line of people outside his  door. The furniture is sparse and Mr. Johnson's sports shirt is  not suited to the warm summer day.    Lulu is actually short for Mlungisi, he says. He often leans  forward over his lectern when he wishes to emphasize his words.  About his fiery predecessor, Johnson says: "Mokaba's bully image  was created by the media. There are other leaders who make  bellicose talk, but the media singled him out. Peter is a  dedicated fighter for freedom and human rights. But like many  other people who were leaders under apartheid, he is no stranger  to rage."    Johnson (29) has few pleasant memories of Keiskammahoek, the  place where he was born in Ciskei: "I will always remember how a  policeman forced me to strip naked so that he could search me."  He had his baptism of fire during the tumultuous 1980s in the  burning townships of Port Elizabeth: "In those years everything  was simply consumed by the struggle. We had to fight to survive.  I was born in the struggle. It is my mission to fight for  freedom for all the people in this country," he says.    Johnson does not like to answer the question as to whether  he  is a Christian, but it was his involvement in a Christian youth  organization that led him to start judging the system of  apartheid by the Scriptures and he rejected it. His political  career then accelerated. He joined the Congress of South African  Students (COSAS) in 1980 and he was the national president of  that organization in 1983 (Mokaba was also a COSAS man). Shortly  after COSAS was outlawed by the government in 1985, Johnson was  arrested for his political activities. After his release in  1989, he found himself once again in the trenches and around  December he advanced to become vice president of the ANC Youth  League--the office he occupied until he was elected its  president last week.    What course are the ANC youth going to take? "The Youth  League is a militant organization and we will always remain so.  The struggle is by no means over--we will continue to fight," he  said. "Until there is peace and democracy for everyone in South  Africa, the youth will continue to have to defend their  townships at night with AK-47 rifles. The illusion of a `lost  youth' is rubbish. We were never lost--we were at the forefront  of the struggle and we will always be there."    He believes that the youth have a role to play in national  reconstruction and development: "We cannot, however, bury the  bitter fruit of 300 years of apartheid overnight; we are looking  rather at a period of at least 10 years. That is why the Youth  League is looking at five-year programs for reconstruction and  development in all areas."    COSAS' cause still remains near and dear to his heart.  "Black  matriculation examination results were pathetic, but the roots  of the problem lie in apartheid. The education crisis is going  to get worse next year--thousands of students are going to be  turned away because of unfair admission requirements and because  they do not have the money."    Johnson rejects the rumors that the ANC leadership is afraid  of its youth and is modifying its policy to appease young  people. "As Youth League president I am also a member of the  ANC's National Executive Committee. Our working relationship  with the ANC is excellent--I can walk into Mandela's office at  any time. Although we are a part of the ANC, we do not play  second fiddle to it--we make our own decisions." He does foresee  that the Youth League will always be a pressure group within the  ANC. "It is for that reason that I am a proponent of a youth  parliament that would see to the interests of youth at the  highest level."    And are the more militant members of the ANC Youth League  attracted by the bellicose talk of the Pan-Africanist Congress  (PAC)? "I personally investigated the situation when those  rumors began to circulate, primarily in the Vaal River Triangle  and Soweto. I and my people on the scene kept a watchful eye on  the situation and I do not know of any member of the Youth  League who joined the PAC.    Regarding the contributions of the DP [Democratic Party] and  other South African and foreign organizations to the freedom  struggle he says: "There are those who claim to be experts on  freedom and democracy. But the same DP that now claims to be a  champion of democracy regarded the ANC's freedom fighters as  terrorists until recently. P.W. Botha and Van Zyl Slabbert were  in collusion."    This young lion has a warning for right-wingers: "Those  organizations that are pursuing only violence should be aware  that time is running out for them. They had better not come  looking for rapprochement at the last minute." But, after all,  the olive branch is there as well. "Even then we will be ready  to accept them. We offer a home for youth across the entire  political spectrum. We fight for peace and democracy for all  South Africans."    Sexwale said at Johnson's inauguration that he spoke like a  future president. Perhaps he is right. After all, Nelson Mandela  had his baptism of fire decades ago as the leader of the ANC  Youth League.</p>

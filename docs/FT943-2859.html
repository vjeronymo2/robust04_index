			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Brokers say Khashoggi is buying Thai stakes Mr Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi businessman and arms dealer, is involved in negotiations to buy stakes worth more than Bt3bn (Dollars 120m) in three listed Thai companies, according to company announcements and stockbrokers in Bangkok. The Stock Exchange of Thailand has suspended trading of shares in the three companies while the deals are negotiated. The companies are Jalaprathan Cement, Semiconductor Ventures International (SVI) and Morakot Industries, which produces and distributes palm oil. None of the companies is regarded as a blue chip investment and there has been no immediate comment from the Paris-based Mr Khashoggi on his intentions. Brokers say the deals are being negotiated by Mr Rakesh Saxena, a corporate financier and adviser to Bangkok Bank of Commerce. SVI, an electronic components manufacturer, said large shareholders had signed a memorandum of understanding to sell Mr Khashoggi 40 per cent of the company by September 23 in a deal worth Bt640m. Jalaprathan said its main shareholders planned to sell a quarter of the company's shares to foreign buyers - said by brokers to be Mr Khashoggi and his associates - by the same date. At the market price that stake would be worth Bt1.56bn. Morakot released no details of the sale of its stock, but brokers said 47 per cent of the company, a stake worth Bt1.13bn, was being offered to Mr Khashoggi.</p>

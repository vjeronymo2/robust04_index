			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consensus for social renewal Sir, David Goodhart's candid and accurate appraisal of the German social market model ('There's still life in the old model', April 12) was heartening, swamped as we often are by an insular and sometimes xenophobic tabloid media in the UK. The overriding message is that, to achieve change, partnership and consensus are vital. Confrontation and adversity between various players in the UK has often hindered constructive economic labour market change. In my east London constituency I find an amazing willingness of key players, ie local authorities, London East Training and Enterprise Council, social partners, those from the voluntary sector and educational institutions, to work together in developing projects that will advance economic and social regeneration. I hope it will be this model of regional partnership, a model supported by the European Commission, that will ensure successful economic and social renewal, based on the consent of all interested parties. Carol Tongue, European parliament, 91-113 rue Belliart, 1047 Brussels, Belgium</p>

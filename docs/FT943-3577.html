			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Wesgo recommends ADollars 106m APN bid Australian Provincial Newspapers, the chain of regional newspapers controlled by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, has launched a ADollars 106m (USDollars 79m) cash bid for Wesgo, the radio company which operates stations in eastern and South Australia. APN picked up a 14.8 per cent stake in Wesgo on Sunday, following talks between the companies, and Wesgo immediately recommended the ADollars 1.90 a share offer when it was announced yesterday. The radio company had been facing a rival bid from Sunshine Broadcasting Network, which valued it at about ADollars 90m. By yesterday afternoon, however, Sunshine had sold its stake in Wesgo to APN. Amcor, the Melbourne-based packaging, paper and pulp group, has announced its first move into Indonesia. It will take a 55 per cent stake in Indopack Pratama, which is owned by Pakerin, a private paper and packaging group.</p>

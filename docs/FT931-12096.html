			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Motoring: A thoroughbred beast of burden - Citroen's XM SD estate CITROEN'S XM is not quite the biggest bulk carrier among estate cars. Ford's Scorpio, a Mercedes 200-300T or the Vauxhall Carlton beat its load floor length, with back seat folded, by up to five inches (12.5 cm). But nothing can match it as a weight carrier. As a bonus, its self-levelling suspension keeps it on an even keel with a load of garden stone or logs. Or, for that matter, a dozen cases of still wine, six of champagne and 24 cartons of beer. This, my bathroom scales tell me, will total 1,074 lbs (488 kg). Allowing 294 lbs (134 kg) for my wife and me, we will still be well within the 1,378 lb (626 kg) load limit - and HM Customs' guidelines - as we roll off the ferry at Dover one day soon. But the XM SD estate is much more than a champion weight-lifter. I doubt that any estate car can match its ride quality. Laden heavily or running light, it is as unruffled by bumpy roads as an ocean liner on a gentle swell. On motorways, it cruises like the chairman's limousine. Semi-active suspension lets it corner fast on winding roads without leaning; automatic transmission makes town driving relaxed and motorway tail-backs more tolerable. Normally, I fill the 80-litre (17.6 gallon) tank at 450/550-mile (725/885 km) intervals because, in more than 4,000 miles (6,500 km), the worst fuel consumption has been 28.6 mpg (9.87 l/100km). At best, it was 35.4 mpg (7.98 l/100 km). The two-pedal XM SD estate is, of course, a turbo-diesel. It is not as economical as a five-speed manual Citroen XM SD I drove for a year; that gave me up to 45 mpg (6.27 l/100 km) on a journey. But the automatic is a far nicer car to drive. With only two pedals, its awkward, foot-operated parking brake is tolerable because it is not needed for hill starting. And apart from replacing a no better-than-average manual gearbox, the automatic transmission makes the XM turbo-diesel feel much more refined. Because the 2.1 litre, 12-valve, 110-horsepower diesel is small for a car of this size, it has to work quite hard. When accelerating, the transmission does not go into top until nearly 3,000 rpm and 50 mph (80 kmh). On slowing down - say, for a corner - it down-shifts almost imperceptibly into third at around 40 mph (64 kmh) and into second at 30 mph (48 kmh). All of this makes the XM SD drive more like a petrol-engined car than a typical diesel. The downside is that on a cross-country route with bends and hills, the transmission spends more time in second and third than in top, which is no help to fuel economy. But on a motorway, the high top (under 3,000 rpm at 80 mph/128 kmh) makes for relaxed and economical motoring. The XM SD estate has such executive car goodies as power-adjusted front seats and door mirrors, remote central locking and electric sun roof - plus a good radio / tape with volume and station search buttons in the steering wheel hub. With all seats filled, it still has a load space big enough to take a folded two-seat pram and a labrador on its bean bag. Citroens share important mechanical components with Peugeots but are still individualistic. Although it is not at all quirky, you would never mistake the XM estate for anything else; it drives, rides and looks like no other car. List price is Pounds 20,943. This includes an information read-out telling you which door you have left half-open and what the outside temperature is - it flashes a frost warning below 5`C - but ABS brakes are Pounds 821 extra.</p>

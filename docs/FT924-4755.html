			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Coal sale to await pit review debate THE GOVERNMENT would take no decision on the timing of British Coal privatisation until both houses of parliament had been able to debate the results of the pit closure review, Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, said yesterday. His assurance came as ministers were attacked by opposition peers for seeking to press ahead with the bill paving the way for the privatisation of British Coal and of British Rail while the review of the pit closure programme was still under way. The legislation allows the two organisations to appoint advisers to deal with financial and legal issues in the run-up to privatisation. The Lords voted not to delay the paving bill until early next year when the white paper following the coal review is due to be published. The decision to proceed marks the overcoming of a vital hurdle for BR privatisation, already postponed for some months.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Former MCC chief defends secrecy over company loans MR DAVID SHAFFER, former chief executive of Maxwell Communication Corporation who was last week named by a New York bankruptcy court to manage MCC's US assets, last night defended MCC's decision not to disclose to shareholders a series of loans between MCC and Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies over the past three years. Mr Shaffer said he was 'shocked' on August 2 when Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's finance director, revealed the size of loans from MCC to Mr Maxwell's private companies. These totalled around Pounds 350m, having not existed at the end of MCC's financial year on March 31, 1991. Mr Shaffer said he contacted Mr Maxwell last August and was assured that most of the inter-company loans from MCC would be repaid by September. 'As long as I have worked here, for the past three years, there have always been inter-company loans between MCC and private Maxwell companies. I don't think they should have been disclosed. There was no legal obligation to do so and they were not material,' he said. The transfer of funds from MCC - which last month filed for protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law - to private Maxwell companies is the subject of an inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office. It is expected investigators will ask Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, MCC's auditors, to justify the decision not to disclose loans over the past three years between MCC and private Maxwell interests. In an interview with the Financial Times last night Mr Shaffer also said: MCC, Macmillan Inc and affiliates owe around Dollars 189m (Pounds 105m) to Berlitz, the language school subsidiary. Berlitz said last night it is not paying dividends on Dollars 180m of its preferred stock held by MCC and Macmillan because they are in default on the Dollars 189m of loans from Berlitz. Macmillan holds 10 per cent of the 56.5 per cent stake of Berlitz shares and is seeking the return of the remaining Berlitz shares from five entities who received them from the Maxwells as collateral on loans - Swiss Bank Corporation, Swiss Volksbank, Shearson Lehman Brothers, Advest of New York and Morgan Stanley, which is holding Berlitz stock in custody for a UK-based affiliate of the Bishopsgate group of Maxwell fund managers.

And it cannot be a state body because there may not  be two representative bodies in one republic."    For its part, "Ukraine," an association of 40 public  organizations and political parties, has come out with a  statement on the Crimean events which says in particular that  the election of a Crimean president is a violation of Ukraine's  constitution and a way of "dragging Ukraine into a restored  Russian empire." The statement suggests that the Ukrainians and  Tatars living on the peninsula are being subjected to tough  discrimination.    The association called on the Ukrainian president, Supreme  Soviet, and law enforcement bodies to "give a proper assessment  of the actions by the Crimean separatists and take adequate  measures to restore law and order in the whole state."</p>

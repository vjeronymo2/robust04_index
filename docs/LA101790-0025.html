			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: ATTORNEY GENERAL;  </P> <P> VICTIMS-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS BACK LUNGREN  </P> <P> Stressing his tough anti-crime posture, Republican state attorney general  candidate Dan Lungren on Tuesday showcased several crime victims' advocates who  praised him while questioning the crime-fighting credentials of his Democratic  opponent, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith.  </P> <P> Lungren "is a man of character and . . . commitment," said Collene Campbell,  the sister of slain motor sports promoter Mickey Thompson and a leader of the  Crime Victims California Justice Committee. "I'm so proud to know Dan, and we  as crime victims have very little to be proud of."  </P> <P> Campbell, speaking at a news conference, said she served "in the trenches" with  Lungren, a former five-term congressman, to help win passage of Proposition  115, the sweeping anti-crime initiative approved by voters in June. In  contrast, she said, Smith, who also supported Proposition 115, never made  himself available to meet with her.  </P> <P> A Smith spokeswoman said Tuesday that the San Francisco prosecutor would be  happy to confer with Campbell, who now heads a 400-member group called Memory  of Victims Everywhere. "If she appeared at his office at a time when he was  busy with district attorney's work, it's possible he couldn't meet with her at  that time," spokeswoman Betsy Hely said.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Smith has relentlessly attacked Lungren for his staunch  anti-abortion stance as well as his repeated votes in Congress against  anti-pollution legislation. Lungren has counterattacked by stressing the key  role he played in the passage of criminal reform laws, including the  Comprehensive Crime Cotrol Act of 1984, which strengthened prison sentences and  allowed authorities to seize the assets of drug dealers.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's news conference, Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. James  Cloninger, a co-author of Proposition 115, questioned the extent of Smith's  involvement in bringing the anti-crime initiative to the ballot.  </P> <P> During a joint appearance with Lungren last month, Smith said he had helped  draft Proposition 115, which is designed to speed trial proceedings and expand  the number of crimes covered by the death penalty. But Cloninger said Tuesday  he had no recollection of Smith participating in the drafting process.  </P> <P> But Alameda County Dist. Atty. John J. Meehan, in a statement by Smith's  campaign later Tuesday, said he recalled that Smith helped work on revisions of  the proposed initiative in a California District Attorney's Assn. committee.  </P></p>

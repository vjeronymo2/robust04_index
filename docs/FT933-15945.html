			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): New Zealand closes at a new three-year high THE Nikkei average posted a marginal gain on the lowest volume since January 18 as investors remained inactive due to the two-day Bank of Japan branch managers' meeting, which ends today, and the Tokyo G7 summit, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average appreciated just 1.60 to 19,623.06 after wavering between 19,545.45 and 19,676.07. Volume fell to 150m shares from 226m. Declines led advances by 576 to 402, with 169 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 12.00 to 1,583.42, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.21 at 1,200.95. Many traders expect investors to refrain from building positions ahead of the general election on July 18. However, Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said the current lull in the market resembled the situation in January this year, when share prices jumped on active buying after a few weeks of low trading volume. Issues closely linked with East Japan Railway, the state-owned regional railway company which officially applied for listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday, were mixed. Market participants hope that the JR East shares will be a catalyst for the equity market, by attracting the interest of individual investors. Nippon Signal, a leading railway signal maker, rose Y20 to Y1,590, but Kyosan Electric, another signal manufacturer, receded Y10 to Y1,180. Nikkatsu, the movie producer which filed for court protection under the bankruptcy law yesterday, ended at an offered price of Y99. The company is scheduled to be delisted on October 2. Meanwhile, Shionogi, the drug maker which will replace Nikkatsu as a Nikkei 225 component stock, became the day's most active issue, firming Y10 to Y1,060 on continued buying orders. Janome Sewing Machine dropped Y31 to Y390. Reports that a former executive was seeking Y120bn in damages from Janome's board members for the company's massive debts prompted selling. Mitsubishi Motors declined Y6 to Y754 as Chrysler, the US car maker, was poised to release its 2.72 per cent stake in the company. Other car shares were firm on the weaker yen, with Nissan Motor up Y11 to Y695. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 57.15 to 21,706.08 in volume of 16m shares. Roundup PROFIT-TAKING was much in evidence among the Pacific Rim's markets yesterday. NEW ZEALAND accelerated to a new three-year closing high, assisted by a robust performance by Telecom, 14 cents ahead at NZDollars 3.25, and a further easing in interest rates. The NZSE-40 index moved forward 16.46 to 1,715.52 in high turnover of NZDollars 38.2m. However, Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey both declined on profit-taking, Fletcher dipping 3 cents to NZDollars 2.89 and CHH easing a cent to NZDollars 2.96. HONG KONG fell back at the close as early gains were erased by profit-taking, triggered by news that the first day of the Sino-British talks had ended inconclusively. The Hang Seng index lost a net 12.52 at 7,205.41, having risen by more than 120 points earlier in the day on news that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, is to visit China to hold talks on Hong Kong's political reforms. Turnover stood at HKDollars 4.06bn against HKDollars 5.10bn on Friday. SINGAPORE rose on selective buying interest in Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 7.69 at 1,825.92. Brokers said a report that forecasts of 1993 and 1994 corporate earnings had been revised upwards by analysts also underpinned the market. Volume came to 129.22m shares. SEOUL saw buying focused on financial shares and large manufacturing companies. The composite index ended 4.48 higher at 752.78 in turnover of Won396.5bn. News that Dong-Ah Construction would sign joint-venture deals in China worth some Dollars 3bn helped to lift construction stocks. Dong-Ah closed the day's limit up, appreciating Won1,000 to Won22,000. TAIWAN reversed an early 50-point gain, the weighted index finishing 9.91 lower at 3,907.33. Turnover totalled TDollars 11.9bn. Early rises were triggered by unconfirmed reports that the Formosa Plastics group was about to announce a Dollars 7.5bn petrochemicals project. Formosa rose 50 cents to TDollars 41.30. MANILA slipped back as investors took profits on selected blue chips. The composite index dipped 4.46 to 1,579.51 in turnover down to 263.7m pesos. AUSTRALIA featured gold stocks in an otherwise subdued session, the gold shares index strengthening 50.2 to 2,154.2 while the All Ordinaries index lost 3.0 to 1,765.9. Turnover amounted to ADollars 311.8m.</p>

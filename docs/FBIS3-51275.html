The new minister is the son of Jorge Cardenas, Colombian  coffee czar, and he currently holds the post of manager of the  Colombian State Energy Enterprise.    This will be his second experience in the public sector,  because previously he had dedicated himself exclusively to  managing private sector companies.    Cardenas must carry out an industrial reconversion process  initiated by his predecessor. The process is aimed at boosting  industry in the face of the economic opening implemented by  Gaviria's government.    The incumbent minister resigned to join the political  campaign of Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana, who in early  February will launch officially his presidential campaign.</p>

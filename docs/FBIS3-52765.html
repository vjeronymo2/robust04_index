			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Pakistani Campaign Soon for the </F> Deportation of `Afghan' Arabs"]    [Text] Islamabad, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Official  Pakistani sources yesterday confirmed that hundreds of "Afghan"  Arabs living in Afghanistan [as published] are now targets for  detention and deportation to their countries of origin within  the next few weeks. A foreign ministry spokesman in Islamabad  has stated that Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia had officially  requested that Pakistan expel their extremist nationals residing  in Pakistan.    The spokesman added that "solving this problem is also  important for Pakistan."    Pakistan is expected to begin its campaign in the next few  weeks to avoid the possibility of its name being added to the  U.S. list of "states which sponsor terrorism." It is known that  the U.S. State Department is now reviewing that list prior to  issuing a new list in February.</p>

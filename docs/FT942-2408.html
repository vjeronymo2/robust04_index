			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Spain and Bolivia hit by two-game bans Spanish captain Miguel Angel Nadal and Bolivian star striker Marco Etcheverry were both suspended for two matches yesterday after being sent off in their teams' opening games. The ban means both will miss their remaining two first-round group matches. Both countries were also fined Dollars 3,500, the minimum automatic fine. The disciplinary committee of Fifa, soccer's governing body, decided that in principle a direct expulsion will lead to at least a two-match suspension. General secretary Sepp Blatter also said that all teams were being warned to observe rules on shirt advertising after Germany, Switzerland and Romania all breached rules in the opening two days. Fifa added that if a player was sent off for two yellow-card offences, he would receive a one-match suspension.  -------------------------------------------------- Results  -------------------------------------------------- GROUP F Belgium    1        Morocco      0 GROUP E Norway     1        Mexico       0  -------------------------------------------------- Today's games  -------------------------------------------------- GROUP B Brazil vs Russia San Francisco (21:00 BST) GROUP F Holland vs Saudi Arabia Washington (00:30 BST)  --------------------------------------------------</p>

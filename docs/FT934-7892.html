			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / National print deals to resume NATIONAL PAY bargaining is to resume in the printing industry in 1994 after a year's suspension, it was announced yesterday by the printing employers' federation and the GPMU print union. The decision follows intensive negotiations between the two sides and widespread consultation among printing companies. It represents a climbdown by the employers federation, which made clear earlier this year that it wanted to scrap the national wage agreement in favour of company deals. But the federation found its affiliate members were almost evenly divided in their views on whether to return to national pay bargaining. While larger printing companies saw the value of dealing with pay themselves, medium and smaller-sized companies preferred the stability ensured by a centralised agreement.</p>

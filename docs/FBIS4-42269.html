			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus, has declared that the Cyprus question has  reached a turning point that requires a new persepctive.  Denktas held a news conference in Kastamonu, where he is being  hosted by the Ilgaz Group.    In his news conference, Denktas asked that the pressure and  threats directed against the Turkish Cypriot side cease and that  there be a realistic bid to resolve the problem. According to  TRT correspondent Ihsan Gunal, Denktas remarked that the Greek  Cypriots are amassing weapons on the island and they are  planning to establish an air force and to allow Greece to build  a naval base in Baf [Paphos].    [Begin Denktas recording] This is madness; but, we cannot  stick our neck out just because the Greek Cypriots have gone  insane and we cannot say yes you are right to all their moves.  [end recording]    Denktas noted that the Greek Cypriots are engaged in efforts  to join the European Union [EU] and if this comes about they  will merge with Greece. The Greek Cypriots are already  concluding various bilateral agreements with the Greeks, Denktas  noted. He announced that if the Greek Cypriots become a member  of the EU, then the Turkish Cypriots could opt for economic and  political integration with Turkey under conditions to be agreed  upon. This will convey the following message to the Greek  Cypriots, Denktas explained: The moves you make can be  reciprocated and we will courageously undertake such reciprocal  moves. Denktas said that Turkey and the Turkish factor should  not be forgotten with regard to this issue.    In reply to a question, Denktas said that he will not submit  the integration proposal to the Turkish Government.    [Begin Denktas recording] However, the assessment of the  situation and the exchange of views we conducted indicate that  this is the only solution in the face of continuing Greek  Cypriots moves. [end recording]    Later, Denktas flew by helicopter from Kastamonu to Ankara.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Atay Ahmet Rasid, minister of foreign affairs and  defense, has said that the Greek Cypriot side must quickly  abandon its inflexible approach and refrain from making  statements and accusations against the Turkish Cypriot side that  are aimed at misleading the public, so that a balanced and just  result can be achieved from the talks that are being held on the  confidence-building measures.    In a written statement yesterday, Rasid recalled Greek  Cypriot Foreign Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis' effort to  blame the Turkish Cypriot side for the deadlock in the talks on  the confidence-building measures and said that Mikhailidhis'  effort was aimed at distorting well-known facts.    Rasid stressed that the introduction of new elements in the  talks -- elements aimed at satisfying the Greek Cypriot side --  will create a deadlock in the negotiating process. He said:  "As the experts who follow the talks on the confidence-building  measures on Maras [Varosha] and the Nicosia International  Airport have seen, the main reasons for the present deadlock are  the Greek Cypriot side's pressure and the attempt to deviate  from the original package of confidence-building measures and  add new elements to it in order to satisfy Glavkos Kliridhis and  the Greek Cypriot side."</p>

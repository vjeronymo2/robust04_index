			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRUCK CARRYING ORANGES OVERTURNS, BLOCKS ANAHEIM FREEWAY FOR 2 HOURS  </P> <P> A tractor-trailer truck rolled over Saturday on the Riverside Freeway in  Anaheim, spilling a load of oranges and shutting down the highway for more than  two hours.  </P> <P> No one was injured in the 3:45 p.m. accident just east of Imperial Highway, but  thousands of motorists were stranded on the freeway until the mess was cleaned  up shortly before 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Some drivers resorted to taking side streets to get around the crash, but the  majority waited it out while crews cleared the freeway, authorities said.  </P> <P> A California Highway Patrol spokesman said the accident apparently occurred  when a car blew a tire, swerved into the big rig, then ricocheted down an  embankment.  </P> <P> Jose Luis Luivano, 24, of Escondido lost control of the truck, which swung  across traffic and overturned onto its side, spilling the load of oranges  across the pavement, the CHP spokesman said.  </P> <P> The driver of the car that triggered the accident fled the scene afterward, the  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Authorities had been unable to identify the man, who was apparently unhurt, by  late Saturday night.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia is to begin training pilots from Vietnam.  QANTAS and the Australian Aviation College have won a $9 million  contract to train 60 pilots -- a deal being sponsored by  Australia's overseas aid organization, AIDAB [Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau]. Len Novak reports:    [Begin Novak recording] It is the first time any aviation  course will be undertaken for Vietnam by Australians. The  Adelaide-based Australian Aviation College will train the  students to airline entry; QANTAS will teach the students how  to fly airliners up to Boeings and Airbuses.    The first group of 20 cadets will start their training next  month and together with the rest of the contingent will form the  nucleus of Vietnam's new breed of pilots. The country is moving  to modernize its fleet and needs qualified crew. It is expected  the entire training program will be staged during the next two  years, allowing a much needed boost to Australia's ailing  aviation industry. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of </F> Democratic Kampuchea, on 21 June; place not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] I. At 1830 on 17 June, the Democratic Kampuchea  [DK] office received a letter from the Interior Ministry of the  two-headed government signed by Sar Kheng and Yu Hokkri. It  ordered the Democratic Kampuchea representative and his entire  staff to withdraw from the DK office before 19 June 1994.    II. According to reliable reports, Interior Minister Sar  Kheng and Defense Minister Tie Banh -- both communist Vietnamese  puppets -- met on the orders of their communist Vietnamese  masters to adopt this measure on 14 June; that is, before the  roundtable commission meeting on 15 and 16 June.    III. According to these reliable documents, the Assembly did  not meet to decide on this matter and the king did not know  about it in advance. Therefore, the move to close the DK office  in Phnom Penh was a dictatorial and fascist measure by the  police and troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets. They are  no different than Hitler's fascist Gestapo. This was a decision  made by communist Vietnam and its puppets, who oppose national  reconciliation and peace and who continue to fuel the communist  Vietnamese war and annex Cambodia at will.    IV. As for the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], it does  feel the need to leave its office in Phnom Penh for the  following reasons:    1. The PDK is not afraid of the puppets' fascist police and  troops -- the lackeys of communist Vietnam. The DK has fought  more than 250,000 communist Vietnamese aggressor troops since  1979. It dealt them repeated serious blows until forcing them  to sign the October 1991 Paris agreement. The DK is not afraid  to make sacrifices. It has done so repeatedly and has left  everything behind to defend the nation, race, and land. The DK  has no goal other than this -- it does not seek profit or power.    2. The DK set up this office following the Paris agreement  at the request of the king and of people from various circles in  Phnom Penh as well as people nationwide. It did so at the  request of the overwhelming majority of peace and justice-loving  countries around the world who want the various Cambodian sides  to have contact and talk with one another to achieve national  reconciliation and peace so that Cambodia can enjoy peace and  Southeast Asia and the Asia- Pacific region can enjoy stability  and security.    After learning of this fascist measure, the king asked the  PDK to leave to prevent the two-headed government from making  trouble. At the same time, the king also told the two-headed  government not to do anything affecting the DK representative.  If the representative were molested, there would be great  trouble. In view of this situation, the PDK decided to pull out  of Phnom Penh.    V. The problem is this: What was the goal behind the  communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets closing the DK  office in Phnom Penh? Our nation, people in every circle, and  peace and justice-loving countries around the world have seen  their goal and clearly realize the following:    1. The goal of the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their  puppets and lackeys is to continue fueling the war to kill the  Cambodian nation, people, and the DK. This is why, on the one  hand, they have dispatched men to seek aid -- particularly  weapons -- from foreign countries, while on the other hand they  destroyed the roundtable meeting by refusing to discuss national  reconciliation. Our entire nation and people can clearly see  this with their own eyes. Increasing numbers of foreign  observers have also realized that the State of Cambodia has  become a two-headed government since the UNTAC [UN Transitional  Authority in Cambodia] election. This is just on the outside,  however. In essence, the two-headed government remains the  state authority of the communist Vietnamese puppets -- 90  percent in Phnom Penh and 100 percent in the provinces.    2. In fueling their war of aggression in Cambodia -- using  Cambodian traitors to kill nationalist Cambodians -- the  communist Vietnamese have no hope of destroying the DK  militarily. They have had bitter personal experiences, both in  the full-scale war of aggression using their own army from 1979  to 1991, and thereafter. Despite this, the communist Vietnamese  continue to fuel their war of aggression through their puppets  in the two-headed government so they can continue to bring in  Vietnamese nationals to annex Cambodia in a demographic war.    The strategy of the communist Vietnamese aggressors poses a  great danger to the survival of the nation and people. Faced  with this immense and immediate danger, the PDK -- like other  nationalist Cambodians -- has a high sense of responsibility and  duty regarding the survival of the Cambodian nation and race.  It cannot avoid this responsibility. Now, as in the future and  in the past, the DK absolutely remains with the nation and  people, sharing weal and woe.    3. Apart form the goal of killing the nation, the people,  and the DK, do the communist Vietnamese have any other goals in  ordering their puppet and lackey troops and police to enact this  fascist measure to close the DK office in Phnom Penh?    The answer to this question is very clear; there is no  doubt about it. The goal of the communist Vietnamese is to cut  off contact between the DK and the other Cambodian sides  completely. Once they have done this, the communist Vietnamese  and their puppets can do whatever they want with those who are  already in their cage. This is the dark goal of the communist  Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys in adopting the fascist  measure to close the DK office in Phnom Penh.    VI. Another question that arises is this: Can the communist  Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys do anything they want  at will? The answer to this question is also clear; there is no  doubt about it. The communist Vietnamese and their puppets and  lackeys cannot do anything at will. The national conflict  caused by the communist Vietnamese aggressors through the  Communist Party of Vietnam -- which also controls the so-called  Cambodian People's Party, the state authority, and over 4  million Vietnamese -- is already very acute. There is also the  social conflict resulting from the communist Vietnamese  aggressors' controlling and plundering the economy of the  two-headed government -- from paddy, rice, corn, beans, rubber,  fish, timber, and so on, to other resources. On top of this,  the Vietnamese nationals who have been flowing into Cambodia --  there are more than 4 millions of them now -- have also been  robbing the country. The ringleaders of the communist  Vietnamese puppets are also robbing the country. The two-headed  government is doing the same thing. This has deprived people in  the rural areas of their farm land and workers and students in  the cities of jobs. Officials, teachers, and even soldiers are  being deprived of their salaries.    The 15-year communist Vietnamese war of aggression continues  to rage and destroy the country. Theft and robbery, insecurity,  prostitution, AIDS, and all kinds of social ills are spreading.  All of these conflicts are piling onto other conflicts and are  near the explosion point. The communist Vietnamese and their  puppets and lackeys are solving this complex situation by  fueling the war with one hand in an attempt to destroy the DK,  which is the backbone of the resistance of the entire Cambodian  nation and people in defending the nation. With the other hand,  they are using fascist measures to arrest and kill the people  and the masses in Phnom Penh and various provincial towns who  are unable to take it any longer and have risen to fight back.    Can the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys  solve this? Certainly not; on the contrary, the more the  communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government fuel  the war, the more fascist they become and the more they oppose  national reconciliation. In turn, the nation and people will  oppose and denounce them more and more. The forces of national  reconciliation will arise and become more agitated and active in  their struggle.    VII. On this occasion, the PDK would like to once again  affirm its stance as follows:    1. In a situation where the communist Vietnamese and their  puppets and lackeys, bad elements in the Western alliance, and  the two-headed government continue to fuel the war to kill the  nation, the people, and the DK, the latter has every right to  join the nation and people to struggle in every form to defend  themselves.    2. The DK, like the entire nation and people, very much  needs and wants peace and national reconciliation. In the past,  present, and future, and under all circumstances, the DK will  continue to stand firm and unshakable on national reconciliation.    3. The DK wants continued roundtable talks and discussions  to search for national reconciliation based on the two items on  the agenda as already agreed. This is a billion times better  than fueling the war.    Long live the mighty national reconciliation forces!    [Dated] Cambodia, 21 June 1994    [Signed] PDK Chairman Khieu Samphan</p>

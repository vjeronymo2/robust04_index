			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Zhirayr Liparityan, Armenian Republic deputy </F> minister of foreign affairs, by Ida Martirosyan, under the  rubric "War and We"; place and date not given: "The Possible and  the Necessary"]    [Text] The possible and the necessary--these are the  premises on which we should base our actions in order to shift  to more complex issues--is the opinion of Zhirayr Liparityan,  Armenian Republic deputy minister of foreign affairs.    [Martirosyan] Mr. Liparityan, in your opinion, is the  peacekeeping process progressing, regressing, or not going  anywhere?    [Liparityan] Most likely, the latter. Although of course  there is a certain progress, and certain retreat. For instance,  Azerbaijan does not accept any mediating efforts, any  cease-fire. It is ready for a new offensive and de facto  continues the war, air raids--that is, Azerbaijan's position is  evidence of the lack of progress in the peacekeeping process. On  the other hand, the CSCE has become more active.    Mr. Eliasson has sufficiently analyzed previous mistakes and  now is demonstrating a new approach, which inspires certain  hopes. That is, as you can see, there are both pluses and  minuses, so we may say that as a result they neutralize one  another or, in other words, there is no particular progress. At  the same time, the opportunities for it undoubtedly exist. To  carry them through, however, one has to work hard, in order to  first and foremost identify where and how they could be  utilized. I would count as an unquestionable achievement the  fact that the main parties in the conflict--Azerbaijan and  Karabakh--finally came to understand that the problems cannot be  resolved in a military way and the process of peaceful  settlement remains the only viable option. This may be done  within the CSCE framework, the way Eliasson suggests. It could  be the Russian initiatives. It is an inarguable fact that Russia  as the country in closest proximity, which has a stake in  normalizing the situation in the region and has ties with all  parties to the conflict, may play a very significant role. We  hope in any case that Eliasson will be able to combine the  efforts of both the CSCE and Russia, which undoubtedly is ready  for it. In this case we will be able to speak of moving toward  progress.    [Martirosyan] Some Western political scientists and  journalists believe that despite the fact that the West had  certain interests and plans here, its initially active position  on the Karabakh issue is on the wane, and that in the final  count the outcome will be determined by Russia. In Russia,  however, there is a belief that instead of showing activism in  the peacekeeping process--which is within the abilities of the  CSCE, and United Nations, and the United States--the West does  not miss the occasion to throw sticks in the wheels of Russian  initiatives. Would it be fair to say that this disjointedness  and asynchronicity, which stems from a certain divergence of  their interests, is in fact one of the reasons producing the  lack of clear progress in settling the conflict?    [Liparityan] Your concern over this is understandable and  justified in a sense that relations between the West and Russia  are far from clear-cut. Several years ago they were perceived  differently, as more difficult. After the disintegration of the  USSR and especially now, when the policy of Russia as a state is  more clearly defined, many aspects are becoming more clear. And  especially how Russia itself sees its place in the world. This  is also a multistep process, in which the West does not always  understand or accept Russia's position and, vice versa, Russia  also does not always correctly perceive the former's intentions.  They are both in the process of getting to know one another.  There is no doubt, however, that an understanding will come,  their positions will get mutually fine-tuned, and they will  adjust. One can already see it in the example of Bosnia, where  we are seeing precisely this stage of fine-tuning, a step toward  cooperation between Russia and the West. Let us hope that this  will happen here, too.    I must say that newspaper items and even statements of some  politicians and diplomats sometimes [line illegible] actions.  And I repeat, they reflect not so much the probability of events  as the deep fear of the worst. Although there is nothing  particularly terrible in it; on the contrary, this is like a  warning of danger. It is clear, however, that one cannot form a  judgment of the real policy from them. Russia has an image of  the country that is quite responsible in its policy and actions.  And, I repeat, both Russia and the West are moving step by step  [line illegible] all, where each will take its place in a new  set-up. Therefore I have no doubt that Russia will not act  against international law, the CSCE, and the United Nations; on  the contrary, together we will find an approach to settling our  conflict. By the way, do not forget that even when there exist  apparent similarities, each conflict has its own character and  therefore requires a special approach to its resolution. I must  say that this is precisely the direction in which our diplomacy  is working: finding common points in the interests of Russia and  the West in order to strengthen their interaction and impact on  the fastest possible resolution of the problem. This is the main  approach. Of course, there are disagreements not only between  Russia and the West as a whole, but also in the approaches  favored by the United States and the EC. But they are not  substantive. Thus, I repeat, everything boils down to  painstaking work, and I am convinced that mutual understanding  is inevitable.    [Martirosyan] Do you consider correct an approach that makes  cease-fire a cornerstone and only then a search for a peace  formula? Perhaps it would be more correct to put the latter  ahead of the former, or act in parallel in both directions?    [Liparityan] We have discussed this issue in great depth,  and  not only we but other states as well. From the methodological  aspect, there are three approaches. The first is a simple  cease-fire. Then, in several phases, resolution of other issues.    The second is to first define the status and after that  cease-fire and everything else. The first approach is  unrealistic, because Azerbaijan does not accept it. They are  afraid that in the current reality the issue of returning the  seized territories will be postponed until further negotiations.  Therefore, it agrees to a simultaneous cease-fire and return of  seized territories. The first option alone does not suit it. We  and Karabakh are ready to accept the first option, but, as I  said, we know that for Azerbaijan it is unacceptable. As to the  second--to start with the status--in our opinion, this will lead  to exacerbation of the conflict because there are tremendous  principal disagreements between the parties precisely on this  issue. And there is deep mutual mistrust. Therefore, it is  simply naive to assume that under this option the parties will  be able to come to an agreement. Thus, our approach is in  working from the premise of what is possible and necessary. To  find these components [line illegible] move over to more complex  issues. Our package consists of three points that meet the  requirements of possible and necessary. It is cease-fire, the  return of seized territories, and lifting the blockade. All of  this is spelled out in the CSCE's Vienna document and the  Russian initiative. The problem is that there is no guarantee  for a cease-fire without some disengaging forces. We cannot  trust Azerbaijan. A cease-fire must be stable and guaranteed. If  a cease-fire is guaranteed, we guarantee the return of the  territories. Without Lachin, of course, which is subject to  further negotiations, because for Karabakh it is a lifeline. And  lastly, lifting the blockade. These three points as a package,  in our opinion, are the most acceptable and realistic solution.  But to consider it all even in parallel with the issue of  status, I think, albeit possible, is fraught [as published]  because unresolvable issues associated with it will immediately  arise. It means that we have to admit that the issue of  status--and it is this issue that in the final count constitutes  the cornerstone of the peace formula--is the most difficult one  and it is not advisable to give it priority. You see, there is  one more serious nuance in the issue of defining the status:  More weight will be given to the voice of the party that will  rake up more military victories by the time of negotiations.  Subsequently, this will reduce the guarantees of a real  cease-fire process. Which is the most important point. A  cease-fire is necessary in order to stop bloodshed; in order for  people to return to normal life, taste it again, and realize  that nobody will benefit from an endless war between peoples  living side by side; and finally, in order to reduce domestic  pressure for both sides and for simple human desire for normal  peaceful life to prevail. And perhaps it is after the  cease-fire, during the period of returning to normal life, that  people will find those ways and possibilities for coexistence  that we cannot find now. They will reach compromises they now  consider unthinkable. That is why I am saying that right now the  most important part is to apply all efforts in order to  implement the three conditions I have enumerated above.    [Martirosyan] Over these years, the conflict has gone  through  several stages. Initially it was between a republic and its  autonomy within the boundaries of one state; then it was  considered internal within the framework of one newly formed  sovereign state, although in essence it was between one  recognized state and another one claiming recognition. Now it  has transcended into an international stage, although the world  community seemed to try to avoid precisely that. Judging by all  signs, however, the world community does not take into account  this transformation, because otherwise the legal aspect of  approaching the settlement would have been changed. Could this  perhaps be the reason why the peacekeeping process is not moving  anywhere: the lack of a fresh look, a new legal approach to the  conflict, which is going through transformation during its  development, which stem from objective changes on the political  situation?    [Liparityan] You see, internalization of this problem also  has gone through several stages. The first was the result of the  collapse of the USSR, when it changed from being an internal  problem of the latter to an external one, because one of the  interested parties, in addition to the ones directly involved,  was a sovereign state--Armenia. The second happened at the point  when Armenia and Azerbaijan joined the CSCE as members. A CSCE  mandate dated 24 March 1992 was adopted that said that the  resolution of this conflict must be found through mediating  efforts of the CSCE. The third stage is when Azerbaijan called  in mujahidin and other contract soldiers. What I want to say is  that there have not been any particular legal changes but there  obviously have been certain political ones. For instance, now  the United Nations has entered the process--an organization  which, unlike the CSCE, has its own military contingent and the  right to bring it into a territory where certain events take  place, and without the consent of the parties to the conflict at  that. That is, it is a certain qualitative change in the  political approach.... But, I repeat, there are no such changes  in the legal aspect. There is still no decision, a CSCE or UN  document, presenting the issue differently.    [Martirosyan] Still, in your opinion, is a change in the  approach on the part of the world community needed?    [Liparityan] You see, in a certain form it already has  happened. The CSCE has realized that by its very structure it  does not possess the capabilities of implementing the decisions  entrusted to a peacekeeping mission or group under its aegis. I  mean the process of cease-fire. In some decisions the CSCE has  acknowledged that by very [as published]. The result of this  realization was that Russia directly joined in on the issue. In  reality, it already has happened, although officially the CSCE  does not say that it is no longer engaged in the issue of  cease-fire. Both the numerous statements of the Minsk Group  chairman and UN resolutions mention the mediating part of  Russian peacekeeping forces in the cease-fire process. This is  happening both de facto and de jure, since there exist  corresponding UN resolutions. That is, as you can see, when it  is obvious that the CSCE does not possess the ability to  influence one or another process, it steps aside, handing this  right over to whoever has the real ability. In this respect Mr.  Eliasson has a very clear position, more active: If Russia can  do it, let it happen, while we will send our observers.    [Martirosyan] Mr. Gilmore believes that the question of  bringing in the troops is not as simple as it may seem,  especially in such a protracted and bloody conflict as that of  Karabakh, and that it is unlikely to be a panacea. Besides, he  says it is a question of time, since numerous issues involving  the status and mandate of such a contingent must be  resolved--from their rights and duties to subordination and  financing. Meanwhile, there are many who do believe that without  a disengaging military contingent, resolution and observers  alone will not guarantee real compliance with the terms of  cease-fire. You have said earlier in this interview that you  support the priority of cease-fire and everything else should  come later. Does it mean that even this--provided that a  peacekeeping contingent does need to be brought in--now will be  delayed under the pretext of defining the status of the latter?    [Liparityan] Mr. Gilmore undoubtedly is correct when he  mentions the problems associated with the mandate. There are,  however, forms, accepted by the international community, when  this can be dispensed with. For instance, CSCE rules envisage an  option of bringing in third-country peacekeeping forces without  a special CSCE mandate. We do not see any particular problem in  whether these troops will have a CSCE or UN mandate (although of  course it would be good) or whether it would be a contingent  supplied by the third country. The main item is the scope of  their authority. This is what should be in the center of  discussion--not the formalities aimed at dragging out the  process.    [Martirosyan] Do you not think that Armenia's participation  in the negotiations' process contributed to a certain degree to  its even greater involvement in the conflict as a directly  interested party? In any case, this is the way it looks--on one  hand, we proclaim that we do not participate in the war and, on  the other, sit at the negotiations table. If the former is true,  why is Turkey, for instance, not sitting next to us, since they  have certain relations with Azerbaijan, or Russia for which this  role is more fitting as a legal successor to the USSR than the  role of a mere peace keeper? Perhaps if Armenia had not taken  upon itself originally the mission of representing Karabakh in  the negotiations process, the world community would have been  compelled to recognize Karabakh as an independent side in the  negotiations sooner, since they had to be conducted with someone.    [Liparityan] Armenia participates because its territory is  under attack. This is one aspect of our participation. And the  second is that we have a direct stake in the security of  Karabakh, which is populated by our kin. And finally, the  foremost reason for our participation was that at the time the  negotiation process began, Karabakh was not recognized by the  world community as a subject with an independent right to  participate in negotiations. So we had to undertake it. Armenian  officials, unlike the ones of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, had  the official right to represent Karabakh's interests, and simply  speak for it at official meetings at an international level in  various countries and organizations. Although of course one  could speak of some form of participation by Turkey as an  interested party as well. For us, however, what is important is  not formality but the work, its results. Now Karabakh  participates in this process. Now that this process has started,  our role should gradually diminish from that moment on.    [Martirosyan] Do you believe that as a result of  negotiations  we have come even a step closer to ending the war and that  something still needs to be changed in the world community's  approach to the Karabakh conflict in order to speed up its  resolution?    [Liparityan] In my opinion, I have already answered quite  fully the second part of the question. The international  community must apply a certain effort and pressure on Azerbaijan  to make it accept one of the options. And second--the  international community must combine its efforts. That is,  Russian and the CSCE must interact at least to make the former  happen--exert influence on Azerbaijan. After all, look, both we  and Karabakh are coming up with peace initiatives. Azerbaijan,  on the other hand, keeps coming up with delays. On the other  hand, it is obvious that its complex domestic situation does not  allow those healthy aspirations for peace--which probably do  exist there, but do not have the opportunity to manifest  themselves--to come through. In short, in order for the  peacekeeping process to proceed more actively, we need greater  activism by the world community. Everything that depends on us  we already do.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Brick mountain walls in builders: Andrew Taylor finds serious overcapacity among construction materials producers THE BRITISH construction industry, already reeling from the worst recession for more than half a century, is bracing itself for another round of company failures, plant closures and job losses. Overcapacity among contractors and building material producers is such that further cuts are inevitable, even if the recession were to end tomorrow. As it is, most forecasters expect construction demand to fall further next year - by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent - in spite of measures to encourage greater expenditure on building announced in the government Autumn Statement. Redundancies will consequently continue to rise in an industry that has already lost more than 400,000 jobs since summer 1989. According to Mr Howard Seymour, construction analyst for stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd: 'Even if construction demand were to stabilise at levels prevailing in 1986, which was a reasonably good year for output and sales, there would still be substantial overcapacity.' At the heart of the industry's troubles is the massive investment in new capacity made by companies in the late 1980s to meet booming demand for new buildings. Brick manufacturers are estimated to have spent more than Pounds 200m on new plant during the period, only to find that demand for their products shrank as housing and commercial property markets went into recession. Brick producers increased production capacity from 4.5bn bricks a year to 5bn between 1987 and 1989. Closures and mothballing of kilns have now reduced capacity to 3.7bn. Even so, sales of bricks this year will be less than 3bn, or 19 per cent less than kilns are capable of producing. The effect of such overcapacity has been a savage reduction in prices charged by building material producers and contractors. Mr Robert Napier, managing director of Redland, one of the country's biggest building materials producers, estimates that prices of concrete, bricks and tiles have fallen by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in the past 12 months. 'It is madness,' Mr Napier says. 'In south-east England we are virtually giving away valuable finite reserves of sand and gravel, at very little profit. 'The only way that prices can recover is if inefficient plants and producers are removed from the market, preferably through mergers and subsequent rationalisation.' That may be difficult to achieve in markets where there are many very small family-owned companies. They have no other business interests to fall back on, and therefore seek to increase volume when profits fall, thus putting even greater strain on prices. The only solution for larger companies may be to buy out small businesses or wait for them to fail. Meanwhile, annual sales of ready-mixed concrete, one of the most basic of building materials, have declined by almost a third since 1989 from 29.6m cu metres to 20m. Manufacturing capacity has been reduced by only about 2m cu metres during the period. The overheads of running a concrete-mixing plant, with its much lower use of energy, are small by comparison with a brick or cement works. The incentive to close a plant, which might mean losing an entire local market, is therefore much less. Profits on ready-mixed concrete have fallen to about Pounds 1 a tonne compared with Pounds 4 to Pounds 5 a tonne three years ago. Mr Napier says producers that lack their own supply of aggregates can only be selling at a loss. Road construction is one of the few areas of building and civil engineering to have withstood the recession. Sales of coated stone are holding at about 37 1/2 m tonnes a year. Unfortunately, blacktop manufacturing capacity has risen even faster than sales. In the Thames Valley alone there is estimated surplus capacity of at least 5m tonnes a year. Prices have plummeted, and most blacktop producers will be making a loss on sales, according to the industry. Steel producers have also suffered as construction demand has dwindled. More than 100 steel fabricators have ceased trading or gone into receivership since 1989, according to the British Constructional Steelwork Association. Numbers employed by the industry have fallen from 60,000 to 40,000. In spite of those reductions, capacity continues to outstrip demand. Almost 90,000 tonnes of construction steel is estimated to have been sold this year, compared with a potential manufacturing capacity of about 1.1m tonnes. The arithmetic is inescapable: building material producers must continue working on short time, or introduce extended closures over Christmas (as seems increasingly likely), or plants will have to be mothballed or closed permanently. Contractors face similar overcapacity. Competition for work is intense. Many contractors are winning work at a loss or bidding for work at prices that only just cover their overheads, according to Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, the industry's biggest trade association. The overriding need is to generate cash from progress payments to meet monthly bills and pay off borrowings, Sir Brian says. 'The construction industry faces a long haul before output reaches a level where the rise in unemployment will first be checked, and then reversed.'</p>

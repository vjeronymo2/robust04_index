Giving the statistics recently,  Dr. Benoit Karambire said that the high AIDS prevalence was due  to the area's proximity with Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burkina  Faso. According to Dr. Salimata Sissoko, who is in charge of  Sikasso Hospital's laboratory, about 10 percent of blood donors  had tested positive with HIV. Dr. Sissoko said Sikasso has  turned into a place where HIV-infected Malians living in  neighboring countries come to pass their last days. When the  infected widows of the exiles return home, they are generally  inherited by their brothers in law, thus propagating the disease  to worrying levels among the region's 1.5 million people.

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / China urged to cut inflation China is suffering from lack of monetary restraint, according to a top Chinese bank official. Mr Dai Xianglong, a deputy governor of the central bank, has blamed this for contributing to high inflation and has urged the government to curb excessive money supply growth. In the People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, he said M1 growth  - cash in circulation - had risen by 32 per cent in the first nine months of the year compared with last year. This exceeded a target of 20-25 per cent. Mr Dai's warning about the need to curb excessive money supply growth is part of a continuing public campaign by the People's Bank to reinforce the case for restraint. Mr Dai warned last month M2 monetary growth for the September quarter of 37.1 per cent was much too rapid and was fuelling inflation. This year's M2 target is 24 per cent. Consumer prices in China's 35 main cities rose by 27 per cent in the year to October. This compared with a rise of 27.5 per cent the month before. Mr Dai blamed unauthorised lending by non-state financial institutions for excessive monetary growth. The issuance of Yn500bn of corporate bonds in the first six months of the year had exacerbated the problem. Another factor was direct foreign investment, which had leapt by 55 per cent in the first eight months to Dollars 20.5bn (Pounds 12.5bn). Wages to state employees had jumped by 41.34 per cent in the year to October. Capital construction had continued to rocket ahead on the back of relatively easy credit. Mr Dai sharply criticised lax monitoring procedures by state banks which had failed to prevent loans for the upgrading of enterprises being diverted to real estate or stock trading. Close to Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice premier in charge of the economy, the top banker was also highly critical of a wages blowout. 'Some of these companies have lost control of wages and costs,' he said. Mr Dai called for a slowing of development and a reduction of funds devoted to fixed assets. 'The central government's share of GDP is too low, its share of tax revenue is too low, so it is unable to provide extra funds to state firms,' he said. China is seeking to calm an overheating economy without causing an abrupt slowdown which might add to unemployment. Chinese officials fear a 'hard landing' and have thus been selective in applying credit restrictions. Germany's Hoechst chemicals group has signed a contract to set up a Dollars 29m joint venture in Shanghai to make polyester products for the building industry.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] issued a statement  on 1 June refuting the UN Security Council [UNSC] president's  statement of unreasonable allegations of finding fault with us,  which was released a few days ago.    Press statement of a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry:    The UN Security Council, on May 30, according to a scenario  which had been worked out in advance by some member states,  published a statement of its president groundlessly finding  fault with us and containing the unreasonable claim that the  fuel rods must be replaced only in compliance with the practical  demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and  that the opportunity for selecting fuel rods for separation and  preservation might be lost.    It is entirely unjust for the UN Security Council to have  discussed our question without any justifiable reason on the  basis of the wrong judgment made by the Secretariat of the IAEA.  It was only a few days ago that negotiations on the replacement  of fuel rods of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station  were held between us and the agency.    The main question discussed at the negotiations was the  preservation of technical possibilities of future measurement of  replaced fuel rods and, in particular, there was sufficient  debate on the reasonableness of the method we are applying at  present.    The agency side, too, said it would seriously study our  method and the two sides agreed to continue to discuss it in  future negotiations.    And it was confirmed that none of the fuel rods being  replaced were diverted for other purposes and, practically, that  the whole course of the current replacement of fuel rods is  going on in the presence of agency inspectors and under strict  control of inspection equipment.    By the way, what justification on earth does the UN Security  Council have to put our question on its agenda and discuss it  now.    If things were to take a correct track, the UN Security  Council should have called, not us, but some quarters of the  agency secretariat, into question.    Before starting to replace fuel rods, on several occasions,  we requested that the agency take necessary measures such as its  presence and the removal of the seals. But it did not send a  team of inspectors to the end, when the replacement of fuel rods  began, thus openly neglecting its duty as an international  organization. This was what some quarters of the IAEA  Secretariat did.    Even when we allowed "an additional inspection" which  alluded  to "an inspection left incomplete," they shunned it, thus  intentionally ignoring the statement of the president of the UN  Security Council dated March 31.    It was also the agency's Secretariat that distorted the fact  by talking as if the negotiations had broken down and hurriedly  referred our problem to the UN Security Council without a clear  explanation, categorically denying our method even before the  negotiating delegation of the agency, which had promised to  study the method, arrived at the head office in Vienna.    In all, such an act by the Secretariat of the IAEA was aimed  at capping us ultimately with the title of culprit [pigo] by  justifying their past behavior in concocting, by any means,  "inconsistency" against us on the basis of fabricated  information.    It is only too natural that our country, which has engaged  itself only in peaceful nuclear activities as a dignified,  independent, sovereign state, will not yield to such  unreasonable act of the agency's Secretariat and allow itself to  be treated as an offender [choein].    In view of this, the UN Security Council, instead of finding  fault with us, should have taken issue with some officials of  the IAEA Secretariat who laid hurdles in the way of our peaceful  nuclear activities, framed sinister political intrigue to shift  the blame on to us and referred the problem to the UN.    It is also self-contradictory that the presidential  statement  of the UN Security Council unreasonably urged us to allow  selected separation and preservation of fuel rods and  preservation of the possibility of future measurement.    Since we are in a unique status after the temporary  suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it is clear that we cannot  accept such routine and ad hoc inspection as the selected  preservation of fuel rods. A full understanding of this was  reached at the recent negotiations with the agency.    Although we are replacing the fuel rods in a unique status,  we are doing the utmost to show the transparency of our nuclear  activities.    The replacement of fuel rods is taking place in such a way  as  to fully preserve the technical possibility of measuring the  fuel rods in the future as requested by the agency when our  unique status comes to an end.    This is the most scientific and realistic method invented by  our scientists and facility operators with a high sense of  cooperation, motivated by their consistent position to show the  uprightness of the nuclear activities. Its feasibility has  already been proven fully through experiments.    If this method of our style is applied, it will be possible  to reproduce the channel and order of any fuel rods and measure  them correctly in the future.    At the recent negotiations in Pyongyang, we gave the IAEA  side a full explanation of our-style method concerning the  replacement of fuel rods and suggested with a good intention  that negotiations should be held any time if there were any more  questions to be discussed.    There have been attempts these days to create the "urgency"  of the situation by alleging that the pace of the replacement of  fuel rods is too fast. Since it is part of the pure peaceful  nuclear activities and technical possibilities for ensuring the  continuity of safeguards and measuring fuel rods in the future  are fully guaranteed, there is no ground for finding fault with  the speed of replacing fuel rods.    It was necessary to test the maximum efficiency of the  refueling machine that our replacement of fuel rods progressed  at a rather fast speed some time ago. This was also a normal  course of the peaceful nuclear activities. So, this is hardly a  matter for surprise.    Such being the case, at a time when everything is  progressing  smoothly on a normal track, the UN Security Council discussed  the biased report submitted by some officials of the Secretariat  of the agency without any examination and hurriedly adopted a  presidential statement. It is hardly understandable.    This was because they were too dull to sense the reality or  they were affected by some sinister political background.    If the UN Security Council, for this matter, is  disgracefully  charged with being manipulated by some specified member nations  while ignoring its noble mission to be responsible for world  peace and security, it will be a shame to history.    Originally, the basis for the existence of an international  organization is impartiality.    If the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council, bereft  of impartiality, continue to insist on pressure with an  unreasonable attitude, we will not feel any need to be  restricted by such pressure, either.    It is intolerable that we have suffered from big obstacles  in  our peaceful nuclear activities, restricted by the unilateral  demand of the IAEA. In case pressure is put on us again, we  will no longer fall victim to the unreasonable demand but will  have to go our own way, unhindered by anything.    This is our firm will, who regard independence as our life  and blood.    If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the  technical possibilities of the future measurement of fuel rods  are gone or the UN Security Council puts pressure on us, talking  about sanctions under that pretext, we cannot but take the  course of taking decisive countermeasures, freeing ourselves  from such unreasonable restrictions rather than suffering from  them, and we will be left with no other choice but to go over to  the continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. We  will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the intention to  solve the issue in a fair way and resolve it in a peaceful way  through dialogue. But we will counter without slightest  compromise even the slightest intention to ignore our  sovereignty by unjustifiably putting pressure on us.</p>

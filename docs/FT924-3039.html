			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK, China resume HK talks BRITAIN and China yesterday began three days of talks on the future of Hong Kong and devoted the first session to a recitation of known positions about proposals made by Governor Chris Patten for more democracy in the colony. China urged Britain to withdraw the governor's proposals and abide by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law - the mini-constitution drafted by Beijing for Hong Kong when it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Mr Tony Galsworthy, Britain's representative, again offered China talks on the proposals which envisage a broadening of the franchise in elections due in 1995. The latest round of talks is the 25th to be held by the Joint Liaison Group which was set up, in accordance with the Joint Declaration, to oversee orderly transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China. British officials do not expect much progress to be made this week. Mr Patten's proposals initially won widespread support in Hong Kong. That support, however, has weakened in the face of a concerted campaign by China to discredit the governor, and local concerns about Mr Patten's style of leadership. Yesterday's Economic Journal, Hong Kong's leading financial daily, carried an editorial that was very critical of the governor's style. George Graham adds from Washington: US President-elect Bill Clinton said yesterday he was 'very concerned' about the mounting tension between China and the UK over the future of Hong Kong, and hoped the US could play a 'very constructive role in relieving those tensions.' 'I think it is clear from the activities in China in the last few years that the Chinese desperately want to maintain the economic engine of Hong Kong. I hope they understand they really can't maintain it unless they also maintain a large range of personal freedom, liberty and human rights,' he told a meeting of media executives in Washington yesterday. Mr Clinton, who during his election campaign criticised President George Bush for taking too gentle an attitude to Chinese human rights abuses, said he might want to say more on the subject after he enters the White House.</p>

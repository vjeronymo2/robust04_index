			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "rk"] </F>   [Text] The latest public opinion survey carried out by the  FOCUS agency in May 1994 produced some interesting results  regarding the more detailed and specific aspects of individual  political entities and personalities.    While the list of trustworthy politicians is still topped by  the "evergreens" (Michal Kovac, Jozef Moravcik, and Vladimir  Meciar), it is interesting that precisely Michal Kovac and Jozef  Moravcik, as well as Brigita Schmognerova, have become  acceptable to broader sections of the population. It is  precisely the acceptability of the sympathizers of parties other  than his own that markedly distinguishes the present prime  minister from his predecessor (sympathizers of the Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] make up 74 percent of those who  trust Vladimir Meciar, while Democratic Union [DU] voters  represent only about 20 percent of those who trust Jozef  Moravcik). Similarly, whereas the popularity of Peter Weiss  within the ranks of his own party is declining, he is becoming  more acceptable to the supporters of other parties. According to  the FOCUS survey, of all party leaders, Ludovit Cernak, Jan  Slota, and Peter Hagyari enjoy the least sympathies in their own  parties.    The FOCUS survey was also aimed at ascertaining shifts in  the  voters' base since the 1992 elections. The slightest shift has  been ascertained among Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] voters--56 percent of those  who had voted for these two parties in 1992 would also vote for  them in 1994. Approximately half of the original voters have  remained loyal to the HZDS and the Democratic Party [DS] (which  ran in the 1992 elections as the DS-Civic Democratic Party of  Slovakia), while 40 percent of those who had voted for the Civic  Democratic Union [ODU] in 1992 would today vote for DU. Another  interesting finding concerns the structure of supporters of  individual political parties. Men, citizens with only basic  education, and citizens over 55 slightly prevail among HZDS  supporters. Citizens working in the private sector are  underrepresented among them. As much as 92 percent of HZDS  supporters are determined to participate in the elections. If  they were to choose a second party, HZDS supporters would opt  for the Slovak National Party [SNS] and the Association of  Workers of Slovakia [ZRS], while they feel an aversion for the  KDH. The typical SDL voter is over 45 or 55, and citizens  without religious affiliation are overrepresented among them. A  total of 90 percent of SDL voters are determined to participate  in the elections. Other parties acceptable to SDL supporters  are the ZRS and the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS],  while they have an aversion to the HZDS and the KDH. The most  typical KDH supporters are over 55 or 60, with only basic  education. Some 88 percent of them are Catholics, and 91  percent would participate in the elections if they were held  today. As other acceptable parties, KDH supporters name, above  all, DU and the DS. They have an aversion to the HZDS, while  their aversion to the SDL is declining. DU would be voted for by  a disproportionate number of women and citizens under age 44.  Supporters with university education are also overrepresented  among them. Sympathies for DU grow with the size of the  community of residence. If they were to cast a second vote, DU  voters would give it to the National Democratic Party [NDS] or  the KDH, while they feel aversion for the HZDS.    When asked about their motives to vote for a particular  party, respondents cited four reasons predominantly: sympathy  and trust, the assertion of group interests, the political  parties' programs, and the political parties' personalities.  The following motives are important for the supporters of  individual political entities: sympathy and personalities for  HZDS supporters, Christian character of the movement and  sympathy for KDH supporters, the assertion of workers' interests  and social emphasis in the party program for ZRS supporters, and  sympathy and personalities for DU supporters (the personality of  Jozef Moravcik is an even bigger motive for DU supporters than  the personality of Vladimir Meciar is for HZDS supporters).</p>

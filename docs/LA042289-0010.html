			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW OFFICIALS TO HEAD PROBE OF TBILISI CLASH  </P> <P> Prosecutors from Moscow will head a criminal investigation of a clash between  nationalist demonstrators and troops in Tbilisi, capital of the Soviet republic  of Georgia, on April 9 in which 20 civilians died, Tass said Friday.  </P> <P> The announcement, made in a report of a meeting of the Politburo, followed  accusations that Soviet authorities attempted a cover-up of the incident,  particularly over the alleged use by troops of poison gas.  </P> <P> "Bodies of the Prosecutor's Office of the Soviet Union will be in charge of  investigating the criminal case which has been instituted over the events in  Tbilisi," the official Soviet news agency said.  </P> <P> This was "to ensure the objectivity and thoroughness of the investigation in  accordance with the law and to provide information systematically to the  population," it said.  </P> <P> Tass said the Politburo, at its regular meeting on Thursday, also urged the  Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party to investigate the causes of  the events the clash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.N. Investigation Sought  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Washington, Soviet dissident Eduard Gudava asked President Bush  to request a U.N. investigation of the incident.  </P> <P> Gudava, founder of the Helsinki Watch group in Georgia, said that far more were  killed and wounded by Soviet troops during the demonstration than the 20 dead  and more than 200 injured reported by the Soviet government.  </P> <P> The State Department has not commented on the incident.  </P> <P> Official accounts have maintained that troops sent in to break up an all-night  vigil by thousands of people in front of the government building in Tbilisi  used maximum restraint and only responded when under attack.  </P> <P> However, Soviet newspapers have charged that troops used poison gas against the  demonstrators, and a clandestine video film of the events, shown to journalists  in Moscow on Friday, appeared to show troops attacking without provocation.  </P> <P> Sixteen people were killed when the troops, supported by tanks, moved in and  another four people subsequently died of their injuries.  </P> <P> Soviet television said 92 patients are still hospitalized.  </P> <P> Georgian film maker Eldar Shengelaya told journalists at the showing of the  video that he believed Moscow must have given the go-ahead to send in the  troops.  </P> <P> "The decision must have come from higher up, although it's not clear where it  came from," he said. "Members of the (national party's) Central Committee  cannot but have known about it."  </P> <P> Shengelaya and other speakers at the meeting accused the authorities of  attempting a massive cover-up of the Tbilisi incident.  </P></p>

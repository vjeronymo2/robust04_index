			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Devenish purchase helps Greenalls improve to Pounds 29m Last year's acquisition of Devenish helped Greenalls Group, the pubs, drinks and hotel operator, to a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 29m in the six months to March 25, or 28 per cent before exceptionals. Mr Peter Greenall, managing director, said 'not only have we delivered synergies from the acquisition, but trading is above our expectations'. Beer volume through the enlarged pub estate was down 4.8 per cent. However, margins were helped by the renegotiation of brewing supply contracts, some of which took effect within the half year. Profits from pubs, including the effect of the acquisition, were up 47 per cent at Pounds 32.7m. Profits from the Premier House range of pub restaurants, which Greenalls plans as its main target for capital investment, were up 73 per cent at Pounds 6m while those from UK hotels, the chief investment target in recent years, were up 15 per cent at Pounds 8m. Off-licence profits were down 11 per cent at Pounds 2m, as a result of competition from supermarkets and cross-channel imports. However, off-licence turnover had risen by 3 per cent since Christmas. Profits from drinks and leisure were down 5 per cent at Pounds 2.4m. On group sales up 21 per cent at Pounds 337m, operating profits rose 39 per cent to Pounds 49.1m. Interest charges rose sharply to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 9.6m). There were exceptional charges of Pounds 3.8m, consisting mainly of Pounds 3.2m reorganisation costs in the drinks and leisure division, involving 60 redundancies. Earnings per share were up 3.6 per cent at 11.66p before exceptional items and property profits, and down 7.8 per cent at 10.43p after them. The interim dividend is raised 5 per cent to 5.334p. Greenalls' shares closed 13p lower at 462p. COMMENT The market found these results slightly opaque, due to lack of information on the Devenish contribution and uncertainty on the real progress in hotels. In addition, the cash outflow of Pounds 45m in the half is slightly unsettling. However, the pre-Devenish performance is claimed by the company to be broadly represented by the 3.6 per cent rise in earnings per share. In addition, the cash outflow should fall next year as investment on hotels passes its peak. Assuming perhaps Pounds 84m pre-tax this year, the shares are on some 15 times earnings. While this does not seem unduly expensive, there is a discount due to uncertainty in a period of transition.</p>

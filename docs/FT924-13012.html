			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Week in the Markets: Columbus Day setback for gold likened by one consultant this week to a fighter pilot's 'hours and hours of sheer boredom peppered with a few moments of stark terror' - has moved down a notch. Most of the week's fall of Dollars 8.40 a troy ounce came on Monday when European speculators chose the US Columbus Day holiday to drive the price down Dollars 5.05 to Dollars 345.80 - hardly dramatic, but certainly worthy enough to stifle a few yawns. New York's Comex was open on Monday but it was thinly manned and European sales were not matched by US buying in the afternoon. 'The US speculators followed the movement in the physical market for a change,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, yesterday. Gold's trading range is now well below the Dollars 348 to Dollars 352 level of the past few weeks. The market closed at Dollars 342.45 yesterday, well below the 200-day average price of Dollars 345.50, which has bearish implications to traders who follow chart trends. South African and Australian producers managed to catch the market as it came down, locking in prices at R1,000 and ADollars 480, Mr Smith said. Fears of further producer selling are likely to keep the lid firmly on the price. This week's fall is partly a reaction to the market's failure to move above Dollars 352, some analysts suggest. The pace of the fall was accelerated as funds cut their losses once Dollars 348 was breached. Analysts suggest further falls are on the cards, especially as Thursday saw some heavy selling from the Middle East. It is worth noting that platinum has held up well this week, closing at Dollars 357.35, up Dollars 1.35 from last week when it was trading at a premium of just over Dollars 5 to gold. On the London Metal Exchange the rate of fall in base metals prices has slowed, although nickel and tin have been continuing headlong on the downward path. LME warehouse stocks of nickel rose by 1,440 tonnes on Monday and by 1,878 tonnes on Thursday, taking the total to a record 52,728 tonnes. A year ago stocks were 8,604 tonnes and two years ago just 3,240 tonnes. Most of the nickel pouring into LME warehouses is thought to come from Russia, which is itself beginning to suffer from the depressed market. On Tuesday Mr Nickolai Abramov, vice-general director of Norilsk, the world's largest producer, said low prices and weak demand had forced the group to cut production by 15 per cent from last year's level. Further cuts were planned next year if demand did not pick up, he told the International Nickel Study Group in the Hague. The market was not impressed. 'Production cuts are all very well, but nickel is still pouring out of Russia,' said one analyst. Mr Abramov admitted that the country had a serious problem with the 'grey market' and urged his government to adopt a strong policy to stop the leakage of nickel, copper and cobalt. No other western producer has announced production curbs to follow Inco's cut last week, although Cominco said it had postponed a planned fourth-quarter production increase at its Glenbrook smelter. Inco said this week that it was likely to lay off between 500 and 1,000 workers in Canada in the next two years. Cash nickel closed at Dollars 6,180 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 435 on the week. Tin has fallen below Dollars 6,000 a tonne this week, touching the lowest levels for five months on the back of heavy selling, some from China. Cash tin closed yesterday at Dollars 5,955, down Dollars 290 on the week. Memories of the zinc squeeze are beginning to fade as fundamental news takes its proper place on the LME. However, according to Reuters news agency, technical tightness is developing in the new aluminium alloy contract, centred on January 6, the first tradeable cash date. This is partly because a grey market has been trading since June, and there is some concern that warehouse stocks might be low when cash trading begins. News late on Wednesday that Cote d'Ivoire had banned all purchases of its mid-crop and sub-grade cocoa for the 1992-93 season pushed nearby prices on London Fox up by more than Pounds 30 a tonne on Thursday morning. However, by the close the market had settled back on perceptions that smuggling and other measures would lessen the effect on Ivorian sales. The March contract closed yesterday at Pounds 679, down Pounds 8 on the week.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium      +7,600  to  1,389,725 Copper         +1,975  to  302,450 Lead           +1,200  to  177,950 Nickel         +1,878  to  52,728 Zinc           +2,250  to  376,500 Tin            -45     to  14,835  --------------------------------------</p>

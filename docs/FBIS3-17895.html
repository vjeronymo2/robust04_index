"In order to cut the funds for defense factories, the  government-approved state defense contracts would have to be  revised," he said.    Kokoshin said that the Defense Ministry needed nearly Rbs 28  trillion for purchases of military hardware in 1994 while the  Finance Ministry was prepared to allocate one fifth of that  amount.    He said that the Defense Ministry would press for its needs,  in particular through the State Duma. He added that the  ministry "had appropriate instructions on this score from the  president and the prime minister."    Kokoshin listed numerous reasons for the shortage of funds  in  his ministry, notably slow restructuring of Russian industry,  the need for it to maintain a large social role for its  employees and low demand for the civilian production of  converted defense factories. He said that defense production  proper accounted for as little as 20 percent of the defense  industry's output and there were no customers for the remaining  80 percent. "For this reason aircraft, ships, locomotives so  needed by the railroad ministry and tank-trucks are  stockpiling," he emphasized.</p>

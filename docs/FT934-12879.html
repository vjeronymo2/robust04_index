			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / CIA labels Aristide a murderer PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has sprung to the defence of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled Haitian president, after a Central Intelligence Agency assessment described him as a mentally unstable murderer, writes George Graham. Mr Clinton said the evidence from Mr Aristide's brief spell as Haiti's president before he was forced out in 1991 by a military coup tended to undermine those reports. 'During the time he served as president, political terrorism and abuses went down in Haiti, not up,' Mr Clinton said. In an assessment that has been seized on by the right wing, a CIA analyst told members of Congress last week that Mr Aristide had ordered the murder of an opponent and spurred mob violence, and cited medical evidence that he suffered from manic depression. Mr Aristide has denied the allegations, and has countered with charges that the military leaders who now control the country are involved in drug trafficking. The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has been placed in the embarrassing position of having to discredit its own intelligence analysts.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Russia puts a price on ultimate MiG flight of fancy HAS THE child within you always hankered after being a fighter pilot? In one of the most bizarre instances yet of Russia's appetite for foreign currency, tourists are to be allowed to fly supersonic sorties over Moscow in Russian warplanes - at a price. While strafing the Russian capital will not normally form part of the deal, anyone with at least Dollars 5,895 (Pounds 3,900) to spare can choose from a range of packages that will put them at the controls of jet fighters including the MiG 29 over Russia at speeds of up to 2 1/2 times the speed of sound. The more expensive packages, such as the Dollars 13,845 Military Adventure Programme, include add-ons such as the opportunity to operate and fire a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and a T80 turbine-powered tank on a St Petersburg firing range. At the top of the range is the Dollars 45,000 Ultimate Flight Programme, in which the tourist and their partner are trained in aerial combat. The programme ends with a dogfight, the winner receiving a silver-plated 'Top Gun' helmet signed by all the MiG test pilots at Zhukovsky air base. The packages are being offered to western tourists through a newly formed company called MiGs Etc, based in Sarasota, Florida. Its founder is 30-year-old Mr Kent Ertugrul, a flying enthusiast until recently in the computer software business. The first national newspaper advertisements for the trips began to appear last week. Since then, MiGs Etc says, its telephones have not stopped ringing.' Mr Ertugrul said he had the idea during a visit to Moscow when he found that the Russians had been selling military flights to the public on a small scale for a year or more. He took a flight in a MiG 29, considered the experience 'indescribable', and immediately started negotiations to sell the flights abroad. Mr Ertugrul believes there is a large market for the tours in the US, Europe and Japan. Mr Ertugrul emphasises that tourists will be accompanied by top Russian test pilots and will fly well within the performance capability of the aircraft. Even so, the MiGs Etc brochure says participants will be required to sign a form releasing MiGs Etc from any liability for death or injury. As for flight safety: 'Although we doubt you will ever need it, you will be given detailed instructions on using the ejection seat.' Yeltsin takes power from local councils, Page 3</p>

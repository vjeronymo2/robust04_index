			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMERGENCY HELICOPTERS  </P> <P> Your Aug. 1 editorial, "Helicopters to Nowhere," cited some valid points.  Purchase of a dedicated emergency response helicopter is not a panacea for an  ailing Los Angeles County trauma network.  </P> <P> However, a helicopter may be a desirable component of a well thought-out trauma  response system. And therein lies the distinction. Such a helicopter would  hardly solve the transportation problems in an area such as the Hollywood  Hills. But in the San Gabriel Valley, which has been left bereft of trauma  facility coverage since the withdrawal of Queen of the Valley and Whittier  Presbyterian hospitals from the trauma network, such a transportation  alternative could make the difference, in certain instances, between life and  death or, with some patients, being able to make a full recovery and continued  reliance on life-support therapy.  </P> <P> We urge state lawmakers to recognize the crisis in health-care funding at the  county level, and to adjust their priorities and act swiftly and responsibly to  provide needed funding for health care.  </P> <P> DAVID CHERNOF, MD  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Medical Assn.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 4/4/1994 -- "Belgium supports  Romanian efforts to integrate within European structures and on  the other hand appreciates especially the constructive attitude  of Romania towards the pact of stability in Europe in the  prospect of the Paris conference of 26-27 May," (the official  launching of that initiative) stated to a Romanian press  correspondent in Brussels the Belgian deputy premier and foreign  minister Willy Claes.    In a statement made after his departure to Sofia and  Bucharest where he is expected to pay formal visits over 6-9  April, the Brussels head of diplomacy stressed that "Belgium  follows attentively the process of reform and privatisation in  Romania."    In a gesture "with a symbol value for the joint cultural  values of our united Europe" and as an undeniable illustration  of the special friendly character of the visit, Willy Claes, who  is also a talented musician, will conduct a concert of the  Romanian radio symphonic orchestra.    Belgian and Romanian sources in Brussels are noting among  other things "the double character of the visit, the bilateral  and the European one," as well as its "considerable" duration,  taking into account the busy schedule of the Belgian deputy  premier who is also the acting president of the Ministerial  Committee of the Council of Europe.    According to the same sources, Belgium "is aware of the  economic and social difficulties implied by the Romanian  transition, but it is determined to reassert -- through its head  of diplomacy -- its support, as to its possibilities, for a  democratic and European Romania."</p>

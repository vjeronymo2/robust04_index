			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): Turn on, tune in, and marvel with Motson - Britain's TV audience is being served a World Cup mixture of thrills and banality / Soccer There comes a turning-point in every World Cup when events on the pitch take on extra significance. It usually happens after the opening salvoes have been fired. We have been introduced to the dramatis personae; we have acclimatised to sleepless nights; and we have begun to bond with the hapless addicts at the other end of the office who also remember that Bolivian back-heel which led to their third corner of the match. At this transcendent moment, people who spent the first days of the campaign rubbishing soccer find they have run out of cliches and quips, and start to take an interest, for even they understand that what they are watching is powerful drama. That moment has arrived early in this splendid tournament, with Thursday's Italian victory over the charmless Norwegians. The combination of a rash piece of goalkeeping and a truly courageous piece of management by Arrigo Sacchi brought us the first unforgettable icon of USA 94: the utterly bewildered face of Italy's Roberto Baggio as he trudged off to be substituted by Luca Marchegiani. You had to be there - in front of a television screen, that is - to lip-read Baggio's distress: 'E impazzito?' ('Has he gone mad?'). Sacchi stood firm. Off went the cherubic Baggio, up went the voice of BBC commentator John Motson, and suddenly we knew we were in a World Cup. These are the games, high in melodrama, low in pure footballing skill, which make great television. For the truth is that the various pundits assembled to provide viewers in Britain with 'expert' analysis are proving as sadly inadequate as ever. Reaching a new nadir of banality, John Fashanu, who plays for Wimbledon in the English Premier league and is commentating for ITV, revealed plenty about his conception of the game during the closing stages of Sweden vs Cameroon. 'In the last couple of minutes', said Fash, 'we have had two substitutions; both of them are 6ft 2in, so neither side obviously wants to settle for a draw.' Tell that to the 'Norwegian Everests' (La Gazzetta dello Sport). Norway are one of the tallest sides in the competition, but have so far displayed little desire to wander into their opponents' half. For the most part, comments on strategy and technique have been conspicuous by their absence from British screens. Tactics? Who needs them when you have Ron Atkinson, manager of Aston Villa, around? Ron, never one to lose himself in theory, has become a master of psycho-football, the game that is played entirely in the head. Halfway through Germany vs Spain, he could bear it no longer: 'You also  - I don't know if it's my imagination - get the impression about that mental thing . . .' - this in response to the hitherto impressive Spanish side having had a quiet five minutes. 'That mental thing' is pundit-shorthand for letting us know that every side from south of the Alps - or Texas, for that matter - contains far too many feckless fanny merchants who would prefer to be in mid-siesta than in midfield where they might be called on to turn over a bunch of strapping Teutons. On came Germany's Rudi Voeller, the 'old fox', in what was 'a psychological substitution'. Like a work of 18th century empirical philosophy, all was in the mind now. 'You get the impression that all the belief is with the Germans' - a quasi-theological pearl that warned us what to expect. The Spanish dominated the rest of the game and Germany played their poorest football of the tournament. The team with the most legitimate claim to experiencing unbearable mental pressure have provided the saddest story of the week. Colombia had to pull their mid-field player Gabriel Gomez out of their match against the US at the last minute after he had received death threats against his family. On the field, the Colombians looked ever more ineffectual as they ran their pretty triangles into the thumping tackles of Alexi Lalas and Marcelo Balboa. As they left the field at half-time, the Colombians would have seen a scoreboard which read: 'Escobar, own goal', which probably told them more than they needed to know about their homeland. Lalas and Balboa (wasn't that Rocky's surname?) looked stronger and stronger as the match went on. Lalas, variously referred to as 'the rock-and-roller', 'the gypsy' and 'Catweazle', looks one of the best defenders in the world on current form - smart money sees him in the Premier league next season - while Balboa came within an inch of scoring the goal of this or any World Cup with a stupendous overhead kick. At the other end, goalkeeper Tony Meola, who wants to be an actor, glanced at the TV camera behind the goal and crossed himself in mock incredulity. The Americans, having seen their basketball championship settled on Thursday, can now turn their attention to the less serious business of watching their soccer players knock the stuffing out of some of the world's greatest teams. Through a combination of Wimbledon, short-sightedness and long, bitter memories, we were denied the opportunity of watching live what was surely one of the biggest stories of the first World Cup week - the extraordinary return of Argentina's Diego Armando Maradona, perhaps the only man, along with Pele of Brazil, to have earned the right to be called a football genius. This mere fact was not enough to sway Britain's terrestrial TV channels, which had already decided that an ageing, overweight cheat with a drug problem could not possibly play a decisive role in such a wholesome sporting event. They should think again. Maradona's body is so battered that he is literally frightened to shoot, in case the force required causes him serious injury. But against Greece, he saw an opening and could not resist it. Curled into the top corner, it was the most precisely-hit shot of the week. Maradona's sprint to the camera and Munch-like scream into the lens let out four years of fury and resentment. BBC link-man Bob Wilson found it unsavoury. Maradona himself, watching a playback, thought it was 'very beautiful'. Surrounded by loyal lieutenants who can move the ball with bewitching speed, and looking significantly fitter than he did in Italy four years ago, Maradona is set to have a final fling with the talent which stubbornly refuses to desert him. He has already won a World Cup single-handed, but will not rest on the memory. It's that mental thing.</p>

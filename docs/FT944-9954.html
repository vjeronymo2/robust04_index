			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: Gold rush fever as lottery launched - Queues are forming for a share of the expected windfall On Monday the tickets go on sale for the National Lottery, and by next Saturday the nation will be welcoming a new millionaire. It will be another four months, however, before the other certain beneficiaries of the lottery, the nation's arts companies, collect their windfalls. Although the Arts Council, which is processing the applications for the extra funding that the lottery provides, receives its first first weekly cheque from Camelot, the organisers, on Tuesday November 22, it does not expect to pass on any money until April. In the meantime the accumulating pool, which should average Pounds 250m a year for the arts during the seven years of Camelot's contract, will be adding millions in tax free interest. Jeremy Newton, lottery director at the council, has chosen a steady-as-she-goes approach. Although there has been pilot research and dry runs, the council is not sending out guidelines to prospective applicants until the end of the month. It expects the first completed proposals to arrive by January 4. Then the assessments will begin, with the first successful companies hearing the good news at the end of March, with more approvals announced monthly. The lottery will transform the arts in the UK. The anticipated sum to be given away each year comfortably exceeds the combined annual grants of the Arts Councils of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is a gormless arts organisation, professional or amateur, that is not considering a pitch. Crafts people, and film and video makers, as long as they combine into a group, can also apply. The Arts Council has interpreted the original government directives as loosely as possible to make things easier for companies. There is still an element of matching funding, but nowhere near the original 50/50. An arts company seeking Pounds 100,000 or more from the lottery must raise a quarter of the sum requested through its own efforts - from friends, from business, from fund raising events, from local authorities. Anyone seeking less than Pounds 100,000 need only find 10 per cent, and for very small companies the council hopes to be even more reasonable. No one knows how many applications there will be, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. Up to three quarters are expected to be for sums of less than Pounds 100,000. To begin with the money is likely to be given to existing small and medium sized arts companies, with good track records and obvious expansion needs. Once these easy options have been taken care of the Arts Council will turn its attention to the delicate matter of new, mainly amateur, arts companies, and the big boys. Jeremy Newton does not expect to hand out more than Pounds 10m on any one project. But the Royal Opera House, which is seeking around Pounds 50m from the lottery for its rebuilding programme, need not be too down-hearted. The council could give Pounds 10m for the first phase of a development and another Pounds 10m for a second. There is also an acceptance that the really major claimants, those seeking Pounds 40m plus, like the South Bank Centre, the British Museum, the new Tate Gallery of Modern Art, Cardiff Bay Opera House, etc, can apply to more than one lottery source, in particular the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Millennium Fund. Personnel will be in place to handle joint, or manifold, applications. The council has also moved slightly over the vexed matter of what the money can be used for - but only slightly. It is basically to go on capital projects - on converting a disused church, or an empty cinema, into a theatre or community arts centre etc. Wisely, it is reluctant to attract the government's wrath by giving lottery cash to clear overdrafts. Perhaps for brand new ventures there might be a small revenue endowment to tide an organisation over before it starts to earn cash. But it would be madness to blur the issue: annual funding must remain the responsibility of the Arts Council, paid for by its grant from the government. If it started to help out the current plight of clients with lottery cash the government would quickly seize the opportunity to cut the annual subsidy. And any arts organisation getting lottery money to improve its facilities should soon benefit in revenue terms by attracting larger audiences. The annual council grant is in enough danger as it is. The cabinet met on Tuesday to decide budgets for 1995-96. Last year the English Arts Council had its grant cut by for the first time, by Pounds 3.2m, and it has been promised an increase of only Pounds 900,000, to Pounds 186m, for next year. It is campaigning for the restoration of the Pounds 3.2m, plus an inflation increase. The reputation of the new heritage secretary, Stephen Dorrell, will rest on his success in bringing home the bacon. To date he has kept a low profile. The rising groundswell about this aloofness will disappear if he can achieve more money for his department on budget day - and give some of it to the arts. There is a real danger that the government thinks it has pacified the arts world with the lottery: but there is little point in promising cake tomorrow if some arts organisations have starved to death in the meantime.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian participants in the CIS consultative bodies  for cooperation in different spheres of the economy decided at  their meeting today that a coordinating-consultative council  must be created under the Russian Ministry for Cooperation with  the CIS states.    This council will implement the economic strategy of Russia  towards the CIS states.    The council will be headed by Russian Minister for  Cooperation with the CIS Vladimir Mashschits. It will also  include representatives of the Central Bank of Russia, the  Customs Committee, the CIS Inter-State Bank currently being  established, other CIS bodies and the directors of the Russian  big state and private companies.    The council will concentrate on assistance to the CIS  transnational financial and industrial structures and on  coordination of activities of Russian departments in these  spheres.    The council was given the right to submit its proposals and  recommendations on implementation of the treaty on establishment  of the Economic Union to the government. The appropriate  agreement was signed in September, 1993.    Deputy Minister for Cooperation Marat Khusnutdinov said the  main problem for the CIS states was that on non-payments. The  debt of the neighboring countries to Russia for the delivery of  energy supplies is 2.5 trillion rubles.    The first meeting of the new council planned for June will  focus on possible establishment of a payment union, conversion  of all CIS currencies, development of border trade and  simplification of the customs procedures.</p>

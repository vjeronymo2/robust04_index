			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 6 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela has  enacted a public service act, paving the way for a new civil  service to replace that of the former central, homeland and  self-governing territories' governments.    Minister of Public Service and Administration Zola Skweyiya  said on Monday [6 June] the act would replace the Public Service  Employment Acts of all previous government entities.    "It makes provision for 32 national departments and  organisational components and nine provincial administrations.  It will now be possible to rationalise the administrative  structures of the former public services into these new  structures. It also paves the way for the establishment of  uniform terms and conditions of employment for all public  servants. This has been a bone of contention in a number of  regions. I wish to emphasise that more work needs to be done  before the implementation of uniformity in the terms and  conditions of employment can be finalised. This process will,  however, be expedited," Dr Skweyiya said in a statement.    He said the act was an important step in the rationalisation  of the public service. "Various government institutions are in  the process of urgently finalising their planning with the view  to implementing further rationalisation actions. Obviously all  relevant role players will be consulted in this process.    "I sincerely regard the public service as one of the most  important elements of the state. The government cannot develop  the country and build the nation without an efficient public  service and for this reason the government is committed to  establish the best possible public service for South Africa and  one which will be accepted by the community at large," Dr  Skweyiya said.</p>

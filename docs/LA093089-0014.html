			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEADLINE FAILED MORE THAN THE BRUINS DID  </P> <P> The sports headline, "UCLA Fails," is a disservice to players and coaches of  UCLA. I wish to congratulate the team for one of the most exciting games in  memory. Perhaps for some only winning counts, but the American tradition of  sports is not whether you win or lose but how you played the game.  </P> <P> JACK PARRY, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

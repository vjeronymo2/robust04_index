			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Wholesale prices edge upward Western German wholesale prices climbed 0.5 per cent in May from April and rose 1.1 per cent from April 1993, the federal statistics office said yesterday. Most economists had expected a month-on-month rise of only 0.2 per cent and a year-on-year increase of 0.7 per cent. The May figures also represent an acceleration from the previous two months. In April, the index for wholesale prices rose 0.2 per cent in the month and 0.5 per cent in the year; in March, the index climbed only 0.1 per cent in the month and 0.2 per cent in the year. Analysts attributed the increase to rising commodity and oil prices that were not offset by the weaker dollar in the month. Some of the biggest month-on-month price gains came directly from commodities: a 23 per cent jump in coffee prices, 5.5 per cent in fruit prices, 4.4 per cent in pigs for slaughter, and 3 per cent in grains. Switzerland's industrial production in the first quarter rose 7 per cent from the same period in 1993, the government statistics office announced yesterday. Incoming orders rose 10 per cent in the same period, with business from abroad up 13 per cent and orders from domestic customers up 6 per cent. The official Swedish unemployment rate decreased to 7.1 per cent in May from 7.4 per cent in April and was down from 7.5 per cent in May 1993, according to official figures. Norway's trade surplus in May fell to NKr4.88bn (Pounds 448m) compared with NKr6.78bn (Pounds 622m) the same month a year earlier, according to the country's statistical agency. Austrian building output rose nearly a fifth in the first quarter, increasing 19.6 per cent to Sh21bn (Pounds 1.9bn) the central statistics office said.</p>

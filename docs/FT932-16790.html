			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The Long View: While bankers sleep THE BANKERS have withdrawn defensively into their parlours, but the sins they committed as they naively explored the red light districts of late 1980s finance are still troubling them. This week a string of leading banks faced losing half the Pounds 1bn or more they advanced in 1989 to support Isosceles, an unquoted supermarket buyout vehicle which owns the Gateway chain. It was notable for importing concepts of financial engineering such as mezzanine debt and 'stub' equity (which even at the time some people unkindly pointed out was an anagram of 'bust'). Now the stores group cannot possibly pay the interest on its mountain of debt and a financial restructuring is under way. More trouble looms at Queens Moat Houses, another Pounds 1bn-plus borrower, which asked for a share price suspension on Wednesday 'pending clarification of the company's financial position'. While the banks struggle, and their most troublesome clients are still on life support, the UK corporate sector as a whole is nevertheless getting its financial affairs back into passably decent shape. In 1989 and 1990 the industrial and commercial company sector was running alarming financial deficits of around Pounds 20bn a year, but that was cut to Pounds 10bn by 1992 and there should be a surplus in the current year, the first since 1987. The balance sheet of the corporate sector is looking somewhat better structured, too. At the peak in the late 1980s companies were borrowing more than Pounds 30bn a year from banks, but in 1991 and 1992 there were actually small net repayments. Rights issues are already flowing, and confirmation of economic recovery will bring out many more; in addition, there could be an active market for new company flotations this year. Elsewhere, big companies are heavy issuers of Eurosterling bonds. Such capital market refinancing is good for the corporate sector, but it leaves the banks with a quality problem: the good loans are being repaid but the bad ones stay on the books. Five years ago banks dominated the financial markets, and prices of the kinds of assets they liked to finance rocketed. This applied especially to property, including hotels, as well as to fringe assets such as Van Goghs. The banks rarely intruded into the stock market except to finance the activities of takeover kings in buying companies from investors, which often happened at up to twice the normal market price. The displaced investors, if they were wise, put their money on deposit at high interest rates, and waited. Now the banks are out of the game and the securities markets are back in control. Markets in shares, which offer the prospect of rising incomes, especially attractive to investors such as pension funds, are very high. Because of the shift in power, takeovers are almost dead: British companies spent Pounds 1.6bn on the securities of other companies in 1992 compared with Pounds 18bn in 1989. UK real estate remains stuck in the doldrums as institutional investors ignore the bogus asset values generated some years ago by bank finance and look at rental income which is no longer rising but is flat at best and may fall at the ends of the leases. In the past four years UK share prices have climbed by 30 per cent, but office property values, according to Hillier Parker, have fallen by about 35 per cent. Arguably the opposite kind of value distortion is now present, because investors - intoxicated by a bull market - are too optimistic about the extent to which dividends may grow. There is now a cyclical opportunity for the stock market to extend its reach down into the smaller company sector. Already the shares of small capitalisation listed companies have been outperforming. The FT-SE SmallCap Index is up 14 per cent so far in 1993 while the Footsie index of the 100 leaders has stagnated. So the beleaguered Stock Exchange could have been over-hasty in threatening last month to shut down its Unlisted Securities Market, a decision which anyway it appears to have deferred. While the banks lick their wounds and busy themselves plugging the holes in their balance sheet ratios there is inevitably concern that shortage of finance for small and medium-sized companies might threaten the pace of Britain's economic recovery. In fact this does not seem likely to be a problem across the middle of the market where there is a variety of sources of capital led by institutions such as 3i. According to 3i its dividend income from this sector is still rising, which does not suggest any great general distress. Meanwhile there is plenty of activity in restructuring balance sheets, though little sign of demand for capital to finance expansion of capacity. But life is much tougher at the very small end, where hundreds of thousands of 1980s Thatcherite entrepreneurs set themselves up in business with equity released from overmortgaged homes and floating rate loans from clearing banks, which jacked up the interest rate from 10 to 18 per cent by 1989. This is the main source of the frightening statistics of business collapses. Yet although many sole traders are still going bankrupt the number of failures of limited companies is starting to tail off. The combination of wild fluctuations in economic conditions together with dependence upon floating rate finance is lethal. Somehow an institutional framework for channelling fixed rate and equity finance to the smallest businesses needs to be developed, but nobody can see how to make a profit out of it. It was a vacuum that the clearing banks tried to fill in a way that they now regret. Losing money did not even make them popular. But it is astonishing how cycles swing and fortunes fluctuate. Perhaps those shrewd investors should be reading the commercial estate agents' brochures, although it is surely too soon to be considering a dabble in flower paintings by one-eared Dutch painters.</p>

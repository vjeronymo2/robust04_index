			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Congratulations to the writers and sponsors of the following shows who had the  courage to create viable and dignified parts for older men and women as well as  minorities: "Matlock," "Island Son," "In the Heat of the Night," "Murder, She  Wrote" and "Dallas." And a rap on the knuckles of the "Falcon Crest" writers  for turning a fairly decent series into a nonsensical waste of time with their  ridiculous and poorly done love scenes that have no redeeming value.  </P> <P> Marianne Della Marna, Alta Loma  </P></p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies There is something unreal about sterling's fall to a record low against the D-Mark yesterday. If anything, short-run expectations of further rate cuts have been receding. The seven wise men did warn of the risks to the recovery at the end of last week, and increased loss provisions at National Westminster could point to persistent economic weakness. But other indicators like retail sales and money supply growth have grown more hopeful of late. So there is no obvious reason to push sterling down. It may be a matter of D-Mark strength rather than sterling weakness. The Bundesbank could take inflation figures from the German regions, especially those showing Bavarian consumer prices rising 0.5 per cent this month, as justification for its cautious response to January's fall in M3 money supply. Its money market operations yesterday confirm that it is in no rush to cut official interest rates. In theory that should spell more danger for currencies struggling to stay in the ERM than for sterling. Pressure has been returning to the system this week. Chances are it will intensify and spread as the French election approaches. But for the time being the easy profits are to be made in selling currencies such as sterling and the lira which are free to fall. The UK does not have a political crisis on the Italian scale. Yet there is the government's Maastricht disarray and its apparent confusion on economic policy. Paradoxically, the best way for Mr Lamont to stabilise sterling might be to cut rates to the point where the market knows he can go no further.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Fayed and Rowland row over pay-to-MPs video claim Last year's fragile ceasefire between Mr Mohamed Fayed and Mr Tiny Rowland came to an abrupt end yesterday as they argued about the alleged contents of a video recording of Mr Rowland - and even about when the recording or recordings may have been made. Mr Fayed said that as part of the truce in the long-running legal battle with Mr Rowland - which began when Mr Fayed and his brothers snatched control of Harrods department store from under Mr Rowland's nose in 1985 - the joint chief executive of Lonrho had consented to make a video recording about political payments he had made. 'We had a BBC cameraman,' said Mr Fayed. 'I interviewed him like David Frost.' Mr Fayed said the video contained details of political payments made by Lonrho exceeding Pounds 1m. However, Mr Rowland, barely able to contain his laughter, denied last night that any such video had been made: 'You know there is no man like him (Mr Fayed),' he said. 'I would love to see this recording.' He added: 'I can tell you we have never paid a penny to anyone employed in government.' Last week, Mr Fayed's disclosures about his payments to MPs led to the resignation of one minister, Mr Tim Smith, and has put in question the survival in office of Mr Neil Hamilton, a minister at the department of trade and industry. Mr Rowland disclosed that he had lunched with Mr Fayed for 'one and a half hours' last Thursday in Mr Fayed's Harrods' office. 'He kept asking 'did you pay Pounds  1/2 m or Pounds 1 1/2 m?',' Mr Rowland said. Mr Rowland said he was convinced it was this meeting that was recorded. 'I was a little bit concerned at the time,' he said. Mr Fayed, however, said it was not taped. Mr Fayed remains bitter about the appointment of inspectors in 1987 to investigate his takeover of House of Fraser, owner of Harrods, two years earlier. He believes his alleged tape recording of Mr Rowland sheds light on the reasons for the appointment.</p>

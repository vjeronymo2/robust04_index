			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 25 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Democratic Alliance  of Serbs in Macedonia [DSSM] today sent a public message to the  citizens of Serb nationality instructing them to provide  information for the P1 [population census] form only if the form  is printed in two languages--Serbian and Macedonian--and to  refuse to take part in the census if the form is printed only in  Macedonian.    A statement released by the DSSM says that this message was  sent to the Serbs in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] because some census collectors are trying to  register the Serbs on forms printed in Macedonian, with the  assistance of an official interpreter, which is in contravention  of the Law on the Census applied to citizens belonging to  national communities.</p>

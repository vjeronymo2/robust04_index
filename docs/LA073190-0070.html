			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUJITSU WILL BUY CONTROL OF U.K. COMPUTER FIRM;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: THE PURCHASE OF 80% OF INTERNATIONAL COMPUTERS LTD. MAY SIGNAL THE  START OF MERGERS BETWEEN EUROPE'S STRUGGLING FIRMS AND CASH-RICH JAPANESE  COMPANIES.  </P> <P> Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer maker, said Monday that it will buy a  controlling share of Britain's top computer manufacturer in the first major  purchase of a European computer company by the Japanese.  </P> <P> Fujitsu's purchase of 80% of International Computers Ltd. for $1.2 billion  expands the Japanese company's growing reach in the global market for  computers, semiconductors and other high-technology products and automatically  makes it one of Europe's leading computer makers, well ahead of the creation of  a single European market in 1992.  </P> <P> The purchase also allows Fujitsu, the world's third-largest computer maker, to  replace Digital Equipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass. in the No. 2 spot, behind  International Business Machines.  </P> <P> In the works for the past 18 months and widely rumored during the past 10 days,  the deal, however, has ramifications far beyond the immediate participants.  </P> <P> Analysts said they expect additional deals between Europe's struggling computer  industry and cash-rich Japanese companies eager to expand without the expense  and trouble of establishing local subsidiaries. Further, analysts noted, the  Fujitsu deal is sure to sharpen competition for IBM, the world's No. 1 computer  maker and a leading force in the European computer market.  </P> <P> "Europe is changing its attitudes toward the Japanese and beginning to accept  them in their computer markets," said Ulrich Weil, a technology analyst in  Washington. "And there are sure to be more changes ahead."  </P> <P> Although the Fujitsu purchase of ICL is the largest deal of its kind, it is not  the first.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Mitsubishi purchased Apricot Systems, a small British  personal computer maker. In addition, several other European electronics  companies have ties to larger Japanese firms. For example, NEC Corp. has a 15%  stake in a subsidiary of the French company, Cie. des Machines Bull, and  Hitachi Ltd. has links with Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Before its 80% purchase of ICL, Fujitsu had a nine-year technology-sharing  agreement with the British company. But until the latest deal, Fujitsu's  European operations consisted of a computer manufacturing plant in Spain and a  semiconductor-making plant in Ireland, as well as a semiconductor marketing  operation throughout Europe.  </P> <P> "The message is becoming increasingly clear for companies throughout the  world," said Michael Borrus of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International  Economy. "If you're not already in Europe with your own operations, and you  want to be a global player, you're going to have to find a partner in Europe."  </P> <P> Among those most often mentioned as potential European partners are the ailing  computer operations of Philips N.V., the Dutch electronics company; the sagging  computer operations of Bull of France, and the erratically performing computer  operations of Italy's Olivetti.  </P> <P> Although analysts said the full effects from the growing presence of Japanese  companies in Europe will not be seen for years, the latest deal makes Japan a  major player in the European mainframe computer market for the first time by  giving them the dominant market share position in Britain. However, because  ICL, whose sales last year were approximately $2.9 billion, has only a small  market presence beyond Britain, analysts said Fujitsu will be on its own as it  attempts to expand its European operations.  </P> <P> And Fujitsu left little question that it would expand its operations. "We look  forward to promoting the ICL name vigorously in its key markets," Takuma  Yamamoto, Fujitsu's chairman, said at a London press conference.  </P> <P> ICL's principal markets have been British governmental agencies and retailers,  and its market share in that country is said to be second only to IBM.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GLOBAL COMPUTER SALES  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.09IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989 sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Company / Country  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1.

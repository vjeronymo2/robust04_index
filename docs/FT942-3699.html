			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: The deal makers hunt for allies The election results may be counted but a new round of political jostling has just begun. With composition of the European Parliament split fairly evenly between right and left, the task of building the parliament's political blocs is set to be a delicate game of musical chairs. The main forum for the manoeuvring will be the parliament's fragmented right wing. While the left is presenting a fairly cohesive front, allied around the dominant Socialist group, the right will face a difficult task in forging any firm alliance. The Christian Democrat group has traditionally been the key alliance maker on the right. Its number overall has shrunk slightly in the election to around 130 but the European Peoples Party (EPP) which it controls has a raft of likely allies. This could raise the group's overall numbers to near parity with the Socialists. The question now is whether parties such as the UK Conservatives or Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia will be willing to work with the EPP. 'There will be hectic negotiations this week - there will be many telephone calls across the borders,' said Mr Leo Tindemans, former Belgian prime minister and leader of the EPP. He insists that the Christian Democrats do not want to associate with Mr Berlusconi's main government allies, the neo-fascist National Alliance/MSI and the Northern League. Crucial negotiations will also centre around France's neo-Gaullist RPR and the Portuguese ruling centre-right liberals. Portugal's liberals dislike the whiff of incense still wafting around Christian Democracy. In France, the transfer of a full Gaullist contingent, still attached to the General's 'l'Europe des Patries', is far from assured. Although Britain's Tories sat in alliance with the EPP during the latter part of the last parliament, many Christian Democrats are angry at the anti-European tone of the Conservative government and its recent election campaign. Mr Tindemans himself says that some new alliance with the Conservatives might still be possible - although he admits that Dutch, Italian and Belgian Christian Democrats have been opposed in the past. The Conservative party says it is keeping its options open until the parliament reconvenes. Although Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the main Christian Democrat broker and deal-maker, appears well-disposed towards Mr Berlusconi, Benelux Christian Democrats deplore the Italian leader's alliance with neo-fascists. Even if the EPP does forge an alliance in the next few weeks, this may sunder over the increased presence of Italy's neo-fascists at Strasbourg when parliament assembles on July 19.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO REPORTEDLY WOOING BUCS  </P> <P> Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse is entertaining bids that could  move the NFL franchise to sports-hungry Sacramento, according to a published  report.  </P> <P> The Bucs have been offered $50 million for the move, the St. Petersburg Times  reported in today's editions.  </P> <P> The proposed deal is similar to offers Sacramento has made to at least six  other NFL franchises, including the Los Angeles Raiders, Buffalo Bills and New  England Patriots -- $50 million cash for the team, a new $100-million stadium  and guaranteed ticket revenues over 20 years.  </P> <P> The offer is being made by city and county officials and the Sacramento Sports  Assn., a private group of developers.  </P> <P> Culverhouse had no comment on the report Sunday night.  </P> <P> According to Sacramento developer Gregg Lukenbill, the Tampa Bay offer is  little more than a safety net should the Raiders choose to return to Oakland,  their home before they moved to Los Angeles in 1982.  </P> <P> "There's nothing to it, and I wouldn't pay any attention to it," Lukenbill,  managing partner of the National Basketball Assn.'s Sacramento Kings, told the  Sacramento Bee on Sunday.  </P> <P> "If the Raiders deal doesn't work, maybe I'll look elsewhere. But I'm on track  to get the Raiders deal done, and I feel ethically bound to do that."  </P> <P> However, Joe Benbenuti, a partner of Lukenbill's and a member of the Sacramento  Sports Authority, acknowledged to the Bee that the group has contacted "a  half-dozen teams."  </P></p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling bonds The government should not take too much heart from the recent slew of sterling Eurobond issues. Yesterday's issue from PowerGen brings to Pounds 1.5bn the amount raised so far this year. But the range of borrowers and maturities suggests pockets of demand for sterling bonds rather than the wave of international buying required to help fund the public sector borrowing requirement. There has been overseas interest. But with sterling hovering around DM2.50, the potential for currency gain looks hardly enough to tempt big money. The surprise is that more companies have not moved to lock into long-term rates before the government starts borrowing in earnest this spring. While short rates are low most are evidently satisfied with floating rate bank debt. Moving to longer maturities involves higher interest payments. Even so, companies with a natural requirement for long-term funding - utilities among them - may yet regret not raising 10-year money at less than 9 per cent. The danger is not so much that the government will absorb all available institutional funds - life companies have an appetite for corporate bonds which yield a little more than gilts. Overseas investors will be needed to fund the PSBR. They may demand higher yields or a lower exchange rate before buying more sterling bonds. Any borrowers hanging on for lower interest rates are running something of a risk.</p>

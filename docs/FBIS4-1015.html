			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Police on Tuesday said  the Internal Stability Division [ISD] had not returned to  Thokoza on the East Rand where soldiers of the National  Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], hostel and township residents fought  running gun battles through the day.    Police East Rand spokesman Lt Deon Peens told SAPA police  were not intervening in the conflict. "The ISD was not back  there. Police are doing normal police work, driving around in  their bakkies [pickup trucks]," he said. He confirmed the NPKF  had requested the assistance of the South African Police [SAP],  and directed all enquiries to the NPKF head office.    An NPKF soldier could not confirm a report that the force  had  fired a mortar round into Hostel No 2 in the township. He said  it was "very, very busy" in Thokoza.    Inkatha Freedom Party Spokesman Ed Tillet said: "The NKPF  are totally out of control. They are firing indiscriminately at  everyone." Mr Tillet said the car in which IFP Transvaal  Political Director Themba Khoza was travelling in the township  had been petrol bombed, but this had yet to be confirmed.    Police were on Tuesday investigating a rocket-propelled  grenade attack on No 2 Hostel in Thokoza. A police spokesman  said the RPG7 attack caused little damage and no one was  injured. Three people were killed earlier in the day and  several others injured in crossfire between township residents  and hostel residents, police said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] I will not accept the resignation of Minister  Andrija Hebrang, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic said at a  Croatian Government session, which is still underway. Jasenka  Dudic is on the phone with a report.    [Dudic] The program which is being implemented in the health  service is part of the overall stabilization program, so I --  just like Dr. Hebrang -- would as a man of principles refuse to  head the government if that program was brought into question.  Prime Minister Valentic said this when he refused the  minister's resignation and announced a discussion of the  situation in the health service for the next session. He  stressed that the government would not allow anarchy in the  health service. The prime minister admitted that opposition to  the stabilization program has been much greater than the  government has admitted before, and that there is still some  opposition on the part of those who oppose order.    Concerning prices, they are under control, and the  government's message to those who have increased them is to  reduce prices to previous levels, or the state will intervene.    The Croatian Government has adopted two-phase emergency  measures for improving the water supply to Zadar and Biograd.  Over the past two years the government has done everything to  provide the water supply to those two towns, Prime Minister  Valentic and Deputy Prime Minister Seks stressed. However, we  have to exert additional pressure on UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] because they did not do anything to improve the water  supply and protect the Kakme source, thus enabling the crime  against humanitarian law.

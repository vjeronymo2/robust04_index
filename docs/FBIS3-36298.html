			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>   [Text] Today, our lawmakers discussed and adopted the Law  on Political Parties. Anatol Vyartsinski, deputy chairman of  the Commission for Mass Media and Human Rights, delivered a  speech on this issue. I asked him to comment on the new law.    [Begin recording] [Vyartsinski] The Law on Political Parties  addresses a lot of issues. First of all, in the general  political aspect, in a legal aspect, it admits and legalizes  individual rights for free speech and worship, and the right to  band with other like-minded people in political organizations.  The law legalizes the multiparty system as a reality of our  actual sociopolitical life.    [Rutkowski] Currently, we have many parties in Belarus,  however, the Communist Party is still one of the most prominent  ones.    [Vyartsinski] The law foresees equal rights for all parties.    [Rutkowski] So, when the election campaign begins, each  party  will be able to nominate an established number of candidates to  the Supreme Soviet. Is this true?    [Vyartsinski] To some extent. The Law on Political Parties  foresees that parties can participate in elections and nominate  their candidates, and it is highly likely that future elections  will be conducted on the basis of party lists. However, this is  the domain of the Law on Elections [words indistinct]. [end  recording]    The draft law on alternative service has been discussed by  our deputies not for the first time. Leanid Privalow, deputy  chairman of the Supreme Soviet Commission for National Security,  Defense, and Crime, delivered a report on this topic. However,  the people's deputies have various opinions on the issue of  alternative service; many deputies oppose it. We know that this  law exists in many civilized countries. Yes, a young person  should be able to choose between military service and something  else. However, the implementation of this law demands that the  mentality of our people change. This draft law was not adopted.  I asked Leanid Privalow to express his opinion on this issue.    [Begin Privalow recording] I do not want to comment on the  behavior of some of our deputies, and I do not want to blame  them. However, being an expert on this issue, I claim that the  time for this law has not yet come [words indistinct]. [end  recording]</p>

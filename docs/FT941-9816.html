			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Maid sticks by Pounds 100m valuation Maid Systems, a small on-line business information supplier, yesterday insisted that next month's flotation would value the company at a minimum of Pounds 100m. The figure has been questioned by industry experts since news of the intended flotation emerged in January. Observers argue that Maid has few assets to justify the price. In addition, they say it is at the mercy of companies which provide its data and faces fierce competition from larger companies like Reuters and Profile, part of the Financial Times group. Mr Stephen Aulsebrook of Hill Samuel Bank, which is advising Maid on the issue, said the price had not yet been fixed. It would be arrived at through a book-building exercise over the next month but Pounds 100m was the target valuation. The company is coming to market by way of a placing on March 15. The pathfinder prospectus was published yesterday and dealings in the shares are expected to begin on March 25. About 30 per cent of the company is to be floated. The expected net proceeds of Pounds 16m will be used for product development and marketing expenses, especially in the US, which the company believes will eventually become its principal market. Maid has contracts with information providers for data which it stores and distributes over telephone lines to customers' personal computers. Its existing services include Researchline, Newsline and Companyline. A typical annual subscription rate for business information is Pounds 6,000. Last year, pre-tax profits advanced 85 per cent to Pounds 603,176 on revenues ahead 64 per cent at Pounds 5.7m. It has been profitable for the past four years, according to executives. Mr Dan Wagner, managing director, said that most of the company's revenues would eventually come from a new product, Maid for Windows, planned for launch in 1995. Mr Wagner believed he had identified a gap in the market for the supply of on-line business information to the mass market. The aim is to provide a tailored information service to individuals at a basic cost of Dollars 200 (Pounds 140) a year. The company provides a basic service on which customers can add units to suit their needs.</p>

He accused Western  governments and big business of withholding funding to the PAC  to ensure an African National Congress [ANC] election victory.    Mr Makwetu said PAC officials from the president down had  not  been paid for nine months. "We are living from hand to mouth.  Nobody from the president down has been paid. We need  everything we can get," Mr Makwetu told a media conference.    He said arrangements had been made to restore the PAC's  telecommunications -- disconnected this week after a R94,000  [rand] bill went unpaid -- but that "we must live up to these  arrangements". "If we don't find the funds we might find  ourselves in trouble," he said.    "Our members...are donating amounts of between R5 to R50,  with a few giving us a few hundreds," Mr Makwetu said. "Big  business and the overseas community is determined to ensure that  these are one-sided elections. The unholy alliance between the  international community and big business will deny this country  the multiparty democracy overseas countries claim they enjoy."    He said the United States had given at least US10 million to  the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party. "The PAC and other  organisations have been ignored and our efforts to get the same  kind of assistance has fallen on deaf ears," he said.    The Scandinavian countries had donated R25 million to the  ANC. The French had also donated to the ANC. "However, despite  this, we are not pulling out of the elections. We are not  throwing in the towel and already creating excuses in case we  lose. Despite our poverty, for this is what the struggle is  about, we will make the necessary sacrifices for victory. Some  of our posters are handwritten on cheap paper and done in  townships and squatter camps for this is where the struggle  starts in the first place."</p>

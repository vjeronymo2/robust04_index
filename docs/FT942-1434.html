			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Goode proposals provide basis for system The white paper aimed at improving the regulation of occupational pensions adopts many of the proposals urged by its own advisory panel, the Goode committee, nine months ago. The paper is intended to be a blueprint for sweeping legislation which will be proposed in the next parliamentary session. In spite of clear indications from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, in recent weeks that he would do the opposite, the government has stated its support for a fully fledged pensions regulator with sweeping powers to intervene in the activities of pension schemes when members' benefit rights appear to be threatened. But contrary to the Goode committee recommendations, the regulator will not be able to search independently for breaches of the rules. It will instead have to rely on 'whistle-blowing' by scheme advisers or members. In another departure from the recommendations, the government has proposed that the industry, not taxpayers, should pay the estimated Pounds 10m annual bill for running the office of the pensions regulator. This will be more than the budget of about Pounds 750,000 available to the Occupational Pensions Board - which it will replace - because its duties are more sweeping and it will oversee more schemes. The government estimates that the legislation would cost the average scheme with Pounds 16m in assets roughly Pounds 5,160 in additional costs and Pounds 14,005 in one-off setting-up costs. The government estimates the cost of the proposals to itself to be Pounds 120m a year due to tax relief for recurrent costs borne by industry, and Pounds 80m to Pounds 120m for the additional tax relief granted to schemes that increase their investment in lower yielding assets to meet new solvency requirements. It expects an additional Pounds 30m in lost tax revenue as schemes write off the non-recurrent administration costs incurred in adjusting to new information-keeping and reporting requirements. The paper proposes some cost savings for employers in its plan to abolish the Guaranteed Minimum Pension from April 1997. GMP is the portion of occupational pension intended to provide the same level of benefits as the State Earnings Related Scheme for which employers receive rebates of National Insurance Contributions. The white paper proposes continuation of the rebates but employers will only be required to increase pensions in payment each year by either retail price inflation or 5 per cent, whichever is lower. Currently, the GMP portion of each member's pension must be increased by the level of earnings inflation, or by 7 per cent each year, or by a maximum of 5 per cent if they are prepared to pay a premium to the state. The white paper proposes that occupational schemes with 100 members or more will be required to allow members to appoint a third of all trustees if they wish. The Confederation of British Industry, the employers' body, had argued against it, although many of the UK's largest pension schemes have trustee boards composed of up to 50 per cent members. The government has rejected the Goode committee's advice to bar employers from taking cash from their schemes when a surplus is found. The government will allow employers to take cash out, provided that the scheme rules allow it. Where the rules do not allow it, they may apply to the regulator for permission to do so. The government also rejected advice that it should extend the period which employers have to wind down a significant cash surplus before attracting punitive tax charges. As expected the government is proposing a 'minimum solvency standard' although it has modified what the Goode committee proposed. The modifications, suggested by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries are intended to allow companies to continue to hold large percentages of their total assets in equities rather than force them to switch into bonds. Schemes will have to meet 100 per cent of the minimum solvency standard from 1997 and will have up to 10 years to correct any shortfall. The main points of the proposals are: A new pensions act to establish a regulator from April 1997. The regulator will consist of a full-time chairman supported by a board of at least six part-time members with pensions expertise. It will have an advisory committee which will represent a broad range of interests. Any decisions taken by the board will have to be agreed by the majority of its members. It will have an annual budget of Pounds 10m to be funded by a levy on the industry based on the size of each scheme. The regulator's powers will include the ability to select sanctions and penalties ranging from a reprimand to a fine, removal or disqualification of trustees and winding up the scheme. A list of potential sanctions is being drawn up. All 'defined benefit' schemes which promise a set benefit upon retirement will be required to meet a minimum solvency standard. The calculation will be based on so-called cash equivalents - roughly the transfer value of each member's benefits if he had left the scheme. Following consultation with the IFA the Goode committee proposals on how to calculate the standard have been altered. Under government proposals, the calculation of cash equivalents for younger members will be based on equity yields. As members age, gilt yields  -typically lower than those on equities - will assume an increasingly important role. The solvency standard will begin to take effect in April 1997 and schemes will have five years to bring their fund up to the requisite level. Each three years and actuarial valuation will have to include a certification that the scheme has enough assets to meet all past service liabilities on wind-up. If not, the trustees must develop a plan to bring the scheme up to the 100 per cent level over the next three years. This means that current schemes may not have to meet the solvency standard in full until 2005. If the scheme is found to have less than 90 per cent of assets needed to meet liabilities, it must be funded to the 90 per cent level within three months either by an immediate cash injection or some other measure. Alternatives could include a bank guarantee or the creation of some form of cash reserve, provided trustees were reassured that this was properly ring-fenced. In calculating the cost to pension funds of meeting the minimum solvency standard, the government said that only those pension schemes which were less than 110 per cent solvent were likely to have to engage in any move out of equities into lower-yielding gilts. The cost of additional contributions from this year until 2004 should be no more than Pounds 100m in total for UK pension schemes. Additionally, the cost of adjusting the investment strategy would be no more than Pounds 60m to Pounds 140m by 2004. The government is considering the development of a new type of security which could provide more appropriate backing for pension schemes' inflation-linked liabilities. There will be a compensation scheme for cases where the new Pensions Compensation Board believes losses to members have occurred as a result of 'dishonest removal of assets', including fraud, theft or other misappropriation. If the assets of the scheme, as a result, fall below 90 per cent of the minimum solvency standard, there will be powers to authorise 'drip feed' payments to a claimant scheme in the form of loans. Meanwhile, the trustees of the scheme have a duty to try to recover missing assets. The scheme will not guarantee that pensioners who lose their benefits through fraud will be fully compensated. Compensation is not payable on 90 per cent of the benefits due but on up to 90 per cent of the minimum solvency standard. Members of all types of schemes shall have the right to select at least one-third of all the members of the board of trustees. The minimum number of trustees in all cases will be at least two, except for small schemes, defined as those with 100 members or fewer. In such schemes, members shall have the right to appoint at least one member trustee. Employers will be required to allow member trustees paid leave to carry out their duties and to undertake training. The government opposed the recommendation that for defined contribution schemes - where benefits are simply accrued contributions plus investment returns - members be allowed to appoint two-thirds of trustees. Employers should not have the sole right to appoint trustees and should not be able to veto a trustee selected by the members. Scheme actuaries and auditors should not act as trustees except for small self-administered schemes and the scheme administrator should not be a scheme trustee. Also, scheme members should be free to appoint a non-member trustee such as a trade union representative if the employer agrees. There should be the power to refer disagreements to the regulator. The government will allow some changes in employers' freedom to use pension scheme surpluses. However, it rejected the Goode committee's advice that employers be barred from refunding cash to themselves from the scheme, even when scheme rules allow it, unless the pensions regulator agreed. Instead, for schemes whose trust deeds do allow cash extractions, members will have the right to challenge trustees' decision and seek the intervention of the regulator if criteria set out in the trust deed are not complied with. Where the trust deed does not provide for cash refunds, there should be an additional requirement that the employer notify scheme members to enable them to press their case before the regulator. Also, the employer should inform members why the regulator allowed the refund to be paid. In earnings-related schemes which require the employer to finance any shortfall, employers should remain free to take contributions holidays. However, they may not do so if the effect of the holiday would reduce the funding level below the 100 per cent minimum solvency standard. Separately, the government rejected the Goode committee suggestion that employers be allowed to write off surpluses greater than 105 per cent of liabilities over a 15-year period before attracting tax penalties. Critics have said that the current five-year limit encourages employers to take either refunds or contributions holidays which can quickly lead to scheme deficits when markets fall sharply in ensuing years. The government has decided against making any recommendations on the disposition of pension assets in divorce cases as recommended by the Goode committee. The government proposes to break the link between Guaranteed Minimum Pensions - up to 20 per cent of each employee's pension - and the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. This will have benefits for the government, saving it an estimated Pounds 1.5bn of Serps expenditure by 2050. Occupational scheme members and providers will continue to receive a national insurance contribution rebate for each member but schemes will no longer be required to provide benefits equal to those of Serps. Employers who qualify for the rebate will be required to uprate the entire pension by either retail price inflation or 5 per cent, whichever is the lower. The change will not affect GMP entitlements on service before to April 1997. The government expects employers to share in the cost savings of this measure. Assuming that 80 per cent of pension scheme members are in contracted-out (where GMP is paid instead of Serps) salary-related schemes, the entire sector will see recurrent funding savings of Pounds 90m. This will be offset, however, by non-recurrent costs for scheme administration of Pounds 95m. Other changes have been proposed to improve flexibility for non-occupational scheme members. Personal pension holders and members of money-purchase schemes will be entitled to age-related rebates. This will give smaller tax incentives to young people to encourage them to contract out of Serps via personal pensions but tax rebates will rise as they age to discourage them from contracting back into Serps. Also, the government is proposing to relax its strict rules requiring a retiring individual to put all the assets into an annuity immediately when a personal pension matures. This has forced some individuals to buy annuities at the top of the market, severely reducing the scale of benefits they receive. Instead, individuals will be allowed to delay purchasing an annuity until the age of 75. Those who do defer purchasing an annuity will be allowed to draw sums from their pension fund, subject to strict annual limits to ensure that the fund is still sufficient to purchase broadly the same pension as it would have done at normal retirement age.</p>

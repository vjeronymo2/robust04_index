			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Text] Beijing police yesterday detained the lawyer who  helped the dissident unionist, Han Dongfang, file a lawsuit  against the Chinese authorities. The lawyer was picked up for  counter-revolutionary offences according to a semi-official news  agency.    Zhou Guoqiang, 39, was held by public security officers for  questioning over a series of alleged anti-government activities,  the Hong Kong China News Agency (HKCNA) [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE]  said quoting sources from relevant departments in Beijing.    Unconfirmed reports said three other dissidents were taken  away by police in Beijing early yesterday morning, including a  Beijing University scholar, Yuan Hongbin, and a Beijing-based  labour activist, Qian Yumin. The identity of the other  dissident remained unclear. Last night, Shanghai police picked  up dissident Bao Ge "for a chat", his family said.    The detentions raised fears of a fresh round of persecution  of political dissidents to ensure stability as the annual  session of the National People's Congress draws near.    The action coincides with a series of high-level meetings  between senior U.S. official John Shattuck and Beijing officials  on China's human rights. It will provide new ammunition for US  congressmen who are campaigning for Washington to place greater  pressure on China to improve its human rights record in order to  secure an extension of its trade privileges.    Mr. Zhou is a close friend of Mr. Han, who was leader of the  outlawed Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation, formed at the  height of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations.    Mr. Han, who was prevented from entering China from Hong  Kong  after his expulsion late last year, claimed last night a  large-scale crackdown against dissidents was underway.  "Although this is not the first time they have taken Zhou away  for questioning...they may have decided to put him behind bars  for some time."    The unionist said the detention would cause a very bad  impact  on China's chance of renewing its Most Favoured Nation (MFN)  trading status this year. "I am afraid the Chinese authorities  do not really seem to care about the MFN now. It looks like  they are rounding up people now so that they can release some  when the time comes," he said.    The HKCNA report said Mr. Zhou had been involved in  "collaboration with hostile forces outside the country" and  unlawful anti-government activities incitement and disruption of  social order.    Mr. Zhou is now the legal adviser at a audio-visual  appliances company in Beijing. A member of the federation in  1989, he was detained from June to September that year. He was  later freed after showing an attitude of repentance, the report  said. But "relevant departments" told the news agency that Mr.  Zhou had continued to forge ties with unnamed foreign hostile  forces to engage in anti- government activities.    It claimed that the dissident convened an unlawful meeting  last October to compile an "anti-government article" and then  held a press conference for foreign journalists. He was also  accused of using an unregistered facsimile machine to send the  article to Hong Kong, "creating a bad influence outside China",  the HKCNA said.    Mr. Zhou joined a group of lesser-known dissidents in  publishing a Peace Charter last October, calling for an  improvement in human rights and the replacement of one-party  rule with a multi-party system. At least three of the nine  signatories of the charter have been detained for questioning by  police. Only Qin Yongmin remains behind bars. He was sentenced  to two years in a reform-through-education camp outside Wuhan  earlier this year.    According to the HKCNA, Mr. Zhou had organised the  production  of a large number of "culture T-shirts" emblazoned with slogans.  He had planned to distribute the T-shirts during the upcoming  congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  annual sessions, it said.    According to Mr. Han the T-shirts prepared by Mr. Zhou and  his friends mainly carried slogans concerning the labour  movement in the mainland and were not for distribution during  the congress.    "I understand they haven't yet printed those T-shirts. It's  still cold in Beijing and they plan to sell them in the summer,"  he added.</p>

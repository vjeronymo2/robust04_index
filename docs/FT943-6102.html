			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Spate of deals aimed at retail investors A spate of bond issues aimed mainly at retail investors dominated the eurobond market yesterday, but there was little sign of any return to the market by institutional investors. While the appetite for high-coupon paper among retail investors is clearly intact, the market's ability to absorb institutionally-targeted offerings could be tested in the next few weeks, as borrowers attempt to beat the autumn rush. 'There is certainly a greater level of conversation about potential transactions than there has been for some time, but we are still not seeing any activity from big institutions,' said one syndicate manager. For the first time, the Province of Ontario came to the Dutch guilder market with a Fl 500m offering of 10-year bonds, priced to yield 45 basis points above the 10-year 7 1/4 per cent Dutch government bond. Lead manager ABN Amro said the deal was successful, with the bonds placed predominantly with Dutch institutional investors, although it reported some demand from retail investors in other European countries. AT&amp;T tapped the Ecu market with an Ecu150m issue of five-year bonds, priced to yield 6 basis points above the five-year 6 per cent French government bond. The issue was well received, lead manager Paribas Capital Markets said, particularly because the coupon of 8 per cent was the highest seen in the Ecu sector since February 1993. However, some syndicate managers attacked the pricing as being too aggressive. The deal was mainly targeted at continental European retail investors, Paribas said, and the proceeds have been swapped into floating-rate US dollars. Three banks took advantage of the attractive swap rates still available in the Italian lira market, launching new issues totalling more than L500bn. Swiss Bank Corporation and Morgan Guaranty tapped the short end of the market, where the yield curve is particularly steep. Both three-year deals offer coupons of 11 3/8 per cent and are likely to appeal to investors in Switzerland and the Benelux region. Recent three-year deals for General Electric Capital Corporation and Rabobank have rallied half a point since they were launched last week. Italian bank Cariplo launched a slightly longer-dated L150bn five-year deal, which dealers said was likely to meet good demand from domestic investors.</p>

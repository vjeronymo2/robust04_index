			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Pay rises fall Median basic pay rises in Britain fell to 2 per cent for the three months to the end of October, according to provisional data from Industrial Relations Services published yesterday, Robert Taylor writes. That rate was the same as for the three months to June, which was the lowest level for at least nine years. Median pay awards across the whole economy have fluctuated within a 2 per cent to 2.3 per cent band for the seven months since April. IRS figures show a noticeable drop in the monthly level of pay rises in the upper quartile of private-sector workers - down to 2.5 per cent in October from 3 per cent in September. By contrast there was a slight increase, from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent, in the same period in the lower quartile. The provisional data also reveal a widening gap between the level of pay deals in manufacturing compared with those in the private services sector. Basic manufacturing wage rate rises this year have been running at least 0.5 per cent higher than those in private services with an average gap for the year of 0.8 per cent. The latest figures contain a higher-than-normal proportion of public-sector pay awards - affected by the government's 1.5 per cent wages policy - and a smaller number of basic pay rises in the private manufacturing sector. The IRS figures refer to the level of recorded basic settlements and not to the growth in total average earnings. The findings are based on only 38 pay reviews in October.

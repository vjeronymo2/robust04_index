			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A claim that Thailand is providing military  support to the Khmer Rouge reflects the frustration of the  international community at the situation in Cambodia, Deputy  Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said yesterday.    The international community expected to see peace in  Cambodia  after the United Nations-organised elections in May last year,  Mr Surin said.    "When things do not go well, they try to find a reason for  it. One easy reason is (to allege that) the Khmer Rouge is  receiving assistance from Thailand."    The deputy foreign minister was commenting on an article  written by former US ambassador to Thailand Morton Abramowitz in  THE WASHINGTON POST on May 29.    In the article, Mr Abramowitz said the Khmer Rouge had  established control over areas in northern and western Cambodia.    "The ineffectiveness of the Phnom Penh government and an  ill-conceived military campaign are key reasons for Khmer Rouge  successes. But a major external factor is Thailand's help for  the Khmer Rouge," he wrote.    "The Thai military provides them goods and, reportedly, arms  and gives their leadership sanctuary," Mr Abramowitz said.    But Mr Surin commented that the author may be "holding on to  an old image" of the Khmer Rouge as a member of a tripartite  coalition which fought against the former Phnom Penh government.    There is no need for Thailand to respond to the allegation  as  the author "has a right to express his opinion," Mr Surin said.    It was Thailand's policy "not to support any one faction,"  the deputy minister stressed. Thailand "wants to see national  reconciliation take place in Cambodia as soon as possible".    "Some foreign countries now understand Thailand's position,"  he said. He refused to give names but said they included  Western countries.    Mr Abramowitz also suggested that the U.S. raise its  concerns  about Cambodia during pending dialogue in Bangkok with the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations.    The deputy minister welcomed the suggestion, saying: "It is  better than discussing the issue outside the region."    The U.S. is one of ASEAN's seven "dialogue partners" and is  due to join an 18-nation forum on security issues taking place  on July 25. [passage omitted]</p>

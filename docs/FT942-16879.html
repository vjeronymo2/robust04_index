			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (11): 'The kind of financing which is of little interest to banks' - A look at an institution specialising in shipping finance There is more to the Danmarks Skibskreditfond (DSK) than has yet met the foreign investor's eye, according to Mr Bo Jagd, the fund's managing director. Or - as he says while trying not to sound too boastful - 'We can't find a bank in Europe which has a bigger shipping finance portfolio than we have.' 'We are a household name here at home, but we are hardly known anywhere else,' Mr Jagd says, but he predicts that this will soon change. So far the fund, a specialist bond-issuing mortgage institution providing long-term finance for ships, has been funded entirely in the domestic market, but he expects that within the foreseeable future it will go into direct dollar financing. The DSK is a substantial institution by Danish standards. Its DKr47bn balance sheet and DKr39bn loan portfolio ranks it alongside Giro Bank, which is the country's fifth largest bank. But the DSK is in the business of long-term finance. Typically, it provides 14-year loans matched by funding with a 14-year maturity - a kind of financing which is of little interest to banks. Loans are provided for new building of ships and conversions of ships at Danish shipyards for Danish and foreign owners, and to Danish owners for the acquisition of new ships and second-hand tonnage, as well as for the sale, to foreign owners, of Danish ships. The substantial loan portfolio reflects the fact that Denmark boasts a large commercial fleet and a substantial shipbuilding industry. There are two big shipping companies: A P Moller Maersk, which is one of the world's biggest, probably best-known for the Maersk Line (one of the world's two biggest companies in container-carrying liner shipping); and the Lauritzen group, which is especially prominent in refrigerated cargo transport. Moller owns the Odense Steel Shipyard, the only yard in Europe which has built and delivered double-hulled super-tankers. Lauritzen owns the Danyard, in Jutland, which recently won a big order to build a series of gas carriers for the American group Stolt Nielsen (the finance was arranged by the DSK). The third important shipyard is the Burmeister &amp; Wain Shipyard in Copenhagen. The DSK loans are secured by first priority mortgages up to 60 per cent of the fund's evaluation of the vessel. Over this level additional security is required. The fund has a conservative lending policy and keeps tight control over exposures. This shows up in the accounts. Bad loss provisions in 1993 were DKr62m, or about 0.6 per cent of lending. The DSK made a net profit of DKr221m in 1993; up from DKr202m in 1992. Its equity to assets ratio at the end of last year was 11.1 per cent - although this key figure does not have the same significance for the fund as it does for a bank, Mr Jagd says, because the DSK is not subject to the BIS capital adequacy rules. The conditions under which the fund operates are changing rapidly. Not only have shipbuilding subsidies been reduced by the European Union, but also there is a strong push by the OECD's member states to abolish subsidies altogether. This, and the fact that interest rates have fallen, means that an increasing proportion of ship financing is being carried out on market terms. In the case of Denmark, much of the fund's borrowing since the 1970s has taken the form of index-linked bonds. There was a strong domestic demand for these, which obviated the need to market DSK bonds abroad. Funding by index-linked bonds is being phased out, however, and Mr Jagd says that the fund is increasingly interested in marketing its normal mortgage bonds abroad - as well as planning to introduce dollar funding instruments. The DSK bonds, in contrast to many of the Danish mortgage bonds, are non-callable bullet bonds. This gives them a structure with which foreign investors are familiar. They resemble treasury bonds, but, typically, carry a spread over treasury bonds of about 40 basis points. 'If a foreign investor wants a Danish element in his porfolio, he can obtain a better yield from us than from treasury bonds,' Mr Jagd says, but he concedes that the fund's bonds are not as liquid as treasury bonds. In the past, the fund has done considerable business in swapping loans into floating rate dollars - which is a logical step, as ships are dollar assets. The next step, Mr Jagd adds, is to go into direct dollar financing, motivated partly by the fact that there is a limit to how many investors are prepared to do dollar swaps on loans of such long maturities. In fact the fund has already made its first venture into dollar financing, a six-year loan on a bilateral basis. The time for more ambitious dollar financing is approaching, probably as a private placement, he says. 'But there is no hurry. Institutions which change too fast have too often ended up in trouble, so we are changing cautiously.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladislav Kozyakov commentary] </F>   [Text] A spokesman for Russia's Defense Ministry flatly  refused on Monday [28 March] the reports of Western media on the  Russian military allegedly going ahead with the development of  biological weapons. Our observer Vladislav Kozyakov has some  details on this subject:    A spokesman for the information and press department made a  statement from the Defense Ministry. He told ITAR-TASS that  Russia is neither developing nor producing biological weapons.  The statement was causing a sensation but absolutely groundless  reports were made these days by some Western newspapers. For  example, the SUNDAY TIMES published by the London-based TIMES  produced a horrible picture alleging Russia has at its disposal  some super plague powder which can destroy half a million people  if 440 (?tonnes) of it were air dropped. What is more, the  newspaper reported that the West has no antidote for this agent.  It goes without saying that the report provided no evidence to  prove this sensation. It couldn't be otherwise, since there is  no such agent whatsoever. The author of the article, sent from  Washington, Mr. James Adams, refers to the testimonies which had  allegedly been made by three Russian defectors. One of them  gave some information to the CIA, the other two did so to the  British secret service. The names of these persons remain of  course unidentified -- as a result nobody can verify whether  these people really exist.    The developments remind one of the practices utilized by  special services during the Cold War period, when the East and  the West were competing for who is better at darkening its  potential enemy. It was just at that time when the fabrications  were spread all over the world about the AIDS virus having been  released from the Pentagon laboratories to spread around the  globe.    One can only wonder why even now the mass media is giving  reports with misleading information capable of sowing distrust  in international relations, the more so that the current pattern  of relations between Russia, the United States, and Britain  allows these countries to resolve their own problems --  especially those involved in mass destruction weapons --  proceeding from mutual frankness. It was a tripartite  Russian-American-British agreement to achieve this concluded as  early as 1992. [sentence as heard] The document of the agreement  clearly stipulates all the sides concerned can inspect the  facilities which had been used for the production of biological  weapons.    The main question is: Why did this hoax about Russian  biological weapons come into being just now? One of the  possible answers to it can be found in the SUNDAY TIMES itself.  This is evidence that some people are trying to create  suspicion among Russian leadership. Could it be for this very  reason that the conclusion can be drawn some Defense Ministry  officials could ostensibly be deceiving the president in this  respect?    However, another possibility is also quite plausible. In  Washington and London there appear again some groups which would  like to damage the prestige of Russia as a great democratic and  peace-loving power. At the same time they are eager to put a  fly into the ointment of the current process when constructive  partnership among Washington, Moscow, and London is now gaining  strength.</p>

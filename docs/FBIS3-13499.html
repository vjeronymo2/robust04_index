			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Four members of the PLO leadership in the Gaza  Strip met with Labor faction members at the Knesset in Jerusalem  this morning and demanded that settlements in Gaza be  dismantled. Sufyan Abu-Zayda, one of the delegation members and  Fatah spokesman in the Gaza Strip, said that the delegation's  main message was that the settlements constitute an obstacle to  peace. Another delegation member, Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, said  that the leadership in Gaza believes in the peace process and is  committed to it. 'Abd-al-Raziq was jailed for 21 years for  having participated in setting a booby- trapped car in Rishon  Leziyyon. He said that he and his friends have now changed  their positions in the wake of the peace process.    The delegation members complained that after the Hebron  massacre, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units entered narrow  alleys in Gaza and engaged in unnecessary confrontations instead  of restraining themselves in the face of the local residents'  expressions of grief. According to the four PLO leaders, some of  the clashes were with children, some of whom were fired upon  from a distance of 200 meters.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0930 GMT on 15 March adds  that Abu-Zayda "said that the delegation's meeting with the  Labor members was approved by 'Arafat and that he will brief  'Arafat about it."]    Eight Labor faction members participated in the meeting.  Knesset Member [MK] Yosi Katz insisted that the Palestinians  should not take advantage of the Hebron massacre to add demands  to the Declaration of Principles. MK Ya'el Dayan agreed that  settlements in densely populated areas of Gaza should be  evacuated. MK Dalya Itzik said she regrets the fact that there  is no peace camp in the Palestinian street similar to Peace Now  in Israel.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Knesset  speaker refused a request from the right-wing factions to  prevent the PLO delegation members from entering the Knesset.  National Religious Party MK Yitzhaq Levi complained to the  House Committee about the fact that this delegation was allowed  into the Knesset while the wives of the jailed Kakh members were  barred from doing so yesterday. This afternoon, the Knesset  House Committee will discuss complaints in this regard raised by  MK Levi and other right-wing MK's.</p>

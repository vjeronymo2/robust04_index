			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOOR MUSEUM RELIVES THE SETTLING OF INDIANA  </P> <P> Rated "one of the 10 best places to relive America's past" by Good Housekeeping  magazine, along with such landmarks as Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts  and Michigan's Greenfield Village, Conner Prairie recreates the primitive  atmosphere of 1836 Indiana.  </P> <P> Just six miles northeast of Indianapolis, Conner Prairie, an outdoor history  museum, depicts the common endeavors of the first generation of Indiana  settlers.  </P> <P> Costumed guides reflect the mannerisms, attitudes and values of the day in  first-person interpretations, portraying former villagers.  </P> <P> Surrounded by bolts of calico, buttons and thread, nails and implements, a  youthful James Whitaker, the storekeeper's son, says, "I can't help the high  price of coffee -- 20 cents a pound."  </P> <P> He tells a customer: "This tea service, imported from England, is of fine bone  china. It'll run you $6.50. That's expensive. Don't reckon I'll sell much of  them. When I purchased the dishes at a Cincinnati jobber's, my father warned me  not to waste money on frivolities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Practical Pottery  </P> <P> At the edge of town, Isaac Baker and his bride run the pottery store that  supplies the village with practical items such as pitchers and covered jars. He  considers his cabin "a real fine house. It has a wood floor. Lucinda here is  used to a dirt floor."  </P> <P> Stationed before an open hearth, a housewife dressed in typical 1830s attire  brushes away flies as she prepares dinner.  </P> <P> "There's not much you can do about all these flies," she says. "They do fine by  themselves. Indeed it's hot, but if I don't have a fire, I don't get to cook.  You gotta cook if you want to eat, and my boys work hard and sure do get  hungry."  </P> <P> At the Golden Eagle Inn, a bed is 12 1/2 cents a night, meals are 25 cents,  room and board $2 a week. There, travelers exchange news about faraway places,  while the aroma of freshly baked gingerbread and mincemeat pies wafts through  the kitchen doorway.  </P> <P> A guest, glad to rest a spell, shakes his head in dismay, complaining: "There's  no more state land nearby and privately owned land is going for $5 an acre."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pegs and Timbers  </P> <P> The bar, which smells like a barn, originally was erected in Clifton County,  Ind., in 1832. It was dismantled, brought to Conner Prairie and reconstructed  with wooden pegs to fasten the huge timbers.  </P> <P> Down the street, Doc Campbell, who compounds his own medicine, allows that for  occasional surgery he uses whiskey for the men and opium tea for the women.  "Then I just hold them down till it's all over."  </P> <P> For the decorating of Campbell's residence -- there's a grand piano in the  parlor -- research preceded what might appear to be an arbitrary decision.  Paint for the rooms was based on colors advertised in Indianapolis newspapers  during the 1830s. Wallpaper also reflects the period.  </P> <P> Encompassing 288 acres -- including a wooded area, the White River, a prairie,  a natural amphitheater and a nature trail -- Conner Prairie was founded in 1964  by the late Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical heir who donated the William Conner  home and surrounding farmland to Earlham, a liberal-arts college in Richmond,  Ind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Authentic Furnishings  </P> <P> Prairietown, Conner Prairie's 19th-Century village, consists of 39 structures  moved from former Indiana sites. The mansion of William Conner, a prominent  frontiersman, land owner, trader and member of the Indiana Legislature who came  from Ohio in the early 1800s, also was moved to Conner Prairie.  </P> <P> Built on its present foundation in 1823, the home -- listed on the National  Register of Historic Places -- is furnished authentically, including Conner's  game table, his horsehair sofa and his chairs.  </P> <P> On the stairway landing stands an imposing grandfather clock, circa 1830.  According to the guide: "It keeps good time, is set once a week, on Monday." A  delicate sampler, cross-stitched by Martha E. Rust in 1822, hangs in the  hallway.  </P> <P> Almost 100 years old, the bright applique quilt in the master bedroom looks as  if it had just been completed. The trundle bed, too, is spread with an  outstanding quilt, a bold floral design on a gleaming white background, made in  1850.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wool From the Herd  </P> <P> On the Conner estate are three buildings brought here to show what may have  existed on Conner property. The Loom House displays textile arts. Woven bed  ticking, woolen rugs and fancy coverlets are fashioned there for the entire  museum.  </P> <P> Visitors watching the fabric being woven can look out the window at the plant  that colored the yarn and see the sheep that produced the wool.  </P> <P> Down a path, the Spring House, a stone reservoir with walls, is perfect for  storing perishables and stays cool even during hot summer days.  </P> <P> At the Still, several yards beyond, spectators can see the process by which  early settlers distilled corn into whiskey. One bushel of corn could be  converted into three gallons of corn liquor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gallery for Exhibits  </P> <P> The newly opened $9-million Museum Center, with an exterior of Indiana  rubblestone and a bright copper roof, offers exhibits in a 3,000-square-foot  gallery. The current exhibit, a series of sketches called "Drawn to Indiana,"  will run through July 17.  </P> <P> In addition to a central gallery for permanent exhibitions, the center includes  a 100-seat theater, 3,000-volume research library, sky-lit atrium, classrooms  and studios for blacksmiths, potters, woodworkers and restorers.  </P> <P> On the calendar are year-round special programs: Conner Prairie by candlelight  (during Christmas season), winter hearthside suppers in front of the dining  room fireplace at the Conner home (January through March), a Mother's Day  fashion show featuring traditional 19th-Century costumes, and a hot-air balloon  festival (May 27).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Old-Fashioned Sport  </P> <P> Festivities for the Fourth of July, as celebrated in 1836 when the only  national holiday was Independence Day, are full of old-fashioned sport:  political orations, pie-eating and seed-spitting contests, checkers  championships, sack races, brass band, barbershop quartet and a fireworks  display.  </P> <P> On selected weekends, demonstrations of folk art and needlework, plus an  old-time spelling bee with words taken from Noah Webster's 1831 speller  highlight aspects of pioneer days.  </P> <P> During the summer, the Indianapolis Symphony performs concerts on Wednesday and  Saturday evenings.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Conner Prairie, six miles north of Interstate 465 at the Allisonville Road  exit, is open April through November, Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5  p.m.; noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday, closed Tuesdays in April and November.  </P> <P> For more information, contact Conner Prairie, 13400 Allisonville Road,  Noblesville, Ind. 46060, (317) 776-6000.  </P></p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome The Wellcome share sale was always likely to face sniping from institutions which benefited from the traditional method of selling equity in the UK, including the lucrative system of sub-underwriting. Last week's sudden cut in the price at which the issue was supported, leading to an 18p fall in the shares on Tuesday, seemed to offer the critics further ammunition. However, US-style support or stabilisation is meant only to smooth the progress of an issue absorbing shares not held firmly by investors. By maintaining the support price at 800p the lead manager felt itself in danger of creating a false market. As the chart shows, Wellcome had outperformed a falling market by 4 per cent in the previous week. This was clearly more than is implied by stabilisation. It remains to be seen whether Wellcome will now find a firm floor. The shares closed the week at 787p, only 1 per cent behind the market since the issue started trading on July 27. Of the 40.5m shares available to the lead manager for stabilisation, perhaps 15m are still held in reserve. Perhaps more important, they were trading comfortably above the new 777p support price, suggesting a fragile equilibrium of buyers and sellers. However, the quality of placement achieved by the book building process remains unproven. Some institutions must be expected to take profits if the shares rise above the 800p sale price. Other than a couple of large liquidations by UK institutions, however, there was little sign of nervous selling last week.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (13): Making painful progress  -Mobile data services / Technical and marketing issues have constrained the market for mobile data services surprisingly, perhaps - when I was over in France for the fiftieth anniversary of D-Day. It would have been easier if I had taken a laptop computer with me. Things would have been easier still if I could have checked out various bits of information for my article by accessing, over my laptop, the Financial Times Profile information database. Once completed, I could have sent my article down the telephone wire to the Financial Times at Southwark Bridge in London. The technology and the service providers already exist to send and receive messages over computers using radio signals. In the UK, for example, there are three mobile data network operators. But the commercial implementation of mobile data has been painfully slow, particularly compared to mobile telephones. There are 2.3m cellular telephone users in the UK today - equal to four per cent of the population. Mobile data operators, on the other hand, have only 5,500 subscribers. A variety of technical and marketing issues have constrained the market for mobile data since IT and telecommunications companies developed the first technologies in the early early 1980s. A report, Mobile Data: Market Strategies, by Ovum, the London information technology and telecoms consultancy, lists six reasons why mobile data has not lived up to expectations. They are: Lack of confidence in technology. Availability of networks. Lack of suitable terminals. Solutions and applications. The weakness of systems integration. Market education. On the technology side, a lack of suitable terminals and inadequate software systems has been a problem. Mobile data terminals come in two generic forms: specialist terminals; and general terminals with separate mobile data modems to allow them to communicate over the mobile data network. One of the main reasons for implementing a mobile data system is to extend corporate network facilities to new groups of users, and in particular, mobile field forces. Users have found that specialist terminals do not have the same software capabilities as corporate systems. Those terminals which do have software packages that match corporate networks tend to be expensive. Price is also an issue for users who are considering buying radio modems for their laptop PCs. Radio modems are larger and more expensive than their fixed network counterparts. They are built as separate pieces of hardware rather than incorporated into terminals. Portable modems are about the same price as portable PCs. Martin Garner, a telecoms consultant and mobile data specialist at Ovum, believes the failure to attract widespread support from systems integrators and software developers has been an important reason for mobile data's slow growth. The Ovum report notes that 'the leading users in mobile data tend to be very large organisations because of the difficulty and costs associated with engineering a mobile data system.' Large organisations have their own sophisticated systems integration expertise in house, and have long-standing relationships with external systems integrators. Confusion over the choice of network also affect the market: in the UK, for example, there are too many networks - users are not clear about the best choice of networks and services, and therefore delay buying-decisions until clear winners emerge. The Deparment of Trade and Industry awarded five mobile data network licences in 1990. But two of the licensees handed back their licences and a third built a network and then shut it down because it had no subscribers. This leaves two mobile data operators, Cognito and Ram Mobile Data. A third mobile data operator, Paknet, was awarded a licence in 1992. But the confusion does not end there. Cellular operators Cellnet and Vodafone offer mobile data services over their Tacs-900 analogue cellular networks. They will soon begin offering improved data services over their GSM digital cellular networks. The UK's two other cellular operators, Mercury One-2-One and Orange are also planning to offer mobile data services. In addition, National Band Three, the national public access mobile radio operator, and a number of regional pamr operators, also offer data services. As a general rule, analogue cellular networks are less suited to mobile data services than digital cellular networks. Data is transferred using circuit-switched transmission, which is less efficient than packet-switched transmission over GSM networks. On the other hand, GSM is still relatively new - the first services were not launched until 1992 and the various data transmission capabilities within the standard have not yet been implemented. Analogue cellular networks tend to be suited to long data transmissions such as fax and file transfer. One of the first data services over GSM will be short messaging, which is the same principle as radio-paging. The UK's three dedicated mobile data networks all use different system. Cognito uses a packet-switched data protocol and has positioned itself as a provider of relatively uncomplicated data services such as two-way messaging. Paknet runs a standard X25 packet switched data service. It is used mainly for fixed applications such as electronic funds transfer at the point of sale (Eftpos) and does not handle mobility features such as hand-off between cells. Ram Mobile Data uses a proprietary system, developed by Nokia of Sweden, called Mobitex. This is also a packet-switched data system. Its main advantage is that the network can be used by users of fixed or mobile terminals, and by both open and closed groups of users. In other European countries, however, there have not been enough networks - some countries have only licensed their first mobile data operators within the last year. Meanwhile, Mobitex is rapidly emerging as the preferred system for mobile data operators across Europe. Mobile data operators in eight countries - Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, the UK, have now adopted this system. They are planning to introduce 'roaming' between networks, allowing subscribers in one country to use networks in other countries. The only potential challenger to Mobitex is Motorola's RD-LAP systems, which is used by Deutsche Telekom in Germany. It is also used by Hutchison, the UK mobile data operator which shut down its network last year. Motorola is now considering buying the network from Hutchison, to operate it as a joint venture with Cognito. In spite of the problems that mobile data has faced, operators and manufacturers remain confident that the market will grow rapidly. Ovum predicts that the number of mobile data subscribers in Europe and North America will multiply 25 times between 1994 and 2000 to reach just over 18m. The early adopters of mobile data have been vertical markets such as police forces and airlines. British Airways, for example, uses mobile data to check in passengers. But over the last year, Microsoft, Novell and other software companies have brought out products which will fuel growth in horizontal markets. Laptop computers with built-in radio modems could be standard items for journalists by the time the one-hundredth anniversary of D-day is commemorated on the Normandy beaches.</p>

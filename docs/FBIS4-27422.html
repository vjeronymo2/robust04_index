			<p>BFN     [Text] At a House of Representatives' Budget Committee  meeting on 30 May, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was asked about  the collapse of talks between the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) and Pyongyang over the inspection of fuel rods  being removed from a nuclear reactor in the DPRK. Hata said:  "I have repeatedly asked the United States and South Korea to  tenaciously talk with Pyongyang. On the other hand, I have  asked North Korea to consider the anxiety in the international  community." He then stressed that he intended to work with  concerned nations to resolve the nuclear issue through talks  with Pyongyang.    Hata also said: "I have told Pyongyang (if the country  agrees to settle the issue through talks) Japan will help  improve the DPRK's living standards together with the United  States, South Korea, and China." In this way, he indicated that  North Korea would be offered multinational support and  cooperation if it agreed to resolve the issue through dialogue.    Hata was answering questions from Yoshio Hachiro (a member  of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan).    Concerning the fuel rod removal Pyongyang has arbitrarily  carried out, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also said: "If the  situation remains as it is now, it will become difficult in the  next few days to confirm the fuel rod exchange," indicating the  nuclear problem would reach the crucial point in the next few  days.</p>

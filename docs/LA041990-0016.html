			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 40 PROTEST CSUN LEADER'S REFUSAL TO BAN ROTC  </P> <P> About 40 students and faculty members blocked the main entrance of the Cal  State Northridge administration building for more than two hours Wednesday,  protesting the university president's decision to retain the ROTC program after  faculty members voted to ban it.  </P> <P> Chanting "ROTC go away. Racist, sexist, anti-gay," the demonstrators wore CSUN  sweat shirts stenciled with the word "discriminates" in Day-Glo orange and  carried banners that read, "Where is democracy at CSUN?" and "When some are  oppressed, none are free."  </P> <P> CSUN faculty members last month voted to abolish the Reserve Officers' Training  Corps program, in which 42 students are enrolled, because of the U.S. Defense  Department's exclusion of those who are openly homosexual from military  service. But that recommendation was overturned Monday by CSUN President James  W. Cleary.  </P> <P> Demonstrators argued that CSUN would not tolerate a program that discriminated  against women or minorities, so it should not allow one that discriminates  against homosexuals.  </P> <P> "Discrimination is the same whether it's blacks, Latinos, women or  homosexuals," said Zeke Zeidler, a 1987 CSUN graduate and former student body  president. "The only difference is homophobia is acceptable in our society."  </P> <P> The students, many of whom are members of the Lesbian and Gay Alliance,  demanded that Cleary reconsider. But Cleary, who was at an off-campus meeting  Wednesday morning, said by telephone that his decision was circumscribed by a  legal opinion from an attorney for the California State University system. That  opinion found, in part, that states do not have the right to overrule federal  policy.  </P> <P> "It's virtually impossible in my position to change a decision based on legal  advice from the legal counsel for the entire system," he said.  </P> <P> However, the statewide Academic Senate is scheduled to vote on gutting ROTC  programs at all CSU campuses during its May 3-4 meeting in Long Beach.  </P> <P> The recommendation up for review avoids the legal challenges of trying to ban  ROTC by instead calling for removal of any mention of ROTC programs from  college catalogues and other campus publications, refusal of credit for  ROTC-related courses and denial of faculty status for ROTC instructors.  </P> <P> Ray Geigle, senate chairman, said that "the practical effect would be to  eliminate ROTC on the campuses." Recommendations from the Academic Senate are  usually routinely approved by the CSU Board of Trustees, Geigle said.  </P> <P> At a rally after Wednesday's protest, Jon Davidson, an attorney for the  American Civil Liberties Union told students that he is examining past  decisions regarding states' rights and may file a lawsuit against Cleary and  the university.  </P> <P> "President Cleary's arguments are nothing but excuses," Davidson said.  </P> <P> Although Wednesday's turnout was meager compared to anti-Vietnam War marches at  the university in the '60s and '70s, observers said it was one of the largest  protests in recent campus history.  </P> <P> "Students aren't used to demonstrating," Prof. John Clendenning said. "Twenty  years ago, there would've been a massive demonstration."  </P> <P> Administrators gained access to their offices by using back and side doors. But  one protest organizer, senior Mat Rudieck, 24, said the intent was not to  prevent people from getting to work.  </P> <P> "Our point is to make it inconvenient for people," he said.  </P> <P> After the rally, Rudieck and other students discussed plans to continue the  protest today, possibly in a speech to the faculty senate.  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Technology: Sealed with innovation - Advances at an Austrian group are helping industry It is difficult even for engineers to get excited about seals, the rubber or plastic rings that are fitted at joints in fluid pipes to prevent leakage. But this is a business with a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) annual worldwide turnover and vital to the functioning of most industrial machinery. It is now being shaken up by a small Austrian company, Economos, that has achieved an impressive series of innovations in materials and production technologies and distribution methods. There are thousands of seal types and sizes, and customers expect their distributors to keep stocks available of most of them. Seal makers, too, put pressure on distributors to buy large stocks. This is because their production technology and injection moulding encourages them to make large batches. In the mid-1980s, Helmut Mayerhofer, founder of Economos, and his associates began investigating the possibility of developing compounds that could be machined on a numerically controlled lathe. When an order came in for a small quantity of an item not in stock, they could simply take a rough block of polyurethane or synthetic rubber and turn the required few pieces. The problem was that few existing polyurethane compounds could be machined and those that could were not flexible enough to make suitable seals. They approached the Department of Material Science and Material Testing of the Mining University of Leoben in Styria in 1988 for help, and within a year a formula was found that would produce a machinable polyurethane material suitable for seals. Meanwhile, Economos, working with a plastic machine maker, developed a process for extruding the material into rough seal moulds - which resemble lengths of pipe - in industrial quantities. The challenge in producing material for seals and extruding it into rough shapes is that the finished product must have highly consistent elastic properties and be free of bubbles. Achieving these aims becomes more difficult as the desired diameter of the seal increases. The company's third innovation was the development of a lathe, cutting tools and software for machining the rough stock into precisely dimensioned seals. Economos considers these developments to be so valuable that it does not allow any employee to learn both the chemical and production aspects of the technology. Moreover, it has not taken out patents, fearing that competitors would quickly find ways of getting around them. An unexpected benefit came as a result of the speed and degree of automation of the company's lathe. It can machine a seal in about a minute, slice it off the rough stock and immediately machine another from remaining stock. This meant the system could be applied more widely than originally anticipated. Economos can use it to produce normal volumes as well as occasional seals. Since production could be done in response to orders, why not set up for business as close to the customers as possible? Under that model, distributors would no longer need to carry large stocks, making possible lower prices and higher margins. Machinery producers might even be tempted to abandon the stocking and supply of replacement seals. In the past two years, Economos has set up, together with local partners, what might be termed seal service centres worldwide. Economos supplies the rough blocks of material and the lathes, while the local entrepreneur, under a franchise agreement, machines and delivers seals in response to orders. So far, there are 250 such centres operating with the brand name Seal-Jet. Ernst Stocker, Economos managing director, estimates their combined annual sales at about Dollars 120m. Economos had revenues last year of Sch420m (Pounds 23m) almost all of it from selling machines and materials. It is now revising its strategy to gain greater control of the seal service businesses outside Austria.</p>

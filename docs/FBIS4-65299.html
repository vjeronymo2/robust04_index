			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F> Fini by Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "One Oscar  Too Many in the Negotiations"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Guiglia] What was the  most delicate moment in the formation of the new government?    [Fini] Paradoxically when I said that I was perplexed about  the Northern League at the Viminale [Interior Ministry]. I  could have said a definite no, but I did not because I was  against vetoes. The League behaved the same way when it opposed  Dini as budget minister, but not to the point of making the  government drown. Everybody did his part in his own way. In  the end good sense prevailed: [Interior Minister] Maroni  obviously confirmed that the unity of Italy was not under  discussion and that our attitude had changed. Delaying things  would have meant weakening the governing body and doing the Left  a favor. The Right decided to render its services to the  nation. We will demonstrate the rest with our ministers who are  already at work.    [Guiglia] Well, the five hours spent in Berlusconi's house  cannot have been idyllic. What was the bone of contention  between you and the Knight [Berlusconi nickname]?    [Fini] I considered the choice of Previti as justice  minister  to be inopportune. Berlusconi was not of the same opinion. In  those very hours a letter from the head of state arrived  concerning the "principles" to be respected in the choice of  ministers. However, the prime minister-designate and myself  were never at a standoff, not even on the choices of our  ministries.    [Guiglia] What was your reaction to [President] Scalfaro's  intervention?    [Fini] That letter had been announced, but, of course, we  were curious and wanted to read it word by word. There were no  vetoes. There was some "batting" as we interpreted it.    [Guiglia] But did the head of state do the right thing by  writing or not?    [Fini] It did not matter. It was something for future  reference. Berlusconi did well to tell Maroni to "ideally sign"  his confirmation.    [Guiglia] What weight did Scalfaro have in the negotiations?    [Fini] He had some weight.    [Guiglia] New Chamber of Deputies and Senate speakers, new  government, new legislature. Can the "old" president stay at  the Quirinale [office of the president]?    [Fini] This is not on the agenda.    [Guiglia] Not on the agenda or not a problem?    [Fini] I have already answered.    [Guiglia] How do you judge [League Secretary] Bossi and  Berlusconi after 10 days of repeated face-to-face encounters.    [Fini] I think I have discovered that Bossi is by no means  superficial, even though at times he expresses himself in a  simple or simplistic manner. As for Berlusconi, he is an  unusual businessman: He talks a great deal but he also listens  a great deal. He is incredibly patient, an able mediator.    [Guiglia] Are you dealing out compliments to make the  government last?    [Fini] There is no need to. Either the boat continues to go  ahead or it sinks and we all drown. The government was born  under a common banner of respect and responsibility.    [Guiglia] What were the "real" steps in the turning point of  the MSI [Italian Social Movement]?    [Fini] The list could begin with a good MSI performance on 5  April 1992. However, it was [former President] Cossiga's blows  and the bribery scandals that acted as the detonators of a  corrupt and party-system regime. The last shiver I felt was on  11 December when I announced to the central committee that I had  gone to the Fosse Ardeatine [site of Nazi retaliation  slaughter]. Would the response be an embarrassing silence or  applause? They responded with applause and with a standing  ovation; at least most stood. This was when National Alliance  was born, and I was certain that the MSI would have followed me.  To the Palazzo Chigi [government seat].</p>

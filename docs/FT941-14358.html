			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Greece softens stance on conditions for EU entry The Greek presidency of the European Union yesterday disavowed a proposal it made last week to limit EU regional aid available to the remote and poorer regions of the Nordic and Alpine countries which are negotiating entry to the union. The proposal, which would have had most effect on Norway and Sweden, the two countries most reticent on membership, could have complicated negotiations which have to be completed by March 1 to keep to the deadline of entry in January next year. Yesterday, however, Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European affairs minister, said of the proposal that 'it's not our position, it's simply a working paper'. The confidential January 10 paper, nevertheless, is clearly described as a 'presidency proposal'. Mr Pangalos, who presented the Greek presidency's work programme to the European Parliament yesterday, is to visit Sweden, Finland and Norway from tomorrow for talks on the enlargement talks. On the sensitive issues of regional and agricultural subsidies and how much the four applicants should contribute to the EU budget, the minister insisted 'there is no Greek proposal at the moment, and there won't be until we've completed our talks with the candidate countries'. The European Commission yesterday agreed on the shareout of the Ecu14bn (Dollars 15.5bn) social fund for 1994-99, which is aimed mainly at combating long-term and youth unemployment. The Ecu14bn goes principally to those countries with the largest number of unemployed, excepting Greece, Portugal, Ireland and more than half of Spain, which, as relatively poorer areas, are entitled to more generous EU structural aid. The UK share will be Ecu3.4bn, France gets Ecu3.2bn, Germany gets Ecu1.9bn, Spain Ecu1.8bn and Italy Ecu1.7bn. The social fund is mainly for training and retraining the unemployed, but part of it can now be used to retrain workers who work in industries vulnerable to structural change.</p>

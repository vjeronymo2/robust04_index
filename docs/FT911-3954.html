			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Leading Article: The case for road pricing IMAGINE a supermarket which introduced a Pounds 10 entry fee and halved the prices of its goods. Demand from its customers would soar, its shelves would be stripped bare, and it would quickly go out of business. As the last shoppers staggered home under the burden of their purchases, they might remark that the proprietor had a poor understanding of the way markets work. It could never be. And yet, it is argued, something similar happens on the roads. People pay a high price up front to buy, tax and insure motor cars, then find that the marginal cost of using them amounts to little more than the cost of the fuel consumed. The result is that they drive too much. This mattered less when fewer people were able to afford the motoring market's entry fee. But as prosperity has risen, and with it the number of vehicles owned, many countries are finding that the pace of traffic growth is outstripping their ability to increase their road network. The problem is particularly acute in densely-populated Britain. Congestion is already serious in most urban areas and on many trunk routes. And according to Department of Transport forecasts, the number of vehicle miles being driven will be two-and-a-half times greater in 35 years. Although a portion of the growth can be accommodated by roadbuilding, environmental considerations now rule this out in many built-up areas, and it is becoming an increasingly difficult option elsewhere. So something is going to have to restrain demand. Discriminating use One way of achieving this would be to encourage more discriminating use of the available road space by eliminating distortions from the market. At present, motorists do not pay the full social costs of their driving because they make no direct contribution towards the cost of road deaths and injuries, towards the environmental costs of noise, visual intrusion and atmospheric pollution, or towards the cost of congestion itself. The solution could be a system of charging drivers on a pay-as-you-go basis. Electronic devices in vehicles would respond with roadside devices to clock up charges against drivers according to type of vehicle, time of day and amount of road space consumed. Vehicle owners would receive a quarterly bill as they do for gas, electricity and telephone charges. Political difficulties The idea is not far-fetched. An electronic system was developed and tested for a pilot project in Hong Kong. It achieved reductions in peak-time traffic of up to 24 per cent. But the experiment was dropped on civil rights arguments because the technology allowed people's movements to be tracked. The logic for road pricing seems inescapable. Certainly it is preferable to rationing vehicle ownership or allowing congestion to regulate the imbalance between supply and demand. Yet progress towards it must recognise the political difficulties of introducing a charge for something which, like air, consumers have grown accustomed to receiving free. Acceptance will be more likely if road users are convinced that other options have been exhausted. This is not yet the case. The government's heavily-expanded roadbuilding programme will relieve some trunk road congestion. In urban areas, where congestion is most pressing, much could be achieved through measures such as tougher enforcement of parking restrictions, better control over road works, and taxation of company-provided car parking spaces. Nevertheless, the breathing space is limited. One city - Cambridge - has already decided that the only way to solve its congestion problems is to go it alone with a road pricing scheme of its own. Others may soon follow. The government has so far stood back from the road pricing issue. It should no longer do so. An embarrassing failure of road pricing in Cambridge or elsewhere would exacerbate the difficulty of introducing the scheme more widely. The government should lend its support to the Cambridge experiment and do what it can to ensure it succeeds.</p>

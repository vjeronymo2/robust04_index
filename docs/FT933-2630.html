			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: AB Ports advances strongly to Pounds 29m - Property side now well placed to produce a positive contribution SHARES OF Associated British Ports Holdings rose 16p to 452p yesterday on news of a near-doubling of profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 29.4m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. However, the comparable figure reflected a Pounds 10m property development provision. Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said that following the Pounds 83.6m total provision made in 1992, the property business was well-placed to produce a positive contribution. Operating profits from property development were Pounds 1m following a loss of Pounds 1.6m last time, while profits from property investment rose to Pounds 5.4m from Pounds 4.5m. Port related property profits contributed Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 9.8m). Operating profits from the ports and transport sector were Pounds 28.4m after taking a Pounds 4m charge for severance payments, mainly at Southampton Container Terminals, where manpower has been cut from 461 to 349. This was down on last year, when the sector had profits of Pounds 32.5m after Pounds 2m of severance costs. Sir Keith said the company now employed 1,800 people at its 22 ports, a reduction of about two-thirds in 10 years. There would be further severance costs, he predicted, but nothing like on the same scale. The amount of cargo in tonnes passing through the ports had remained constant, said Sir Keith, but an improvement that emerged towards the end of the half year had been maintained in July and August. Steel, timber and containers were higher, but coal imports were much lower. Sir Keith added that the car trade had been strong in both directions. Production from the Toyota Derby factory was being exported through Grimsby. Group turnover was slightly ahead at Pounds 108.9m (Pounds 108.1m). Net interest payments were down to Pounds 17.8m from Pounds 20.8m. The group had a tax charge of Pounds 7.2m or 24.5 per cent, reflecting capital and other allowances. Previously tax was Pounds 4.6m, or 30.5 per cent. Net borrowings were Pounds 359m (Pounds 349m) giving unchanged gearing at 60 per cent. Earnings per share improved to 11.9p (5.7p), although before the property development provision last year's earnings were 9.6p. The interim dividend is being raised from 3.25p to 3.5p. COMMENT Clearing the decks with a large property provision might have pushed ABP into the red last year, but it has enabled a clearer picture to emerge this year. The group is sensibly planning to concentrate its property investment business on land near its ports. It also reports good progress with lettings in the property development side, which has moved out of the red at the operating level. At the same time income from the ports is holding up well. The problems with Southampton Container Terminals are over, and from now on any severance costs should be insignificant. Full-year pre-tax earnings of around Pounds 60m will give a p/e of about 19 - justifiable if the ports business continues untouched by European recession and the property business continues to improve.</p>

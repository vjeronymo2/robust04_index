			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Books: Suitable cases for dramatic treatment - Fiction DREAMERS by Elaine Feinstein Macmillan Pounds 15.99, 339 pages CONSEQUENCES by Helen Muir Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 15.99, 231 pages Elaine Feinstein's last novel, Loving Brecht, was a delicate, low-key evocation of a city, Berlin, in a period of turmoil. It approached its subject glancingly, telling the story of the playwright Bertolt Brecht through the eyes of a nightclub singer who had a long affair with him. Feinstein's new novel, Dreamers, is also about a city, this time 19th-century Vienna. It is more obviously historical, opening like an old Hollywood movie with the announcement of a date - 1848, year of revolutions  -which tells us what kind of narrative to expect. This is followed by a piece of celluloid scene-setting, a portentous authorial announcement which cries out for accompanying martial music: 'It was a February morning in Vienna. The wind was blowing savagely from the east and a little snow was settling on the domes of green and bronze in the First District'. From this panoramic view, Feinstein sweeps down to focus first on the houses, cake shops and coffee houses of the rich, then on the servants who are hard at work ministering to them. These cinematic techniques are used throughout the book, cutting abruptly from the grandest of town houses to the garrets of the poor, from noisy crowd scenes to a child's deathbed. Most of Feinstein's characters are Jewish and her ambitious aim is to plot their struggle to survive and prosper as Metternich is overthrown and a new, more liberal order seems to be in the making in Austria. Unfortunately, Dreamers has more than technique in common with the Hollywood costume dramas of the 1930s and '40s. People rush in and out making terse announcements: 'Revolution in Paris. Barricades have gone up in the streets. Royal troops have fired on the crowd.' The chief characters are a lovely but mysterious orphan, Clara, who cannot remember her origins; a child prodigy, Joseph, whose talent in playing the violin elevates him to international stardom; and Anton, the literary, left-leaning son of a fabulously wealthy banker. The novel spans 16 years of their lives without ever really bringing them alive as they move on and off Feinstein's richly-decorated sets like pretty, lovingly-crafted puppets. Helen Muir's novel is constructed not like a Hollywood costume drama but a TV soap opera. Its characters are as unlikely as those in Dreamers; and its title, Consequences, suggests that they are all taking part in an elaborate comedy of manners. Muir is best at dialogue, especially the jerky speech of a woman who has summoned up the courage to call a man who might not be interested in her: 'Hello. I wondered how you were. You . . . you said you were going to ring me but you haven't. You sound a bit muffled at your end. Can you hear me? Have you got somebody there?' Most of the characters meet at a ghastly singles club off the Cromwell Road, the men looking for sex and the women seeking something more romantic. Yet the novel cannot decide whether its keynote is farce or pathos, cruelly guying a character on one page and a moment later soliciting sympathy on his or her behalf. Much of the plot stems from an incident at the club in which Leonard, a narcoleptic cartoon animator, tramples on his dancing partner, an overdressed blonde in grey lame who turns out to be a captain in the Life Guards. These are easy targets and it is a pity that Muir has settled for belly laughs rather than something which might really engage readers' hearts.</p>

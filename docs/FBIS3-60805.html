They were carrying machine guns and pistols,  which they used to shoot citizens, terrorizing them when they  tried to confront and chase them.    Witnesses said the criminals laid an ambush for the tourist  bus. One of them threw an explosive device at the bus,  shattering the front, back, and side windscreens of the vehicle.  But the driver did not stop and sped away from the scene.    Eyewitnesses also affirmed that the three criminals fled  through a side street leading to the Corniche Road.</p>

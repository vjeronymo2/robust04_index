			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Unfinished revolution Few men, if any, have transformed their country upon attaining supreme power at the age of 73. When the country that has been transformed is home to more than a fifth of the world's people, the achievement is of far more than local significance. Arguably, Deng Xiaoping's role in liberalising the Chinese economy makes him the world's most significant political leader of the second half of the 20th century. But his failure is on almost as grand a scale as his successes. A yawning gulf has opened up between what, as a Marxist, he would describe as the economic base and the political superstructure. China's future, perhaps even the world's, depends on whether, and how, that gulf is closed. Mao Zedong would be at the head of any list of history's ideological fanatics. Deng, with his insistence on the need to seek truth from facts, is the supreme pragmatist. His invention of 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' was a stroke of genius. He knew that the capitalist rose could smell as sweet under a socialist label. What mattered to him was not ideological consistency, but unleashing the talent and drive of the Chinese people. Under Deng, the market has been brought into China, while China has erupted on to the global economy. Between 1977 and 1993, China's measured gross domestic product rose more than fourfold; the dollar value of its exports increased tenfold; and the annual inflow of direct investment rose from virtually nothing to Dollars 26bn. Above all, hundreds of millions have experienced a transformation in how they live now, and how they hope to live tomorrow. China's economic success has also transformed what the economic development of east Asia, hitherto confined to relatively small countries, signifies for the world as whole. This is no longer just another change in the distribution of global economic activity. It heralds the end of roughly half a millennium of European dominance. The 21st century will, it is said, be the Pacific century. More probably, it will be China's century. The question is what sort of China this will be. A price has had to be paid for Deng's pragmatism, just as a far greater one had to be paid for Mao's fanaticism. He has let sleeping political dogs lie. But whenever they wake, they bite. The price includes a party without its ideological raison d'etre; a society without the rule of law; and a political system without checks and balances. The massacre in Tiananmen Square is a black mark against Deng's name. It was a sign of panic. But it was a sign, too, of his failure to adapt the political system to the changes brought about by China's economic success. It may be that Deng had, in truth, no realistic choice. He is, to his credit, no arbitrary despot prepared, like a Mao or a Stalin, to butcher his opponents in millions. He wooed the Communist party, which they cowed. But this failure to secure political reform, or even a credible successor, leaves his legacy vulnerable to chaos, or reversal. The probability, in fact, is that those policies will not be reversed. To do so would require determination and bloodshed on a horrifying scale. Chaos is understandably feared by the Chinese. But the problem is as likely to be a different one: the arrival on the world stage of a giant economic power that is also an arbitrary, often a xenophobic, despotism. Grim for the Chinese, this would be fearful for everyone else. Deng, 90 yesterday, has clearly failed to rise to the challenge of political reform. For China's sake, as well as that of the rest of the world, his successors must not fail too.</p>

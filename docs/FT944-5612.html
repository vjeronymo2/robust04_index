			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: AAH shares tumble on warning - Fleet of refuse trucks played part in healthcare group's setback A setback in its environmental services division contributed to a 14 per cent fall in interim profits at AAH, the pharmaceuticals distribution and retailing group. The shares fell 48p to close at 336p. Mr John Padovan, chairman, warned that profits for the full year would be below last year's levels as pre-tax figure for the six months to the end of September fell from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 16.4m. Operating profits at the environmental services division, which supplies services and equipment to local authorities, fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 800,000 on sales of Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 36.6m). Mr Bill Revell, chief executive, blamed the setback mainly on the performance of the hire fleet of rubbish and street-sweeping trucks. This had now been chopped by two-thirds to 110 vehicles. The second half is traditionally poorer for the division, so a recovery is not expected. While the business is not up for sale, 'we are not wedded to any part of it if we don't see a long-term future', Mr Revell said. Group sales moved ahead from Pounds 773.1m to Pounds 798.6m. The latest figure includes Pounds 5.9m from acquisitions and Pounds 1.5m from discontinued operations, while the previous figure includes Pounds 47.6m from the building supplies operation sold to Travis Perkins in March. Mr Revell said the absence of profits from the building supplies business had also contributed to the first-half setback. In addition lower gains on property disposals and increased pension contributions had cost Pounds 1m. Operating profits from the healthcare division, which accounts for more than 91 per cent of total sales, improved from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 17.1m, although net margins eased from 2.6 to 2.4 per cent. Sales were Pounds 717.9m (Pounds 642.7m). Mr Revell said the group had 'no problem with sales - the key is to get the cost of handling sales down'. The group is in the middle of a rationalisation programme in its wholesale distribution business, for which a Pounds 5m provision was made last year. So far Pounds 1.4m has been spent, and the number of branches cut by six to 18. By March 1996, the group plans to have 15 branches, of which seven will be fully automated. The group has acquired 17 further pharmacies since March, taking the total to 305. Earnings per share fell to 12.2p (14.7p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 6p. COMMENT The extent of the problems at AAH is reflected in the sharp downward revision of City forecasts for the full year from around Pounds 42m to Pounds 36m. Any reasons for being in the environmental services sector have disappeared, and in any case the pressures on local authorities are unlikely to go away. The management, quite right to sell the building supplies operation, should ask itself why it is in any business outside the healthcare division, which accounts for more than 91 per cent of sales. Even here, the rationalisation and modernisation taking place is affecting performance while the group catches up with the competition. However, the healthcare business is performing reasonably well in a growth market. On a prospective multiple of around 12, this might prove enough of a lure to hold on for better times.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- China is to set up a  standardized unemployment registration and supervision system  within two years, according to Zhang Xiaojian, the head of the  Employment Department of the Labor Ministry of China.    Speaking at the national employment meeting here, Zhang said  that the expected system will help create a solid labor market  for the development of China's market economy.    He said that China will this year choose 100 enterprises and  ten cities nationwide to try out the system and will trace the  development of their overall unemployment rate, long-term  unemployment rate, under-employment rate and other economic  figures.    Meanwhile, China will refer to internationally adopted  practices in analyzing and supervising labor markets, the  official said.    China will also promulgate a set of macro unemployment  insurance regulations that suit the country's real conditions so  as to standardize management of the labor market.    Official statistics show that, in addition to 130 million  surplus rural laborers, China has 4.1 million jobless urban  workers, or 2.6 percent of the total urban workforce.    China's employment situation is extremely difficult, and the  country now is faced with unprecedented challenges in deploying  all the jobless, said Li Boyong, Chinese minister of labor.    To keep the government well informed on the true picture of  the country's unemployment and labor supply and demand, China  will strive to register the unemployed and give out unemployment  relief and employment services according to their particular  circumstances.    Zhang said that economic progress is the way to provide for  expanded employment, adding that the collective economy and the  service sector are expected to be the chief absorbers of the  unemployed. He said that China will do its utmost to keep the  unemployment rate in the vicinity of three percent.</p>

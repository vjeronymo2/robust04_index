			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, member of the Palestinian </F> National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and date not given;  from the "With The Midday Events" program--recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni: The families of  Palestinian detainees and prisoners are staging protest marches.  What are you doing as a Palestinian leadership?    [Al-Husayni] In fact, we are facing a problem over the  interpretation of the agreement that was signed in Gaza, as well  as the agreement that was signed in Cairo first and then in  Gaza. Our view of this agreement is that 5,000 Palestinian  prisoners should be released before 11 June and that all  Palestinian detainees should return home, except those involved  in criminal cases -- murders or ordinary criminal cases; those  should be turned over to the Palestinian Authority. We were  surprised that the Israelis interpreted this as meaning that he  who killed a [Israeli] civilian is covered by this formula.  They then came back to add that he who injured a [Israeli]  civilian is covered by that formula even if he was tried at a  military court. We now want to have, once again, a distinction;  that what we were talking about was the criminal aspects and not  the military cases, which, as is well known, had reasons  connected to the confrontation with the occupation and ended  with the signing of the peace process and should not remain  unresolved.    As regards the other prisoners, negotiations on their  release  must start immediately after 11 June. Now because of this  Israeli position, we demanded an end to the prisoner release  according to the Israeli way. The prisoners should be released  according to our concept, or a new agreement must be drafted  with the Israelis on the way the prisoners should be released.  We and the prisoners will be facing major complications if we  accept the Israeli concept.    What I would like to clarify here for our brother prisoners  is that their cause is one of our priorities. We insist that in  the end all Palestinian prisoners must be released and returned  home. This is a peace process and within this context -- the  peace process -- all Palestinians must be released regardless of  the acts they committed.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal, the security liaison committee will  meet today in Gaza to discuss this issue. Are there any  proposals on the agenda?    [Al-Husayni] Yes. We are supposed to raise at this meeting  the issue which we are facing in Jericho. A large number of  Palestinians who were released should return to their homes  immediately. The formula agreed upon in the past -- that is;  he who killed a Palestinian must remain in Jericho -- means  that he should remain in Jericho only if his leaving to his  place of residence would cause problems. But if his leaving to  his place of residence does not create anything that may harm  the security of that person, then he must return to his home.  Those who were arrested for wounding or harming others, these  must return immediately, even if this is done gradually, but  they must return because their cases are resolved.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Husayni, how many prisoners have been released  so far on the basis of the Cairo agreement?    [Al-Husayni] So far, less than half the number have been  released, that is less than 2,500 prisoners. Some 300 prisoners  are now in Jericho, and at least half of them must go  immediately to their homes.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni, naturally you are now  making arrangements in preparations for Yasir 'Arafat's arrival  in the self-rule area. Has 'Arafat informed you of the date of  his arrival and have you informed the Israeli authorities of  'Arafat's date of arrival?    [Al-Husayni] I can say that it will be in the second half of  this month, not before 15 June.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni, thank you.    [Al-Husayni] Thank you.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Newspaper Publishing in the black but warns on outlook NEWSPAPER Publishing, the owner of The Independent and Independent on Sunday, has moved into profit in the first half after more than a year of significant losses. The company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 465,000 in the six months to March 29, which compared with a loss of Pounds 6.46m in the same period last year. The 1991 loss did, however, include exceptional items of Pounds 1.9m. However, Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, the newly appointed chairman, warned yesterday that 'in the absence of the long-expected economic recovery it will be difficult to sustain this positive result in the second half of the year.' Sir Ralf said The Independent held its own in the face of considerable promotional activity by its competitors and that sales of the Independent on Sunday had risen, in spite a cover price increase in December. Turnover amounted to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 40.8m). Earnings per share of 2.2p compared with losses of 45p last time and 64.2p in the full year to end-September 1991. Sir Ralf said the company had started to reap the benefits of the efforts taken last year to reduce costs. Repayment of substantial bank loans out of last year's rights issue had also helped the profit and loss account.</p>

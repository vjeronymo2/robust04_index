			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to the Council </F> of Ministers at the Palace of the Congress in Luanda on 21  February -- recorded]    [Text] Dear Prime Minister and distinguished members of the  Council of Ministers: Today, we shall analyze the government's  social and economic program that defines economic, social, and  institutional policies, goals, and measures for 1994.    This work has been done by a technical commission made up of  more than 10 economists and some jurists. That commission was  led by the secretary of state for planning and the deputy  finance minister, with the help of the Council of Ministers  assistant secretary.    That commission has proposed that prices be readjusted. In  other words, there must be changes in the foreign exchange and  interest rates. Salaries and prices must be readjusted. That  commission has also proposed the scrapping of administrative  methods for managing foreign earnings; a reduction in public  expenditure and in the General State Budget deficit; an increase  in fiscal revenue; a public investment policy; a set of measures  to stimulate Angolan private investment and to attract foreign  investment; and to define a strategy to reschedule the foreign  debt. In short, conditions are sought to stabilize the national  currency, increase salaries, make investment viable, and recover  economic growth.    Some of the measures are harsh, but intentions are good.  This time, we predict that we will be able to move from good  intentions to practical action. Obviously, this continues to be  the program that is possible under the circumstances of war  currently besetting our country. Nevertheless, let us not use  the situation of war to justify all insufficiencies and failures  to achieved planned goals.    The fundamental measures in this program were approved in  September of last year. They have not been implemented only  because of a lack of firmness or failure to carry out the  required tasks at the right time.    The performance period we are entering into now is one of  the  greatest responsibility. If the proposed program is implemented  with rigor, discipline, and seriousness, we may be able to  stanch the country's serious economic crisis. Gradually, we may  start overcoming it with a view to improving our people's living  standards.    Faced with a war effort and an undeclared state of  emergency,  the state has been forced to divert important resources to  provide logistical support and to reequip the army and the  police. Those resources had initially been earmarked for the  economy and for national reconstruction. The state was also  forced to return to an administrative system to allocate foreign  exchange resources. This was the situation until the third  quarter of last year. The armed forces and the national  (?police force) have discharged their duties with dedication and  a high degree of patriotism.    Starting virtually from scratch in October of 1992 and  having  to fight against an army that was well equipped and which Jonas  Savimbi had kept hidden, our forces proved, as far back as  August of last year, that the democratic government elected by  the Angolan people could not be overthrown by the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] military forces.    However, the government lacked the necessary mobility to  created the conditions needed for moving from emergency to  economic reform programs. This situation allows me to conclude  that it is well nigh impossible to manage an economy facing a  crisis without the existence of a government organ that will be  responsible for devising, coordinating, and managing economic  programs. In view of that, I believe there is an urgent need to  create an organ, which will be equivalent to a ministry, and  which will be responsible for dealing with structural and  macroeconomic problems in the medium and long terms.    I think that some preconceived ideas in regard to the former  Ministry of Planning and its cadres have now been laid to rest.  Studies on economic reform guidelines have always come from that  ministry. The coordination of the government's economic sector  could be handed over to the current Planning State Secretariat,  which might evolve to become the Ministry of Planning and  Economic Coordination which, in general terms, would be  responsible for drawing up the government's economic programs,  for devising general economic and social development policies  and, eventually, to bring order to Angolan territory and to  define strategies for negotiation with the principal  international financial institutions.    The Finance Ministry is currently entrusted with those  duties  because there is no organ that deals specifically with them. It  can readjust its organizational structure to meet the important  tasks it has been allocated daily to deal with problems arising  from the economic crisis and other economy-related matters.    Certainly, there is a need for other forms of restructuring  in terms of the government's organization and its higher  structures responsible for management and executive affairs. To  that end, it is my belief that pertinent studies will be made  concerning strategic management and the promotion of cadres  capable of guaranteeing sucess for the aforesaid program.    We must not wait for the war to end so we can move  resolutely  in that direction. If peace arrives sooner rather than later,  then all the better. It will expand our room for maneuver and  increase our responsibilities concerning the complete promotion  of national reconciliation. However, we must continue to follow  our path if peace does not arrive so soon.    UNITA continues to carry out offensive military operations  in  various parts of the country. It has been killing innocent  people. It has been destroying economic infrastructure. It has  hindered or impeded productive work as well as the free movement  of people and goods.    Obviously, such military pressure from UNITA will not change  the government stance at the negotiating table. What is more,  this government must not fold its arms in the face of that  military offensive either. The Angolan Armed Forces must reply  to the attacks being carried out by the UNITA military forces  and defend the people. By the same token, such pressure will  not force the government team to abandon the Lusaka peace talks,  particularly in view of the great progress that has been made at  those talks.    In short, we must reply on the ground when we are attacked  and, simultaneously, deal correctly and constructively with  developments at the Lusaka peace talks, until a lasting and  verifiable cease-fire agreement has been reached.    It is my belief that both the mediators and the observer  countries are attentive to all ploys aimed at sabotaging the  Lusaka peace talks and that such ploys will not be tolerated.</p>

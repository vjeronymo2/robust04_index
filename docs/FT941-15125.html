			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Major faces fresh test at Scott inquiry today: PM's performance will be closely watched Mr John Major's political authority faces a fresh test today when he gives evidence to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into whether the British government illegally sold arms to Iraq in the late 1980s. Mr Major's appearance before the inquiry marks the first time that a serving prime minister has given evidence to a judge in public. The session's political significance has been heightened even further by the scandals and party infighting that have shaken his leadership since Christmas, amid tensions between Downing Street and sections of the tabloid press, traditionally staunch Tory supporters. Mr Major's position has been damaged by two ministerial resignations, allegations of gerrymandering by Tory-led Westminster council and a cabinet split over the nature of the prime minister's 'back to basics' policy. Cabinet colleagues were confident yesterday that the prime minister would not be implicated by the inquiry. However, several ministers emphasised that Mr Major's demeanour - and the manner in which he responds to cross-examination - will be closely scrutinised, amid signs that he has failed to enforce cabinet unity around his leadership. Weekend newspaper reports that Mr Major had spoken derisively about some rightwing members of his cabinet at a Downing Street dinner party last week fuelled the controversy about the 'back to basics' policy and how it impinges on issues of personal morality. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the House of Commons, said yesterday that reports in The Sun and the Daily Mail - which said that Mr Major had told guests he would happily dismiss any one of the Cabinet rightwingers - were untrue. 'I do happen to think that some of the ways the press have treated things in recent days fell a good deal short of what is desirable,' Mr Newton said on BBC radio. Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, also claimed that the reports were part of a vendetta by the press against Mr Major. 'There are one or two people in Fleet Street . . . who make no secret of the fact that they do not like this administration,' he said. The comments have served to underline the deteriorating relationship between the prime minister and some tabloid newspapers. Moreover, the government appeared far from certain how to approach the more sensitive areas of the 'back to basics' policy. It was confirmed yesterday that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, had postponed publication of a blueprint on housing policy, fearing that its research into allegations of queue-jumping by single mothers did not stand up to scrutiny. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, added to Tory gloom by claiming that last November's Budget demonstrated that the Tories' manifesto commitments could not be trusted.

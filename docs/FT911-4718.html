			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Fitter Britons cause 9% downturn at Great Southern GREAT SOUTHERN Group, the USM-quoted funeral director, suffered a 9 per cent downturn in pre-tax profits in 1990, reflecting a 14 per cent decline in the national mortality rate. The resulting fall in sales of funeral and cremation services left the taxable outcome at Pounds 3.22m, down from Pounds 3.54m last time. The setback came in spite of an overall gain in market share. Turnover increased from Pounds 22.13m to Pounds 25.14m, and operating profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 4.92m to Pounds 5.18m. Mr Eric Spencer, deputy chairman and chief executive, said that high interest rates and the depressed property market were continuing to affect profit and debt levels. Borrowings at the year-end stood at some Pounds 12.97m, leaving gearing almost unchanged at 114 per cent. It was hoped to reduce this to less than 100 per cent by the end of 1991, he said. The interest charge rose from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 1.97m. During the year a number of properties had been sold, realising some Pounds 688,000, although following a rationalisation programme the company still had premises for disposal with a book value of about Pounds 1.75m. Mr Spencer added that goodwill arising on past acquisitions totalling Pounds 15.4m had been written off to reserves. If this figure was added back to the balance sheet, gearing would stand at below 50 per cent, he said. The bulk of the profits came from the funeral services side, where four acquisitions had been made in the year. Profits from this activity rose from Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 3.8m. Crematoria and cemeteries put in Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.01m), while the contribution from ancillary services fell from Pounds 339,000 to Pounds 288,000. Chosen Heritage, Great Southern's pre-paid funeral plan, continued to grow, and total plans sold now total more than 30,000 with a face value of some Pounds 19m. A final dividend of 5.5p is proposed, making a total for the year of 8.5p (8p) and comes from earnings per share of 13.9p (16.9p).</p>

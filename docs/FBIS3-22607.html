			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some foreign workers have been found to be carriers  of malaria. Pahang state director of medical and health  services, Dr. R. Mahadevan, however, said it is difficult to  control them, as they seldom stayed in one place for long.    Dr. Mahadevan said another source of malaria was the Orang  Asli [aborigines] in the interior areas. They, too, move from  place to place.    Pahang has the second highest rate of malaria cases after  Sabah.</p>

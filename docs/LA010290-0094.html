			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CROOKS' VALUE TO EDISON CAN BE FOUND OFF THE BOARDS  </P> <P> Talia Crooks wasn't named the most valuable player of last week's Marina girls'  basketball tournament, but her value to the Edison High School girls'  basketball team was all too evident.  </P> <P> Just ask Coach Philip Abraham.  </P> <P> "(Tournament MVP) Debbie Fischer has been stealing the limelight, but Talia is  the reason we are able to play teams with big posts," Abraham said.  </P> <P> From pillar to post, Crooks, the Times' Athlete of the Week, had her way last  week.  </P> <P> Crooks, 5-feet-9 and 140 pounds, is averaging 11 rebounds and 12 points this  season. She had 44 rebounds and 47 points in four games of the Marina  tournament as Edison (9-2) upset Ocean View, 58-53, in the championship game.  </P> <P> "Talia is really quick and she uses that," Abraham said. "She's thin but  muscular.  </P> <P> "Laura Finch and Talia set solid screens and they are really good at rolling to  the hoop."  </P> <P> Crooks is not Edison's primary offensive threat.  </P> <P> "Talia gets most of her points off of rebounds and post moves," Abraham said.  "She has a good sense for the ball and tremendous timing, which is so important  for rebounding.  </P> <P> "She's a great volleyball player and that helps with timing."  </P> <P> Crooks agrees. "I think volleyball has helped. I'm not that great a jumper but  I work at it," she said. "In volleyball you learn to jump with the timing of  the set ball, so I guess I'm used to it (timing rebounds)."  </P> <P> Hard work and concentration also help hone rebounding skills, and Crooks posts  high marks in those areas too.  </P> <P> She had 11 rebounds against Lakewood's front line of three 6-footers in  Edison's 56-54 victory last week. That takes a little more effort for a 5-9  player than letting the ball bounce into her hands.  </P> <P> "They weren't just 6-footers," Abraham said. "They were all legitimately good  players. But Talia's presence is constantly felt on the floor. She plays clean  and always plays very hard."  </P> <P> And Crooks doesn't care how tall the opposition is.  </P> <P> "They don't intimidate me just because they're taller," Crooks said. "The first  thing I look for is to rebound. I hurry to get position and screen out. We're a  running team, so usually the tall girls are slower and don't keep up."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Denise Gandara of University had 73 points in three games at the Orange Glen  tournament, including a 24-point, 12-rebound performance in a 58-53 victory  over Orange Glen Friday.  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia of La Quinta was the leading scorer in the Marina tournament with  122 points in four games and led La Quinta (8-2) to the consolation  championship.  </P> <P> Melisa Sortino had 100 points for Marina (10-4) during the Marina tournament.  Marina lost to La Quinta in the consolation championship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talia Crooks  </P> <P> Edison High School  </P> <P> Position: Forward  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 5-9, 140, Junior  </P> <P> Last Week: Crooks had 44 rebounds and 47 points in four games to lead Edison  (9-2) to the Marina tournament title.  </P> <P> Season: Crooks averages 12 rebounds and 11.5 points.  </P></p>

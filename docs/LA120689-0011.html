			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING FEE COMPROMISE  </P> <P> Thanks to The Times for providing space to Bill Boyarsky to comment on the  inner workings of Los Angeles city government. He's a terrific writer and I  usually enjoy his column.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, a recent column was inaccurate. In "How a Law Gets Written by  Lobbyists" (Metro, Nov. 22), Boyarsky wrote, "Two smart attorneys" (a  developer's attorney and myself) were responsible for drafting the proposed Los  Angeles ordinance requiring commercial developers to pay a $5 a square foot  affordable housing linkage fee.  </P> <P> It doesn't take two attorneys of any particular intelligence to compromise  between $2.50 and $7.50 at $5. The only reason developers agreed to the $5  compromise was due to pressure of tenants, community organizers and nonprofit  housing providers requiring payment of a housing linkage fee.  </P> <P> The idea for the linkage fee originated in December, 1988, in "Housing Los  Angeles: Affordable Housing for the Future," the report of the city's Blue  Ribbon Committee for Affordable Housing.  </P> <P> Over the past 9 months, more than 30 persons from both the public and private  sector, including aides from City Council offices, various city departments and  the city attorney's office, have served on a city task force to study linkage  fees in Los Angeles. Several hotly contested hearings were held on the issue.  </P> <P> Nonprofit housing providers, community activists, and others consistently  pressed the City Council to require commercial developers to pay their fair  share for the loss of affordable housing consequent to development. It is these  dedicated persons who participated in hearings, and/or served on the committee  and task force who are responsible for this long overdue legislation.  </P> <P> MICHAEL BODAKEN  </P> <P> Senior Attorney  </P> <P> Legal Aid Foundation  </P> <P> of Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Tunnel launches second service The Channel tunnel takes a further step towards paying its way today with the start of long-distance freight services carrying new cars from the West Midlands to Milan, Charles Batchelor writes. Rover Group will make its first shipment of about 250 cars to its Italian distribution centre as part of a regular service of five trains a week. The journey time will be cut from eight days to two. Railfreight Distribution, the British Rail subsidiary, expects to run six trains a day each way through the tunnel by midsummer, rising to 27 a day by the end of next year. Through freight trains are the second service in the tunnel after freight shuttles - which carry lorries between Folkestone and Calais.</p>

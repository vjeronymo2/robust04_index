			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Books: The badger in his sett - Malcolm Rutherford reviews the writings of Brian Redhead PERSONAL PERSPECTIVES by Brian Redhead Andre Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 244 pages Brian Redhead may have been a radical broadcaster; he was a very conservative man. For long the unmistakable anchor of the BBC Radio 4 programme Today, he helped to instil badgering as an accepted way of asking questions. Yet, as badgers go, he was a friendly beast and, as we now discover, he put a lot of his thoughts on paper. Redhead died early this year. Instead of a formal biography, his family has put together a series of articles which he produced over the last decade for the relatively obscure magazine, Saga, a monthly for elderly people. One point about him in Personal Perspectives comes out immediately: his Englishness, and the regionalness within it. 'We are a mixed lot,' he wrote, 'Celts, Romans, Saxons, Danes, who have managed to get along over the centuries. When the Normans came, imagining that they had conquered, they were simply absorbed.' And again, in a perceptive remark, 'history is what people make of their geography'. Redhead was fascinated by everything to do with English history: to some extent the more remote the better. He has a charmingly erudite piece on whether or not his adopted home of Macclesfield was part of Mercia, in other words, which came first, Mercia or Macclesfield? He was equally at home in the 19th century partly because it brought the development of the railways. If you want an account of how the president of the board of trade, William Huskisson, was killed while opening the Liverpool-Manchester line in 1830, here is a source. On the other hand, even Redhead was not quite sure of the first genuine passenger line: Stockton-Darlington or Merseyside? Passengers from Stockton, he thinks, were initially drawn by horses. Redhead liked Crewe Junction, where at one stage you could get a train to every part of the kingdom. Some of his best stories were told on the rails. On the way to Macclesfield he gave a young man the history of Cheshire which ultimately - because of the county's salt deposits - led to the founding of ICI. The man turned out to be an ICI recruit. Why Redhead forsook his native north east, where as he describes, he had an excellent education at Newcastle Royal Grammar School and was put on the fast track to read history at Cambridge, for the north west is never fully explained. Yet it was the north west that held him. In terms of journalism Manchester was, in Redhead's words, 'for 90 years the other end of Fleet Street'. He liked the cheeky northern editors who could tell the London men where to get off and what was front page news in the real world. So it remained on the Today programme. Redhead never really liked the south. Abroad, even Scotland, was foreign to him, though he did go to Beijing and hired a bicycle and was much taken by Virginia in the US. Possibly some of that plain blunt man stuff was affectation. At times he could be a trifle pompous: 'I received a letter from a friend who is a historian at Oxford. His father was a historian at Cambridge and taught me'. It contained some esoteric fact about the monarchy which Redhead did not know: 'So I instantly informed the nation'. Yet he could also be humble, as when he recalls Mark Twain's remark on April Fool's Day: 'This is the day upon which we are reminded of what we are on the other 364.' Here is a delightful collection of essays.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Sweet Scottish dream that turned sour  -The Bottom Line A BITTER-SWEET tale unfolded this week which highlighted the problems of British companies - and the investors who back them  - in the recession, writes Guy de Jonquieres and Philip Coggan. The food industry is renowned as a defensive investment, and sugar confectionery as one of its safest havens. Last year the UK sweets market grew 2 per cent in volume - faster than during the economic boom of the mid-1980s - as cash-strapped consumers indulged in inexpensive treats. However, shareholders in Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust must be questioning this conventional wisdom following the failure on Wednesday of Alma Holdings, an unquoted Scottish confectionery company with a stable of venerable brands, including Barker &amp; Dobson, Keiller, Bensons and Hacks. A Kirkcaldy-based family concern formed in 1975, Alma led a quiet existence until 1984, when its fortunes were transformed by the return of Mario Maciocia, son of the company's founder, from several years in England in the import-export trade. A flamboyant third-generation Scot, the young Maciocia was convinced that Alma's future lay in rapid international expansion. He shook up the company's management, launched new products and set up sales divisions in the US and continental Europe. In five years, Alma's sales rose from Pounds 1.2m to more than Pounds 70m. Maciocia's early success owed much to his undoubted, if eccentric, marketing flair. Seeking to invigorate Alma's basic line of children's sweets, he hit on the idea of Skullcrushers, a ghoulish fondant confection which oozed red jelly when bitten. The product proved a worldwide best-seller. It was rapidly followed by a range of successful sweets based on film and television characters, including Batman and Ghostbusters. In 1988, Maciocia bought out the other family shareholders and simultaneously acquired Barker &amp; Dobson's sweets interests for Pounds 9.75m. The deal, which involved Pounds 24m in new borrowings, took Alma into the mainstream confectionery business. It also presaged Maciocia's nemesis. B&amp;D - bought from the Budgens supermarket group  - turned out to have unexpectedly large losses. While still struggling to turn the business round, Alma suffered a series of arson attacks at a factory in Stockport. These inflicted heavy production losses, against which the company turned out to be under-insured. Meanwhile, plans to transfer production from a B&amp;D plant in Bury to a site in Dundee were beset by delays. The results were a precipitous drop in sales, which last year amounted to barely Pounds 40m, and deepening losses, compounded by high interest rates. Under pressure from institutional investors, Maciocia resigned as chairman early last year, since when the entire top management of Alma has been replaced. However, it was too late. After the company suffered unexpectedly weak demand in the final quarter of last year, the shareholders decided to sell it. But hopes of concluding a deal were dashed by the withdrawal of an unnamed prospective bidder, making receivership inevitable. Bad luck obviously contributed to Alma's downfall. But there are also doubts about the soundness of its underlying business plan. Maciocia admitted later that the B&amp;D purchase was conceived while he was 'intoxicated by deal heat.' Furthermore, apart from its disappointing financial performance, the acquisition presented a bigger management challenge than seems to have been appreciated at the time. Not only do B&amp;D's adult confectionery lines call for different marketing skills than the children's sweets in which Alma specialised; B&amp;D's business also requires a mastery of large-scale production techniques which lay outside Alma's previous experience. The collapse of Alma is just the latest price of bad news for Drayton Consolidated. The trust, managed by Invesco MIM, saw its share price plunge last year as investors developed doubts about the value of its unquoted portfolio. The trust took a Pounds 37m provision against its unquoted holdings last year, and wrote down part of the value of its Alma holding. Nevertheless, the final exposure was still Pounds 19.7m, the trust's second biggest investment, and the effect of Alma's failure was to knock 57.8 p per share off the net asset value per share. The news caused Drayton's share price to fall 43p to 147p on Wednesday, a long way down from the peak of 587p in 1989. A number of trusts specialising in this area have had problems as the recession has hit smaller businesses. Unease about the sector has meant that even trusts with good records stand on a substantial discount to their asset values. Investors in such companies currently have a sour taste in their mouths.</p>

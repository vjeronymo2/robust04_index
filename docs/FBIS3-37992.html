The Speaker Who Lost a Presidential Race Will  Have a Role Yet"]    [Text] Opening a meeting of the Supreme Soviet Presidium,  Crimean Parliament Speaker Nikolay Bagrov said: "My application  to resign is still in force. But since the session has not  granted this request, and taking into account a number of  circumstances, I have decided to hold a meeting." Referring to  the circumstances, Bagrov said: "First, the situation is  difficult and we need to create a normal environment for the  president's work. Second, there is no need to elect a new  parliamentary chairman. Third, the Supreme Soviet ought to  operate." Nikolay Bagrov gave a negative assessment of the  Ukrainian Supreme Council's decision to hold local elections on  26 June together with the Ukrainian presidential elections:  "This is unwise, all the more so because it will be in our  tourist season." Bagrov proposed that this matter be passed to  the session for consideration. A proposal by Presidium member  Viktor Bobylev to lift the moratorium on holding a referendum on  the Republic of Crimea's independence was turned down.    Later Nikolay Bagrov held a news conference. He told  journalists about Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of the  Republic of Crimea: "This man merits attention, and he ought to  show what he can do."    Nikolay Bagrov made it clear that he cut his vacation in  order to stay in his office for another month (he will resign  after the March elections) to help the president. "I am ready,  together with Supreme Soviet deputies, to create conditions for  the work of the executive branch." The speaker dwelled in  detail on the proposed discussion of the Crimean budget at the  parliamentary session. "If presently a city plans to receive  700 billion karbovanets in profits, but receives only 8 billion,  drawing up a budget will be a very difficult thing to do,"  Nikolay Bagrov said. "What I very much fear is whether we will  be able to survive after Ukraine enabled us to draw up our own  budget and will not give us anything."    Nikolay Bagrov had a negative view on Crimea's joining the  ruble zone and holding a referendum on Crimea's independence.  In his opinion, all that is unrealistic.</p>

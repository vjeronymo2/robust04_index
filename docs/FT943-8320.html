			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Dynastic triumph for radical Kumaratunga The opposition's performance in Sri Lanka's general election is a personal triumph for their chief campaigner and prime ministerial candidate, Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga. It was not clear last night whether the People's Alliance, the multi-party opposition coalition, had won enough seats to take power. But in challenging the supremacy of the United National party, it had done more than enough to establish Mrs Kumaratunga as a politician with formidable personal appeal. With energy, intellect and a radical reputation, Mrs Kumaratunga attracted the support of many Sri Lankans who wanted change after 17 years of rule by the conservative UNP. The daughter of two former prime ministers - the late Mr Solomon Bandaranaike and his widow Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike - Mrs Kumaratunga has also demonstrated the enduring influence of political dynasties in South Asia. It has taken a long time for 49-year-old Mrs Kumaratunga to move out of the shadow of her 78-year-old mother. Mrs Bandaranaike refuses to countenance retirement and remains the leader of the Sri Lankan Freedom party, the senior member of the People's Alliance. The two women have at times quarrelled bitterly over control of the SLFP - with each other and with 46-year-old Mr Anura Bandaranaike, Mrs Kumaratunga's younger brother. Mrs Kumaratunga was educated in Paris in the 1960s, where she absorbed the heady flavours of French-style Marxism. She returned to Sri Lanka in 1970s, when her mother became prime minister for the second time and launched socialist reforms. The young Mrs Kumaratunga was given a post supervising the distribution of land from big estates to the poor. She married Mr Vijay Kumaratunga, a film star, who joined her on personal missions to contact the Tamil Tigers, the island's separatist rebels. He was killed in 1989 by Sinhalese nationalists against any compromise with the guerrillas. Mrs Kumaratunga maintained her status as a radical, developing a reputation as a passionate speaker for the welfare of the poor. Meanwhile, her brother Anura established himself at the centre of the SLFP, well regarded for his tactical skills and moderate views. Mrs Bandaranaike was torn between the logic of promoting her level-headed son, who seemed likely to make sensible use of the family's political inheritance, and her firebrand daughter, who was much less predictable but whose passion for the poor came closer to her own feelings. In the event, the matriarch was spared from making a choice when earlier this year, Mr D B Wijetunga, the president, lured Anura into the ruling party with the offer of a cabinet seat. The decision backfired on the UNP because it united the SLFP for the first time in years and permitted Mrs Kumaratunga to take centre stage. Her first electoral test came in March, when she led the party to victory in provincial council polls in southern Sri Lanka - to the chagrin of her brother, who headed the losing UNP campaign. With real power in sight, Mrs Kumaratunga moderated some of her views, adopting pro-market economic policies, though insisting that such policies must have 'a human face.' If the UNP somehow succeeds in retaining power, Mrs Kumaratunga is likely to make a dynamic opposition leader. If the opposition takes office, she will face a difficult challenge as prime minister, trying to hold together a nine-party coalition. Her warm heart will win her many friends, but her inexperience could prove a serious handicap.</p>

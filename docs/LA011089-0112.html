			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> OUTSIDE MOVE HELPS PUT POLISH ON ERKENBRACK'S GAME  </P> <P> For 3 years, 5-foot 11-inch, 140-pound Keri Erkenbrack of Canyon High School  posted up near the paint, her little elbows ready to do battle with the biggest  of Orange County's centers.  </P> <P> But this season, Canyon Coach Bill Fitzgibbons moved her to forward, and  Erkenbrack is beginning to shine after 3 years of being the diamond that was  roughed up.  </P> <P> Erkenbrack, The Times' athlete of the week, scored a career-high 31 points and  pulled down 10 rebounds in a 63-37 victory over El Modena Thursday in the  Century League opener for both teams.  </P> <P> Two days earlier, she scored 25 points in Canyon's 70-24 nonleague victory over  Troy.  </P> <P> Erkenbrack leads her team in scoring with 20.3 points per game and rebounding  (10.4). She also has been the soccer team's starting goalie for 3 seasons.  </P> <P> Playing center, Erkenbrack was used to taking a lot of shots -- inside. She had  to be persuaded to shoot from the perimeter when she was moved to forward  during summer-league play, Fitzgibbons said.  </P> <P> But after working over the summer at practice and in the La Mirada High School  summer league, Erkenbrack is comfortable with 20-foot shots and is the team's  leading 3-point shooter.  </P> <P> "It was a big transition," Erkenbrack said.  </P> <P> "Inside, I'm only 5-11 and I'm used to getting killed underneath. I have to  really fight for position. Outside, I have an advantage with my height. And  having experience playing inside, I can always drive to the basket or post up."  </P> <P> Fitzgibbons acknowledges that Erkenbrack's scoring average could soar in a  program with less of a team focus.  </P> <P> Two other starters average about 9 points per game -- point guard Christa  Ramirez and 6-3 center Sheri Rhyne, whose arrival has freed Erkenbrack to roam  the perimeter.  </P> <P> "Keri is not the focal point," Fitzgibbons said. "Her main objective is to play  good defense and hit the boards. She doesn't have to lead our team."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMER  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia scored 70 points in 2 Garden Grove League games, including 45  points in a 66-28 victory over Kennedy Friday. In that victory, she pulled down  21 rebounds and had 14 steals. She scored 25 points and had 13 rebounds in a  67-48 victory over Rancho Alamitos Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keri Erkenbrack  </P> <P> Canyon High School  </P> <P> Position: Forward  </P> <P> Height, Class: 5-11, Senior  </P> <P> Last Week: Scored 31 points in a 63-37 victory over El Modena and scored 25  points in a 70-24 victory over Troy.  </P> <P> Season: Erkenbrack leads Canyon in scoring (20.4 points per game) and  rebounding (10.4 per game).  </P></p>

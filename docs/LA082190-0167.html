			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARTERIAL DISEASE BLAMED IN DEATH  </P> <P> An autopsy today revealed that arterial disease caused the death of a  36-year-old boxer who collapsed during a gym workout.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Maine chief medical examiner's office said the death of  Rick Craney on Monday night was attributed to "severe stenosing coronary artery  atherosclerosis."  </P> <P> Craney was working out at a gym in preparation for his fight on the undercard  of Saturday night's World Boxing Organization welterweight title fight when he  was stricken.  </P> <P> Witnesses said Craney collapsed on an exercise bench after sparring three  rounds each with two opponents at the Olympic Boxing Club.  </P> <P> Craney, a one-time Maine welterweight champion, was to have fought Bernard  Boisvert prior to a welterweight championship match between champion Manning  Galloway and Nika Kumalo.  </P> <P> "He had just finished sparring six rounds, and he was on an exercise bench when  he slipped onto the floor," said trainer Gene Roberts, who was watching the  workout.  </P> <P> Another trainer helped Craney back onto the bench.  </P> <P> "He said, 'It's all right, I'm OK,' and then he fell again," Roberts said.  </P></p>

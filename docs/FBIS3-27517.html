			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Xiuqing (2621 4423 3237)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and Liu  Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission [CMC],  sent letters to the first working conference of the China  Aerospace Industry Corporation [CAIC], which opened on 21  February, expressing the hope that the aerospace front will  seize the opportunity, make persistent efforts, and step up  reform to bring about greater development in China's aerospace  industry by the end of this century.    Li Peng stated in his letter: The aerospace industry  occupies a very important position in China's economic  construction and construction of national defense. It has been  the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the CMC's  consistent principle to maintain a momentum for developing  China's aerospace industry and to step up the transfer of  aerospace technology to the national economic construction. In  the past 30 years or so, you have scored great achievements in  and made contributions to the development of China's aerospace  industry through unremitting efforts. I earnestly hope that,  through this conference, you will further unify your thinking,  change your concepts, seize the opportunity, deepen reform, and  step up development on the basis of Comrade Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics to make new  contributions to enhancing China's defense capability, promoting  national economic development, and increasing China's overall  national strength.    Liu Huaqing said in his letter: Now China has turned a new  page in the aerospace industry to carry forward its development  and forge ahead into the future. I hope you will keep your  sacred missions firmly in mind, start from the world strategy  and supreme interests of the state, greet challenges, keenly  engage in reform, and bravely scale new heights in your industry  to create a brighter future for the Chinese aerospace industry.    State Councillor Song Jian attended and addressed the  conference. He also expressed his ardent expectations of further  developing the aerospace industry.    The CAIC was established last year by reorganizing a former  government organ, according to the decision of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council, to meet the need to establish a  socialist market economic system. In his report to the  conference, President Liu Jiyuan said: During over one year of  intense work, the aerospace front has smoothly completed  institutional transformation and has brought many new reform  measures into practice. Organs at various levels were  streamlined, their work style changed moderately, and their  efficiency rose to some extent. The industry has made great  achievements in the fields of scientific research, production,  development of civilian products, export, and separate  management of military goods and civilian products, and has thus  laid a foundation for further development.    The new ideas for developing the aerospace industry are:  "developing aerospace industry, stressing civilian products,  improving economic returns, and marching toward the world." The  industry's objectives of development by the year 2000 are:  "making great developments in applied satellites and the  application of satellites and industrializing them in earnest by  successfully developing and manufacturing a new generation of  telecommunications satellites, meteorological satellites,  resource satellites, and new aerospace engineering; further  modernizing weaponry; developing the CAIC into a high-tech and  large-scale transnational conglomerate; marketing Chinese-made  satellites and their parts and other civilian goods on the  international market, after consolidating and strengthening the  existing position of China's carrier rockets on the  international market, to better serve people of the world; and,  from now on, setting the average annual growth rate of this  industry's total output value at 20 percent and its annual per  capita productivity over 100,000 yuan, so that the aerospace  industry will truly become one of the attractive industries.</p>

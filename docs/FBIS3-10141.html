That information was provided to this newspaper by  Samir Nahass, head of the CPRM's Division of International  Relations.    The Cubans have been interested since last year in signing  the agreement to allow the two countries to exchange experts in  the areas of prospecting and production. Cuba has large mining  reserves of nickel, a mineral considered strategic by the world  metallurgical industry. The Cubans were previously being given  technical assistance by Soviet advisers from the former USSR.  Now it is Brazil, with its big potential for nickel mines and  its available technology, which will be able to provide Cuba  with a package of services.  <H5>  China </H5>   Brazil's main reserve of niobium ores--the deposit in Seis  Lagos, Amazonas, which is owned by the CPRM and has reserves of  rare earths--lacks the technology for separating those ores from  the other elements that are present.    According to Nahass, the Ministry of Geology and Mining of  the PRC has offered that technology to the CPRM. Last year four  geologists from the CPRM were in Beijing studying the quality of  Chinese geology and familiarizing themselves with the mining  technologies that may be transferred here for use in the CPRM's  projects.    The Chinese, who became the world's second-largest producer  of iron ore last year (178 million metric tons), want to acquire  the technology for concentrating iron ore from the Brazilians.</p>

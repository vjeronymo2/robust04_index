			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rolly San Juan] </F>   [Text] Zamboanga City -- The Abu Sayyaf has warned of more  terrorist acts, including bombings, kidnappings, and attacks on  police stations and detachments, if the military continues  operations against it.    The warning was contained in a letter sent to the Southern  Command by Ustadz Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani, leader of the  Sulu- based extremist group.    Lt. Gen. Thelmo Cunanan, chief of the Southern Command,  earlier ordered Col. Ponciano Millena, 2d Marine Brigade chief,  to disband the group at all costs.    The military reportedly planned an offensive against the Abu  Sayyaf, now said to be holed up in the villages of Takes Jakil  and Buhangiran in Patikul, Sulu.    The group was reported to have joined forces with the "lost  command" group of Commander Redjulan.    Regional Police Director Roberto Lastimoso has placed all  police personnel here on alert and ordered the setting up of  checkpoints in the city's strategic entry points.    "We cannot be intimidated by the Abu Sayyaf," he said.    The group abandoned its main headquarters in Basilan last  June and sought sanctuary in Patikul after the military launched  an all-out operation after the kidnapping of Fr. Bernardo Blanco  and six-year-old Luis Anthony Biel.    Blanco was able to escape, while Biel was later freed by his  captors.    The Special Action Group of the Philippine National Police  arrested on Friday a suspected member of the Abu Sayyaf along  Governor Lim Avenue here.    Police identified him as Jalilul Amin, 31, of Jolo, Sulu.    Seized from Alalin's possession were a .357 Magnum revolver  and a handheld radio.</p>

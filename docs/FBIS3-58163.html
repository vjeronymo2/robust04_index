[passage omitted]    French President Francois Mitterrand also cited the need to  avoid "countering" the development of democracy in Russia.    He described the plan for gradual expansion endorsed by NATO  leaders, known as Partnership for Peace, as "reasonable" and  said it was "a form of real guarantee" for the security needs of  the new democracies in East Europe.    A spokesman for Mitterrand said former Soviet states now  worried about the potential of renewed Russian expansionism  should interpret the partnership as a promise that "now war  could threaten their territorial integrity and sovereignty."

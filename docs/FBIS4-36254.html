			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will not  appoint an envoy to serve as an intermediary between Israel and  Syria but will continue to handle the negotiations between the  two countries himself. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz  reports:    [Begin recording] [Raz] Secretary of State Christopher has  recently become more active with regard to the negotiations  between Syria and Israel. There are apparently several reasons  for this, including domestic ones. The reports, for example,  that Christopher may be asked to vacate his post are also  spurring him to make greater efforts. Dennis Ross is not  exactly popular in Syria, with the end result being both overt  and covert activity by the secretary of state. Deputy Foreign  Minister Yosi Beilin is optimistic. He believes that there is a  wide base for promoting the negotiations between Syria and  Israel.    [Beilin] The United States has been very active with both  parties on promoting the Syrian-Israeli track over the past few  weeks since the last round of talks, mainly through telephone  calls and by using the media. I think that we shall see  additional process prior to Christopher's impending visit. Any  progress made, as well as any U.S. involvement, will hopefully  lead to additional progress because we now have an unprecedented  basis for negotiations: a readiness by both Syria and Israel to  talk about peace as well as withdrawal on the Golan Heights,  together with an acceptance by both sides of U.S. involvement.  This is a precedent that definitely should be taken advantage  of.    [Raz] What can we deduce from the fact that Christopher has  decided to handle the negotiations himself for the time being  and not appoint an envoy as previously intended?    [Beilin] I do not know any details about such an intention.  It is true that the idea of a special envoy to the Middle East  has been raised on numerous occasions. However, the secretary  of state apparently decided to continue handling the  negotiations personally and that is certainly important because  the more senior the envoy the greater the chances of success.    [Raz] Could we witness a breakthrough in the next round of  talks? Are contacts behind the scenes creating the basis for  such a breakthrough?    [Beilin] I hope so, but I do not think that it is any  specific round of talks that can lead to a breakthrough. A real  breakthrough can only come in the wake of ongoing and deeper  U.S. involvement, which comprises more than just visits of  senior officials to the region. I think that the secretary of  state's decision to make a special trip to the Middle East to  deal with the Syrian-Israeli track and not as the aftermath to a  visit to Europe or Turkey is symbolic in itself and apparently  indicates that the United States will now devote separate time  to our issue.    [Raz] Christopher, however, still has a great deal of work  in store for him. There has been no change in the parties'  positions. Nothing has actually happened. Syria has still not  issued a reply to the detailed plan submitted by Israel through  the Americans. Nevertheless, there is a sense of impending  developments in the air. [end recording]    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 8 June in a  similar report by political correspondent Udi Segal adds that  "officials in Jerusalem hope that the Americans bring new ideas  to promote the negotiations and succeed in extracting a few  answers from Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad regarding the  Israeli proposals. As for Syria's latest demand that Israel  abrogate the Golan Law, sources in the prime minister's bureau  said that would not be necessary because any agreement reached  between the two countries which contravened the Golan Law would  have to be approved by the Knesset, thus abrogating the law."]</p>

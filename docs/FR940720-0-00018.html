			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 170.20&blank;Average Cost Per Professional Staff Hour <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is amended to reflect an agency-wide, professional staff-hour rate based on FY 1994 budgeted costs. Accordingly, the NRC professional staff-hour rate for FY 1994 for all fee categories that are based on full cost is $133 per hour, or $231,216 per direct FTE. The rate is based on the FY 1994 direct FTEs and NRC budgeted costs that are not recovered through the appropriation from the NWF. The rate is calculated using the identical method established for FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993. As noted earlier, in this final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. The method is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. All direct FTEs are identified in Table II by major program. For FY 1994 the NRC has traced additional direct effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. The budgeted costs for these activities had previously been included in overhead but are now being directly assigned to the class of licensees that they support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,i1,s50,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table II._Allocation of Direct FTEs by Major Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Major program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1No. of direct FTEs1 <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Reactor Safety and Safeguards Regulation  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,034.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Reactor Safety Research  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 111.3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Nuclear Material and Low Level Waste Safety and Safeguards Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 352.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reactor Special and Independent Reviews, Investigations, and Enforcement  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 111.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Material Management and Support  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 19.0  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=4 --> Total direct FTE  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 21,628.9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 1FTE (full-time equivalent) is one person working for a full year.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 19 June (PANA) -- High-ranking Burundi  Government officials, mainly from the majority Hutu ethnic  group, spend the night in Uvira, a small town in the Zairian  province of South Kivu, near Bujumbura.    "Early in the morning, these officials return to their  offices in Bujumbura to perform their duties", the ZAIRE NEWS  AGENCY (AZAP) correspondent reported from Uvira Friday [17 June].    The influx of Burundian refugees to the small town near Lake  Tanganyika has created an acute shortage of accommodation.  Hotels of the area are overbooked, said the local correspondent  of AZAP who also spoke of insecurity problems arising from the  presence of the top Burundi Government officials in Uvira.  Reports indicate that up to 10,000 Rwandan refugees and 70,000  from Burundi have flocked into South Kivu so far.</p>

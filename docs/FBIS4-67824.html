			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Tamara Smirnova report: ``Buran's Creators Have Become </F> Watchmen'']    [Excerpts] Only fanatics are left here now. Each morning  they pass through the gate of their strict-regime enterprise and  head along winding, echoing corridors to the shops and  departments. It is hard to believe, looking at the shrouded  instruments and the immobile bulks of machine tools, that quite  recently everything here was humming, blinking, and vibrating --  in short, life was in full swing. People were working in three  shifts, as though possessed, not requiring a rest. There was  something fantastic in the hush-hush Science-and-Production  Association of Automation and Instrument Building, commonly  known as the ``Pilyugin firm.'' [passage omitted]    ``My shop manufactured 42 instruments for Buran,'' Boris  Kurochkin, leader of precision mechanics, said. ``They control  the craft from lift-off to landing. We take a month to `lick  into shape' a single component. Whereas it is possible to train  a fitter in a year or two, it takes 10-15 years to `perfect' an  assembler-fitter in precision mechanics. The shop is unique.  It produces unique instruments. For comparison: In the past  there was one Faberge, but we have several. An attempt was made  to adapt our Faberges to flow production. The result was  lamentable: They all skedaddled. One is in roofing, another  guards a warehouse, yet another serves in a store. The  explanation for all this is simple -- no wages. In the  capitalist world a specialist of such caliber has earnings at  the level of a banker. Here he makes less than a cleaning  woman. How is it possible to keep an ace of precision mechanics  on 40,000 rubles? Talk with the workers yourself....''    The shop where gyrostabilizer platforms are assembled and  regulated. Here the need for cleanliness is as in an operating  theater -- specks of dust are counted per liter of air.  Assemblers have to wear special cambric clothes. Even the  cloths that are technically necessary to wipe surfaces are made  of the same very fine fabric.    But this was in the past. This is how it was. Today there  are no components on the work table of team leader Zinaida  Bakhtina -- just a ball of wool and knitting needles.    ``Have you taken up knitting to while away the time?''    ``Yes, unfortunately. There are no orders. Out of 22 work  days we are employed for three or four, God willing.  Specialists have gone into commerce. I am not suited for it.  My soul does not accept what is going on in the country. A  complete breakdown....''    Valentin Bykov, chief of the testing and diagnosis  department, is still harsher in his views:    ``The democrats are lying when they say we squander money.  Russian technology is exceptionally economical -- it bears no  comparison with U.S. technology in terms of expenditure. Our  engineer is more qualified and competent. He lets only a  perfected article take off. In retrospect, we have had  considerably fewer failures than the United States. But what  are we forced to engage in now? Some businessmen came to us  with their problem: They said they had bought equipment to  counterfeit fashionable jeans but were afraid to install it on  the second floor of a dry-cleaning establishment. Were the  machine tools too heavy, and would the building suddenly  collapse? We carried out their instructions and received money.  But this is hack work! I am ashamed.''    There is a lot of argument in the firm about conversion. In  principle, the science-and-production association has never  avoided tackling national economic tasks. It has been making  medical equipment for more than a year. Designers are drawing  up a system for the control of nuclear stations. They are  racking their brains over a ground-effect machine, a huge  transport craft capable of flying over the sea at low altitudes.  Or take an instrument to predict earthquakes. Using complex  algorithms and taking 21 indicators into account, the apparatus  ``paints'' a portrait of the elements and predicts shocks long  before they happen. But there has never been a demand for the  method. The country is not creditworthy. It cannot afford the  latest technologies. There can be no question of scientific  developments for the long term.    No, it will not be a joyous festival for the creators of  automatic space equipment. Rendered lifeless by  poverty-stricken funding, the sector is withering day by day.  But it is not even the beggarly existence that oppresses its  creators but the lack of demand for their very lofty intellect.  The country is losing its priorities in the world. The  beautiful Buran has already been set up in Gorkiy Park to amuse  the crowd. What will it be turned into -- a sideshow or maybe a  bar? A bird that was born to fly has had its wings clipped. Is  not the same fate being prepared for Russia?</p>

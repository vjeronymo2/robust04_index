			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Del Monte to be sold for Pounds 360m DEL MONTE Foods International, the canned fruit and juices company, is being sold to a joint venture between Royal Foods and Anglo American Corporation, both of South Africa, for Pounds 360m - roughly 14.5 times historical earnings. DMFI, which is owned by institutions and management following a Pounds 229m buy-out in 1990 in the wake of the break up of RJR Nabisco, announced plans in February for a stock market listing. Shareholders, however, led by Charterhouse Bank with just over 50 per cent, have decided on a speedy sale at a guaranteed, if slightly lower, price because of uncertainty in the stock market, according to Charterhouse. DMFI is unrelated to the Del Monte fresh fruit business, which was bought by Polly Peck, the fruit and electronics company which collapsed in 1990. The Royal group, which is led by Mr Vivian Imerman and is involved in foods and chemicals, has a market capitalisation about half the size of the DMFI purchase price. Royal is eventually expected to seek a listing for part of the group in London. Royal Foods last year bought DMFI's South African fruit canning subsidiary, which still supplies about half DMFI's deciduous fruits such as peaches and apricots under a long term supply contract. Anglo's involvement is in line with its aim to get into higher value added areas of business, and breaks new ground by moving away from cyclical commodities towards consumers. However, Mr Graham Boustred, deputy chairman of Anglo, yesterday played down talk of an important strategic shift saying: 'It's quite difficult to shift a group of Anglo's size.' Anglo and its associate, De Beers, currently have a joint market capitalisation of about R36bn (Pounds 7.2bn). The deal is also an interesting collaboration between Anglo, the pinnacle of South Africa's Anglo-Saxon business establishment, and the youthful, entrepreneurial and distinctly Jewish Royal group. The acquisition is conditional on regulatory clearance in South Africa, especially from the Reserve Bank, and successful completion of fund raising by Royal, which met with banks over the weekend. Anglo has committed to invest R400m directly.</p>

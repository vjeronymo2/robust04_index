			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AFRICA WILL GET EXTRA SPOT IN '94 TOURNEY  </P> <P> Africa will get a third berth in the 1994 World Cup, at the expense of Europe,  the head of soccer's ruling body said today.  </P> <P> Joao Havelange, president of FIFA, credited Cameroon's success this summer for  the change.  </P> <P> "Africa will automatically get one more place," Havelange said in an interview  published in La Gazzetta Dello Sport. "It deserves it. That place will be taken  away from Europe."  </P> <P> African nations had been calling for such a move well before the tournament and  complained that Europe was over-represented at the World Cup.  </P> <P> The North and Central American region and Asia will also get a chance to  increase participation to three teams from two, but only through a special  qualifying series with South American and European nations, he said.  </P> <P> This could further weaken the presence of the traditional soccer bastions of  Europe and South America, which have 18 of the 24 slots in this year's World  Cup.  </P> <P> After Roger Milla got two goals to put Cameroon in the World Cup quarterfinals,  he said he wanted Africa to profit from his achievement.  </P> <P> "It proves the progress of African soccer, and we have to work to get three  places in the next World Cup," Milla said.  </P> <P> FIFA has to make a final decision on the issue at a meeting in December.  </P></p>

Iglesias,  president of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and his  party here today.    Rong briefed the guests on China's economic development  since  the country launched its reform and opening-up more than a  decade ago and particularly in recent years.    Iglesias expressed appreciation of China's great  achievements  in the past 15 years and voiced the hope that the economic and  trade ties between China and the Latin American countries would  be further expanded.    The two sides also exchanged views on the further expansion  of cooperation and China's linking up with IDB.    Iglesias arrived in China on February 20 at the invitation  of  the People's Bank of China.    IDB is the oldest regional inter-governmental bank, with the  largest business volume and capital. It has played an important  role in promoting economic development and social progress in  Latin American countries.    Iglesias' visit here, wound up this afternoon, has  strengthened the mutual understanding and existing friendship  between China and IDB, said sources from the People's Bank of  China.</p>

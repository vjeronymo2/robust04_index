			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (10): Poacher turned gamekeeper / Profile of Robert Jones MP - Britain's new Mr Save-It The task of making Britain more energy efficient belongs to Mr Robert Jones, the newly appointed junior minister at the Department of the Environment. Although the UK has previously had energy ministers with a brief to raise energy efficiency, this is the first time anyone has formally carried the title. It was an unusual choice. Mr Jones was previously chairman of the Select Committee on the Environment in the House of Commons where he grilled ministers and officials on Britain's rather mixed performance on energy saving. Last year, he produced a report which effectively said that government policy in the area was too weak, and put forward a string of recommendations. Some people have therefore viewed the appointment as 'poacher turned gamekeeper', though he is highly regarded in the energy efficiency business itself. 'He comes to the job with great knowledge and sympathy for the subject', says Mr Andrew Warren of the Association for the Conservation of Energy. 'But people also have high expectations of what he can achieve.' Now, he is in the hot seat himself. How does the view look from there? 'We are achieving a lot, but there's also a lot of complacency around,' he says. The progress has come mainly in industry, he thinks, where companies have become much more cost-conscious, and are taking serious steps to reduce energy consumption. The government is backing this up with advice schemes, help with eco-audits and management standards. The UK is also 'doing quite well' by international standards. 'Our building regulations take us close to the top, well ahead of countries like Germany,' he says. He is also encouraged by the initiatives taken by local authorities to save energy, and by the government's target of reducing its own energy consumption by 15 per cent between 1991 and 1996. The complacency Mr Jones sees is mainly in the residential/commercial sector where energy is only a small part of people's costs. Moreover, householders do not bother to compare one quarter's electricity and gas bills with the same quarter the year before, so they have little idea of the energy trends in their own homes. 'We do need to get over the fact that more than half of global warming gases come from buildings,' he says. The government has been running a publicity campaign to sharpen people's awareness of the risks of global warming. It recently turned the pressure up with a fresh campaign which is supposed to make them actually do something about it. The Pounds 6m campaign, using the message 'Wasting energy costs the Earth', is based on dinosaur figures because they appeal to children who tend to be much more responsive than adults to appeals of this kind. Mr Jones has also been asking banks to provide free energy ratings for homes when advancing mortgages to house purchasers. From next July, new building regulations will require all new dwellings to be given an energy efficiency rating. The campaign comes on top of the government's highly controversial imposition of VAT on home heating in last year's Budget. But the effects of this tax are being eroded by the decline in gas and electricity prices. Does Mr Jones think taxes should be pushed up further to keep up the pressure? 'Rather than jack up energy taxes, I would prefer to concentrate on educating people,' he says. 'We don't want to add unnecessarily to their costs.' In fact, the trend in prices reinforces the government's view that it needs to use other weapons besides price, such as persuasion, publicity, and pump priming exercises, particularly for low income households. But Mr Jones opposes further legislation to enforce energy efficiency. In a recent House of Commons debate, he told MPs that he thought sufficient progress was being achieved without adding to the legislative burden. This concern about costs also lies behind Britain's resistance to an EU plan for a carbon tax, which Mr Jones thinks would greatly harm the competitiveness of European industry if it was imposed unilaterally. 'We should look at this on a world basis,' he says. Mr Jones concedes that there is still doubt about the seriousness of the risk of global warming. But he says this is expressed 'by a tiny minority of scientists'. And he believes that energy efficiency is still a worthy goal in its own right because it increases industrial competitiveness, and saves householders money. He remains confident that the UK will be able to reach its target of reducing CO to 1990 levels by the year 2000 under its Earth Summit commitments. The next point to be considered is what happens after that, and international negotiations have only just started.</p>

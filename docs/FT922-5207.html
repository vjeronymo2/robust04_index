			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Amnesty critical of Peru regime AMNESTY International, the human rights group, said yesterday that human rights violations had continued in Peru since President Alberto Fujimori took power nearly two years ago, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor. 'Widespread 'disappearances' and extra-judicial executions by the security forces, as well as torture, continued to be the organisation's principal concerns in Peru,' it said. In the first 21 months of the Fujimori government, 392 people reported as 'disappeared' remained unaccounted for after arrest. There were 169 extra-judicial executions. The group was also critical of measures taken since Mr Fujimori dissolved Congress on April 5, which it said undermined the structures by which the state made provision for protection of human rights. However, it reiterated concern about the killing of hundreds of defenceless people by opposition groups.</p>

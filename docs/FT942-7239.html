			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Greenspan opposes legislation to control derivatives Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve board, yesterday brushed off calls for new legislation to control derivative financial instruments and warned that intervention could increase risks to the US financial system. 'Remedial legislation relating to derivatives is neither necessary nor desirable at this time,' Mr Greenspan told a congressional subcommittee. Mr Greenspan said there was a pressing need to overhaul the entire US regulatory structure, but he warned that reforms aimed solely at derivatives could be counterproductive. Last week, the US General Accounting Office called for measures to strengthen controls on this fast-expanding area of the financial markets. Derivatives, such as swaps and options, are instruments derived from other financial assets or indices. The GAO warned that the entire financial system could be undermined because of the lack of regulation, but Mr Greenspan highlighted the risk of interven-tion: 'Legislation directed at derivatives is no substitute for broader reform,' he said. Without broader reform, he added, such legislation could increase risks in the US financial system 'by creating a regulatory regime that is itself ineffective and that diminishes the effectiveness of market discipline'. Mr Greenspan's remarks were echoed by representatives of four US regulatory agencies overseeing banks, securities dealers and futures markets in their testimony in Washington to the House of Representatives subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. 'I'm not prepared to say at this point: the sky is falling down, we need to legislate,' said Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Eugene Ludwig, comptroller of the currency, and Mr Andrew Hove, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the two other principal federal bank supervisors, as well as Ms Barbara Holum, acting chair of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, expressed similar sentiments. In contrast to Mr Greenspan, Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England's director for banking supervision, yesterday repeated a call for the derivatives trading subsidiaries of US securities firms to be regulated. Mr Quinn said he was 'more agnostic' about increased regulation of other participants in derivatives markets. US managers urged to improve use of derivatives, Page 37 Accountancy column, Page 14</p>

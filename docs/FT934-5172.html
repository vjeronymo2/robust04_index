			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Transported by zone bonds or rates (1) Sir, When I came to Canada in the early 1980s, a combined subway-bus token cost 35 cents. Now it costs Dollars 1.30. This price has outperformed gold and other inflation hedges. In London the rise in transport as a relative price has been even greater. Here is the answer to the problem of under-investment in transport in south-east England. Your suggested mega-bond for London (Leader, November 29) should be denominated in zone one rides, and pay interest in zone one rides, Network SouthEast season tickets, or cash equivalent. A sum of Pounds 1,000 might buy a 1,000-ride bond offering 50 rides per annum . . . somewhat like the Wimbledon tennis debentures. Government need not come into it. A consortium of banks and construction companies could issue a super financial derivative for Pounds 10bn. They would negotiate project by project with whoever was running the transport system: investment for rides of cash equivalent. Uninvested funds would be placed in medium-dated gilts, from where they probably came in the first place. It would be privatisation by the back door.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the European Union Commission have ended  a fact finding mission to Ukrainian nuclear power plants by  concluding that Kiev needs assistance in setting up a national  training center, special literature and equipment for personnel  training. They recommend that G-7 countries provide appropriate  technical assistance to Ukraine.    The delegation visited nuclear power plants at Chernobyl,  Zaporozhiye and Rovno and met representatives of the  Yuzhno-Ukrainsk and Khmelitsk stations.    At a final meeting with officials of the Ukrainian state  committee for nuclear energy (Gosatom), Commission members  praised the Ukrainian system of personnel training, though the  training scheme for operational and maintenance staff was based  on outdated methods and instructions worked out while the former  Soviet Union still existed.    Gosatom deputy head Nur Nigmatulin said that many of the  mistakes could be avoided if local nuclear power plants had  "full-scale accident simulators", but there was only one  simulator, at the Zaporozhiye plant. However, he said the basic  training scheme was in many ways superior to its western  counterpart.    At the same time, Nigmatulin said that Ukraine was soon  expected to receive such kits for the Rovno and Yuzhno-Ukrainsk  plants, largely due to help from the French government. Twelve  instructors will undergo training this year.</p>

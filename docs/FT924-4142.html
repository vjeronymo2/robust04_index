			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (12): Cost of finance acts as a deterrent - Italy 'THIS year's results are not encouraging. The economic situation, high interest rates and fiscal tightening mean that 1992 will definitely be worse than 1991 for buy-outs in Italy,' says Mr Franco Papa, corporate finance partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in Milan. Not that last year provided much reason for enthusiasm. The firm's data base shows that 16 operations in total were announced in 1991 - three fewer than in 1990. Moreover, KPMG Peat Marwick says that the market value of deals plunged by 53 per cent. This year the value will probably decline further. According to Mr Dante Razzano, Morgan Grenfell Italia's managing director, there have been no significant buy-outs, above Dollars 100m, in Italy in 1992. 'A combination of high interest rates and heightened consciousness of lending risks among Italy's banks has reduced buy-out activity,' says Mr Razzano. The cost of finance is the factor most frequently mentioned as a deterrent to buy-outs. 'It is almost impossible to consider leveraged operations at current interest rates,' says Mr Guido Belli, a senior executive with Sopaf Group's Invest, a leading Italian investment bank. The MBO deal by which Invest took a 70 per cent stake in the building materials company SADI at the beginning of the year was one of four mentioned by KPMG Peat Marwick. 'It is the only operation that we have completed in 1992,' says Mr Belli. The fact that yields offered by buy-outs in Italy are unattractive is not only because of the high cost of money. Prices sought for businesses have often been high, a factor that has also prevented the growth of buy-out numbers. 'Many owners have held inflated ideas about the value of their companies. Moreover, they believed that prices could only go up. But, after the shocks of the summer and autumn, a sense of reality is beginning to show,' says Mr Razzano. Mr Jonathan Bliss, director of 3i, also remarks on greater pricing realism. 'Results in the corporate sector were disappointing in 1991 and businessmen now recognise that outturns will be poor this year and that recovery is unlikely next year. Prices are starting to reflect this.' 3i is not typical of buy-out operators in Italy, where it started business two years ago; it wants only minority stakes and looks for longer term investments. It also wants low gearing in operations in which it participates, with debt to equity ratios of about one. 'We want to avoid the higher risk that accompanies high gearing,' Mr Bliss says. Schroder Associati is less concerned about debt/equity, but looks carefully at debt/cash-flow. 'Interest cover is the key measure. The number of times that financing costs are covered by the company's cash-flow is what counts,' says Mr Paolo Colonna, the firm's director. Schroder Associati has been involved in about 40 operations over the past four years, taking majority stakes in small and medium-sized companies with the aim of creating mini-industrial holdings. 'Italian industry is characterised by one-man entrepreneurial businesses. There are rarely outside managers in family companies, so our deals are buy-ins rather than buy-outs,' says Mr Colonna. The trade sale offers the main exit route in Italy. 'Nobody is enthusiastic about the 'borsa',' says Mr Bliss about the option of stock market quotation. Italy's is a small market lacking the public limited companies and large scale investment by institutional investors that typify those of New York and London. Yet in spite of the absence of action over the past two years, investment bankers in Milan have not lost hope. Schroder Associati's Mr Colonna believes opportunities will arise next year from two developments in Italian industry. First, it now seems that privatisation will become a reality. Most observers believe facts will soon follow the torrent of words that the subject has generated. 'Management buy-outs will not happen directly, but will occur as a by-product when new owners of privatised companies start rationalising,' says Mr Colonna. 'The second source of buy-out operations will be the corporate restructuring that major groups have started to put in motion. Until now the sale of subsidiaries has been seen as a sign of weakness. That attitude is disappearing, and focusing on core businesses is seen as the right strategy,' he says. Mr Bliss also sees corporate restructuring as a source of buy-outs, although he believes that management will only have small equity stakes. 'Succession problems in family companies will continue to provide good opportunities for buy-out operations,' he adds. In which sectors are the opportunities likely to occur? Most bankers agree that food is at the top of the list. 'It will always be an interesting sector, even when the economy is in recession,' says Mr Bliss. High quality clothing will continue to produce opportunities. However, in spite of the density of Italian engineering, conditions are tough and prospective deals will be subject to extremely close scrutiny. Invest is examining several potential operations, and Mr Belli believes that there will be no shortage of good opportunities over the next six months, as owners decide to pass the burden of management to others and as their asking prices start to fall. If this happens, the patience of some investment banks should be rewarded after the lengthy period of scarcity. There have been many players on the field and at the sidelines of Italian buy-outs. It will be interesting to see which make the winning plays when the game really gets moving.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Maria </F> Hluchanova and Jana Pankovcinova in Bratislava on 3 May:  "Screening Certificates of Government Members Will Be at Hand in  a Few Weeks"]    [Text] Asked whether the government's situation is not  complicated by rumors that one member of the cabinet has  problems with the screening law, Prime Minister Moravcik said in  an interview for Monday's [2 May] NARODNA OBRODA: "As required  by the screening law, I asked for all government members to be  screened in order to ascertain whether they meet the conditions  of that law. I am waiting for an answer." After yesterday's  meeting of the government, we asked the prime minister in this  context:    [SME] When did you ask for the screening of government  members and why had they not been screened during the formation  of the coalition cabinet?    [Moravcik] It takes some time. You know how much time we had  to form the government. The screening certificates could not be  obtained prior to the government's formation because, under the  law, the certificate must be delivered to the screened person  first and only when the screened person deems it suitable can it  submit the certificate to whoever requested the screening. In  other words, it was not technically possible to do this earlier.  I expect that we will have all the screening certificates at  hand in a few weeks.    [SME] Are the rumors that one member of your cabinet has  problems with the screening certificate true?    [Moravcik] I do not know whether they are true. That is  just what the screening should show.    [SME] Should any member of your cabinet receive a positive  screening certificate, how will you deal with the situation?    [Moravcik] We will proceed in accordance with the law.    [SME] When exactly did you ask for the ministers' screening  certificates?    [Moravcik] Some two or three weeks after the government's  appointment.    [SME] How are we supposed to understand your words that the  results of screenings will be available in only a few weeks?  When Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of the National Council of  the Slovak Republic, asked the Slovak Information Service [SIS]  for a screening certificate, he received it on the second or  third day after submitting the application, as he told SME in an  interview. Why should it take a few weeks?    [Moravcik] I do not know how the process is progressing  technically in the SIS. But I know that they have problems with  the files.    [SME] How quickly do you intend to amend the screening law?    [Moravcik] It has not yet been decided whether the  government will propose an amendment to the screening law.    [SME] Do you not think that the questioning of this law  undermines your declared endeavor to respect and comply with the  screening law?    [Moravcik] We are proceeding in accordance with the law.</p>

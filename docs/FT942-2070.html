			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Electra's net assets improve Net assets at Electra, the venture capital investment trust, rose by 11.6 per cent to 380.9p per share over the six months to the end of March. Total net assets stood at Pounds 659m at March 31, but have declined slightly since then. Mr Michael Stoddart, chairman, said he viewed the future with 'tempered optimism'. Electra's portfolio consists of about one third listed companies and two thirds unquoted companies or listed stocks where there are dealing restrictions. About 30 per cent is invested in the US. Most of the remainder is in the UK, with a few small holdings in continental Europe. The fund does not currently invest in east Asia, but said it had plans for the region. The listed portfolio grew by 17.6 per cent over the half year, compared with a 3.7 per cent rise in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. The unlisted portfolio grew by 7.2 per cent. US growth lagged behind the UK because of declining US stock markets and poor performance by a number of companies, including Atlantic Coast Airlines, Sphere Drake Holdings and US Long Distance. New unlisted investments, amounting to Pounds 71.2m, were split almost equally between the US and the UK. Realisations of unlisted investments brought in Pounds 29.3m. During the half year, four companies in the portfolio were listed and since the end of March a further three have floated. Two more, EuroDollar and Pillar Property Investments, have announced plans to seek a London listing. 'Although we take advantage of market conditions to realise investments through flotations, we are happy to retain our shareholding if the stock market is not receptive to new issues,' Mr Stoddart said. Trade buyers were also interested in several companies, he added. Net available revenue for the half year rose to Pounds 6.94m (Pounds 6.05m) and an interim dividend of 3.55p (3.45p) is declared from earnings per share of 4.01p (3.5p). Electra will shortly lose its position as the UK's largest venture capital trust, with the flotation of 3i. Its results will be watched closely for its possible influence on the pricing of the 3i issue, due to be announced tomorrow. Electra shares closed up 9p at 306p yesterday, a discount of about 19 per cent to the latest net asset value of 378p. See Lex</p>

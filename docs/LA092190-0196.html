			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AGASSI VICTORY GIVES U.S., AUSTRIA 1-1 TIE;  </P> <P> DAVIS CUP: SEMIFINALS SEE AUSTRIAN SKOFF EASILY DISPOSED OF IN STRAIGHT SETS.  MUSTER DOWNS CHANG IN INTERMITTENT RAIN.  </P> <P> Andre Agassi took the sting out of a charged-up Horst Skoff, then toyed with  him for two sets, giving the United States a 1-1 tie with Austria after the  first day of their David Cup semifinal today.  </P> <P> Thomas Muster had used his power to overcome the finesse of Michael Chang in  the opening match as Austria took an early lead in the best-of-five weekend  series.  </P> <P> Agassi won the last three points of a tiebreaker in the first set and captured  12 of the next 13 games as Skoff ran out of energy. The American needed less  than two hours to complete his 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 6-1 victory.  </P> <P> The fourth-ranked Agassi so dominated Skoff that the Austrian did not win a  single point on his own serve in the second set.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of Skoff's tennis was on emotion that first set and I felt like  it was just a question of getting through it," Agassi said. "If I had lost the  first set I think he would have played like that for a little bit longer, but  I'm not sure how long he would have kept that up."  </P> <P> In the other semifinal, Australian took a 2-0 lead over Argentina in Sydney,  Australia. The semifinal winners will play for the title beginning Nov. 30.  </P> <P> Agassi and Skoff traded sharp passing shots and delicate drop shots in the  tiebreaker until the eighth point, when Agassi recovered from a slip to take a  5-3 lead. He won the next point on Skoff's serve, then slammed an ace to finish  the set.  </P> <P> "Andrew was playing great tennis. I've never played somebody who could put me  under pressure like that, never ever. There was nothing I could do," Skoff  said. "If you don't put pressure on Agassi he makes you run like a dog."  </P> <P> With many of the 17,000 fans leaving the Prater soccer stadium in disgust,  Skoff dropped the last 11 points of the match.  </P> <P> "I picked up my game after the first set and he sloed down a little," Agassi  said. "I don't know if he got fatigued, but he tried so hard the first set and  had nothing to show for it."  </P> <P> In the opening match, Chang lost, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4, in an intermittent rain.  </P> <P> Muster improved his Davis Cup clay-court record to 23-0 by taking advantage of  Chang's weak serve.  </P> <P> Muster's victory sent red and white Austrian flags fluttering in the stands and  brought fans, some with their faces painted red and white, to their feet.  </P> <P> "It took me a while until I got used to everything," Muster said. "The last  three sets I was playing some of my best tennis."  </P> <P> The Austrian left-hander, ranked seventh in the world, did not lose his serve  in the second or third sets and recorded four of his eight service breaks  against Chang in those two sets.  </P> <P> "In the second and third sets he was able to dictate the points and I was  having to play on the defensive," Chang said.  </P> <P> The rain, which was not hard enough to stop play, did not seem to greatly  affect either player.  </P> <P> In Sydney, Wally Masur defeated Martin Jaite, 3-6, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-0, 6-2, in  a three-hour struggle, giving Australia a 2-0 lead. Earlier, Pat Cash swept  past Alberto Mancini, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 in the opening singles match on the grass  center court at White City.  </P> <P> Masur was given a pep talk from his teammates during the break after the third  set.  </P> <P> "The guys told Wally he had to get his feet moving," said Australian captain  Neale Fraser. "He came out dancing. It was a fantastic effort."  </P> <P> In a world group qualifying match for the 1991 Davis Cup, Henri Leconte and Guy  Forget gave France a 2-0 lead over Britain at London. Leconte beat Nick Brown,  6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, and Forget defeated Jeremy Bates 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-1.  </P></p>

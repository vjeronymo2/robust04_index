			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe by </F> NHK Political News Department correspondent Koike; place and  date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Watanabe] I believe that the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] alone cannot take power. Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP] alone also  cannot take power. I am in agreement with the policies of  Shinseito and the Japan New Party, and Komeito [Clean Government  Party] appears to be agreeing with their policies. My agreement  with those policies can pave the way for forging a conservative  coalition, and this is the best option under the present  political situation. Forging such a conservative coalition will  serve the interests of our nation.    The coalition partners so far have placed importance on  making a distinction between the LDP and the non-LDP, and their  attitude has stood in the way of forging such a conservative  coalition. I have intended to play a role in rallying  conservative political parties that share the same political  beliefs. I have thought that this is an ideal approach. To play  such a role, I have to form a new political party after quitting  the LDP. Political parties that share the same policies should  forge an alliance after putting aside their past grudges and ill  feelings. I still believe that this is the best way.    [Koike] Mr. Watanabe, there is a belief that you may have  ridden the wave of Ozawa's strategy.    [Watanabe] I do not think that I have ridden the wave of his  strategy. I have acted in accordance with my own beliefs.    [Koike] Mr. Watanabe, in recent days you have made twists  and  turns. How do you assess Mr. Ozawa?    [Watanabe] Mr. Ozawa and I share completely identical  policies, and I trust him.    [Koike] Would you comment on his artifice [chibo]?    [Watanabe] Artifice and the way of getting things done  differ  from person to person. I think that Mr. Ozawa is a decisive man  and a man of action. He is a wonderful man. If he relies  excessively on his artifice, this would cause problems. I am an  old man. I value relationships with other people as much as  possible. I always hope to get along well with other people.  Mr. Ozawa and I do not necessarily share the same artifice.    [Koike] Do you still have the desire to become prime  minister?    [Watanabe] I intend to fulfill my desire as long as I serve  as a politician. I will keep the desire in mind.</p>

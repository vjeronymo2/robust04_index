			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Funds still leaving building societies MONEY CONTINUED to drain out of building society accounts in July because of competition from National Savings. The societies suffered a net outflow of Pounds 325m, up from Pounds 314m in June. The figure was one of the worst for the industry since September 1986 when it suffered an outflow of Pounds 673m as savers withdrew money to take part in the flotation of TSB. However, the July outflow was not as bad as the industry had feared. The societies had forecast an outflow of Pounds 450m to Pounds 500m for the month. They fared better towards the end of the month, after the government had lowered rates on the National Savings First Option Bond, which was introduced in the first week of July. Interest on the bond had outstripped the societies' rates and two weeks after it was introduced the government cut the gross interest rate from 10.34 per cent to 9.67 per cent. Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Building Societies Association, warned that the societies still expected poor inflows of savings in the next few months. Societies still face strong competition from National Savings, and the final call on regional electricity company shareholders next month is also expected to hit building society savings. Mr Boleat said: 'To an extent the pressure has eased but I would not feel too happy in saying that it has gone away.' In spite of the outflow, the total volume of savings held with building societies has risen by about Pounds 8bn since the start of the year because of accrued interest. There was a slight increase in mortgage lending in July, but the societies say they believe that this may have only been a temporary burst in the weeks before the ending on August 19 of the stamp-duty exemption on house sales of less than Pounds 250,000. Gross mortgage advances rose to Pounds 3.74bn from Pounds 3.19bn in June, while net new commitments were 7 per cent up on June at Pounds 3.44bn. Both figures were below the levels of lending in July 1991. The association warned yesterday that the housing market could now fall back with the return of stamp duty at its previous level. Mr Boleat said: 'The effects of this artificial boost to the market may well be reversed over the next few months. The low level of commitments outstanding does not augur well for the near-term prospects for the housing market.'</p>

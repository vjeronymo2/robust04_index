			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso said  today that he will not leave his post following the government  defeat in Congress. He added the government will maintain all  the agreements signed for the approval of the economic plan.    Minister Cardoso said that the commitment the government  needs from Congress is a zero deficit this year. He explained  that there are conditions to compensate, via other measures, for  the resources that would have been collected with the income tax  increase on large companies and the financial operations tax  which were not approved by Congress.    [Begin Cardoso recording] From the point of view of numbers,  there is no problem in replacing what was denied, but this  something else cannot come from the workers or from the middle  class; it must come from companies because they benefited from  the decision of the minority in the Chamber of Deputies  yesterday which opposed the approval of the tax rate increase on  companies, which was a small rate. I reaffirm that the struggle  against inflation is everyone's struggle for the benefit of the  Brazilian people because there are favorable conditions for  investment in Brazil -- the time is right. But this is  everyone's struggle, otherwise inflation will not be defeated.  [end recording]    Cardoso also said that the government will continue to  fulfill the agreements reached during the negotiations for the  approval of the economic plan. He added that in the amendment  for the creation of the social emergency fund, the states will  also be excluded, like what happened to the municipalities  following the retention of the participation fund. Cardoso  explained that in exchange for the retention the states accepted  a cut in the budget program equivalent to $200 million. The  fund will also receive the PIS [Social Integration Program]  revenue from the banks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Romie A. Evangelista] </F>   [Excerpts] Cashiered Army Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan,  leader of the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa (RAM)  [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance] said yesterday his group  was "getting discouraged and losing confidence" with the way  government peace negotiators are handling the peace talks with  military rebels.    He stressed, however, that RAM would not abandon its hope to  reach a peace accord with the government, and that they will  wait for another six months for the government to act concretely  on the issue. [passage omitted]    "We are beginning to be discouraged but we are not  discarding  the peace process. Even if they don't know what to do with the  peace process, we are not going to give up," Honasan said.    "Mukhang wala na namang plano ang pamahalaan ... mukhang  nagbobolahan na naman. Gusto naming malaman kung ano talaga ang  gusto nilang mangyari sa peace process," [It seems that the  government has no plans ... looks like it is back to deception.  We want to know what they really want to happen with the peace  process] he added. [passage omitted]    "One year na kaming nag-uusap ... pero ang narating lang  namin procedures ... saan gagawin ... sino ang magho-host ng  merienda. Tapos, napapagbintangan kami na kami pa raw ang  nagpapabagal pero lahat naiprisinta na namin," [We have been  talking for one year ... but what we have achieved are only  procedures ... where to hold ... who will take charge of the  snacks. Afterwhich, we are blamed for delaying the talks when  we have already presented everything] he explained.    He said they have already given five talking points with the  government but it remained enacted upon. [sentence as published]  His request for provision of bodyguards for protection, was  approved in principle by President Ramos but this also remained  unheeded.    "MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] Chairman Nur Misuari  moves around in Mindanao with many armed bodyguards. Pero kami  na nangunguna, kami pa ang hindi bigyan ng ganuong  konsiderasyon," [But we who talked peace with the government  ahead of the MNLF are not given such consideration] Honasan said.    Asked by the STANDARD if they have a time frame within which  they would seek other options concerning the peace talks,  Honasan said: "Siguro ibig naming tingnan 'yung kalagitnaan ng  taong ito para mabasa natin kung babagal ito at kung may  pinanggagalingan ang katapatan nila." [I think we will just  watch at the middle of this year to determine if the peace  process slows down and if they are really sincere.]    What options they would make in case the peace talks fail?  He said: Kung hihinto? Hindi ... ayaw naming isipin 'yon.  Kapag huminto ito ay mas grabe ang mangyayari." [If it stops?  No ... we do not want to think about it. If this stops, the  worse will happen.]    RAM-YOU (Young Officers Union) leader Capt. Emil Ong said  there are many issues that have to be discussed in the peace  talks that are being ignored.    Ong, who was with Honasan at UST, declined to give the exact  number of RAM forces at present but said only 20 percent of the  entire RAM forces had been mobilized during the December 1989  coup attempt.    Honasan laments the fact that some of his men are still in  jail despite a preliminary agreement reached last 20 December  1992 that all detained RAM men will be released from detention.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Akio Fujii] </F>   [Text] On the 18th, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (FRB)  implemented its third money-tightening measure. These rapid  tightening measures were taken in just the two and a half months  since February. And, again FRB Chairman Greenspan issued a  "monetary tightening" statement concurrent with the tightening  action. The first two measures were announced following policy  decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) composed  of FRB directors and FRB regional presidents, but the third  money-tightening measure did not have any direct participation  by the FOMC. It appears that the FRB is taking the approach of  publicly disclosing policy changes regardless of whether an FOMC  session is involved.    There are various views on why the FRB has adopted the  approach of publicly disclosing policy at the time  money-tightening measures are taken. First is the "Congressional  consideration" view which gave consideration for the heightening  demand in Congress for the immediate public announcement of  monetary policy when a decision is made. Second is the "market  consideration" view calling for the necessity to explain FRB  intent in words rather than through market operations so as to  prevent excessive stock market reactions to precautioonary  money-tightening measures. Third is the "central bank authority"  view to strongly demonstrate the autonomy of the FRB in relation  to the government on monetary policy. Whether just one of these  reasons or several reasons apply is unclear, but it is  definitely a case where FRB policy approach has changed  substantially in connection with the recent money-tightening  measures when compared to past practice.    We now hear vociferous debate on potential successors for  Bank of Japan (BOJ) President Mieno, whose tenure will expire at  the end of the year. President Mieno cites as qualifications of  a successor president an "individual who can discharge the  duties of the central bank." One might say that I am premature  in view of the debate being held on whether the recession has  bottomed out, but if one were to lay out the issue facing the  next BOJ president, it might be the "timely conversion to a  money-tightening stance."    During the question-and-answer phase after a speech given at  the Foreign Correspondents Club, President Mieno on the 19th  stated in reference to monetary policy during the bubble  economy, "Interest rates were raised in the late stages of the  bubble and as a result the actions were untimely," indicating  that lessons were learned from the fact that countermeasures  against asset inflation were untimely as the result of placing  too much emphasis on traditional commodity price indices such as  consumer prices. There were times such as in connection with the  1987 Black Monday when there was no choice but to delay  monetary-tightening measures for fear of adversely affecting  stock markets in Japan, the United States, and Europe, but the  perception is strong even within the BOJ that there were some  oversights in policy matters in the latter stages of the bubble.    In general, in the area of monetary policy, since the  government basically welcomes monetary easing, little friction  exists between the central bank and the government. Problems  arise in the monetary tightening phase and tension between the  government and central bank rises easily, especially during  changes from easing to tightening phases. When and how smoothly  he implements the next tightening move will be the foremost  highlight of the next BOJ president's monetary policies.    FRB Chairman Greenspan was faced with the same issue before  Japan was. In response, he has said, "I will assume a policy  encompassing a public disclosure approach," and has placed that  approach in practice. It may be premature to evaluate whether  this approach was the right one, but the FRB has certainly  demonstrated a clear-cut position.    In contrast, has the BOJ prepared itself for the upcoming  contingencies? First, the current BOJ process of making monetary  policy decisions and handling public announcements is obscure.  When it comes to market interest rate adjustments, it says  nothing except to say, "Please look at the daily adjustments  reflected in the markets." Even if they decide to say something,  it happens in the form of a BOJ press conference where a change  in interest adjustment policy is acknowledged several weeks  after implementation.    Further, although the official discount rate is, in  principle, set at the BOJ Policy Committee, in reality, it  undergoes quick approval at a "general meeting," but prior  approval during roundtable discussions of the board of directors  and coordination with the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. The minutes  of the BOJ Policy Committee are eventually published in summary  format, but the nature and contents of debate leading to the  policy decisions are not disclosed. The proceedings are  structured so that only privileged insiders are privy to the  monetary policy decisionmaking process.    Although MOF support is usually extended to the BOJ during  monetary easing periods, that is not always the case during  monetary tightening phases. There are times when monetary  tightening must be undertaken, even when such action is contrary  to the wishes of the government. I believe such situations  should be handled in a manner so that BOJ intentions and  contents of decision are promptly made public without the risk  of misunderstandings.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MAVERICK WHO TIED KNOT FOR PLAYBOY KING  </P> <P> This summer, Charles D. Ara began receiving telephone calls from strangers and  friends he had not heard from in years.  </P> <P> Ara, who performed the marriage ceremony for Hugh Hefner, founder of the  Playboy empire, was suddenly a very popular person.  </P> <P> Some of the calls were former Catholic priests who, like Ara, are married and  no longer considered to be priests by the Catholic church. "Some of them said  they wished they had been chosen to perform the wedding," Ara said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Priests Offered to Help  </P> <P> Others were from priests who jokingly asked if they could participate in the  July 1 marriage of Hefner to Kimberly Faye Conrad.  </P> <P> "Some asked me if they could hold the Bible during the ceremony," said Ara, a  marriage, family and child counselor in private practice in Cerritos.  </P> <P> "Charlie was always known as a maverick who is very committed to his beliefs,"  said a priest in the Los Angeles Archdiocese who did not want his name used. He  caid that a number of priests who discussed Ara's role in the Hefner marriage  said it would be bizarre for them as Catholic priests to perform the ceremony.  </P> <P> But another priest, Father Terrence Richey, said: "I couldn't imagine doing the  wedding, but I'm not horrified that Charlie did it."  </P> <P> Representatives of television talk show host Pat Sajak called and invited Ara  to appear on the Sajak program.  </P> <P> Ara did not hesitate. He accepted. In fact, he appeared on the show on two  occasions.  </P> <P> The talkative and humorous Ara showed no signs of nervousness while on TV. At  one point during the first appearance July 7, Sajak joked that he could not  shut Ara up long enough to get a word in himself.  </P> <P> Ara said during the show that his marriage was similar in some ways to Hefner's  marriage to Conrad, who is Playboy's reigning Playmate of the Year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wife Is Younger and Taller  </P> <P> Just as Hefner, 63, is older than his wife, who is 26, Ara, 59, pointed out  that he is older than his wife Shirley, who is 47.  </P> <P> "My wife is much taller than I, and Kimberly appears to be an inch or two  taller than Hef," Ara said.  </P> <P> Ara says he is 5 feet 5 but his 5-foot-8 wife quipped, "He might be stretching  it a bit."  </P> <P> The couple were married in 1970 and live in Cerritos. They have five children,  ranging in age from 9 to 16. They met when Ara was a priest at St. Cecilia's  Catholic Church in Tustin.  </P> <P> "I fell in love, got married and gave up my chance to be Pope," said Ara, who  was born in Los Angeles and attended St. John's Seminary in Camarillo.  </P> <P> Ara was invited to make a second appearance on the Sajak show, he said, after  the show received a few calls from viewers who wanted to know how he could be  married and still refer to himself as a priest.  </P> <P> Bill Rivera, public affairs director for the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese,  said the church had no comment on Ara's performing the ceremony for Hefner.  </P> <P> Ara "is ancient history (as a former priest). As far as we are concerned, he is  just another lay person," Rivera said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I'm Still Helping'  </P> <P> But Ara says he still performs the duties of a priest. He regards himself as an  ordained Catholic minister and consequently empowered by the state to perform  weddings.  </P> <P> "I added matrimony to my priesthood. I'm still helping people. I help them get  over their hurt," said Ara, who is active in CORPUS (Corps of Reserve Priests  United for Service). It is a national organization that lobbies the church for  changes to allow married priests to serve again.  </P> <P> Ara said he was surprised when he got a call from the bride-to-be asking him to  preside over the wedding. "You could have knocked me over with a feather," he  said.  </P> <P> "They had seen me perform another wedding in Malibu. They thought I was funny  and did a good job," said Ara, who prides himself on being able to pitch  humorous, but thought-provoking, one-liners.  </P> <P> Even in his practice as a therapist, Ara says he tries to inject humor to help  his clients.  </P> <P> During a session, Ara said he sometimes switches on a flashlight and tells the  person: "Lighten up."  </P> <P> He might tell a person who has been fired: "Losing your job might be the  greatest thing for your wealth. Now, you can decide what you really will enjoy  doing."  </P> <P> Ara said he advised the Hefners: "The grass isn't greener on the other side.  The grass is greener where it is watered."  </P> <P> Ara said he was attempting to tell the couple that people "need to take care of  their love."  </P> <P> Ara said he is planning to write a book based on a philosophy that also is the  cornerstone of a workshop he is scheduled to teach Oct. 6 at Cerritos College  titled "The 'A's' of Successful Marriages." The three-hour workshop, which  costs $20, will begin at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Ara said he believes that successful relationships depend on several "A" words,  including having affection, giving attention to each other, acceptance of  faults and appreciation.  </P> <P> Ara said he had fun mingling with the guests at Hefner's Holmby Hills estate  during the wedding reception.  </P> <P> The Hefners must have enjoyed his performance, Ara said.  </P> <P> "They invited me and my wife and all of the kids for hamburgers at their home.  The butler cooked hamburgers for everyone, including Hef."  </P></p>

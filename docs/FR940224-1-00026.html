			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To formalize this distinction, EPA is proposing to make use of grouping system concepts and definitions previously discussed in the April 1992 NPRM. Specifically, EPA proposes that a F/FA product not registered by its manufacturer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as of the date of promulgation of this rule be designated as ``registrable'' if it meets the program's criteria for grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the same fuel family <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Conversely, a F/FA product not registered by its manufacturer as of the date of promulgation would be designated as ``new'' if it does not meet the program's criteria for grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive in the same fuel family. In these definitions, the term ``currently'' refers to the date on which EPA receives the registration application for the F/FA in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of these definitions, registration is product-specific. Thus, if a particular fuel or additive product has not been registered by its manufacturer, then that manufacturer does not have the right to introduce, market, and/or sell this product, even if a compositionally similar or identical product has been registered by another manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``bulk additive,'' sometimes called a ``general use'' additive, was defined in the NPRM as a product added to fuel at the refinery as part of the original blending stream or after the fuel is transported from the refinery, but before the fuel is purchased for introduction into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. In contrast, an ``aftermarket additive,'' sometimes called a consumer additive, is an additive product marketed for introduction directly into the fuel system of a motor vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Fuel family'' refers to the primary categorization of F/FAs within the proposed grouping system. A fuel family was defined in the NPRM as a set of F/FAs which share basic chemical and physical formulation characteristics and can be used in the same engine or vehicle. Seven such fuel families were originally defined (unleaded gasoline, leaded gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, methane, and propane), although EPA now intends to delete the leaded gasoline family in view of the prohibition under CAA section 211(n) of on-road use of leaded fuel after December 31, 1995. In the proposed definition of ``registrable,'' the restriction ``in the same fuel family'' means that the similarity of an applicant F/FA to a bulk additive currently registered for use in another fuel family would not suffice to make the applicant F/FA registrable. This restriction is consistent with the general principles of the grouping system, which permits grouping of F/FAs only within defined fuel families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to these definitions, an unregistered F/FA which meets the criteria for grouping only with a currently registered aftermarket additive (and not also with a currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) would not be registrable. This does not preclude an unregistered aftermarket additive from being registrable (since aftermarket additives can group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the registration status of currently registered aftermarket additives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in unleaded gasoline and conforming to the ``substantially similar'' criteria for unleaded gasoline (56 FR 5352) would be registrable, since it would be able to group with currently registered baseline unleaded gasoline fuels and bulk additives <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . On the other hand, an unregistered chromium-containing additive intended for use in unleaded gasoline would be considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable,'' because there are no currently registered chromium-containing fuels or bulk additives in the unleaded gasoline family with which the applicant additive could be grouped. Even if a chromium-containing product had previously been registered as an aftermarket additive for unleaded gasoline (prior to the ban on such aftermarket additives under CAA section 211(f)(1)(B) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or as a bulk additive for use in another fuel family (e.g., leaded gasoline or diesel fuel), the applicant additive would still be considered ``new''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ability to join the unleaded gasoline baseline group assumes that the detergent additive does not exceed oxygen and sulfur limits applicable to the baseline unleaded gasoline category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Until the 1990 CAA Amendments went into effect, the statutory language of section 211(f) was interpreted as applying only to unleaded gasoline fuels and related bulk additives. Thus, prior to November 15, 1990 (the effective date of the CAA Amendments), aftermarket additives intended for use in unleaded gasoline and containing elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur were allowed to be registered. Under the 1990 CAA amendments, all types of motor vehicle F/FAs were placed under section 211(f) jurisdiction. All aftermarket additives that were not ``substantially similar'' and were introduced on or after November 15, 1990 were banned. However, this ban does not apply to products first introduced into commerce prior to November 15, 1990 [CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)]. Thus, ``non-sub-sim'' gasoline aftermarket additives which had been registered prior to that date were allowed to retain their registrations. These are so-called ``grandfathered'' aftermarket additives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the original proposal, new F/FA products would automatically be allowed on the market after submission of Tier 1 and Tier 2 data, whether or not significant health effects concerns had arisen and whether or not EPA had sufficient information to determine if action under section 211(c) were appropriate. However, to address the concerns described above in relation to section 211(c), EPA is now proposing to require that manufacturers of new F/FA products (i.e., F/FA products not registered by their specific manufacturers as of the date of promulgation and not fitting the registrable criteria) submit all testing requirements prior to registration, including Tier 3 when prescribed by the Agency. This means that if EPA were to identify a need for additional testing at the Tier 3 level for a new F/FA, registration would not be granted until satisfactory completion of all such requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (15): Surge of new products - Many of today's photocopiers and printers act as one - at the touch of a button / Printers and Copiers The transition to the all-digital office is gathering apace. Not, as we were once led to expect, to get rid of paperwork but to produce better-looking documents, faster and cheaper, on demand at the point of need. It is not such a long leap into the dark unknown for the modern copier as some may think, for it already uses 10 or more microprocessors and software programs wisely and well to make an amazing array of facilities available at the touch of a button. Fast scanning, infinitely variable zoom, automatic double-sided copying at full engine speed, job programming with memory retention and self-diagnostics are just some of the state-of-the-art features that can be accessed via graphical displaysor touch-sensitive screens. In fact, the technology has advanced to the stage where every office junior in the land could take a set of originals and, with a modicum of training, produce reports, booklets or manuals, stapled complete with colour covers and dividers, in less time than it takes to place an order with a printshop. No wonder suppliers such as Canon, Infotec, Konica, Lanier, Minolta, Mita, Nashuatec, Oce, Olivetti, Panasonic, Rank Xerox, Ricoh, Sharp and Triumph-Adler have all recently launched medium-speed systems machines for the office market. The digital print room Questions are being raised in centralised print departments about the need to produce intermediates, which is both time-consuming and wasteful. If the majority of originals are created on a computer, users argue, would it not make economic sense to send the images direct to the copier electronically? According to Kodak research, 70 percent of UK business and public sector organisations believe that, where the key requirements arelow cost, fast turnaround times, dependability of time-sensitive information and efficient use of space, a copier to computer or network link is important. Hence the company's decision to ad thenew Kodak 1580 copier-printer to its Lionheart programme in the first quarter of 1994. Oce is also moving towards the Digital Repro Centre ideal with a software solution that integrates existing analogue copiers, laser printers, scanners, computers and applications to providean interchangeable and updateable package that will enable the repro department to grow from present hard copy reproduction to the benefits of fully-digital working methods at their own paceand within what might be very right budgets. Commercial Union can already testify to the benefits of digital technology when compared with traditional offset presses. Ray Thorn, manager of group supply, says: 'Using the Xerox DocuTech to produce 500 prints will see the job printed and finished beforethe press would have been ready to start.' To CU's marketing department it is image quality that is crucial, so they have been chosen to run a pilot where they will be able to eliminate intermediates by linking their desk-top PCs or Macs to the MediaServer via a modem for direct input. Digital offset The offset press is not dead yet, though; and for long-run colour-work at a low cost per copy it still has no equal. The launch ofthe Indigo E-Print 100, the world's first digital offset colour printer which combines the performance and image quality of liquid ink with digital imaging and electronic paper handling, proves that it, too, is being given a new lease of life. The digital duplicator The duplicator, too, is alive and well and embracing digital technology to eliminate messy manual processes. With costs per copy on print runs of 24-4000 copies per original at less than one-third of a penny, the economics speak for themselves in schools and colleges where electronic copier-duplicators from Gestetner, Infotec, Ricoh and Riso are finding favour. The ability to link the machines directly to a PC or MAC for direct image input further enhances their value in terms of investment futures. Multifunction desk-top Integrated digital solutions for general office use have been hovering in the wings for several years but the high cost when compared with the products they replace have not made economic sense to purchasers. Marketing directors at Canon, Konica, Ricoh, Sharp and Toshiba have all commented on the fact that although 35 percent of the Japanese copier market is already digital, it will represent no more than 5-10 percent of the UK market for atleast two years. Richard Norton, vice president, Worldwide Document Management Group, Dataquest, the market research company, agrees with that view, but cites several new developments that will help to makethe all-digital office a reality. One is the Oki DOC-IT, a small desk-top unit for personal use costing from Pounds 3,000 that combines image scanning, plain paper fax, copying and page printing. A network version is planned. Mid-range multifunction devices worth noting, he says, include the Ricoh 5330 and the Canon GP55. Digital colour Could 1993 be the year that colour takes off? Perhaps. European research carried out by BIS Strategic Decisions shows that unit sales of colour copiers, now at just under 35,000 units, will grow at the rate 20 per cent (CAGR) through to 1997. Canon was the first to break the price barrier with the launch of a digital colour copier-printer based on bubblejet technology at under Pounds 4,000. Olivetti, too, has entered the market with the Colour 8000 at Pounds 3,795 which divisional manager Alistair Booth believes will be used primarily as a PC printer. Colour laser printers, says BIS, will grow much faster than colour copier, with unit sales rising from 130 units in 1992 to 32,500 in 1997 (104 per cent CAGR 1993-1997). It could be higher if the QMS ColourScript Laser 1000 and the Oce 6460 desk-top machines (priced at around Pounds 10,00-Pounds 11,000) are joined by lower cost units from suppliers such as Canon and Hewlett Packard. But because of much lower prices of colour inkjet and the ability of the technology to be adapted for printer and copier use, sales across Europe are likely to outstrip any other product type, BIS predicts, with units shipped rising from 442,000 in 1992 to 3.35m in 1997. COLOUR inkjet printer-only devices that have broken the mould interms of price and capability include Hewlett Packard DeskJet 1200C and 1200C/PS, which came in at around Pounds 1,400, followed more recently by the Canon BJC-600 at Pounds 599, plus Vat, both bringing to the masses the essential combination of affordable plain paper full-colour and true black. Competing in this market are four-colour thermal units, and here the innovations possible are epitomised by the Star SJ-144, a three-page per minute printer offering zoom magnification priced at a low Pounds 569 and which won the Best of Comdex award this year. At the higher end of the market where the quest for perfectcolour matching and colour registration is crucial, one of the most important developments is the range of EFI (Electronics for Imaging) colour management products which can turn a digitalcolour copier, such as the Canon CLC, Kodak ColorEdge Plus, AgfaXC305, Minolta CD-80 and the Rank Xerox 5775, into a multifunction copier-printer capable of producing very high quality colour output. The need to develop anti-counterfeiting technology, however, naturally adds to the cost. The colour copier-printer market certainly look set for some excitement as innovative products like the Rank Xerox MajestiK, with its auto colour sensing capabilities, stretch the technology barriers. Capable of accepting images from a variety of sources, including computers, scanners and photo CD systems and due to be launched in the first half of 1994, it has already created a storm in Japan by capturing 42 per cent of the digital colour market. Developments in copier and printer technology are, then, still growing apace, with computer networking, PC interfaces, digital imaging and electronic paper handling enabling users to tap into any one of the technologies available on the network, choice only depending on their current application. Users today do not even have to worry about configuring a printer to suit their requirements. Automatic interface switching enables printers to accept data from multiple sources without manualintervention. Automatic emulation avoids the user having to specify a particular computer language. Simultaneous processing of multiple jobs increases throughput. But what if, as a computer user, you have to work from otherlocations and your print jobs are particularly complex? Does itmean that you have to spend ages to reconfigure each printer you use? What if you use a multifunction copier-printer that has tobe physically switched from one function to another and need to access it from a remote location? No problem, says Bob Anderson, director of the Xerox Research Centre at Cambridge Laboratory. In future, you will only have to configure your digital copier or printer once. After that, wherever you are located, be it home, a branch office or overseas subsidiary, as soon as you log on to the network, your printer configuration will automatically search you out without youhaving to do a thing. That, says Anderson, is what printing on demand at the point of need is about. Do you have the feeling that business equipment is getting too clever for its own good? Have no fear, sales of copiers and printers proves that paper is here to stay for many years yet.</p>

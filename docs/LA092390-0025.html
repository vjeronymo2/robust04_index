			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN CONDUCTORS  </P> <P> What a sad and stinging indictment of our teenybopper-based pop culture -- and  The Times' ability to pander to it -- that singer George Michael is worth 96  column inches of copy while symphony conductor JoAnn Falletta gets a little  more than half as much space.  </P> <P> Michael is obviously a thoughtful enough young fellow to realize he's in velvet  bondage, captive to the recording industry that's done such a splendid job of  savaging music. Best wishes for his escape.  </P> <P> JACK O'MARA  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

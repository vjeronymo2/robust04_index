			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition not working in cross-Channel fares Sir, Charles Batchelor's report ('Tunnel prompts Stena to simplify ferry fares', January 5) on the 'simplification' of Stena Line cross-Channel fares appears to indicate another huge rise in some tariffs, particularly for a car with driver only or even with single passenger. For these travellers the increase, particularly during the summer months, will represent a much greater rise than the 'couple of per cent' vaguely indicated by the operators. This is typical of the arrogant and rapacious attitude of the ferry companies towards travellers since announcement of the construction of the Channel tunnel. One is persuaded that they have deliberately raised their almost identical fares way beyond inflation almost every year, confident that the eventual Chunnel tariffs could not compete with them if necessary cash flow to service mounting debt was to be raised. They have now set a comfortable 'floor' for the tunnel while castly increasing their own profit potential. There is a smell of collusion about this cost-push manoeuvre which involves not only the ferry operators but the tunnel management as well. Dr Stefan Szymanski of Imperial College has written a paper, already referred to in your newspaper, that clearly indicates progressive and unwarrantable raising of ferry tariffs since the announcement of the tunnel's construction. It is to be hoped that the Office of Fair Trading and the EU competition office are closely monitoring this pocket-picking of the public. Cross-Channel ferry tariffs have been set far above any comparative journey in Europe for as long as I can remember. Why should the advent of an additional alternative send up passenger costs even further? That is not competition or the working of a 'market'.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Technology: Hot under the collar - Andrew Baxter describes how the wonders of the microwave oven are moving into the laundry room You only have to glance round a big supermarket to realise how microwave ovens have transformed the convenience food industry over the past decade, with whole ranges of tempting dishes created specially for heating in a few minutes. Until now, microwaves in the home have been restricted to ovens, but that could be changing. The advent of microwave clothes-driers could spur similar changes in the drying of clothes at home and in launderettes, in dry-cleaning - and in clothes themselves. In the past few weeks, the California-based Electric Power Research Institute (Epri) has unveiled a prototype microwave clothes-drier that promises to bring the benefits of microwave technology to the laundry room - shorter drying times, improved energy efficiency and much reduced damage to delicate fabrics. It is early days yet, and one important techical problem remains unresolved, but John Kesselring, senior project manager at Epri, sees 'exciting possibilities' when microwave driers are launched on the domestic appliance market. That could be by 1996, he says. The availability of microwave driers, he says, could affect the clothing market in ways that increase the driers' usefulness, as has happened with microwave ovens. Clothes of delicate or woollen material that are now dry-cleaned could be specially designed and marketed as suitable for home-drying. Long-term, this could have implications for the dry-cleaning industry, but in the shorter term the developments at Epri are being watched most closely by domestic appliance producers, which do not want to miss the boat on a potential new product in a mature market. 'We have been very pro-active in looking at all types of energy,' says Fred Stave, Whirlpool's director of technology development and application. 'Previously we've been very cautious about microwave driers, but technology is marching on, and we must look at the possible applications very carefully.' Epri has been investigating the potential for microwave clothes-drying since 1990, picking up on earlier work in the appliance industry. The aim from the outset was to find an entirely new approach which would eliminate some of the inherent disadvantages of conventional tumble-driers, whether powered by electricity or - as is common in the US - natural gas. In standard driers, air is heated as hot as 3500F and blown into the drum, which tumbles the clothes in arcs. The heat is transferred from the air to the surface of the wet clothing. That evaporates the water and reduces the air temperature in the drum, which then rises again during drying from 1100F to 1600F. Capillary action moves embedded water out to the fabric surfaces and eventually heat must be conducted into the fabrics so that water can be removed as steam. The result is that the fabrics are heated to about 1600F, damaging the molecular structure of woollens and delicate fabrics, and causing shrinkage. The microwave drier uses the same magnetron tubes fitted in ovens to produce beams of microwaves that heat up water molecules in wet clothing, causing them to align and then reverse alignment as rapidly as 2.5bn times per second. This heat drives off the water. The fabric stays relatively cool, because its molecular structure gives it a much lower dielectric loss coefficient - a measure of how readily the material is heated by microwaves - than that of water. For delicate fabrics, Epri has been blowing cooling air into the microwave drier, where temperatures have not generally exceeded 1100F - appropriate for delicate fabrics. For normal loads, the shortest drying time could be achieved by combining heated air with microwaves. Since the middle of last year, Epri has been testing an experimental unit built by two Californian companies, Thermo Energy and JG Microwave. Equipped with eight 0.85kW magnetrons, the unit can supply 6.8kW of microwave power, enough to dry a seven-pound load in about half the time required by a conventional electric drier. Overall the savings on time and energy are impressive, but are complicated by the probability that any production machine would be a hybrid of microwave and conventional drying. The reduction in drying times could range from 25 to 60 per cent, says Kesselring, with the biggest gains in coin-operated laundry equipment where users just want to 'finish and get out'. Energy efficiency could be increased by 25 per cent in residential driers, and more in commercial equipment, he says. The cost of the drier would be higher, not only because of the need for two technologies but because a microwave clothes drier would require a shield to prevent microwave leakage. Epri is now making 10 microwave driers for field-testing, but one problem remains: as the moisture in clothes decreases through drying, the electrical charge inside the drier rises, which can cause metal objects to heat up, potentially scorching clothes or even causing a fire. The hazard has been narrowed down to small, thin pieces of metal such as pins and bin-liner or bread-wrapper ties and does not effect zippers or large objects which take much longer to heat up. Kesselring is confident that Epri has a solution, for which a patent is pending. He admits, however, that this will 'make or break' the microwave drier's ultimate commercial appeal. 'A lot of people have been looking at ways to put different types of energy into domestic appliances,' Stave says. 'This one is clearly the closest to being viable.'</p>

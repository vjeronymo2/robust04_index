			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 18 May  1994, pages 16 and 17, carries a 1700-word article dated 17 May  by Eladio Arcaya who evaluates the armed strike ordered by the  Shining Path, SL, to commemorate the 14th anniversary of its  first "terrorist" action.    For the first time in 14 years, the people of the Upper  Huallaga region did not obey the armed strike ordered by the SL.  They went about their business as usual in the midst of an  impressive deployment of combined police and Army security  forces along the Marginal highway from Tingo Maria to Aucayacu.  Officials ordered a curfew in Pucayacu from 2100 to 0600 after  four people were murdered on 15 May by a SL unit that looted the  town, taking food and medicine. The SL unit came from Upper  Pucayacu where it has a camp. A military patrol with help from  the population cleaned "subversive" slogans from the walls in  Madre Mia.    The peasants no longer fear the armed strike and went to  work  the land. Others opened their businesses, took their children  to school, and carried out their normal activities like any  other day.    Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 18 May 1994, page 17,  carries  an unattributed 800-word article on the "total failure" of the  SL armed strike ordered in Lima. The people paid no attention  to the call and went to work as usual. Despite some cuts in the  public transportation system because bus owners wanted to  protect their units early in the morning, most Lima residents  managed to get to work. Police and Army units patrolled roads  and highways. Some "subversives" managed only to throw a few  fire crackers. Security forces captured five "subversives" and  confiscated weapons and explosives. In the San Juan de  Lurigancho district, the Army provided buses to take passangers  to the university campus. Early on the morning of 17 May a bomb  exploded at the Interbanc branch in the San Martin de Porres  district. On the same day at 1400, policemen of the Pachacutec  Police Post arrested three alleged "terrorists" who reportedly  murdered a woman who was selling fruit in the market of San Juan  de Miraflores. The police found two 9 mm Browning pistols in  their posession.</p>

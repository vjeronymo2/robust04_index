			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Keeping a fair rent I HAVE HAD a protected tenancy with a private sector landlord for the past eight years. The property now needs a substantial amount of money spent on it, including a modern heating system, to which the landlord is unwilling to contribute. How can I ensure that any improvements I make to the fabric of the property do not result in the rent officer determining a higher 'fair rent' when he next inspects the property? You should write to the rent officer asking him to note on the file that you are effecting improvements, as the landlord refuses to do them, and give a brief description of what they are and the cost. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

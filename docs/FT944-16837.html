			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Private cable operators organise A group of Europe's leading private cable operators will this week launch an association to campaign for permission to carry telecommunications services across their networks in competition with phone companies. The move comes as the European Commission seeks to persuade EU telecoms ministers to allow competing telecoms networks, including existing cable television systems. The Association of Private European Cable Operators will include Generale des Eaux, the main French private sector cable operator, UK-based cable companies - which since 1991 have been allowed to offer telecoms services and now have more than 500,000 phone subscribers - and independent operators in Denmark and Germany. The association, based in Brussels, is a break-away from the European Cable Communications Association by private operators whose interests are diverging sharply from those of the state-owned phone companies which account for 40 per cent of Europe's cable connections. About 43 per cent of Europe's cable connections are provided by private operators, with a further 17 per cent provided by local authorities or non-telecoms utilities.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Greek inflation rate falls to 14.4% GREECE'S year-on-year inflation rate dropped to 14.4 per cent in 1992, down from 18.0 per cent the previous year but still more than twice the European Community average. Consumer prices rose 1.3 per cent in December, compared with 1.7 per cent the previous December. The government has underlined its commitment to bringing inflation under control by restricting public sector wage rises to 9.1 per cent this year, when inflation is projected at 12 per cent. Public-sector price increases are to be held below 8 per cent, with the exception of domestic telephone tariffs and flights on Olympic Airways, the loss-making state carrier. The Economy Ministry forecasts that year-on-year inflation will fall below 10 per cent by November 1993, making it possible for the drachma to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism at the end of the year. The impact of recession has also helped to keep down domestic price rises despite the lifting of controls in 1992 on a wide range of goods, from bread and other foods to petroleum products. Private-sector wage rises this year, now being negotiated, are expected to average around 12 to 13 per cent.</p>

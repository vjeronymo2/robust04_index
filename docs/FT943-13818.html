			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / People: Schacht fulfils his long-term strategy - Names in the News The decision last week by Henry Schacht to hand over the reigns of Cummins Engine to his long-time friend and colleague James Henderson is just another example of the vision that has characterised Schacht's 21-year term as ceo, writes Laurie Morse. Once described as a 'prairie patrician' because of his Harvard MBA-style of management at the Indiana company, Schacht opted for long-term solutions as he battled against foreign competition, loss of domestic market share, and a hostile takeover bid (from Hanson) during the 1980s. His strategy, which included a costly investment in engines for mid-size and smaller trucks and in technology that allowed Cummins engines to exceed US clean air standards for automotive emissions, resulted in long years of losses. However, the long-term investments began to pay off in 1991 and last year Cummins earned Dollars 177.1m on sales of Dollars 4.25bn. The company has a much more diversified product base than it had a decade ago, has formed strategic international alliances, and is profiting from a surge in truck orders as the US economy recovers. What better time, said Schacht, than to take care of a most important duty - an orderly leadership transition. 'I started talking with our board in 1992. We realised that in 1994 both Jim and I would be 60, and that we needed to avoid a double transition.' Henderson, who has managed side-by-side as chief operating officer with Schacht for two decades, will take over as Cummins ceo. He intends to retire at 65, so has 5 years to put his mark on the company. Schacht intends to continue in his post as chairman, and Theodore 'Tim' Solso, who is 47, will become chief operating officer. In the meantime, Schacht has no plans to slow down. 'I will be pursuing full-time the strategic alliances we've been building overseas,' he says.</p>

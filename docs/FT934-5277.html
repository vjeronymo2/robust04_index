			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / FT Review of Business Books (10): Get my product to the market on time PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH By David Inwood and Jean Hammond Kogan Page Pounds 16.95 194 pages The company which gets to market first can often set a standard and establish a lead which its competitors can never destroy. So the speed with which new products or services can be developed and put on sale can make a significant contribution to company profits. The Japanese have established a strong reputation for bringing products rapidly to market. Japanese companies in the motor industry have brought development lead times down to just 43 months compared with the 63 months taken by their US competitors, though the Americans have started to respond. Just how a company should set about improving its management of product development is explained in this practical guide. The authors, respectively a consultant and an organisational psychologist, identify their target market as the corporate strategist, the project manager and the leaders and members of product development teams. The techniques described are most likely to form part of a large company's management armoury but the principles could be applied, with benefit, by the medium-sized business. The pace of new product launches in a range of highly visible sectors such as video recorders, cameras and motor vehicles has encouraged high expectations among consumers. But the failure rate for new high-technology products is high. Traditional methods of developing new products are no longer appropriate, the authors argue. In the past the process would start with a technical product development team turning an idea into a design. The production engineering department would convert the design into a product; and a production team would devise the means of manufacture, including tooling and training. Finally marketing would launch and sell the product. This way of working is often known as the 'over-the-wall' approach to product development. One department does its job in isolation and then passes the project with little or no discussion on to the next. Objectives may be lost as the project is handed on; no one is in overall control; there is often a need for lots of changes late in the day; and the process is expensive and slow. The new approach, which has been pioneered by the Japanese, is for an integrated management team to develop these various strands in parallel. Outline market research will be carried out at the same time as an investigation of the technical possibilities. At the same time the production department will begin its planning. However, there are limits to this approach and complete parallel working is not really possible. Until the concept has been worked out and the specifications drawn up it would be suicidal to run technical, production and marketing development at the same time. The label which has been applied to this method of working is 'simultaneous or concurrent engineering', though this has the unfortunate implication that product development is still at heart an engineering process. The authors prefer the term 'integrated product development.' This requires the creation, at an early stage, of a multi-disciplinary team which can ensure there is a consistent approach. As far as possible, the different processes should take place in parallel, though in practice some areas will have to overlap rather than run in complete parallel. Ideally projects should be kept small and companies should aim for incremental improvements rather than big advances. The more ambitious the development, the more likely it is to become bogged down by problems. This can create a vicious circle of infrequent product launches and a consequent loss of feedback from customers, leading to expensive failure. Controls are then tightened, senior management becomes involved and development slows even further. But while incremental change can reduce the risks involved in product development, it can be pushed too far, the authors warn. Too many changes cause problems for product support and can leave customers who have bought an earlier model feeling short-changed. Even when there is careful planning, product development is never a certain thing, with fixed and knowable goals at the start. Product development teams must therefore be prepared to modify their plans as a project advances. If insuperable problems emerge they may have to axe a project altogether. But by adopting a phased approach they can achieve a better management of risk. Often the idea of risk appears to defy rational thought, but there are methods of controlling risk which do not necessarily require the use of refined numeric techniques. Risks may be categorised as internal, resulting, for example, from a lack of resources or the use of an unfamiliar technology. Or they may be external, taking the form of a pre-emptive product launch by a competitor or a change in public taste. They may relate to the technology involved or to the marketing approach adopted. By discussing risk in advance, a product team can assess both the probability of a particular threat and its potential severity. Managers can then take steps to avoid the risk, to share it with, say, a supplier, or to insure against it. They can modify a product or commission outside research and development to solve a particular problem. This handbook provides a thorough, if somewhat dry, account of how to speed up product development. It would have been improved by the use of case histories and by a more comprehensive glossary to guide the beginner through the jargon. But it deals with a subject which companies ignore at their peril.</p>

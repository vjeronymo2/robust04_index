			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most comments on the advance notice, and a great deal of the input gained through the Secretary's visits to western states, supported modification of the initial proposal to expand the definition of affected interests, eliminate grazing advisory boards and district advisory councils, and create an advisory mechanism with broader representation and much more direct involvement. Many comments expressed a concern that local input would be overshadowed by interests not directly affected by the decisions to be made while others asserted that all citizens should have an equal say in the management of public lands. There was also a great amount of interest in making public participation more effective by encouraging consensus-based forms of decisionmaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period of November 1993, through January 1994, Governor Roy Romer of Colorado convened and conducted nine meetings of the Colorado working group on rangeland reform. Although this working group considered many of the proposals of Rangeland Reform '94, a key finding of the group was that the current framework employed by the Department and the BLM for encouraging community-based involvement was inadequate. This issue became the focus of much of the Working Group's efforts. The Working Group prepared a summary of their findings and a model for enhanced community-based involvement. The Department agrees with the findings of the group and has attempted to incorporate all key elements of the model for public involvement in this proposed rule. The Working Group's model is presented in its entirety below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Models for Enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Community-Based Involvement in Rangeland Reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 20, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Colorado Rangeland Reform Working Group (``working group'') is committed to these seven goals: (1) Healthy and sustainable rangeland ecosystems, (2) healthy, sustainable and diverse economies and communities (3) accountability of management and users of public lands to broad public goals, (4) efficient and effective management of our public lands, (5) fostering mutual respect among public land users, (6) encouraging the retention of private land open space, and (7) ensuring public lands are managed to comply with federal laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with these goals, the Colorado working group has concluded that the current framework for public and community-based involvement in public lands management is inadequate. That framework could be significantly enhanced by experimenting with a bottom-up, grass roots model of public participation that includes multiple interests and some identified areas of responsibility for on-the-ground rangeland management decisions, and ensures that all members of the public who wish to actively participate in public rangelands decisions, have a full opportunity to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These recommendations are based on two principles: (1) This is a Colorado model (the Colorado working group recognizes that this Colorado model may not be applicable to other western states, and that there may be other models that are better suited to those states); and (2) that this Colorado model represents a change from the current and/or traditional management and that this is an experimental approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The working group has explored a number of different models based in part on the favorable experiences of community and ecosystem-based approaches like that underway in Gunnison, Colorado; the ``Owl Mountain'' example in Jackson, County, Colorado; the Coordinated Resource Management (CRM) experience near Craig, Colorado; and the Federal Lands Program in Montezuma County, Colorado. We recognize that these models may not be appropriate for other states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of discussion, the attached ``draft'' represents an experimental approach to reforming the governance structure for advisory boards and community-based rangeland decision-making. Based on the working group's discussions to date, there is consensus on the basic approach suggested by these models_and consensus on the value of having Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt share this draft with other states and experts in the Department of the Interior for their review. The group further agrees that many of the concepts and ideas described in this model could be useful and applicable to the U.S. Forest Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

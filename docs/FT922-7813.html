			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Genoa hails Columbus The bets are off whether Italy will have a president in time to cut the ribbon, but whoever performs the ceremony, the city of Genoa will today celebrate the opening of its bid to cash in on the Christopher Columbus industry, Haig Simonian writes from Genoa. Genoa's most famous son left his native city for Spain after failing to find sufficient financial backing at home for his expedition to the New World. Latter-day Italian bureaucracy has meant Genoa's current attempt to mark its most celebrated mariner has also taken second place to Spain, with the international exhibition in Seville to mark the quincentenary of Columbus's discovery opening well ahead of its Genovese rival. But the Genovese, who have had around L700bn (Pounds 317m) of Italian government money to shower on their event, claim it is not competing with either Seville or Eurodisney, the main European crowd-pullers. The result has been a worthy, if slightly dull, exhibition concentrating on the wider themes of 'Christopher Columbus, ships and the sea' which is somewhat short on fun but long enough on architectural heritage and urban renovation. The project, over four years in the making, was designed by Mr Renzo Piano, the Genovese architect best known for his part in designing Paris's Pompidou Centre.

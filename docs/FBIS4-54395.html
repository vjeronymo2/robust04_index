			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- Mr. Ian Kenyon, executive  secretary of the preparatory commission to set up an  Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),  told a news conference at the Foreign Ministry here today that  Bulgaria has the political will to ratify within the coming  weeks the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,  Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their  Destruction. He was referring to the assurances he received  this morning at a meeting with ranking members of the National  Assembly Committee on National Security.    Mr. Kenyon said that at a meeting with military leaders of  the General Staff he had discussed the question of Bulgaria's  protection against a possible use of chemical weapons and the  measures which the Bulgarian Army will take in the event of a  threat of use of such weapons of mass destruction in a possible  military conflict.    Asked by BTA whether the commission has information that any  of the warring parties in the Yugoconflict has used chemical  weapons, Mr. Kenyon said that he only had an information  bulletin, according to which primitive warfare chemical agents  like chlorine had been used in the former Yugoslavia but did not  have evidence of the use of nerve gases.    These are just a couple of bulletins and not evidence, he  emphasized. Of course, when the convention enters into force,  inspectors will be sent there to verify the truth.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / France trims interest rates The newly-independent Bank of France cut its interest rates for the first time yesterday, shaving 10 basis points from its intervention rate to 6.1 per cent. It said the cut was in line with a policy of maintaining the stability of the franc over the medium term. The cautious cut reflected the bank's efforts to entrench its credibility in fighting inflation. Shares slid as dealers decided the interest rate cut was only a symbolic move after last week's rate cut by the German Bundesbank. The CAC-40 index index of the most widely traded shares lost nearly 2 per cent to 2,208, but ended above the day's lows. Italy's industrial producer prices rose 3.7 per cent in the year to December, and wholesale prices were up an annualised 3.9 per cent. The trade surplus rose to L2,420bn in December, and to L10,980bn for the whole year. Switzerland's current account surplus last year rose to SFr27.6bn from SFr21.15bn. It rose in the last quarter to SFr6.7bn from SFr5.25bn in the third. Industrial output in the Czech Republic fell a preliminary 5.3 per cent last year and construction output fell 7.5 per cent. Retail sales rose 1 per cent. A surge in domestic demand boosted orders for manufacturing industry in eastern Germany by 7.3 per cent in December compared with November. Orders rose an annualised 6.7 per cent in December.</p>

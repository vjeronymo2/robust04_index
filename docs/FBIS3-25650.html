Shots were fired and stones thrown when Deputy Minister  Chris  Fismer arrived at the rally to explain President F W de Klerk's  failure to arrive as scheduled.    According to security officers accompanying the president,  shots were fired in a crowd of opposing African National  Congress [ANC] and National Party supporters. There were strong  ANC and NP support groups present at the rally.    Mr de Klerk was earlier advised not to attend the rally as  all access roads were being blocked by ANC stonethrowers.  Later, Mr Fismer, chief organiser of the presidential election  tour, confirmed the shootings and stonings and said it was clear  since the party put up posters for the two rallies, that firm  decisions had been taken to prevent the NP from holding their  meetings.    It was a serious problem facing this election and the NP was  going to take up the matter at every possible level. Giving his  own account of events, he said he had gone to Roodepan after Mr  de Klerk's meeting in the Kimberley City Hall to establish  precisely what the situation was.    On the way there, he had seen large numbers of black people,  moving from Galeshiwe township to Roodepan, jumping on every  conceivable means of transport.    He said that on arrival at the grounds, everything seemed to  be in order with the NP band playing and NP supporters clearly  in the majority. He said, however, that police reported a large  number of ANC supporters had gathered between the houses to rush  the state president on his arrival.    That made him decide to "test the temperature" of the  meeting. A squad of ANC supporters then rushed the stage and  stones started flying. Soon shots were fired. He believed the  stones came from all directions and security men ushered him and  other NP officials away.    Later police reported that an unidentified woman had been  killed and several others were injured. No further details were  available.    It was also confirmed in Kimberley by Mr de Klerk that he  had  been "struck by a projectile" at Postdene on Wednesday  afternoon. Although police believe it was a crumpled paper flag,  a television news cameraman said he had footage to show that Mr  de Klerk had been struck on the neck by a stone.</p>

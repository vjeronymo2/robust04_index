			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> Clear Cable Signals: Scientific-Atlanta and General Instrument Systems have  independently developed systems to enable cable-TV operators to turn an  unscrambled TV signal on or off from a central office, eliminating the need for  many house calls. Many conventional systems may also be controlled central  offices but rely on decoding devices in homes.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Scientific-Atlanta called the new technology "more user  friendly." Atlanta Constitution  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Prisons: Privately operated prisons are on the rise in Florida.  Corrections Corp. of America and Wackenhut Corrections Corp. recently became  the first private operators to bid on a maximum security state prison. The  state corrections department has stated that the successful bidder must operate  the prison at 10% below the state's cost. The state Legislature has also  authorized a smaller prison to be operated by a private company. CCA operates  18 prisons in other states. A company executive believes that the percentage of  prison beds under private management will increase to 10% to 15% by the end of  the decade from less than 1% today. Tampa Tribune  </P> <P> </P> <P> High-Yield Fiber: Louisiana farmers are encouraged by the commercial success of  a Kenaf, a hybrid relative of okra and cotton. The plant grows to 10 feet in  about 150 days and has been used in this country mainly as a newsprint  material. It makes stronger, whiter paper than wood pulp without as much  bleaching. With new harvesting methods, Kenaf soon will be in use for fiber  mats for grass, carpets, auto door panels, burlap and rope. In another form,  Kenaf can be made into animal bedding chips that are more absorbent and cheaper  than wood. Growers are researching the use of Kenaf as a fiber source in food  and as an absorbent filler for diapers. Sunday Advocate  </P></p>

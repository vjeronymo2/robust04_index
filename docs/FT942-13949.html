			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: On song Sir, I am pleased to say that if Mr Peter Sachs (Letters, April 20) looks once again at your report on the new initiatives from English National Opera he will see that between the end of last season and this April the 56 per cent attendance figure rose to 62 per cent. This is an early sign that our policy of replenishing the core repertory of the company is beginning to come across to our audiences. In particular, the packed houses for La Boheme, Lohengrin, Rosenkavalier and The Pearl Fishers in the current season seem to indicate that, for most of our new productions, we are gaining the support we need to ensure the future of the company. Dennis Marks, general director, English National Opera, London Coliseum, St Martin's Lane, London WC2N 4ES</p>

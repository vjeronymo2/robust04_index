			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Secrecy review by accountants THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is considering opening its disciplinary proceedings to the public after recent criticism over secrecy. A paper to be submitted to the institute's council lists options for opening some parts of its hearings to observers. Concern has arisen that wider public access might jeopardise free and frank provision of evidence. Other worries include issues of defamation, contempt and breach of confidentiality over the details of the material being discussed. Officials emphasise that very few other professional bodies make their disciplinary hearings public, and do not face the complex questions posed by proceedings against accountants, in which sensitive information about their work for clients might be disclosed. Even so, institute members have come under pressure for more openness on disciplinary matters from individuals including Mr Douglas Llambias, a member of the council and of its disciplinary committee. Mr Llambias was recently refused access to the committee considering the case against two partners from Coopers &amp; Lybrand in connection with an alleged breach of ethical codes in their appointment as administrators to Polly Peck International. The recommendations follow a series of other reforms to disciplinary proceedings in recent months, including much stiffer fines, simplified administration, the appointment of an independent ombudsman and greater willingness to announce that an investigation is taking place.</p>

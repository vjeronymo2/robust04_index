Columbia states that the funds consist of (i) certain refund amounts received by Columbia from its upstream pipeline suppliers; and (ii) certain surcharges collected by Columbia on behalf of GRI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously ordered by the Bankruptcy Court and the Commission, Columbia states that it has deposited in the RIA (i) approximately $131.2 million in upstream pipeline supplier order No. 528 refunds received after Columbia's filing for bankruptcy on July 31, 1991 (post-petition); (ii) approximately $11.7 million in other upstream pipeline supplier refunds also received post-petition; and (iii) approximately $1 million in post-petition GRI collections. Columbia states that these funds were escrowed pending the outcome of litigation as to whether the funds are property of Columbia's bankruptcy estate or are held in trust by Columbia for its customers and GRI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia requests that the Commission issue an order declaring that Columbia's interest obligation with regard to the funds deposited and held in the RIA is to pay to its customers and GRI the interest actually earned on such funds, and not the interest rate prescribed by the Commission's regulation at 18 CFR 154.102(c)(2) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia states that the filing has been served on Columbia's current customers, affected state commissions and public interest agencies, and the Gas Research Institute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before March 17, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

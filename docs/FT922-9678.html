			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Deutsche Bank to expand in US DEUTSCHE BANK is planning to restructure and expand its North American operations to strength-en its presence in US capital markets and private banking. Since 1990, Deutsche Bank has more than trebled its US assets to Dollars 14bn (Pounds 7.9bn). It now plans to increase these assets by 20 per cent to 30 per cent over the next one to two years. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, board member responsible for the region, said the bank's aim was to 'become a leading player in key wholesale sectors' in the US. He stressed that the bank hopes to expand by internal growth rather than acquisition. To accomplish this, the bank is creating a holding company structure to bring together US, Canadian and Mexican activities. Mr Schmitz said that over the next two years Deutsche Bank planned to commit additional capital to the New York-based business in order to enter new areas. The specific areas to be developed were domestic corporate finance, capital markets and trading, swap transactions, foreign exchange and derivative products. The bank will also focus on asset management for institutions and private clients. Deutsche Bank employs 1,200 people in North America and this is expected to rise over the medium term. Last year Deutsche Bank's US securities subsidiary was allowed by the New York Federal Reserve to act as a primary dealer. Mr Schmitz said Deutsche Bank was holding talks with the Federal Reserve over the relationship it has with C. J. Lawrence, its US equity research and brokerage subsidiary, which was acquired along with Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank. The bank's overall aim is to catch US corporate clients who place an emphasis on dealing with strongly capitalised banks. Mr Schmitz said Deutsche Bank had relations with 69 of America's 100 largest industrial companies and wanted to build its US corporate finance business well beyond just servicing US offshoots of German companies. Mr Schmitz said the bank had been 'largely untouched' by problem lending in the US commercial property sector. However, the bank is understood to have almost Dollars 50m of loans to Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group undergoing debt restructuring. Hybrid issue, Page 26</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: KDD held back by stock losses KDD, Japan's international telecommunications company, said a rise in revenues from its international telephone service helped boost sales in the year to March, but profits were affected by losses on its securities holdings. Non-consolidated sales for the year grew 1.6 per cent to Y244.5bn (Dollars 1.89bn), while non-operating profits increased by 14.2 per cent to Y19.4bn. However, pre-tax profits rose by just 0.2 per cent to Y26bn. Lower corporate taxes lifted after-tax profits by 4.6 per cent to Y14.1bn. KDD, which posted sharp declines in sales and profits in the previous year due to competition in the international telecommunication business and lower rates, said cost controls helped operating profits. The company recorded Y2.7bn in losses on securities holdings due to the decline in the Tokyo market. Interest received fell 32.5 per cent to Y2.8bn, while interest on securities declined 53.3 per cent to Y865m. Dividends received fell 37.8 per cent to Y293m. Legislative changes to allow foreign ownership of KDD shares - now prohibited - are under way, and KDD said foreign investors would be able to buy its shares during this fiscal year. For the current year to March 1993, KDD expects a 3.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y27bn on a 5.9 per cent increase in sales to Y259bn.</p>

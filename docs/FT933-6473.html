			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television At midnight every British terrestrial television channel will be showing an old Hollywood movie. Oldest of the four is The Boogie Man Will Get You (C4) of which the late Leslie Halliwell said, in his Film Guide, 'Desper ately unfunny spoof notable only for the fact that it was attempted with these players at that time'. The main players are Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre, the time 1944. Karloff tries to build supermen out of travelling salesmen. The Fountainhead, (BBC2) made by King Vidor in 1949, stars Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal. The Time Out Film Guide says 'Most bizarre movie in both Vidor's and Cooper's filmographies, this adaptation of Ayn Rand's first novel mutes Ms Rand's neo-Nietzschean philosophy of 'objectivism' but lays on the expressionist symbolism with a free enterprise trowel.' Tarzan The Ape Man (11.05 BBC1) is the 1981 film in which Bo Derek plays Jane as a 'Miss Wet Tee Shirt' contestant. Best of the four is Chinatown made by Roman Polanski in 1974 as a pastiche of forties' film noir. Jack Nicholson plays the Chandler style detective in 1930s Los Angeles.</p>

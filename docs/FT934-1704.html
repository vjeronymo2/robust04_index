			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Technology: Battery that packs its own recharger - Worth Watching If you are wondering whether to stick to primary batteries or whether to invest in a recharger, the solution could be the 'Flip Top', a battery which contains its own recharging unit. The bright pink top of the nickel cadmium battery flips over to reveal a two-pin plug. This can be plugged into a standard US electricity socket where the battery is recharged. The battery incorporates a miniature charging circuit and a 1.25 volt cell in a standard size casing. The battery can be charged more than 500 times according to manufacturers Power Battery Holding Corporation, of Bellevue, Washington. At the moment Power Battery Holding Corporation makes a size D battery only and just for the US market, but other sizes are planned. Power Battery Holding Corporation: US, 206 641 7155.</p>

Representative Ronald Dellums, a California Democrat and the  chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, hoped to help  defuse the dispute over the alleged DPRK's nuclear weapon  programs, according to the NEW YORK TIMES.    The newspaper quoted U.S. Administration officials as saying  that the White House has approved the visit, which is a secretly  arranged trip.    He is expected to meet with the DPRK leader Kim Il-song and  his top advisers, the newspaper said.</p>

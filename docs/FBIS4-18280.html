			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Rally for the Republic Calls </F> For Giraud's Head"]    [Excerpt] [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur yesterday  decided purely and simply to withdraw the "youth job training  contract" [CIP] and to replace it with a scheme giving aid to  companies providing young people with their first job.  Moreover, he announced that an interministerial committee on  youth would be held on 26 April. The withdrawal of the CIP is  aimed at calming social unrest -- a demonstration will be held  this afternoon in Paris in response to a call made by all the  trade union organizations -- and also at placating the anger  being manifested by the majority.    While in principle you do not change a winning team, it is  nonetheless necessary, for reasons of appeasement, to change one  that is losing. What is true in sport is also true in politics.  On the eve of the Paris demonstration against the CIP, the  deputies of the majority, and in particular those of the RPR,  brandished pitchforks and pickaxes to pillory the ministers they  hold responsible for the street demonstrations and the  increasing ill-humor of the French people. As they see it, at  least one head must roll: that of Labor Minister Michel  Giraud, who stands accused of having inflamed the universities  and the suburbs with his "controversial" decrees instituting the  CIP.

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Clarke's plans for police shake-up face cabinet opposition RADICAL proposals by Mr Kenneth Clarke to reorganise the police look set to be scaled back after running into strong opposition from the home secretary's cabinet colleagues. Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, have joined Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, in opposing plans which would deprive local authorities of any real control of local forces in England and Wales. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, has also opposed the shifting of all police funding to Whitehall and depriving elected councils of their majorities on local police committees. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has indicated that he would not want to introduce similar arrangements north of the border. The proposed scheme, ending the present half-and-half arrangements for police funding and giving the Home Office an automatic majority of appointees on the police committees, is being characterised as the virtual nationalisation of police forces. Less controversially, Mr Clarke wants to reduce the number of police authorities from 43 to as few as 25. Mr John Major was due this week to chair a cabinet committee to examine the proposals but the meeting was delayed because of the crises in Iraq and Bosnia. Last night, however, Mr Clarke accused opponents of launching a pre-emptive strike designed to force him to water down the plan. He offered assurances that he was against the establishment of a national police force. Mr Clarke is supported by Mr John Patten, education secretary, and Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor. But most of his colleagues want a less ambitious blueprint to preserve a significant role for local authorities in overseeing and funding the police. They are concerned that the proposals have not taken into account the damaging impact on the overall role of elected councils. Their responsibilities have already been significantly reduced by the government's education reforms. Mr Clarke, who has strong backing from colleagues for his separate drive to reform the pay, conditions and internal management of police forces, is expected to respond by offering proposals which transfer fewer powers to Whitehall.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Europe out to cut sulphur emissions NEGOTIATIONS begin today on setting new targets for reducing sulphur emissions in Europe in a bid to tackle the continent's worst pollution blackspots. The week-long talks, under auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), will bring together over 30 countries from western and eastern Europe. They will be trying to advance negotiations on a new sulphur emissions protocol to the ECE's convention on long-range transboundary air pollution. The current protocol, signed in 1985, set a 30 per cent emissions reduction target between 1980 and 1993. Sulphur emissions, which contribute to acid rain, a major cause of forest death and building erosion, come mainly from fossil-fuelled power-stations. The emissions can drift over long distances; much of Scandinavia's sulphur deposits comes from power stations in eastern Europe. ECE officials say European nations have already agreed in principle on, at minimum, an overall emissions standstill from present levels, but are not planning to set another across-the-board reduction target. Instead, the talks are focused on reducing pollution above 'critical load' - the threshold of ecological tolerance. Surveys suggest that more than a third of Europe's ecosystems are suffering sulphur deposition above the 'critical load,' notably in the 'black triangle' linking the Czech Republic, Poland and eastern Germany and in Scandinavia. Negotiators will also be considering technology required to cut pollution to 'critical load' levels and how to share the substantial cost burden. The countries most responsible for high sulphur emissions, mostly in eastern Europe, are those least able to pay. ECE officials say that, although violating the 'polluter pays' principle, it makes sense for rich countries importing pollution from poor ones to pay part of the cost of reducing it. The current sulphur protocol has 20 members. Neither Britain nor the US, both heavy polluters, has signed.</p>

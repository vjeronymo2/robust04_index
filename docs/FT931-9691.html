			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US slaps 70% tariff on 'dumped' UK steel rails THE US Commerce Department yesterday levied duties of almost 70 per cent on steel rail found to have been 'dumped' by British Steel and other UK companies into the US market. However, before the duties are made permanent, the International Trade Commission must determine that dumping - selling at less than either the cost of production or the product's cost in a third market - has injured US companies. The injury test is more difficult to prove than dumping. The steel rail complaint was filed by a division of Bethlehem Steel and CF&amp;I Steel. US imports of steel rail from the UK totalled Dollars 16.2m (Pounds 10.7m) in 1991.</p>

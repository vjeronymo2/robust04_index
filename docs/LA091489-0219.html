			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PALME SLAYER ADMITS 600 ROBBERIES  </P> <P> Christer Pettersson, sentenced to life in jail for the 1986 murder of Swedish  Prime Minister Olof Palme, surprised his appeals court hearing today by  confessing to 600 robberies.  </P> <P> "I robbed 600 people between 1970 and 1977, two each week. . . . Most of them  were amphetamine dealers," he told the Stockholm appeals court.  </P> <P> Pettersson, 42, a self-acknowledged alcoholic and amphetamine addict, had  already been convicted of 63 crimes, including a 1970 murder, when a Stockholm  district court by a split decision on July 27 found him guilty of assassinating  Palme.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Gennadiy Kulbitskiy and </F> Gennadiy Temnenkov]    [Text] Mainz, Germany, June 7 TASS -- "My official German  visit may be held this year," Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin told a news conference here today.    He said they have such plans, but everything depends on  certain circumstances. The prime minister visited Germany a  year ago, and all programs the sides agreed on are being  fulfilled.    A priority of the Russian Government is to create a legal  basis for foreign investments, said Chernomyrdin. Russia is  closely cooperating with Germany in this sphere. Germany ranks  first in Russian-European trade and economic turnover.    At the same time, there were some changes and drops in  bilateral relations. In the opinion of the premier, these  things are temporary, as Russia and Germany have old traditions  and many German firms have long been known on the Russian market.    Russia has changed, and there is plenty of possibilities to  develop economic cooperation. The prime minister called on  German businessmen for more active work on the Russian market.  He said Russia has eliminated many obstacles on the way of  economic cooperation.    Asked about the Russian attitude to NATO's Partnership for  Peace initiative, Chernomyrdin referred to a recent visit of  Russian Defence minister Pavel Grachev to the NATO Headquarters  in Brussels.    "We have accepted the NATO proposal to participate in the  program, and we are ready to cooperate. We are sure we have  done right. I am convinced European problems cannot be solved  without Russia, and we will participate in the program  regardless any opinions about this. We should establish  absolutely normal, partner relations between Russia and NATO,"  he said.    Asked to comment on Russian reports claiming the prime  minister is writing memoirs and planning to publish them in  Germany, Chernomyrdin said he writes no memoirs as he has much  other work to do.    In conclusion the prime minister thanked German Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl for assistance to his Mainz visit.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Bishops say Maastricht is for life: The Catholic church's view of Ireland's referendum IRELAND'S Catholic church this week fired the first barrage from its moral artillery in the country's referendum on the European's Community's Maastricht treaty to be held next Thursday: it brushed aside the economic and political issues of the proposed accord on closer economic and political union and homed straight in on abortion. A million copies of a four-page statement by the Catholic Bishop's Conference, entitled The Maastricht Referendum and Some of its Implications, said: 'The substantive and fundamental issue is the right to life of the unborn child . . . . 'We are firmly of the view that the opportunity must be given to the Irish people to restore the constitutional guarantee of the right to life of the child in the womb. It is our view that the only effective way of doing this is by a new pro-life amendment (to the Irish Constitution). If the Maastricht Treaty is approved however, there must be a degree of uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of such an amendment,' say the bishops. Their reasoning is that despite the 1983 right-to-life constitutional amendment, which was designed to make watertight Ireland's ban on abortion the recent supreme court ruling concerning a 14-year-old rape victim, which permitted her to travel to the UK for an abortion, also established that abortion was legally permissible in Ireland in certain circumstances. Ten years of crusading by the Church and the anti-abortion lobby were thus undone by that ruling and has thrust abortion to the forefront of the Maastricht debate. The bishops' statement says rejection of the treaty would also leave the abortion issue unresolved and that voters are therefore faced with a dilemma. They themselves must decide which result will give greater guarantees of protection for the unborn. The Yes camp immediately interpreted this as meaning that the abortion issue was thereby effectively sidelined in the debate. The anti-abortion lobby says the bishops' arguments justify a No vote. In effect, the church hierarchy has opted not to position itself publicly on the treaty but has provided the ammunition for the moral shock troops of organisations such as the Pro-Life Campaign, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child and the Youth Defence Organisation to campaign for a 'No' vote. All three are identified in the public's eye with the Catholic Church. Individual priests around the country have also been advising their congregations to vote against the treaty. According to a church spokesman: 'Priests are citizens as everyone else and as such are entitled to their opinions, but in the main will be expected to remain within the limits of the Bishops' statement.' Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, yesterday criticised his British counterpart, Mr Norman Lamont, over the disagreement this week between EC finance ministers on the Delors II budget package, writes Tim Coone. He said: 'I understand the arguments of those countries that want to see greater transparency in the use of EC funds, and Germany's problems over the reunification process. But I have less sympathy and understanding for Britain's position in opposing the increases in the EC budget .. I don't think Mr Lamont believes in the idea .. that a wealthier community and an expansion of trade will be more readily achieved by a redistribution of resources between member states'. The Irish government's campaign for a Yes vote in the referendum has been set back by the EC ministers' rejection of the Delors package, which provides for increased funds for Ireland.</p>

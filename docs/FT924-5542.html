			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Recovery 'unlikely until 1994' RECOVERY from the recession is unlikely until 1994, an assessment of economic prospects published today by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants suggests, Peter Marsh writes. House prices will continue to fall next year while the boost to exports arising from the pound's devaluation will come through only slowly, PA says in a report produced with Cambridge University's Department of Land Economy. The large volume of debts built up by consumers and companies since the late 1980s will constrain any recovery while unemployment will continue to rise next year, sapping overall confidence. There will be little extra boost to demand from public spending, because the poor state of government finances will mean the Treasury wants to hold back state spending as much as possible.

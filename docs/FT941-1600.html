			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered plans expansion in Thailand Standard Chartered, the London-based banking group, intends to expand its already profitable operations in Thailand and the rest of Asia, Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman, said. Mr Gillam said Standard Chartered had received preliminary approval from the Thai central bank for a debt underwriting licence and would attempt to obtain an equity underwriting licence. It was also considering opening 'up country' offshore banking offices to serve clients outside Bangkok under Thailand's Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF). Pre-tax profit from Standard Chartered Bank's single branch in Bangkok rose 30 per cent last year to Bt606m, on revenue of Bt1.87bn. Profits were boosted by strong treasury and custodial business. 'Our areas of expansion also include making a strong move into the private client business and derivative products business,' said Mr Gillam, who is in Thailand to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the bank's opening in the country. Standard Chartered Bank recently increased its registered capital in Thailand by a quarter to Bt1bn and intends to increase it further. Mr Gillam expressed concern that Thailand's competitiveness was being eroded by the shortcomings of its education system and by delays in implementing big transport infrastructure projects. But he praised the government's policy of financial liberalisation. Mr Gillam reiterated that Standard Chartered wanted to increased its presence in China, where it already has the largest branch network of any foreign bank. He confirmed that the company planned to apply for secondary listings of its shares on the Hong Kong and Singapore stock exchanges.</p>

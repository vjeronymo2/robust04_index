			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Entrepreneurial Speech and Economic Reality"] </F>   [Text] On the Day of the Entrepreneur, Feprinco [Federation  for Production, Industry, and Trade] read a message giving broad  support to Juan Carlos Wasmosy's economic policies, questioning  Congress' performance, and explaining its differences with  workers.    Entrepreneurs are decisive actors in our country's growth  and  in achieving social equality. They must understand that looking  after the needs of the poorest groups of society seeking a  juster distribution of wealth is intimately linked to authentic  development and the ideal of democracy.    The Feprinco chairman's 17 June message broadly agrees with  the official speech, particularly in saying that some government  initiatives are steps in the right direction; in stressing that  Congress is laying obstacles to economic reform and blocking the  approval of bills submitted by the executive branch,  particularly on privatization; and in emphasizing that the labor  unions are not supporting the plan of economic stability with  their demands for inappropriate salary adjustments and calls for  strikes.    This way of seeing reality refers directly to the "machine  for prevention," which is frequently cited by President Wasmosy  when people point out his scant economic achievements and his  even less successful policy in solving social problems.    The entrepreneurial leadership is obviously concerned by the  invasion and plundering of rural properties, which in Feprinco's  opinion is part of a plan to destabilize the government. But  entrepreneurs do not deny that the real problem is a very  unequal land distribution, and that rural development or any  significant increase in agricultural productivity will not be  possible as long as the current land distribution scheme  persists.    Feprinco is seriously concerned about the fact that  demographic pressure on employment "is exploited by some labor  leaders opposed to changes leading to improved production and  labor conditions." We, however, must also consider that real  salary levels cannot be sustained or contribute to encouraging  productive or commercial activities without regulations because  of labor market structural conditions and the large and growing  labor supply.    Besides, entrepreneurs continue to link salary increases  with  inflation. They call attention to "public company labor leaders'  insistence in demanding salary increases over and beyond the  budgetary possibilities."    Feprinco, however, is satisfied because "steps are being  taken to dismantle the inherited state interventionist role,"  because the government is controlling inflation, and because the  executive branch has produced very important bills, which are  almost indispensable, to introduce needed changes in the state  apparatus in order to liberate the economy.    The entrepreneurs' speech superficially mentions the need to  diversify agricultural production and to create an adequate  legal framework for industrial investments, but it does not  mention the wish for a deep productive transformation with  substantial social equality.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages big recovery after early slump Wall Street STAGING A remarkable turnaround, the Dow Jones Industrial Averge ended only modestly lower yesterday after bargain buying and interest rate cut hopes had helped stock markets recover from an early 100-point loss, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.61 at 3,179.00, compared to its low of the day of around 3,097.40 The other main indices all moved in similar fashion. The more broadly based Standard&amp; Poor's 500 ended down 2.89 at 407.58, the Amex composite down 4.62 at 366.62 and the Nasdaq composite 6.42 lower at 565.21. Turnover was the heaviest of the year at 287m shares. Losses on European markets where the lack of a cut in German interest rates sent share prices sprawling, and last Friday's 53-point drop in the Dow set the tone for a bad start. The Dow fell 26 points in the first half hour, and with program selling filling a market vacuum that had been created by the absence of buyers, the index fell even further in the next 90 minutes to a new intraday 1992 low of 3,097.40. Traders said there were many reasons for the losses including: deepening concern about the economic outlook; disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not cut interest rates on Friday after a bad September employment report; and the growing belief that Governor Bill Clinton will win the presidency in November. and that a Democratic victory has yet to be fully priced into the market. and fear that stock prices may prove overvalued if third and fourth quarter corporate earnings fail to match up to expectations. Prices recovered strongly , however, later in the day as program selling petered out, some investors went bargain buying and investors focused on speculation that the Fed would cut interest rates after today's meeting of the policy-making open market committee. Leading stocks moved down and then back up with the market. Philip Morris closed down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 82 3/4 , Merck down Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 42 7/8 ,and General Electric down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 75 3/8 - all three at least Dollars 1 above their session lows. Marriott bucked the trend all day, rising Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 19 1/4 after the hotels group announced plans to split its operations. Canada TORONTO prices closed only slightly lower, after staging a remarkable recovery from a sharp decline early in the session. The TSE 300 composite index closed down 3.54 points, or 0.11%, to 3,227.53 with declining issues topping advances 431 to 148. Volume was heavy, as 36.9m shares valued at CDollars 472.1m changed hands compared with Friday's 33.3m valued at CDollars 380.5m.</p>

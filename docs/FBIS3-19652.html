			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Leader Rudolf Scharping by Dieter Buhl </F> and Werner A. Perger; place and date not given: "I Can Do It  Better"]    [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Minister-president, Lower Saxony was a  good start for the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] in  this year of many elections. Are Gerhard Schroeder and his  red-green coalition the only midwives of this victory or did you  and a somewhat calmer SPD also play a part in it?    [Scharping] First of all, it was a success for the SPD in  Lower Saxony and for Gerhard Schroeder in particular. The fact  that the SPD has become more stable at the federal level  certainly did not do any harm.    [DIE ZEIT] Gains were made by the Greens above all. Does  that mean that the party is now a possible Bonn coalition  partner for the SPD?    [Scharping] To my mind, the central political signal at the  federal level sent by the Lower Saxony Landtag elections is that  the SPD has remained stable and it has increased its lead over  the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] from 2 percent to almost 8  percent.    [DIE ZEIT] An increase in your share of the vote of 0.1  percent, as the case in Lower Saxony, would not be of much  benefit to you in the Bundestag elections.    [Scharping] The key point is the significantly greater lead  over the CDU. That means that we can also increase our lead  over the CDU at the federal level. The general lesson to be  drawn from the election result is that annoyance with the  parties is declining.    [DIE ZEIT] Following Hamburg and Lower Saxony, is the FDP  [Free Democratic Party] still of interest to you as a coalition  partner?    [Scharping] The FDP is losing its function as a party that  can secure a majority and thus, it can be assumed that it has  become a matter of greater urgency than ever before for the  party to explain what liberalism actually means to it today.  Nevertheless, the SPD conducts debates about the main tasks in  German politics and not about coalitions. The offers that the  SPD receives will certainly exceed demand.    [DIE ZEIT] What is striking about the SPD today is its  exceptional openness. How did you manage that, Mr. Scharping?    [Scharping] Political goals and ideas are being debated much  more intensely in the party. I personally have made an effort  to ensure that we talk to each other rather than past each  other. In addition, the "party ballot" sent positive shock  waves through the SPD. Many who had previously taken part in  key public debates realized that the same way of acting was not  very responsible within the SPD and from the viewpoint of its  political goals, and, thank heavens, they acted accordingly.  When Social Democrats switch on their television sets in the  evenings, they no longer have to be ashamed of news reports  about what is going on in the SPD. That has a significant  impact on the electorate.    Finally, the prospect of winning the 1994 Bundestag makes it  easier to focus political attention on the most important  programmatic points, and that is undoubtedly a further factor.    [DIE ZEIT] Perhaps this openness will cease when the debate  about a program for the government begins. That will call for  many sacrifices, including sacrifices among your own voters.    [Scharping] I think that political models geared solely  toward redistribution and telling the other side what it must  put up with are finished. We will place the justice angle very  much at the forefront as well as the question of who has to make  what contribution to the development of Germany, to its economic  recovery, and to safeguarding Germany's welfare state and  ecological principles.    [DIE ZEIT] So, in concrete terms, who is to be given what,  and what is to be taken away from whom?    [Scharping] We are discussing the issue of how labor costs  must be reduced and investment in new products and new jobs must  be stepped up. That means that within the framework of the  current taxes and dues burden, at the level that it will attain  in 1995, which I believe should not be increased, there will  have to be realignments. There has to be a reduction in the tax  burden on middle and low incomes, if only because of the tax  exemption -- provided for by the constitution -- of minimum  incomes. In addition, for the development of Germany as a  whole, burdens have to be distributed more fairly, which  automatically makes a moderate increase in the taxation of  particularly high incomes and wealth -- as in the United States  -- necessary. The Federal Government wants to reintroduce the  solidarity levy for this purpose. I think that a supplementary  form of taxation would make more sense. If one wants to create  more favorable conditions for investment, then one must  simultaneously make raw materials and energy more expensive,  which is also a key point for the ecological modernization of  the economy. Environmental, information, and communications  technologies, as well as rapid transportation systems -- for  example cooperation with the French on the ICE and the TGV rail  projects -- have a role to play.    [DIE ZEIT] So, you would not provide backing for the  Transrapid rail project?    [Scharping] We will discuss that after Easter, without any  reservations. The technology essentially merits such backing,  but I do not think that the proposed route makes much sense.    [DIE ZEIT] No increases in taxes and contributions, no  increase in public debt: Those are the so-called "main planks"  of your government program. Will you manage to keep to that?  There is criticism in your party. Ultimately, one knows that  if the state makes cuts, they tend to affect the poorest the  most.    [Scharping] First, as for taxation and contribution levels:  In 1995, those will almost reach 50 percent and that will be a  historically high level in Germany. It is a consequence of the  Bonn coalition's orgy of tax hikes and a lack of discipline with  regard to expenditure. If tax and other deductions account for  between 48 and 49 percent of an average worker's wage that also  affects the social acceptance of state activity, which is vital  for civilized coexistence. It also affects acceptance of the  social welfare system.    If the signals that employees receive from politics are, for  example, that they must pay higher pension benefit contributions  -- they will rise by 1.7 percent to 19.2 percent in 1994 -- but  their pensions will not be certain, which is what Herr  Biedenkopf said recently....    [DIE ZEIT] And so did Mr. Lafontaine.    [Scharping] .... that affects the acceptance of common  security in a welfare state. Of course, many employees ask  themselves why the difference between their gross and net  incomes is so high.    Here is a second example: The development of eastern Germany  is to a large extent being financed from social insurance  contributions. Why should employees who pay contributions and  plants with high wage costs alone provide finance for the  development of eastern Germany through pension funds and  unemployment benefit funds? Would it not be more honest if it  were to be done with the help of taxes so that everyone,  including civil servants and the self-employed, made the same  contribution?    [DIE ZEIT] It might be more honest, but probably more  difficult to implement?    [Scharping] It is linked to the example that should be set  by those who consider themselves to belong to elites and possess  appropriate economic and financial resources. It is a question  of justice and economic reason. Pushing up labor costs --  ancillary and supplementary costs -- to such high levels runs  counter to economic reason. Plants with large work forces and  payrolls bear a disproportionate burden as a result. It affects  their competitiveness.    [DIE ZEIT] In your government program, do you define what a  higher income is?    [Scharping] I do not consider that to be necessary.    [DIE ZEIT] But it is something that many people would like  to know?    [Scharping] That may be so. However, the problem that we  face is as follows: The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled  that as of 1996, the legislature is obliged to ensure that the  minimum level of income is exempt from tax. This must be  accomplished with the help of a reform of the wage and income  taxation scales and improved benefits for families with  children. Once those two things have been accomplished, the  rest is only a question of what the actual wage and income  taxation scales will be.    [DIE ZEIT] And what does your government program say on that  point?    [Scharping] As of 1 January 1995, the coalition wants to  reintroduce a solidarity levy of 7.5 percent without the reform  that I have described. Instead of that, what we want is a  supplementary contribution of 10 percent, a tax exempt minimum  income, and better conditions for families. Whoever is paying  2,000 German marks [DM) in tax a month, can expect to pay  DM2,200 over a certain period of time.    [DIE ZEIT] Thus, medium-sized business will be asked to pay  up, because there are not that many rich people who could be  fleeced of even more.    [Scharping] Reducing the taxation burden on investment and  reducing the taxation burden on companies in so far as they  invest and create new jobs is a priority. As for medium-sized  business: In the case of the Law on Safeguarding Germany's  Future as Center for Business, the SPD ensured that depreciation  terms would not get worse. The SPD also participated in making  the taxation of earnings from commercial activity lower. I  consider that to be the right way.    I think that one has to always make very precise  distinctions. What promotes the creation of jobs? What  strengthens a company's own capital base? What facilitates  investment? All this is in the corporate taxation field, and  one has to distinguish that clearly from private income. I am  of the opinion that following the Federal Constitutional Court  ruling on exempting the minimum income from taxation and in view  of the financial needs linked to the development of Germany, we  cannot mislead people into believing that there are no limits to  how much their incomes can grow and that such growth has no tax  implications. That would be untrue. In the case of the  taxation of private entrepreneurial earnings, I share the views  of many entrepreneurs, including the views of Herr Necker or  Herr Murmann: The higher taxation of profits that are withdrawn  would be reasonable.    [DIE ZEIT] You do not want to say openly how much this is  going to cost whom?    [Scharping] Why not?    [DIE ZEIT] You have not defined who the "better earners"  that the SPD talks about so much are.    [Scharping] The term means that one could set a limit above  which everyone has to make some contribution to the development  of Germany, the preservation of social justice, and economic  progress. What I am saying is that everyone has a contribution  to make in accordance with his means. There is a social  imbalance in the way burdens are currently distributed.    [DIE ZEIT] You once said that Germany needs more creativity,  boldness, a pioneering spirit. What does that mean?    [Scharping] First, what that means is that we need elites  and their example. Helmut Schmidt is fond of citing the Hamburg  constitution: Everyone has a moral obligation to contribute to  the common good.    [DIE ZEIT] The SPD has not used the world "elite" in a  long time.    [Scharping] What can one object to about the term elite if  it means a high level of ability and embraces equal access to  such elites, which is also why we talk about equality of  opportunity.    I also think that it is an extreme form of condensing things  to just talk of Germany as a center for business. It leaves  people's living conditions out of the picture. That is why in  debate I always use word that has come from the Protestant  Church and talk about Germany as a "center for living." That is  because the situation of the 4 million unemployed, the many  millions who have to live on social welfare, and the many who do  not have a proper home, should not be left out of the picture.    [DIE ZEIT] Technology has an important role in the issue of  Germany as a center. However, is it not given enough too  little attention in political discussion?    [Scharping] We are too cautious and slow with new products,  with new technical opportunities, the translation of technical  progress and new findings in production. In Europe, all these  things can be better dealt with jointly than if they were  tackled by individual countries. What we need in Germany is a  training, technology, and research offensive.    [DIE ZEIT] Then the SPD will have to undergo some changes.    [Scharping] Yes, on the reformist left-wing side, there is  almost a boundless belief in technical progress. Ernst Bloch  said that one could solve all the worlds poverty problems with  one pile of atoms. Since then, the pendulum has very much swung  in the opposite direction. I am in favor of staging a public  debate with broad participation that would weigh up interests  and ideas, then make decisions, and use the opportunities that  are available.    [DIE ZEIT] Will you set deadlines for abandoning nuclear  energy as was the case in a previous SPD program?    [Scharping] It is our firm goal to abandon nuclear energy.  However, every deadline is subject to the problem that today one  cannot tell when and in what form a consensus will be reached on  the questions. I think that it makes sense to have a consensus  on energy policy in Germany, because of the need to have a  secure energy supply, reliable framework conditions, and the  necessary security for the domestic coal industry. I do not  know whether achieving such a consensus is possible, but we will  carry on seeking it. That means that it does make sense to  establish remaining periods of use for nuclear power plants on  case by case basis if necessary. The general direction is: We  want to get out of nuclear energy as quickly as possible, with  an emphasis on this aspect as quickly as possible.    [DIE ZEIT] At the Munich security conference, you recently  stressed that there were no fundamental differences between you  and the government on foreign policy. Would the CDU [Christian  Democratic Union] not be able to say that the SPD is pursuing  "politics without a beard?"    [Scharping] A policy based on the intellect and the heart is  any event better than one without a beard. I found that CDU  poster amusing. As far as foreign policy is concerned, there is  no disagreement over fundamental issues: European integration,  a secure place in the community of Western democracies,  including NATO, and a reliable relationship with the states to  our east that is as friendly as possible.    [DIE ZEIT] Do you support the timetable for economic and  monetary union?    [Scharping] The criteria are more important than the  timeframe, which does not mean that one should postpone  everything until some never-never day. However, a stable  currency is an indispensable pillar of an economic policy for  economic progress, growth that takes account of ecological  factors, and for instilling confidence in people.    [DIE ZEIT] It has almost been forgotten that there was a  difficult discussion in the SPD on the role of the Bundeswehr.  What does that program have to say about that?    [Scharping] Today, there is virtually no disagreement within  the SPD about the issue. It is, to a much greater extent, the  only point on which we disagree with the government on a key  foreign policy issue. I am very much in favor of Germany being  active in the United Nations. The United Nations should be  strengthened. We want to participate in the measures that the  UN has implemented over the past few years and is expected to  implement over the next few years if it is able to. It would  exclude -- this is the precise boundary --active Bundeswehr  participation in the waging of war.    [DIE ZEIT] You know the words from the song about "the  international winning human rights." What is your position on  the far from infrequent cases where German export interests and  the requirements of a consistent human rights policy clash, as  in the case of China and Iran?    [Scharping] It is necessary for negotiations about world  trade and appropriate agreements -- GATT for example -- to  devote much more attention to human rights, to protection  against social dumping and environmental dumping. What should  no longer occur is that in the same year, the United Nations can  issue a charter on the rights of children while a world trade  agreement makes no mentions whatsoever of the brutal  exploitation of children. Global environmental and developments  policies are an area in which I see a great need and great  chances for intensive cooperation with the United States.    [DIE ZEIT] But what happens in a specific case. During his  visit to China, Secretary of State Warren Christopher gave  prominence to human rights. Others who are competing with  America in that market do not do that. That poses dilemmas for  democratic governments. How would you resolve such a dilemma?    [Scharping] One will never find perfect solutions.    [DIE ZEIT] Does the SPD support the government's policy on  China?    [Scharping] To my mind, the consistent pursuit of human  rights is too weak an element in relations with China.    [DIE ZEIT] What do you think would jeopardize victory in the  Bundestag elections the most? The overthrow of Yeltsin in  Moscow or -- to use your words -- new "carryings-on" in the SPD?    [Scharping] I think that the biggest risk is that far too  many people will act on the quite natural assumption the the SPD  will win the elections and lead the next government. There is  still plenty of hard work to be done. Even with good election  results and good ratings in opinion polls, we should not let up  at any time, because there are almost exactly seven months to go  until 16 October.    [DIE ZEIT] Why do you actually want to become chancellor?    [Scharping] Because I think that I can do the job and do it  better than others.</p>

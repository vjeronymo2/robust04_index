			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> $1.15 MILLION SOUGHT TO IMPROVE HOUSING  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to apply for two U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development grants totaling almost $1.15  million to rehabilitate low- and moderate-income housing units.  </P> <P> The council voted to apply for a $72,000 HUD grant to help rehabilitate 66  moderate-income apartments in the city, said Ernest Whitaker, Oxnard housing  rehabilitation program manager.  </P> <P> Although it will take HUD about 30 days to formally approve the application,  Whitaker said, he is almost certain the grant will be given.  </P> <P> "This is not a case of us going on a fishing expedition," he said.  </P> <P> Under the program, apartment owners can qualify for funds if their buildings  are in moderate-income neighborhoods and if 70% of the units are leased to  residents with moderate incomes, Whitaker said.  </P> <P> A resident who earns 80% or less of the city's median household income, or  about $25,000 annually, is defined as having a moderate income. A resident who  earns 50% or less of the median income, or about $15,600 annually, is defined  as having a low income.  </P> <P> The HUD money can be provided as a loan with 6% interest or as a grant to  apartment owners who can provide matching funds of 50%, Whitaker said.  </P> <P> The council, acting as the Oxnard Housing Authority Commission, also voted to  apply for a $1,073,290 HUD grant for capital improvement projects at 100  low-income housing units in six housing projects owned and operated by the  city.  </P> <P> City officials expect the grant to be approved by August, a report by city  staff members says.  </P> <P> The grant would be used to replace stoves, water heaters and worn kitchen  cabinets, among other things, the report says. The money would also pay to  install bulletproof windows and remove gasoline-contaminated soil at the  maintenance and administrative offices for the Department of Housing at 300 N.

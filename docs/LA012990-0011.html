			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S NO 'BREED FROM HELL';  </P> <P> DOGS: PIT BULLS ARE THE CURRENT VILLAINS, BUT THE BREEDERS, NOT THE ANIMALS,  ARE THE PROBLEM.  </P> <P> Fatal maulings by pit bulls have occurred often enough in recent years to seem  almost commonplace. Equally common and predictable are the reactions of  everyone concerned.  </P> <P> Politicians, such as Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and Gov. George  Deukmejian, talk of an outright ban on pit bulls, and the dog lobby reacts with  an immediate campaign against such legislation.  </P> <P> The news media slavishly recount the gruesome details of the latest attack, and  the public clamors for something, anything, to prevent such atrocities.  </P> <P> I am a reserve animal-control officer, a dog owner and a writer about dogs  (including pit bulls), and this latest killing leaves me with an eerie sense of  deja vu.  </P> <P> Marjee Lilly, a 70-year-old San Diego woman visiting her grandson's home in Los  Angeles, was killed by his two dogs, young pit bull mixes. We'll probably never  know why Vic and Chomper attacked her.  </P> <P> In any case, Marjee Lilly's death calls for solutions beyond the usual lip  service to good laws and platitudes about responsible pet ownership.  </P> <P> First, though, we need a common understanding of the nature of the problem.  </P> <P> The term "pit bull" has been used to identify a large population of registered  and unregistered, purebred and mixed-breed dogs. Their ancestors were bred and  raised to fight other animals. As such, most share a remarkably uncanine  characteristic: They will fight to the bloody end and rarely warn of an  impending attack.  </P> <P> Just because they are genetically selected to fight other animals does not mean  they present a danger to people. On the contrary, the old-time dogfighters bred  their animals to be docile with humans.  </P> <P> Those dogfighters may not be everyone's idea of the perfect gentlemen -- except  when compared to the owners who emerged in the 1980s: the street-corner  fighters, the drug dealers and the macho guys who want the meanest dog on the  block. Backyard breeders, looking to make a quick buck, started mass-producing  the dogs with no regard to temperament.  </P> <P> No one can dispute the fact that pit bulls are over-represented in fatal  attacks. From 1979 through 1988, at least 157 people were killed by dogs in the  United States, and pit-bull breeds were involved in 41.6% of those fatal  attacks, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.  Although there are no reliable statistics on the number of pit bulls, we know  that those breeds do not account for anywhere near 40% of our canine  population.  </P> <P> In reality, though, the pit bull is just the latest breed to reap the spoils of  over-popularity. In the 1960s and 1970s, guard and attack dogs became popular,  and the wrong people wanted Doberman pinschers and German shepherds. Soon,  German shepherds headed the list of dogs that killed. In this decade, there's a  strong likelihood the Rottweiler will replace the pit bull as the media's dog  from hell.  </P> <P> One of the obvious solutions is to pass laws, but not those outlawing a new  dangerous dog each decade. Both San Diego and Los Angeles recently passed model  laws. In those cities, a dog can be impounded by animal control officers if it  attacks or even shows a propensity to cause injury to humans (and in Los  Angeles, other animals.) Enforcing the laws against dogfighting also helps.  </P> <P> But laws and enforcement can do only so much. Dog owners must be held liable  for the actions of their canine charges. In that regard, we have made strides.  At least two people, including a California man, have been convicted of  manslaughter after their pit bulls killed.  </P> <P> But why stop there? Why not hold dog sellers, including pet stores, responsible  as well?  </P> <P> Dog-fanciers in other countries are ahead of Americans in recognizing the  importance of canine temperament. For instance, in Mexico, a German shepherd  must have proof of a sound temperament in order to have its championship  recognized. Tests of temperament are available and are already used by  law-enforcement agencies and other specialty trainers.  </P> <P> Strong steps should at least be thoughtfully studied before we forget Marjee  Lilly:  </P> <P> * Demand that all breeding dogs have proof of sound temperament as well as  proof that they are free of the ever-growing numbers of genetic defects showing  up in purebred dogs. Concurrently, set up free clinics to encourage spaying and  neutering of companion pets.  </P> <P> * License dog breeders. Anyone wanting to produce puppies would have to prove  knowledge of canine behavior, genetics and the importance of socializing young  animals.  </P> <P> * Establish minimum standards to help consumers identify first-class,  well-socialized puppies, whose parents are sound in health and temperament.  </P> <P> Well-bred, well-socialized dogs do not kill. We must take strong, creative  action to avoid future pit bull (or Doberman or Rottweiler) incidents.  </P></p>

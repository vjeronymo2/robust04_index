			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government beats off revolt on leasehold THE Government comfortably beat off a rebellion by London-based Tory backbenchers in the Commons last night as the Housing and Urban Development bill moved to its report stage. Sir John Wheeler, the MP for Westminster North, and Mr Dudley Fishburn, the MP for Kensington, had both said they would be voting against the government. But a Labour amendment seeking to extend the government's leasehold reform proposals to properties with a high ground rent was defeated by 294 votes to 252, a government majority of 42. The bill would give up to 750,000 leaseholders the right to buy the freehold of their property, enabling tenants for example to join to buy the freehold of their block of flats. Groups of Tory back-benchers supporting the interests of private landlords and tenants with long leases have each been endeavouring to swing the reforms in their favour. The landlords' lobby yesterday backed away from confrontation, withdrawing proposals for a tightly drawn residency qualification without forcing a vote after the govern-ment offered minor concessions. Mr Fishburn said the low-rent test provision that the defeated amendment would have struck out would create a two-tier property market. 'In effect, whole swathes of London will be disenfranchised and whole armies of Tory voters will feel let down.' Sir John said the test was there to address a situation that 'simply does not exist.' If not removed, it would 'come back to haunt us again and again.' For the government, Sir George Young, housing minister, said the test provided 'an important distinction' between the rental and long-lease markets.</p>

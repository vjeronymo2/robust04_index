			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO'S AFRAID OF ART MARKET?;  </P> <P> AUCTION: NOT ELIZABETH TAYLOR, WHO WILL SELL HER PRIZED VAN GOGH IN LONDON  DESPITE AN UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CLIMATE.  </P> <P> The economy looks so gloomy and the art market has flattened out so much that  many prospective sellers of valuable artworks are waiting for a more propitious  time to liquidate their treasures.  </P> <P> Not actress Elizabeth Taylor. She has consigned her prized Vincent van Gogh  painting, "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy," to the auction  block. The 1889 landscape is expected to bring between $16 million and $22  million on Dec. 3 at Christie's London. The actress bought the painting for  $257,600 at a London auction in 1963.  </P> <P> If the selling price falls within the auction house's estimate, Taylor's  painting will be among the most expensive Van Goghs to be sold at auction, but  it won't approach a record. The highest auction price for a Van Gogh -- and for  any artwork -- is $82.5 million, paid last May by Japanese paper manufacturer  Ryoei Saito for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet."  </P> <P> Van Gogh painted "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy" a few months  after he had committed himself to an asylum in Southern France. In a letter to  his brother, Theo, the Dutch artist said that the painting celebrates nature  with "autumn effects glorious in color, green skies contrasting with foliage in  yellows, oranges, greens."  </P> <P> Executed the year before Van Gogh committed suicide, the painting comes from  the most vigorous and highly valued period of the artist's short career. The  fact that "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy" has been shown in  prestigious museums around the world indicates that it is considered a notable  example of his work. The Metropolitan Museum of Art included the landscape in  the 1986-87 landmark exhibition, "Van Gogh in Saint-Remy and Auvers."  </P> <P> Taylor bought the painting while she was married to actor Richard Burton. She  had begun collecting art in the mid-'50s and had been looking for a Van Gogh  for 12 years, according to the auction house. Her father, London art dealer  Francis Taylor, reportedly advised the Burtons to go to Paris during the  auction and to bid in secrecy to keep the price down.  </P> <P> The Burtons hung the painting in their home in Gstaad, Switzerland, for several  years. Later they remodeled their yacht Kalizma (named for Taylor's and  Burton's children, Kate Burton, Liza Todd and Maria Burton) to accommodate the  painting. The yacht, which was docked on the Thames River, was home to the  Burtons on their frequent visits to London. They lived on board to circumvent  British laws that prevented them from importing their pets.  </P> <P> Taylor kept the painting after her divorce from Burton. In recent years she has  displayed it in her home in Bel-Air. The actress declined to explain why she is  selling the Van Gogh. An auction house official would only say that the  consignment was "a personal decision."  </P> <P> Although the auction forecast is bleak for the fall season, this is the second  multimillion-dollar Van Gogh to be offered. Christie's New York will test the  Van Gogh market on Nov. 14 when a 1890 still life, "Vase With Cornflowers and  Poppies," goes on the block at an estimated price of $12 million to $16  million.  </P> <P> The Van Gogh market has gone wild in the past four years, starting with the  sale of "Sunflowers" for $39.9 million to a Japanese insurance company on March  31, 1987. Five and a half months later, on Nov. 11, 1987, "Irises" sold for  $53.9 million to Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. When Bond's financial  empire subsequently tumbled, "Irises" was quietly put up for sale. The J. Paul  Getty Museum in Malibu bought it earlier this year for an undisclosed sum.  </P> <P> The "Irises" record held until last May, when it was shattered by the  astonishing sum of $82.5 million paid for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet." Among other  Van Gogh paintings that have commanded more than $10 million at auction are  "Bridge at Trinquetaille" ($20.24 million),"Portrait of Adeline Ravoux" ($13.75  million) and "Romans Parisiens (Les Livres Jaune)" ($12.2 million).  </P></p>

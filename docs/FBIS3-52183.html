Guerrillas opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades and  heavy machine guns at an SLA position in Sujud on the edge of  Israel's self-declared "security zone," the militia said.    The attack was claimed in a statement issued in Beirut by a  hitherto unknown movement, "The Arm of the National Revolution."    The group said the Muhammad Salim group of that movement  carried out the attack. Salim, who was killed five years ago,  was a leader of the pro-Damascus secular National Social Syrian  Party in Lebanon.    Elsewhere, guerrillas fired three Katyusha rockets overnight  Friday at the areas around Marj 'Uyun, headquarters of the  Israeli army and SLA in the occupied zone, but caused no  casualties, the police said.    On Tuesday the pro-Iranian Hizballah militia pounded the  security zone, notably Marj 'Uyun, firing more than 100 Katyusha  rockets and heavy artillery shells, and launched some 20 attacks  against SLA positions.    Israeli helicopters carried out a series of retaliatory  raids  against positions of the fundamentalist movement which left four  people dead, including three Hizballah guerrillas.    Hizballah has spearheaded daily attacks on Israeli and SLA  forces in south Lebanon since Israel and the Palestine  Liberation Organization signed a limited Palestinian autonomy  accord on September 13 in Washington.    The anti-Israel attacks come ahead of a summit this month in  Geneva between U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Syrian  counterpart Hafiz al-Asad, to discuss the resumption of Syrian-  Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace talks.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (3): A measure of how data is transmitted - . . . For Bandwidth ONE thing that all new applications of computer technology have in common is a demand for 'bandwidth.' Image processing, multimedia computing, voice-mail and groupware applications are all examples of tasks that need a way to pass large amounts of information back and forth very quickly. In strict technical terms, bandwidth defines 'the difference, expressed in hertz, between the two limiting frequencies of a band.' In practical terms, bandwidth provides a measure of how much data can be transmitted from one place to another in a given time. Taking the analogy of a road transport system, bandwidth can be thought of as the number of lanes on a motorway. If there are more lanes, then the greater the number of vehicles which can use the road. There are two obvious ways to increase the usable bandwidth of a communications network. Firstly, the size of the 'pipe' which carries the traffic can be made larger and more efficient. Secondly, the 'size' of the data can be reduced or compressed so that more data can be carried in the same 'pipe.' There are efforts under way to increase usable bandwidth in both these areas. The transition from analog to digital networks is one way to make the communications 'pipe' bigger and better - either by using asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology (see 'A') or integrated services digital networks (ISDN). In both cases, data is carried through the network entirely in a standard digital form, thus removing the need to translate it. This increases transmission speeds and makes networks more efficient. VIABILITY Digital networks have been around for some time in the form of expensive leased lines. These have only been viable for large organisations with a continuous demand for a connection. It is only now, with the advent of dial-up ISDN services, that the large bandwidth offered by digital communications has become generally available and cost-effective. UK telecommunications carrier Mercury says that, if line usage is less than 3.2 hours a day, the cost of a dial-up ISDN service is less than the cost of a permanent leased line. One of the main advantages of ISDN is that the bandwidth can be varied according to the nature of the transmission. There are several different ISDN services now becoming available - each rated according to the number of 'lines' they provide. The basic service offers two lines. More advanced services provide as many as 30. But these lines are not physical lines - they are logical lines, controlled by the software. This means that many different messages can be carried simultaneously using a single physical wire or optical fibre. If, however, there is a need to carry a large amount of data - say, a broadcast-quality video signal - several lines can be allocated to the task. Returning to the road analogy - it is like carrying a wide load down two lanes of a motorway. The other approach to increasing the usable bandwidth of a communications network is to 'compress' the data with special hardware and software. If the data transmitted across a network is reduced in this way, the traffic load is, of course, also reduced. There are number of approaches emerging to provide data compression. In February, Microsoft announced its strategy for data compression which will be built in to future versions of the MS/DOS operating system. Called the Microsoft Realtime Compression Interface (MRCI), this specification will give software developers a general-purpose mechanism to compress data in PC systems. Microsoft says that MRCI will reduce data storage requirements. It will also improve data transfer speeds between computers and between a computer and its storage devices. At the same time, the US software develop er Software Publishing (SPC) announced a data compression technology for image data. It uses a technique called fractal transform to convert images from strings of pixel information into mathematical formulae. Fractal graphics have been used to create lifelike computer graphics for some time now. SPC claims that the storage requirements for a full screen, 24-bit colour image can be reduced from about a million bits to as little as 10,000 by using the technique. The combination of faster, more efficient communications networks and clever data-compression techniques will help to remove many of the current bandwidth restrictions. This will provide the foundation for many new applications of information technology - particularly those which fall under the heading of multimedia computing. By the end of the decade it is conceivable that a standard desktop computer will be able to provide full colour broadcast-quality images, hi-fi sound, high-speed international communications and instant access to a multitude of on-line services and databases. Much of the technology to achieve this is already in place and it is only the lack of bandwidth which is the limiting factor. Soon, even this limitation will be overcome.</p>

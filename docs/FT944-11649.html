			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: End of the line for bauxite body Members of the International Bauxite Association have agreed it will be dissolved on December 31, saying that the industry and the market for the aluminium bearing ore have become 'more transparent' and are no longer 'dominated by a few companies'. The dissolution of the producers' group 20 years and one month after its formation, followed the withdrawal of some members and a decision by Jamaica, where the association has its headquarters, that it was leaving because the IBA was no longer relevant to it. A communique issued after an extraordinary meeting of the IBA's council of ministers said that when the association was formed, the bauxite mining and refining industry was dominated by 'a few multinational corporations who largely determined the prices paid to producers. With membership which between them produced over 80 per cent of the world's bauxite and about half its alumina output, the IBA was able to achieve for members, adequate returns through mutual exchange of information'. In announcing earlier this year that Jamaica would recommend the dissolution of the IBA, Mr Robert Pickersgill, the island's mining minister, said its members' share of world bauxite production had fallen to about 25 per cent. 'We have said to the other members that we do not think that we are progressing, and that we want an end to the IBA.' The association, which bauxite and alumina (aluminium oxide) consumers had feared would become a cartel, has acted as a data bank for its members, allowing them to exchange information and ideas on the state of the industry. It received a setback two years ago when Australia, its most important member, pulled out. India, another founding member, also left. This deprived the IBA of about 40 per cent of its budget. The situation was worsened by a high level of delinquency among remaining members. The association lists its members as Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Sierra Leone and Surinam. The association lost two founding members - the Dominican Republic and Haiti - because their industries were shut down. It lost another with the break-up of Yugoslavia. The IBA was unsuccessful in expanding its membership, and failed to attract producers such as Brazil. It also failed to broker a commodity pact between bauxite producers and consumers under the aegis of the UN Committee on Trade and Development because of a lack of support from either side, and because bauxite could not be organised in pacts similar to those for other commodities. Operations were also hampered by the failure of several members to pay subscriptions. In deciding to dissolve the IBA, the members maintained it had been valuable to bauxite producers. 'Technical and market information supplied by the secretariat equipped members with a clearer understanding of the industry,' the council of ministers said. 'This vital ingredient enhanced not only the quality of negotiations with companies, but facilitated the development of further processing activities. The market has become more transparent and the industry is no longer dominated by a few companies.'</p>

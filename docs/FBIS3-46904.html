Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis told a regular briefing  that North Korea had agreed to allow the inspections necessary  for the continuity of safeguards on its seven installations  declared with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Davis said she expects Pyongyang to talk with the IAEA to set  specifics on the procedures.    North Korea and the United States "are very close to  satisfying" the conditions for the third round of high-level  talks, and the talks could open based on these two steps, Davis  said.    North Korean Embassy officials did meet with the IAEA at its  Vienna headquarters, but Agency Spokesman David Kyd said there  were no proposals on Pyongyang's part on the inspections.    The embassy officials basically heard the IAEA's position  and  replied they will come back with the response after consulting  with their government, Kyd said in a telephone interview.    The next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will seek ways to  completely solve all issues related to the nuclear situation  including special inspection on two undeclared sites in North  Korea.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Strike threat Last Thursday, British Airways cabin crews at Manchester and Birmingham backed strike action in a ballot by the Transport and General Workers' Union. Meetings are now to be held to try to resolve the dispute, which is over holidays and allowances affecting air hostesses and stewards. Three-quarters of the 565 cabin crew union members at the airports returned their papers in the ballot. A total of 88 per cent backed a strike, while an even bigger proportion, 93 per cent, supported other forms of industrial action short of a walkout, said the union.</p>

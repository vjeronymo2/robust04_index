			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Management: Long march to market - State enterprises still dominate China's economy. A recent study may help foreign investors in their dealings with them China's remarkable economic growth is driven by non-state industries, yet state-owned enterprises still account for half of industrial output and 70 per cent of urban workforces. Any company with significant business in China will have to deal with them, and may even consider them as candidates for a joint venture. Research by British and Chinese universities, however, suggests that the progress of state-owned enterprises towards the adoption of market-oriented management practices is painfully slow. The findings will be important for foreign companies whose managers may be trying to find out what makes Chinese companies tick, or to ascertain whether their own objectives and those of a local partner are compatible. The research project, led by Lancaster University Management School, compared practices at Chinese enterprises with those of British private-sector companies in similar fields. It particularly examined how companies made decisions on strategic investments, and management of human resources. The researchers found that in Britain the process of winning the support of colleagues, managers and eventually the board for a new project was similar to that in China and took just as much time. The efforts of Chinese managers, however, were mostly directed outside the company. The relationships they needed to build were with supervisory ministries and other authorities, with the aim of securing the many approvals needed for a project to go ahead. A second conclusion was that Chinese companies inevitably took a far broader range of considerations into account, including conformity with central plans, social responsibilities and technological progress. This suggests that not much has changed yet in the management of state-owned enterprises - many of which are chronically loss-making - in spite of the 'contract responsibility' system under which enterprises sign three- to four-year profit contracts with their supervisory authority. Caution is necessary. The investment projects analysed were all approved more than two years ago. Managers interviewed by the researchers indicated that things were beginning to change. One sign of the new order came from the director of Nanjing Chemical, who said he had turned down promotion to positions in ministries because he wanted to be chairman if shareholder ownership was introduced. Still, it will take years for the market-place to break down the uniformity which the research team found in the approaches of the Chinese companies. Standardised behaviour - which does at least help the foreigner to know what to expect - derives from the structure of ministries which draw senior staff from the enterprises, and from a system designed to manage the entire country from the top down. The communist party's role in the management of companies helps to perpetuate a common approach. The party secretary within an enterprise forms a balance of power with its director - though there are signs that the former's role is tending to be limited to monitoring personnel decisions, and that professional managers are on the rise. At Beijing Yanshan Petrochemicals the researchers found the party secretary to be more important than the director, whose appointment he had recommended. But in Nanjing Chemical the director had worked his way up over 30 years, had strong links with the supervising ministry and controlled all business decisions including personnel, while the party secretary's role was limited. Although there has been some devolution of authority, the researchers found that all important investment decisions had to be approved by the state or national government. Once the nod came from the minister concerned, approvals would follow in rapid sequence from all other relevant authorities. One company established an office in Beijing for six months to lobby for its new chemical plant. Its executives repeatedly telephoned key officials to ensure they had all the information. Proposals were still driven less by the sensing of a market opportunity than by a need identified in central planning - for example, shortage of a specific petrochemical. Managers said projects were becoming more market-directed and that proposals needed to contain more detailed market analysis, particularly as the state had ceased to provide grants and financing must be negotiated with banks. However, the researchers commented that 'managers' understanding of the market and, in fact, the market itself, was still dominated and distorted by the continued strong planning bias of the system'. Procedures for individual performance evaluation and promotion, though sophisticated, are also homogeneous. Under an annual appraisal system, specialist units within companies interview some 15 to 20 of a manager's peers and a larger number of subordinates about his or her performance. Criteria for promotion are, in order: good moral and political practice, competence and motivation in present job, quality of relationships with others in the company, and performance record. Senior managers are chosen from production posts and will have deep knowledge of operations. Dismissals are rare. However, changes are beginning to be forced upon companies: graduates are no longer automatically assigned to their first jobs by ministries, and the growth of non-state industry means that a large part of the labour market is outside the planners' control. In the fast-growing province of Guangdong, directors operate with more autonomy, and have to offer higher salaries and fringe benefits to attract staff. It is sometimes suggested that state industries will simply wither in the face of the dynamic growth of industry not directly owned by the state. However, their economic role is so central and their losses such a drain on the national budget that it seems essential for the government to take direct action if economic reform is to be sustainable.

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television ITV programme chiefs keep on claiming that, although they have scrapped This Week, Viewpoint and First Tuesday, their current affairs output is as good and serious as ever; that they are covering much the same ground as before; and that their chief concern is not the maximisation of ratings. Perhaps they simply don't have time to watch their own output. Having given us The Big Story with such humdingers as Is Wacko Jacko A Pervert? and Blues And Twos where we were invited to follow the camera under the lorry to peer at the old lady trapped there, today they begin Hollywood Women (9.00). This, they tell us, provides 'a fascinating no-holds barred insight' into four areas: Glitz And Glamour (today) Sex And Success, Money And Power, and Fear And Violence. Interviewees include Bo Derek, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Channel 4 has chosen to delay its acknowledgement of World Aids Day by 24 hours and is running more than three hours of programmes from 9.00, beginning with the second part of the better-than-average documentary The Plague.</p>

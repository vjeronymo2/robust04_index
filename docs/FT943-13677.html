			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Mitterrand has prostate surgery President Francois Mitterrand is expected tomorrow to leave the Paris hospital where he has undergone prostate surgery. The president, 77, was admitted to hospital on Sunday and had the operation yesterday to remove an obstruction to his urethra which was affecting his kidney. The surgeon, who treated him two years ago for prostate cancer, said that yesterday's operation had been completed 'satisfactorily' and that the president's condition was stable. Mr Mitterrand's wife, Danielle, underwent heart surgery last Friday. Mr Mitterrand has persistently ruled out the possibility of standing for re-election in next April's presidential poll but has long insisted that, his health permitting, he plans to serve out the remainder of his term in office.</p>

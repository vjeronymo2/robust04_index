In an  interview published in the first edition of the independent  SAVANA newspaper, the Renamo leader did, however, say that  Renamo does not intend a return to war. Leonel Matias, our  correspondent in Maputo, reports:    In an interview he granted to the BBC, Jose de Castro,  Renamo's number-one man for electoral matters, noted that his  movement had received promises of financing for its  transformation into a political party, as long as it signed the  General Peace Accord. Jose de Castro says that the accord was  signed, but those countries have not complied with their  undertakings yet.    [Begin Castro recording] We find ourselves in a precarious  situation that does not allow us to be at peace to face up to  the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo. In view of that, we  believe such support would be necessary, seeing that it has been  promised. If you promise, you owe. [end recording]    I also asked Jose de Castro how much money Renamo thinks the  international community should make available. He did not  provide figures, but said that Renamo needs a great deal of  money.    [Begin Castro recording] At this stage, we have delegates  working from their own homes. They do not have [words  indistinct] residences. It is important to note that those are  key provinces, notably those where we believe some conditions  should have been in place but are not. [end recording]    It should be noted that the United Nations has already  created a special fund for Renamo. That fund is worth $6  million. I asked Jose de Castro whether that amount would not  be enough:    [Begin Castro recording] We need transportation. We need  homes. We need fax machines. We need machines. In other  words, we need so many things that we see $6 million as less  than a drop in the ocean. [end recording]    Reports doing the rounds in the Mozambican capital today say  that EC countries have decided to support the special fund that  has been created for Renamo. However, no details are available  at this stage.    Reacting this afternoon to the statement made by the Renamo  leader, Transport and Communications Minister Armando Guebuza,  government representative in the Supervision and Control  Commission, described Afonso Dhlakama's threats as blackmail.    [Begin recording] [Guebuza] I hope that the Renamo leader  will reconsider that demand, because it cannot be used to  blackmail our people.    [Matias] Do you see it as blackmail?    [Guebuza] I cannot see any better explanation for it. Our  people want money but they know they will only have it once  there is stability in the country. [end recording]</p>

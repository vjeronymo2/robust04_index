			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Clarke named chief executive of Hanson Ind LORD WHITE, one of the twin architects of the growth of Hanson, yesterday paved the way for his successor by announcing that Mr David Clarke had been named as deputy chairman and chief executive of Hanson Industries, the congolmerate's US arm. Mr Clarke, aged 50, was introduced by Lord White, chairman of Hanson's US arm, as his successor at a meeting of fund managers and analysts in London last month. Mr John Raos, one of the group's chief operating officers has been promoted to president. The decision to name Mr Clarke as deputy chairman of Hanson Industries increased speculation that Lord White might step down as chairman before he is due to retire in 1996. Mr Clarke, a director of Hanson plc since 1989, has served as president and chief operating office of Hanson Industries since 1978. Both men were yesterday described by Lord White as skilled practitioners of the Hanson philosophy.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TV SESSION TO BE TAPED TODAY;  </P> <P> BERNARDI, CHALLENGER TO FACE OFF IN 3 DEBATES  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and challenger Lyle Hall, who  sparred by remote control during the primary campaign, said Thursday that they  have agreed to three debates, starting with a taped-for-television session  today.  </P> <P> The pair, pitted against one another in the June 6 runoff election, relied  largely on mailers before the April 11 primary, with Hall attacking Bernardi's  age and council attendance record and the 77-year-old councilman criticizing  Hall, a city Fire Department captain, as a tool of organized labor.  </P> <P> They are expected to try to emphasize the same issues in today's taped  half-hour debate, which will be broadcast at 9:30 a.m. Sunday on KCBS-TV,  Channel 2.  </P> <P> The 49-year-old Hall, saying he was "delighted he has at last agreed to a  debate," nonetheless criticized Bernardi for declining a joint appearance  Thursday at a Greater San Fernando Valley Lions Club luncheon.  </P> <P> Bernardi said he passed up the event because it was in Studio City, outside his  7th District, "and I was busy with things in the district. Also, we're going to  get plenty of chance to debate with these three sessions."  </P> <P> The pair will also face off at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Mary Immaculate Catholic  Church in Pacoima. The debate will be sponsored by Valley Organized in  Community Effort, a grass-roots organization formed by Valley churches and  synagogues.  </P> <P> At 7 p.m. May 9, they will debate at the Branford Park community building in  Arleta. That session will be sponsored by the Arleta Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Bernardi, who with 28 years of service is the senior member of the council,  received 42% of the primary vote, short of the majority required to avoid a  runoff against Hall, who was second with 26%. It is Bernardi's first runoff  since he was elected to the council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bernardi Hires Consultant  </P> <P> The councilman, who relishes his public image as a maverick who disdains  conventional political behavior, said Thursday that he has hired veteran  consultant Allan Hoffenblum to write his mailers and advise him on campaign  strategy -- the first time in more than two decades that he has employed such a  professional.  </P> <P> "It's a tough race and I'm not so stubborn that I won't get the kind of help I  need to win," Bernardi said.  </P> <P> Hoffenblum, based in the South Bay, has worked mostly for Republicans.  </P> <P> Political analysts view Hall's flurry of hard-hitting mailings, which were  drafted by Newport Beach-based campaign consultant Harvey Englander, as  responsible for forcing the race into a runoff.  </P> <P> Bernardi on Thursday also offered no apologies for a fund-raising reception,  sharply criticized earlier in the week by Hall, being organized on the  councilman's behalf by council President John Ferraro.  </P> <P> At least 10 other council members are expected to attend, and a Ferraro  spokesman said they have been asked to bring along veteran campaign  contributors, including lobbyists, to boost Bernardi's campaign.  </P> <P> Hall said the event, scheduled Wednesday at the private Los Angeles Athletic  Club, "has the potential of smacking of elitism and being an attempt of the  system to perpetuate itself."  </P> <P> He also charged that the anticipated presence of lobbyists means that Bernardi  supporters were "bringing in the influence brokers to muscle them for  contributions."  </P> <P> Bernardi said Thursday that his knowledge of the event was limited to newspaper  accounts.  </P> <P> "But make no mistake about it, I welcome the support from John," he said. "And  I trust that what he arranges will be done in a proper manner."  </P></p>

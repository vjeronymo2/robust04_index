			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NG" report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Foreign Ministry </F> Recommends"]    [Text] A letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  signed by Aleksandr Panov, deputy to Andrey Kozyrev, appeared in  the State Duma yesterday. The deputy minister's letter is  devoted to the arrival of the Tibetan Dalai Lama, who is on a  private visit to Russia. Since all more or less official  contacts by the Tibetan exile are very disturbing for China, Mr.  Panov recommended to State Duma deputies to take no part in any  meetings with the leader of all Buddhists.</p>

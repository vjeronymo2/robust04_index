			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: QUATTRO'S NEW PROGRAM DELIVERS  </P> <P> Borland International on Wednesday unveiled Quattro Pro, the successor to  Quattro, its 2-year-old spreadsheet program. I've tested a preliminary version  of the program and I'm impressed -- very impressed.  </P> <P> Spreadsheet programs are used to perform calculations on numbers that are  organized into rows and columns. When you revise a figure or modify a formula,  all numbers affected by the change are revised as well.  </P> <P> The Borland announcement comes on the heels of Lotus Development Corp.'s  release of two new versions of Lotus 1-2-3, the program that dominates the IBM  PC spreadsheet market with a share of more than 70%. Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.2,  which is a modest upgrade to the previous version, runs on just about any IBM  compatible machine.  </P> <P> Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 is an entirely new program with lots of bells and  whistles. However, it will not run on older computers, such as an IBM XT; it  requires a machine with the faster Intel 80286 (or 80386) central processing  unit and at least a megabyte of memory. Millions of IBM compatible machines do  not meet these specifications. Quattro works on virtually any IBM-compatible PC  equipped with a hard disk and at least 512K of memory. Microsoft Excel, another  leading spreadsheet program, like Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3, requires a computer  with the faster Intel processing unit or a Macintosh.  </P> <P> Quattro is not a program that sacrifices one feature for another. It's easy to  use, heavy on features and doesn't require a lot of memory or a  state-of-the-art computer.  </P> <P> To begin with, it is compatible with Lotus 1-2-3. That's important if Borland  expects to win defectors from the Lotus camp. The program is also able to load  files from any version of Lotus 1-2-3 except Release 3. You can also display  Lotus 1-2-3 graphs and you can use Lotus 1-2-3 macros. A macro is a sequence of  instructions that enables a user to perform a complicated task in as little as  one keystroke.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easy to Copy Formulas  </P> <P> It's possible to configure Quattro so that it uses the same menus and commands  as Lotus 1-2-3, but the program also comes with its own set of menus that, at  least for me, made it easier to use. Unlike Lotus 1-2-3, Quattro allows you to  use a mouse to select menus, issue commands and highlight portions of your  data. I was able to use the program productively after only a few minutes of  practice; even less experienced users should have little trouble learning it.  The use of the mouse, combined with the program's superb graphics, made me feel  almost as if I were using a Macintosh.  </P> <P> The program is able to work with up to 32 spreadsheets at a time. An individual  spreadsheet can take up the whole screen or can be reduced in size to fit in a  window. The program can automatically arrange the windows on the screen so that  it's easy to use the mouse or the keyboard to move among them.  </P> <P> A formula in one spreadsheet can refer to data or formulas in another. That  could be handy if you were consolidating data from several spreadsheets. For  example, if you were developing a national budget based on reports from four  regions of the country, you could load each report into the computer's memory  and quickly consolidate the data.  </P> <P> Quattro also makes it easy to copy formulas or data from one work sheet to  another. Each spreadsheet is saved as a separate file. But several files can be  identified as belonging to a group so that they all can be loaded into memory  with a single command.  </P> <P> All the major spreadsheet programs allow you to create business graphics, but  Quattro takes it several steps farther. Creating a graph is easier than it is  with Lotus 1-2-3. As with Excel, you begin by using your mouse or arrow keys to  highlight the data you want included. You then select the type of graph  (choices include bar, pie, column, stacked bar and others). If your data is set  up in a standard column format, you can get an immediate graph by selecting the  "fast graph" option. But you can also customize the graph.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Create a Slide Show  </P> <P> The most impressive feature, called "annotate," provides you with a set of  drawing tools that let you draw lines, arrows, circles, boxes and other shapes.  You can also enter text and modify the graphs. Graphs can be placed anywhere on  the screen or on the page when printed out. It's also possible to use the  graphic feature to create a slide show to use during a presentation.  </P> <P> Quattro comes with fonts from Bitstream, which, along with the graphics, give  it the ability to create impressive screen displays and printouts. Because it  operates in graphics mode, all fonts can be displayed on the screen or  generated on a dot matrix or laser printer. I used the program with an  inexpensive Epson compatible dot matrix printer and was impressed with the  results.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the program was very fast on my 386 machine, which is  equipped with three megabytes of memory. But it also works on IBM XT compatible  machines with as little as 512K of memory. To test the program, I deliberately  disabled most of my computer's memory so that only 435K was available. The  program worked well, even after I had loaded in 11 spreadsheets. It wasn't as  fast as it was in the larger system, but it did work.  </P> <P> The ability to run in machines with relatively little memory is increasingly  important.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Versatile Program  </P> <P> Most IBM compatibles have no more than 640K of memory and a lot of machines are  now connected to local area networks that require running special software that  uses part of that 640K. That's not a problem if you're running small, simple  programs that don't take up much memory. But Quattro is a full-feature program.  Programs with help screens, graphics, windows and other features generally take  up a great deal of memory.  </P> <P> Quattro uses a programming technique, called VROOMM, which breaks the program  into hundreds of small modules, called objects. An object is typically two  kilobytes to four kilobytes in size. The program has a control center always in  memory that keeps track of what the user is doing and loads in modules as  needed.  </P> <P> As a result, the entire program doesn't have to reside in the memory. This  creates more room for data, which is why it was possible for me to load  multiple spreadsheets in only 435K of memory. Because it must load coding from  a disk, there is a slight delay, but it is minor compared to the advantage of  being able to use large spreadsheets on the old or low-cost PCs.  </P> <P> Quattro Pro, which will cost $495, is expected to be available some time before  the end of this year. It requires an IBM PC compatible computer with a hard  disk and at least 512K of memory.  </P> <P> QUATTRO PRO  </P> <P> Features: Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program that offers a wide  variety of mathematical and financial functions along with graphics and  database management. It is able to display up to 32 files at a time and has a  unique memory management system that allows the user to work with large amounts  of data on machines with as little as 512K of memory. It is able to use files  created with Lotus 1-2-3.  </P> <P> Manufacturer: Borland International  </P> <P> 1800 Green Hills Road, Scotts Valley, CA 95066, (408) 438-8400, FAX: (408)  439-9273  </P> <P> Price: $495  </P> <P> Requirements: IBM PC-compatible computer with a hard disk and at least 512K of  memory.  </P></p>

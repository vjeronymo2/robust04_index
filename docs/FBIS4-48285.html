			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Farouk Chothia, Stephen Laufer, Chris Louw and Paul </F> Stober]    [Text] Unmistakably bearing Nelson Mandela's personal  stamp, the national unity cabinet announced this week emerged  after days of juggling during which the president was forced to  keep his eye on a number of balls tossed to him by the coalition  parties.    Perhaps most influential among the juggler's assistants was  Mandela's own organisation, with the ANC's highest body, the  National Working Committee [NWC], insisting on retaining control  over several key portfolios despite massive pressure from the  National Party and Inkatha for him to relinquish them.    Among the cabinet positions the ANC was determined to hang  on  to were those related to security, including the defence,  police, and justice ministries, and land, key to the party's  reconstruction development programme.    ANC members have also been named as deputies in key  ministries the party relinquished to their coalition partners.  Said one cabinet insider: "We have a watchman in any ministry  with relevance to the future." "Watchmen" include trade union  heavyweight Alec Erwin as deputy finance minister to the Nat's  [National Party, NP] Derek Keys, ANC legal advisor Penuell  Maduna as deputy to Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi,  Valli Moosa at Provincial Affairs under Roelf Meyer, which will  be key in the development of the federal system, and Thoko Msane  at Agriculture, which is headed by the Nat's Kraai van Niekerk.    The ANC can expect to install a second level of "watchmen"  when the directors general are appointed. These could include  Cheryl Carolus at welfare, and John Samuel at education.  Lawyer Nicholas "Fink" Haysom was reportedly offered the top  South African Police position, but turned it down in favour of a  counsellor's post in the President's office.    The appointments of Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa as  deputies in the education and environment ministries  respectively relates directly to their standing in the ANC.  Mandela appears to have found it impossible to ignore their  popular followings. Buthelezi's appointment to the Home Affairs  ministry -- formerly Interior -- was criticised by Inkatha  spokesman Ziba Jiyane as "the only substantial ministry we got".  He said Buthelezi "was very hesitant right up to the last  moment", but had told colleagues they could take cabinet  positions if they wanted to.    Buthelezi had argued in Inkatha for an opposition role,  saying the ANC would use the cabinet as a "rubber stamp" for its  own policies, "messing up the country" and then holding everyone  responsible. But the opposite view that it was "important to  have a foothold in decision making on things that affect people  on the ground" prevailed, said Jiyane.    Although the Home Affairs Ministry is regarded as a very  senior portfolio and Buthelezi's appointment is a clear sign  that Mandela intends to continue with his policy of national  reconciliation, ANC insiders insisted the Inkatha chief would  not be allowed to run future elections. Although this function  has traditionally resided within the Interior Ministry, several  senior sources said a permanent independent electoral commission  would be established.    The NP argued strongly for the defence, correctional  services, justice, and police portfolios, saying the appointment  of one or more senior Nats who enjoyed the trust of the security  forces would smooth the transition. But the ANC's top committee  was unwilling to relinquish the ministries, arguing that the  NP's human rights record made it impossible to give them the  justice portfolio.    Similarly, reservations surfaced on the Nats' willingness to  root out the "third force" inside the security forces. "They  want the security forces to know right away who is boss," said  one Nat source.    Added to the equation was the ANC's intention of leaving  General Johan van der Merwe in charge of the police and General  George Meiring at the head of the military for the time being.  They are seen as powerful leadership figures, particularly for  white members of the security forces who need to be led gently  to integration and transformation.    Balance required ANC people to head these ministries as long  as the old guard stayed in uniform, argued the NWC.    While Sydney Mufamadi's appointment to head the law and  order  ministry -- renamed "safety and security" -- was almost  universally welcomed within the SAP [South African Police] and  the ANC, former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- spear of the nation,  ANC military wing] commander Joe Modise's nomination to the  defence portfolio was more controversial.    Senior SANDF [South African National Defense Force] officers  made their preference for Modise clear, but ANC members have  criticised his endorsement of the generals' demands for an end  to defence cuts. He has also not fully lived down criticism of  his failure to prevent human rights abuses in MK camps in Angola  in the 1980s.    But Modise enjoys the loyalty of the MK hierarchy, many of  whom can expect to take senior uniformed and defence ministry  positions in the near future.    His conduct of the integration negotiations and TEC  [Transitional Executive Council] defence subcouncil have been  positively received.    The appointment of Inkatha's Joe Matthews as deputy minister  of safety and security is both a concession to Buthelezi and a  calculated strategy by Mandela, who is keen to show the kwaZulu  Police that their long-term interests are best served by  integration into South Africa's future security establishment.  A former ANC member, Matthews is seen as intelligent and  flexible, and ANC security experts believe it will be possible  to establish a good working relationship with him.    The ANC's insistence on retaining the main security  portfolios -- correctional services ultimately went to Inkatha's  Sipho Mzimela -- cost constitutional affairs expert Kader Asmal  a key position as provincial affairs minister. The portfolio,  vital to shaping the federal relationship between central and  regional government, went to the NP's Roelf Meyer in return for  Nat acquiescence on the security ministries.    The land portfolio was almost lost to the ANC when the NP  insisted on heading the agriculture ministry, which has  traditionally included land matters.    Mandela was reportedly preparing to withdraw his nomination  of Derek Hanekom last Friday when the NWC stepped in. Saying  the ANC was the only party with a coherent policy on land, and  pointing to its central importance for the party's  reconstruction and development programme, several NWC members  insisted on splitting land and agriculture.    Hanekom's nomination to the portfolio was also contentious,  with some arguing that a ministry responsible for the emotive  issues of resettlement, land redistribution and compensation  should go to a black. Former ANC Women's League general  secretary Baleka Kgositsile as mentioned as a possible minister.    Although regarded as a political heavyweight, Kgositsile was  felt to lack experience in land issues. Hanekom, whose  expertise and struggle credentials are unquestioned, was  championed by several NWC members. "Competence won out over  political correctness," said one participant.    Inkatha is understood to have had its eye on at least one  senior security position as well as health and housing. The two  departments are key to improving basic living conditions, and  represent areas in which there is potentially much political hay  to be made in the runup to the 1999 election.    Recognising their importance, Mandela stuck to his original  choices of Joe Slovo for housing and Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma  for Health.</p>

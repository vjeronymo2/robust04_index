			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 10 [dateline as received] (AFP) --  The Brussels branch of the humanitarian organisation Medecins  sans Frontieres (MSF [Doctors Without Borders]) is pulling its  Belgian staff out of Rwanda, an MSF spokesman said here Monday  [11 April].    MSF officials said they were alarmed at a wave of  anti-Belgian sentiment since the little African country started  sliding into civil war last Thursday. Belgium is Rwanda's  former colonial power.    The spokesman said some of the organisation's members were  stranded at Ruhengery in northern Rwanda.    But he added that MSF staff of other nationalities were  heading for Kigali to assist at the town's embattled and  over-crowded hospital, and for a hospital and refugee camps at  the southern town of Butare.    The MSF spokesman said people running the Butare camps and  hospital had abandoned them, leaving more than 150,000 refugees  and about 100 hospital patients without support.    Meanwhile, the European Union said it had granted ECU500,000  (560,000 dollars) in emergency aid for the victims of the civil  war in Rwanda.    A spokesman for the EU's executive European Commission said  the money would help fund the despatch by MSF of a medical team  plus surgical supplies to Kigali.    The Belgian Government on Sunday announced an eight million  franc (332,000 dollars) grant to MSF to fund a plane load of  medical supplies for Kigali.    A European Commission spokesman said most EU officials in  Kigali had been evacuated since a new round of bloodshed started  in Rwanda on Thursday and the two remaining officials were due  to leave later Monday.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MOBIL SHOULD 'STOP USING ACID'  </P> <P> Add one more "expert" to the list of those who are willing to risk 10,000 lives  in a Bhopal-type disaster by permitting the continued use of hydrofluoric acid  at Torrance's Mobil Oil refinery. This time it's a spokesman for the Air  Quality Management District's task force on the use of the acid, which is  satisfied with palliatives served up as adequate safety measures (Times, Dec.  29).  </P> <P> What the task force did not do is revealing. Quoting the Times article, "But  the task force did not study the potential for human error in causing  industrial accidents, which safety experts say is a leading factor in most  major incidents.  </P> <P> " 'People could be wonderful for a period of time and then do something  stupid,' said David Schwien, an AQMD senior engineering manager working on the  hydrofluoric acid task force. 'We worry about that here constantly. . . . It is  basic to everything we do, but I don't know what to do about it.' "  </P> <P> We're glad to help out with the solution. Stop using the acid. This may sound  flippant but is based on 25 years of experience in reading monthly safety  reports from a multiplant chemical giant. Each accident reported was carefully  analyzed to explain why the accident occurred despite the existence of an  elaborate safety manual. And the accidents ranged from broken bones to deaths  and totally destroyed plants.  </P> <P> Nothing is at stake here but costs for Mobil Oil. Balanced against the  potential for a major loss of life, there is no choice.  </P> <P> BERNIE HOLLANDER  </P> <P> Torrance  </P> <P> Editor's Note: Hollander is a retired chemical engineer.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jan (MENA)--Newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH notes  that Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's remarks regarding the draft  compromise document, which was submitted during the  Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo, and the need to accept this  draft represents a new setback for the peace efforts. The paper  says that the remarks are also bound to torpedo the principle of  dialogue and negotiations that has been pursued by the parties  to the conflict as a way to resolve an issue that has been going  on for years.    In its editorial today, AL-JUMHURIYAH states the belief that  these remarks demonstrate that the Israeli tactics in  negotiating and in dealing with the issues at hand will  negatively affect the other tracks.    The paper goes on to say that the fact that Rabin's  statements were made following the laying of the cornerstones of  20 new West Bank settlements raises questions about Israel's  intentions and Rabin's credibility.    AL-JUMHURIYAH maintains that the policy of playing for time  cannot wipe out the rights of the wronged nations that are  struggling to wrest back their legitimate rights. The paper  concludes its editorial by saying that this policy is a time  bomb that will open wide the door of violence.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Ecu banking 'expanding' THE ECU, basket currency of the European Community, has developed dynamically in the last three years under the EC's drive for monetary and economic integration, a new report says, Reuter reports from Switzerland. Between 1988 and September 1991, Ecu banking grew by around 25 per cent annually, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in its quarterly report. 'Without doubt the accelerated monetary and economic integration in the EC is one of the driving forces of this expansion.' At the end of September, outstanding claims of the banks reporting to the BIS stood at Ecu176bn, against Ecu101bn at the end of 1988. The Ecu is now the fourth most important currency for foreign currency holdings, the BIS said. Although it is still far behind the dollar, it is catching up on the yen and Swiss franc, the report added. The BIS noted the Ecu was gaining in attractiveness as an issuing currency on capital markets. Almost Ecu25bn were taken up through international bond markets in the first nine months of 1991.</p>

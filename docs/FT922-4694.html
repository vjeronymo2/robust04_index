			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hungary approves acquisition by Heinz, Hillsdown HEINZ and Hillsdown, the international food groups, yesterday received approval from the Hungarian government privatisation authority, to acquire Kecskemeti Konzervgyar (Kecskemeti Canning Factory), a Hungarian food processor. The companies, which made the only offer for the group, are taking a 93 per cent stake. The purchase price was not disclosed, but Heinz and Hillsdown have promised to make substantial investments in the group. The Hungarian food processing industry, while seen by investment bankers as possessing great potential because of the country's strong agricultural base, is in crisis following the collapse of the market in the former eastern bloc. Bekescsabai Konzervgyar, one of the largest canning companies, recently went into liquidation.</p>

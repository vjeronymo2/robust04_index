			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Elbit turns in 61% advance ELBIT Computers, an Israeli maker of military and medical computer systems quoted on Nasdaq in the US, yesterday announced a 61 per cent rise in net profits in 1991 to Dollars 35.6m, on sales up 13 per cent to Dollars 410m, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. Elbit, a subsidiary of Elron, a pioneering Israeli high-technology group, said it had bucked a recent declining trend for Israel's big defence-based industries by concentrating on military electronics where markets have held up. It has also begun to reap the full benefits of a move into non-military applications. Some Dollars 8m of the 1991 profit was attributable to the sale of shares in Elscint. Elbit became a majority shareholder in 1989 in Elscint, an Elron stablemate which makes computer-based medical imaging systems. Elscint posted a 27 per cent rise in profits in 1991 to Dollars 17.1m on sales of Dollars 191m.</p>

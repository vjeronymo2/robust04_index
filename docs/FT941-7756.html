			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Buckingham confirms Pounds 10m sale As part of its support plan Buckingham International, the hotels and leisure group, has confirmed the previously announced sale of one of its Portuguese subsidiaries, Morlaix de Portugal Investimentos Hoteleiros e Turisticos, which owns the Holiday Inn hotel in Lisbon. The Es2.5bn (Pounds 9.7m) sale and other asset disposals are part of the plan Buckingham has agreed with its bankers to give a period of stability in which to reduce borrowings by October 31 1994. Part of that plan involves loan stock holders sanctioning the payment of the cash proceeds of the Holiday Inn to the group's bankers, in exchange for first ranking security over a similar asset, the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, Lisbon.</p>

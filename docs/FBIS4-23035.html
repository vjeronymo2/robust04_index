Kokhreidze, V.I. Elisashvili, Plant </F> Biochemistry Institute of Georgian Republic's Academy of  Sciences, Tbilisi; UDC 577.15]    [Abstract] The ability of higher basidial fungi to degrade  all plant biomass biopolymers, including lignin, due to their  broad range of hydrolytic and oxidizing enzymes and mycelium's  capacity to penetrate the substrate make basidiomycetes  promising for bioconversion of plant materials despite their  slow growth. An attempt is made to confirm the possibility of  bioconversion of tea production waste by higher basidiomycetes  in order to obtain a fungal protein and a complex of  lignocellulolytic enzymes. To this end, higher basidial fungi  from the Botanical Institute collection in St. Petersburg and  Plant Biochemistry Institute of Georgian Republic's Academy of  Sciences were examined. Solid phase fermentation (TFF) was  carried out at 27 in 100 ml bulbs containing 4 g (dry  residue) of tea production waste. The experimental procedure is  outlined. The protein concentration in the biomass was measured  by Kjeldahl's method and the laccase activity was determined by  the oxidation of syringaldazine, and the Mn-dependent peroxidase  activity was measured ny the NADN oxidation. The true protein  concentration in the solid phase tea substrate fermentation  products was determined: it exceeded 18% after 2 weeks of  fungal growth in such basidiomycete cultures as Cerrena  unicolor 062, Cerrena maxima 0681,  Coriolus hirsutus IBR-11, and Pleurotus  ostreatus IBK-191. The true protein concentration and the  xylanase and cellulase activity of higher basidiomycetes in  solid phase fermentation of the tea substrate, laccase and  Mn-peroxidase activity of basidiomycetes in solid phase  fermentation, and true protein concentration and fermentation  activity of P. ostreatus IBK-191 as a function of the  nitrogen source in solid phase fermentation are summarized, and  the growth and fermentation activity dynamics of the P.  ostreatus IBK-191 substrate in solid state fermentation are  plotted. The C. unicolor 062 culture displays the  highest cellulase and xylanase activity (158.5 and 114.7  units/g, respectively) while the Coriolus hirsutus  IBR-11 has the highest laccase activity (4.7). P.  ostreatus IBK-191 has the highest Mn-dependent peroxidase  activity (5.5). Substantial differences in the activity dynamics  of the enzymes are discovered. Organic nitrogen sources  stimulate the xylanase and laccase production while  KNO[.sub]3[/] sources stimulate the carboxymethylcellulase  and Mn-dependent peroxidase production by the P.  ostreatus IBK-191 culture. Bioconversion may be used to  produce protein-enriched edible fungus products and plant feed  products as well as a range of lignocellulolytic enzymes.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report Yuriy Golotyuk in the "Nagorno-Karabakh" column: </F> "The Cease-Fire Agreement May Be Signed After All. Everything  Depends on the Azerbaijani Side"]    [Excerpt] As Armenian presidential aide Levon Zarubyan  told SEGODNYA's correspondent yesterday, so far there is still a  hope that the Azerbaijani side within the next few hours or days  will sign an accord for a cease-fire in Karabakh and on military  and technical aspects of disengagement of the warring sides.  Because Russia, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh have actually  signed this document already, the accord will automatically come  into effect. The presidential aide refused to say in how many  days in this event Russian peace-keeping troops will appear in  Karabakh, pointing out that "the document's details are  confidential."    Mr. Zarubyan stated that the proposed option for a Karabakh  settlement "is generally very favorable to Armenia because it  essentially attests to its military victories, whereas for  Azerbaijan it highlights its military failures." The Armenian  presidential aide suggested this was the reason for Azerbaijan's  unwillingness to sign the accord.    Other officials in Yerevan and Stepanakert yesterday  refrained from comment on the results of a Moscow meeting  between the defense department chiefs of Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Nagorno-Karabakh. On his return to Yerevan, Armenian  Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan only stated the following, "God  knows: Whether or not the Azerbaijanis will sign this document  does not depend on us." He also voiced confidence that "the  agreement will still be signed in the very near future." The  diplomatic department is pinning serious hopes on a visit to  Baku by Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian president's special  envoy, for talks on a settlement in Nagorno-Kazabakh. Yerevan  believes that Mr. Kazimirov will possibly manage to sway the  Azerbaijani side. [passage omitted]</p>

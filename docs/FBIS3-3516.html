A group of scientists from Nanjing Shipping Institute and  the  Shanghai Navigation Channel Bureau has drawn this conclusion  after a year's study.    Their study found out that if the channels were properly  dredged, 50,000-ton ships, including fourth-generation container  vessels, could sail into Shanghai port.    By riding the high tide, the scientists said, even  100,000-ton vessels could reach the port.    At present, the water at the river mouth is only seven  meters  deep, which allows ships larger than 10,000 tonnage to enter the  port only by riding the tide, while large container vessels are  completely denied entrance to the port.    This situation is hindering the development of Shanghai,  Nanjing, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Zhangjiagang and other major ports  on the Chang Jiang River, said officials from the Chang Jiang  Navigation Administration.    The officials believe that the result of the study will have  a significant impact on the the development of the Shanghai  Pudong New area, the Three Gorges power plant and even the whole  basin of the Chang Jiang River.    Preparations to clear the channels will start soon by the  Shanghai Navigation Channel Bureau, according to the Ministry of  Communications.</p>

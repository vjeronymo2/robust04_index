			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / BCCI: First American's trustee plan set in motion US banking and law enforcement authorities yesterday set in motion the procedures needed to transfer control of First American Bankshares  - the troubled Washington bank that was secretly controlled by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)  - to an independent government-approved trustee, writes Alan Friedman in New York. Once the trustee is appointed he will work to facilitate the sale of First American. The nominee as trustee is Mr Harry Albright, a former New York State banking superintendent and former special counsel to the late Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller. The Washington bank has been co-operating with the Federal Reserve, the New York district-attorney, the BCCI liquidators and the Justice Department to achieve the trustee plan in order to sever all ownership links between BCCI and First American. To approve the trusteeship plan, First American has called a special shareholders' meeting of Credit and Commerce American Holdings NV (CCAH), the offshore vehicle controlling First American and featuring several nominees described by the Fed last year as 'front men' for BCCI. Among the BCCI figures being called to the meeting, to be held on May 12 in Curacao, is Sheikh Kemal Adham, a key shareholder and the US-trained former head of Saudi Arabia's intelligence agency. Mr Albright will be named as the sole trustee  - enabled by a court order to exercise the powers of an owner of all the shares of First American  - once the plan is approved by CCAH shareholders.</p>

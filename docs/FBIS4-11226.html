			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Zamora] </F>   [Excerpts] The Chilean Commission for Nuclear Energy  (CCHEN] is undergoing a dynamic modernization process, which  will facilitate support for the productive sector by improving  its international competitiveness. The CCHEN will this Friday  enthusiastically celebrate its 30th birthday under such positive  circumstances.    Engineer German Piderit, the dynamic CCHEN president, told  LA  TERCERA that "we are optimizing the system, and our immediate  goals aim at improving public service, a task that we will  efficiently perform."    Summarizing the three decades during which Chile has been  using nuclear energy, Piderit emphasized the development of a  series of complex techniques related to the manipulation of  nuclear fuel and the fuel cycle. "The fact that we can have and  use this technology at a national level has allowed us to  develop areas that are important for the rest of the country's  productive system," he explained.    He was also pleased to refer to an agreement that CCHEN  signed with authorities of the Second Region last week, "based  on our policy of support for the sector that produces services  and for socioeconomic development." This type of agreement will  undoubtedly be signed with other regions, too. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Reactors </H5>   Chile has no nuclear power plants, but research reactors,  Piderit explained. "It is worth noting the size of those  reactors, as there is no comparison whatsoever -- as far as  power, size, and the possibility of accidents are concerned --  between research reactors and a nuclear power plant." (There  are two nuclear reactors in our country: one in La Reina, and  the other in Lo Aguirre, near the Lo Prado tunnel).    Piderit added: "One of them has reached its critical point  with 5 megawatts, while the other operates at 2 megawatts. The  smallest nuclear power plant in existence operates at more than  300 megawatts."    He noted that "as far as their operation or the possibility  of any accidents are concerned, our reactors are practically  harmless." The research reactors benefit the industrial, food,  and medicine sectors.  <H5>  Medicine and Food </H5>   Surgical and medical equipment, hypodermic syringes, gloves,  and other elements have for several years been sterilized  through gamma radiation at the Lo Aguirre plant.    In the specific nuclear medicine area, the CCHEN is now  supplying "around 90 percent of the radioisotopes and  radioactive medicines that are needed in Chile." [passage  omitted]</p>

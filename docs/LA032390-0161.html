			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HER EXPERIENCE WITH A STEPMOTHER IS NOTHING LIKE CINDERELLA'S  </P> <P> Not all stepfamilies have to struggle as they work toward love and unity. My  own experience was happy from the beginning.  </P> <P> I'm sure that my natural mother loved me, and I her, even though I don't  remember her very well. I was 8 and my sister 12 when our mother died.  </P> <P> But we didn't have the mother-daughter closeness apparent in some families. I  don't remember listening to bedtime stories while being tucked gently beneath  the covers or while cuddling on her lap, her cool hands stroking my hair.  </P> <P> When my father announced his plans to remarry a number of months later, I was  surprised but not unhappy.  </P> <P> I still remember where we were and where we had eaten dinner, how the  gold-flecked diamonds on the seats of my dad's truck felt under my hand as he  told us.  </P> <P> Not having spent much time with my natural mother, I was ready to welcome a new  mother who would be home when I went to bed at night and got up in the morning.  </P> <P> I don't remember too much from the first few months in our revised family. Some  things do stand out -- getting over the awkwardness of calling a new woman  "Mom," the Madame Alexander doll with her yellow dotted dress she brought me,  and adjusting to a new schedule that, for the first time, included regular  bedtime hours and church.  </P> <P> And all the new rules!  </P> <P> Having been used to spending a lot of time on our own, my sister and I weren't  used to someone's telling us what to wear, what we could watch on TV and what  to eat.  </P> <P> No more mornings of Pop Tarts and Cap'n Crunch. We were now awakened to a  mother who served us oatmeal and wheat toast. The days of wearing shorts and  flip-flops to school were definitely over. Mom made me some outfits that I  hated to wear, and I didn't tell her because I didn't want to hurt her  feelings. They were so out of style! Especially the green pantsuit with the  gold trim! Junior high, as we all know, is a place where you have to conform or  die of embarrassment.  </P> <P> All in all, though, changing a few habits and styles wasn't too much to ask of  us, and it didn't take me long to adjust to having a new mother.  </P> <P> I'll never forget the time we were making chocolate chip cookies late one  Saturday morning. In my eagerness to taste the batter, I leaned over just a  little too far and got my hair tangled in the beaters.  </P> <P> She and sister were sure it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. They made  me stand, glaring, for a picture with my gooey hair twisted around the beater.  </P> <P> And the time our dog, Nemo, was killed by a car during a lightning storm. When  I came home from school, Mom pulled me onto her lap to comfort me. I was crying  uncontrollably. She was completely at a loss.  </P> <P> "I'll do anything, anything, if you'll just stop crying," she said.  </P> <P> "Don't . . . ," I sobbed, stuttering, "make me wear . . . that green pantsuit  anymore. . . ."  </P> <P> Poor Nemo was temporarily forgotten. How we laugh about that now!  </P> <P> My sister had a tougher time adjusting than I did, but not really because of  the stepmother situation. It was just that hard time of maturing, leaving  childhood behind for the new challenges of being a teen-ager.  </P> <P> Looking back, not only did we gain a new mother, we also got a new sister  (already married by that time) and lots of other wonderful new relatives.  </P> <P> I cherish this new family situation. It seems foreign to think of my mother and  sister as stepmother and stepsister. They're simply family.  </P> <P> It was wonderful, and still is, to have a mother who cared for me as for her  own. What makes a family, after all, is not merely blood ties.  </P> <P> To me, a real mother is the woman who brings a child up with care, love and  respect -- regardless of whether she brought him or her into the world.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marta Yoldi] </F>   [Text] "The economic situation is chaotic. Honestly, I see  no way out if we continue along this route." Thus did Nicolas  Redondo sum up his view of the current Spanish situation at a  breakfast yesterday with reporters that, though no one referred  to it as such, served as an unofficial farewell by the incumbent  general secretary of the UGT [General Union of Workers].    Redondo asserted that our economy can no longer stand the  thousands of layoffs week after week and the continual job  losses in the small-business sector, "which the media do not  even bother to report, while the government displays inertia and  even appears surprised at what is occurring."    Another remark by the union leader struck a note of despair:  "We know that we cannot be staging general strikes at every  turn, but this situation has to be addressed without delay." To  judge, however, by still another assertion made by Nicolas  Redondo in response to a question concerning the PSV [Basque  Socialist Party], the unions have very little margin left for  maneuver. "Yes, I venture to say that is true. We are paying a  price for having staged a general strike."  <H5>  PSOE's Rightist Tilt </H5>   As usual, the government's current policy rated harsh  comments by the UGT leader, but this time, citing the outcome of  the party's recently concluded 33d congress, he criticized the  PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] directly.    "The party is now tilting toward the right," he said.  Without  voicing judgment of this situation, Redondo nevertheless pointed  out that the party congress served to confirm what was already  known: that the PSOE in its majority supports the government's  policy, and that neolaissez-faire has now asserted itself as a  doctrine among the rank and file of Spanish socialism. His  summation of the PSOE congress was: "Pedro Solbes walked away  with it."    In any case, said Redondo, "I am not going to resign from  the  PSOE. I am still unbelievably credulous, and willing to believe  that something will change." He also expressed his confidence in  the role of the left in general: "There is an official  institutionalized left, and a real left. But with time, I  believe that a coherent left can emerge. Why not?"    Yesterday's meeting with the press also ranged to discussion  of other burning issues, such as the PSV crisis and the  forthcoming UGT congress, at which Nicolas Redondo will be  leaving the position he has occupied as general secretary for  the past 17 years.    In his farewell remarks yesterday, the UGT leader  acknowledged that those "morally" responsible for the PSV's  setback are the union leaders and, of course, the management of  the IGS [expansion unknown]-PSV. "The government is not in any  way responsible," he said, adding, however, that neither had the  government been very helpful.    Nevertheless, Redondo concluded, the cooperativists need not  be overly concerned if the following steps are followed:  presentation of the cooperative's viability plan that is being  worked out by the IGS, to the administrators appointed by the  government; if agreement is reached, granting of a credit line  of 8 billion pesetas guaranteed by the IGS's assets; and lastly,  building of the housing units over a period of four years.  <H5>  The Succession </H5>   His successor clearly will be Candido Mendez. The general  secretary added nothing new to what has already been disclosed  as regards the makeup of the new leadership. Mendez is the  candidate who best meets the requisite conditions for creating a  consensus at the April congress. Redondo asserts that it is for  this reason that he personally selected Mendez. Mendez's plan,  which features the strengthening of the federations within the  organization, "is our plan," and Redondo thinks that it is also  the plan of the other candidate in the running, Manuel Fernandez  "Lito."    Yesterday, Candido Mendez took a giant step toward ensuring  that he will have the backing of the majority at the UGT  congress. Its certainty now appears irreversible. The FSP  [Public Services Federation], the largest of the UGT  federations, announced its preference for Mendez's candidacy  yesterday. The FSP's special congress also decided to support  the continued incumbency of the UGT's present Executive  Committee.</p>

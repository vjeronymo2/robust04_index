			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Villagers wait for the tide to turn / Taking in the view from the Holy Island polling station OUTSIDE HOLY Island's village hall, the sun warmed the picturesque cottages; through a heat haze the castle loomed on its rock and daffodils around the graves beside the ruined Lindisfarne priory bobbed in the spring breeze. Inside the hall retired fisherman Mr Ralph Wilson - presiding officer for the day - surveyed his pile of ham sandwiches and flasks of tea and coffee and daydreamed about how a nip of whisky might relieve the chill of the building, which remained stubbornly cold. Beside him his daughter Morag watched the door. 'Number 51 father' she said, almost before a silverhaired villager crossed the threshold. On an island where most voters have known each other since birth, presentation of a poll card is something of a formality. Holy Island, cut off from the Northumberland coast twice every 24 hours and accessible at low tide across the same strait of water that Saints Aidan and Cuthbert negotiated in the seventh century, is just one example of the challenge of organising polling in Britain's more rural constituencies. The island's village hall, built as a gift in 1931 by Sir Edward de Stein, then owner of the castle, is one of 104 polling stations in the Berwick constituency, the most northerly in England. The presiding officers and poll clerks who run the stations, set up in village halls, schools and even the annexe of the Rose and Crown pub in Alwinton, a Cheviot shepherds' watering hole, are mostly local government officers. But as Holy Island's tides, coupled with the 15-hour polling day, would oblige visiting officials to stay overnight, villagers are entrusted with the task. Berwick is one of more than 30 constituencies nationally where counting will not begin until this morning. Some delay is because of the cost of retaining staff late into the night, others, like Berwick, because of the logistics of collecting ballot boxes from outlying areas. By 11am yesterday, 40 Holy Islanders had voted. About 20 others from the 171 islanders eligible had opted for postal ballots; many were fishermen, away catching prawns and scallops. But Mr Billy Shell, part of a fishing family known to have been on the island for at least 600 years, called in person to vote as his boat was laid up with engine trouble. With him came his 80-year-old father Mr Livingston Shell, a veteran of more general elections than he could remember. By midday the voting rate had settled down to about five an hour; it looked like a long day. Anticipating boredom Morag, a craft shop proprietor, had brought with her a bag of 100 home-made 'willy winkies'  - shell figures sold for 55p each - on which she had to ink in the eyes. Her father stood on the step, having a smoke in the sun. Officially, the causeway could not be safely crossed last night until 11.15pm. But Mr Wilson, drawing on a lifetime's knowledge, knew he could drive the ballot box across, on the start of its journey to the count, a little sooner. 'I'd say I'll get it away at 10.30,' he said. 'The tides are low at the moment.'</p>

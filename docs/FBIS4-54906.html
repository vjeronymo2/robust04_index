			<p>BFN     [Text] Since the situation that would emerge if the  anticipated cabinet changes are approved actually means a new  mandate, we must accomplish within 50 days what we could not do  in 16 months, otherwise we will fail miserably. This position  was defended at a cabinet meeting today by Finance Minister  Stoyan Aleksandrov. He later explained his motives at a news  conference.    According to Stoyan Aleksandrov, if the government succumbs  to trade union and political pressure and adopts a cheap,  populist policy of compensations, a catastrophe will immediately  follow.    At a meeting with Prime Minister Berov Finance Minister,  Aleksandrov said it is not normal to divide the functions of the  Finance Ministry leader's important post.    At the cabinet meeting today, the prime minister asked all  the ministers to present by tomorrow morning at the latest  written opinions on possible measures in their separate  ministries by the end of June.</p>

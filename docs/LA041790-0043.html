			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> MORE THAN A LITTLE OUT OF LINE  </P> <P> Youthful enthusiasm has turned into immaturity during Tustin City Councilman  John Kelly's 3 1/2-year tenure as he and his cohort, Councilman Earl J.  Prescott, have continually disrupted city business. Kelly was defeated in last  week's city election; tonight's meeting is his swan song. But he is not going  quietly, as his astonishing behavior Friday at an anti-abortion demonstration  at a Tustin abortion clinic showed.  </P> <P> Kelly had a right to participate. But like other demonstrators, he was well  aware of the risk of being arrested for his cause. Despite this, he attempted  to interfere with Police Chief Douglas Franks, who was overseeing the arrests  of some of the demonstrators. Kelly actually ordered Franks to stop the  arrests. "You still work for me," Kelly told Franks angrily. "This is  insubordination." Franks correctly exercised his own judgment as the city's  chief law enforcement officer, and Kelly was among the 48 who were arrested for  trespassing.  </P> <P> There is much wrong with Kelly's conduct. First, Chief Franks doesn't work  directly for the councilman but for the city, whose council's majority makes  personnel decisions. Second, Kelly was blatantly attempting to intimidate a new  police chief. Third, it was hardly insubordination to enforce the law as Franks  is sworn to do.  </P> <P> Prescott says he will ask for an investigation by the council and the district  attorney's office into the arrest of Kelly. Both agencies should ignore his  request. If there is any investigation, it ought to be of Kelly's attempt to  interfere with the police chief's performance of his duties. Kelly, after being  defeated for council, told a reporter, "I'm only 28 and I'm white and single.  I've got a life ahead of me." He also said he may run again for public office.  If his behavior on Friday is any indication, he should take the opportunity of  being out of office to do some growing up.  </P></p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Monday Interview: Monetarist with a mission - Patrick Minford, the Liverpool University economist, talks to Peter Marsh Mr Norman Lamont has not had much time for day dreams recently. But in any moments of reflection during the sterling crisis and its aftermath, swimming before the glazed eyes of the UK chancellor may well have appeared the craggy, combative features of Professor Patrick Minford. If Mr Lamont has appeared to be playing a Macbeth-like role, fighting a losing battle against the powerful forces pulling the pound down, then Prof Minford has also played an important part, as the leader of the witches haunting the Scottish regent with warnings of toil and trouble ahead. For the past two years, the vociferous Liverpool University economist has been stirring his cauldron of ideas, cooking up a stream of rebukes and irreverent comments which have conspired to irritate the UK chancellor. Prof Minford was one of the first UK economists to warn of a long recession. And as the best-known member of the so-called Liverpool Six group of monetarist economists, he has not been shy about repeating his view that membership of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism spelt disaster for Britain. Long disregarded by the mainstream in the Conservative party as a heretic, Prof Minford is closely identified with the free-market views of Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, whom he served as an informal economics adviser during the early 1980s. He is dismissive of many of the new generation of Tory leaders, who he reckons have gone soft on public spending and abandoned sound methods of running the economy based on monetary targeting. But with Mr Lamont having been forced to suspend the UK's ERM membership, removing the central plank of his economic strategy, the frequently controversial views of the 49-year-old professor have been given added weight. Sitting in his cluttered office in Liverpool, next to two scruffy suitcases stuffed with economics pamphlets, the professor seems a long way from the hurly-burly of the currency markets and the political maelstrom that has followed the suspension of the pound from the ERM. As befits his academic status, the Professor is keen to expound on a spectrum of issues. He offers outspoken views on on a range of subjects from Victorian workhouses - which he thinks were 'very enlightened for a time' and which could be revived today as part of a plan to cut public spending on welfare - to the populist Sun newspaper, an organ which he admires for its free-market views. Such opinions have given the professor a reputation as a kind of economics rottweiler. However, he has a large fan club, including people on both the right and left of politics. Although the professor - whose thick black-rimmed spectacles and bubbling manner give him the air of a 1960s rocket scientist - has a reputation for irascibility and confesses to a lack of tact, he delivers most of his comments with a smile and no little charm. He even shows a few mild signs of pleasure, welcoming last week's 1 percentage point cut in UK interest rates to 9 per cent. But to speed the UK's recovery from the longest peacetime recession since the 1930s, Prof Minford thinks Mr Lamont could go much further, bringing credit rates down to about 5 per cent and jettisoning any effort to peg the pound to the D-Mark. 'From now on the exchange rate should be viewed simply as a market price - no more important than the price of cocoa. We shouldn't spend any more time worrying about it.' As for his thoughts about Britain's decision nearly two years ago to enter the ERM, no one can complain that the professor has lacked consistency. As early as March 1988, Prof Minford wrote that for the UK to join the ERM would 'expose the economy to great risk' due to a 'too sudden transfer to German monetary conditions . . . and chronic foreign exchange crises requiring interest rate surges'. In terms of forecasts Prof Minford, even though he was no more prescient than most other UK economists in warning of the late 1980s inflationary boom, has judged the length and depth of the current recession much better than most of his colleagues. In May last year, when the Treasury was talking optimistically about growth of around 2.5 per cent for 1992, he said the economy would expand by a meagre 0.1 per cent during that year. That may not have been pessimistic enough. The latest forecasts, outlined last month in a Treasury compilation of private-sector projections, suggest the economy will shrink by about 0.6 per cent this year after a 2.4 per cent drop last year. But the professor was widely considered at the time as a doomsayer. Indeed last summer, Mr Lamont took the opportunity to tell the Liverpool academic so to his face, during a frosty confrontation with Prof Minford in the chancellor's office at the Treasury. That meeting was one of the few occasions in recent years when Prof Minford has had high-level discussions inside the Treasury - an organisation for which he worked for three years in the early 1970s and for which he now has immense scorn for 'making a complete cobblers' of the UK economy since the late 1980s. Yet his real battle is not just with Treasury mandarins, whom he says are too remote from the outside world and are unnecessarily secretive, but the whole of what he dubs Britain's intellectual establishment. By this Prof Minford means people disposed to 'consensus building' and government intervention. He says he has in mind people such as Ms Sarah Hogg (head of the Downing Street policy unit), Mr Howard Davies (director general of the Confederation of British Industry) and Mr Michael Heseltine (the president of the Board of Trade) How did Prof Minford come to dislike the establishment so much? He had a comfortable background (his father was a diplomat and the young Minford went to Winchester College and then Balliol College, Oxford). Perhaps an early hint of rebellion was the 13-year-old Minford's school speech during the 1956 Suez crisis, in which he argued, against the conventional line of the time, that British military intervention was unjustified. 'I was destined to be part of the establishment,' he says. 'Things just didn't turn out this way.' A big factor tipping him away from conventional thinking was his 1970s research in economics. The research was conducted at the Treasury (which he eventually left because he 'got fed up with sitting on committees rather than doing research') and then at a series of academic institutes leading up to Liverpool, where he has been since 1976. His studies led Prof Minford to propose his own brand of economic theory, based on 'rational expectations'. That boils down to saying that everyone involved in economic activity - be they currency dealers, companies or consumers - makes intelligent assumptions on the basis of available information about how factors such as inflation will change in the future, rather than slavishly following trends that are guided simply by what happened in the past. Prof Minford combined this theory with firm views on monitoring the money supply as a way of controlling inflation, in contrast to the then-Keynesian orthodoxy of using fiscal policy to manage demand. Both ideas fitted in with the market-based thinking of Tory leaders including Mrs Thatcher, whom he first got to know at a dinner in 1978, a year before she took over as prime minister. In the aftermath of Mr Lamont's humiliating climb-down over the ERM, he has received no phone calls from the Treasury asking for advice. The mere suggestion seems so incongruous to the Minford mind that it makes him shout with laughter. 'I am not really considered sound. I like the individualistic way of doing things. I like to rock the boat.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1943 Born, Shrewsbury.

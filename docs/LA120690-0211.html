			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY SAID TO BE UP FOR TAX POST;  </P> <P> APPOINTMENTS: PETE WILSON IS CONSIDERING THE STATE SENATOR FOR BOARD OF  EQUALIZATION JOB, GOP SOURCES SAY.  </P> <P> Veteran state Sen. Robert G. Beverly is among a handful of prospective nominees  under consideration by Gov.-elect Pete Wilson for the State Board of  Equalization seat representing Long Beach and southeastern Los Angeles County,  according to several Republican sources.  </P> <P> The seat is expected to become vacant after current board member Paul Carpenter  is sentenced next week for his conviction on felony charges in a federal  anti-corruption case.  </P> <P> Beverly, a Manhattan Beach Republican whose Senate district includes parts of  Long Beach, said: "My quick reaction is that I would be interested (in the  board seat), mostly because it is something different. I've been (in the  Legislature) a long time."  </P> <P> Beverly, who was elected state senator in 1976 after 10 years in the Assembly,  cautioned that he has not spoken to Wilson's transition staff about the  appointment and that he is "not actively seeking" it.  </P> <P> However, Beverly acknowledged that Ernest Dronenburg, a Republican member of  the board, sounded him out recently about his interest in the nomination, which  would require confirmation by both legislative houses.  </P> <P> The Board of Equalization, a five-member panel composed of four members elected  from districts and the state controller, decides tax cases ranging from  individual appeals of income tax bills to multimillion-dollar tax disputes  involving corporations. Board members make $95,052 a year; as a legislator,  Beverly makes $52,500 a year.  </P> <P> The district Carpenter has represented since 1987 encompasses the southern and  central portions of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The Republican sources, who asked not to be identified, said that along with  Beverly, others being considered for the board post are state Sen. Frank Hill  of Whittier; Matthew K. Fong of Hacienda Heights, the defeated GOP candidate  for state controller; former Assemblyman Charles Bader of Pomona, who lost a  bid for a state Senate seat last month, and Oscar Wright, a U.S. Small Business  Administration regional administrator based in San Francisco. All are  Republicans.  </P> <P> Bill Livingstone, Wilson's transition office press secretary, said he could  neither confirm nor deny names under consideration. Livingstone also said  Wilson's attention is focused on selecting people for higher profile positions  -- including the U.S. Senate seat he must give up before his inauguration as  governor next month -- and on putting together a state budget.  </P> <P> Hill said he was not interested in the Board of Equalization seat.  </P> <P> Bader said he is interested in the seat but might not accept it if offered  because of political considerations. "It's an important job. But on the other  hand, party registration would make it difficult for a Republican to get  elected" to the seat in the future.  </P> <P> The district's registered voters are overwhelmingly Democratic.  </P> <P> Fong expressed interest in the slot, saying he wants to sit on the board "to  make California a more hospitable place for business." Fong said he has lobbied  Wilson for the appointment.  </P> <P> Wright could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Even before the recent passage of Proposition 140, which limits legislative  terms, jobs on the Board of Equalization were increasingly attracting the  interest of lawmakers.  </P> <P> While the post does not carry the prestige and public visibility of a  legislative seat, historically it has offered more job security. Once elected  or appointed, incumbents have rarely been defeated.  </P> <P> The most recent example of the security of incumbency was offered by Carpenter,  a former Democratic state senator from Cypress. He easily won reelection in  November to a second four-year term despite being convicted in September in  U.S. District Court on four counts of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy.  </P> <P> Under state law, he must formally forfeit the seat when he is sentenced next  Monday.  </P> <P> Beverly said that if he is named to the post, he would anticipate running for  it in a future election. Despite the Democratic tilt of the district, Beverly  maintained he would have a good chance of holding onto the seat, saying, "It's  not a heavily partisan office."  </P> <P> In the past decade, Beverly's name often has surfaced as a potential  gubernatorial appointee for everything from judgeships to state treasurer. But  in these previous cases, it was widely thought that Beverly enjoyed his Senate  job too much to leave the upper chamber.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Virginia Ellis contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 2  June.    The public debt in government titles totaled $53.6 billion  in  April, representing a 6.1 percent increase compared with March.  The domestic debt represented 9.3 percent of GDP in April,  while it was only 8.7 percent in March. This is due to the  increase in domestic interest rates and to the inflow of foreign  financial investments, which forces the Central Bank to issue  debt titles to prevent an expansion of the monetary base. The  effective interest rate -- the real interest rate plus the  inflation rate -- jumped from 46.42 percent in March to 46.49  percent in April. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in  Portuguese 20 May 94 p 5)    The Market Prices General Index, IGP-M, calculated by the  Getulio Vargas Foundation from 21 April to 20 May, has climbed  to 42.58 percent in May, 1.67 above the former month's  percentage. The Consumer Price Index, IPC, calculated by the  Economic Research Institute Foundation, was 44.66 percent, while  the real value unit variation in May was 44 percent. The  Wholesale Price Index, IPA, increased by 41.34 percent.  Consumer goods prices increased by 38.65 percent. The  Consumers Price Index, IPC, increased by 44.02 percent. The  items whose prices most increased were miscellaneous expenses,  54.01 percent; clothing, 48.94 percent; and transportation,  45.53 percent. The Civil Construction National Index, INCC,  dropped to 45.18 percent. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in  Portuguese 31 May 94 Business and Finance Section p 3)</p>

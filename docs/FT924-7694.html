			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Burton man steps out of the firing line - The Bottom Line The most potent symbol of a new atmosphere at Burton Group's Oxford Circus headquarters must be the decision to remove the bullet-proof glass from the windows of the fourth-floor dining room. Clearly, the board is feeling more secure these days. That feeling was reinforced this week by the fashion retailer's return to profit. While Burton has been struggling to rebuild investor confidence since the departure of former chairman Sir Ralph Halpern, Thursday's results were the first sign that such an effort might be justified, with annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.4m, against a loss of Pounds 13.4m. Yet few investors were looking at the profit line. For a company with almost Pounds 2bn in sales, the figure was largely irrelevant. Instead, they acclaimed Burton's decision to bring its property portfolio costs onto the profit and loss - thus clearing up one of the last big accounting criticisms. They were also pleasantly surprised by the maintained final dividend. 'The sum total encouraged people to believe at last we have a potential recovery story,' said analyst Philip Morris, of Goldman Sachs. The City has had a difficult time forgetting the excesses of the 1980s. The disastrous foray into development and mad whirl of store openings left the group dangerously exposed to economic downturn; the series of 24 carat handshakes - including Pounds 2m for Sir Ralph - are still a sore point; and finally, the drive for profit at the expense of a clear retailing strategy for the 1990s left many doubting the ultimate survival of the group as recently as 13 months ago when it launched a Pounds 161m rights issue. 'The group looked tired and shabby. It lacked investment and focus,' Morris says. Much of that has changed, however, since the arrival in February of American chief executive, John Hoerner. A 33-year veteran of retailing, his straight-talking manner is in direct contrast to the flamboyance of the past. Hoerner knows he has a lot on his plate. In his favour is his track record at one of Burton's most profitable companies, Debenhams, where he turned a loss into a healthy profit. The past year has been one of addressing strategy and tactics. The group is now more sharply focused on target markets in all its chains. Pricing has been a priority with a more disciplined approach to promotions and initial price points. Finally, the simple act of restocking stores - enabling customers to find what they wanted, when they wanted - was a big reason for last year's good performance. Going forward, the group can only benefit from tighter management and clearer focus. Sales are already running about 17 per cent ahead of last year. Although much will depend on the all-important Christmas season, analysts are expecting an eight per cent increase this year. That would still mean a healthy addition to the bottom line for such an operationally-geared company. On the downside, various chains continue to make losses. The most obvious difficulties concern the menswear businesses. While Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins appear to have responded rapidly to the new strategies, the UK menswear market is beset by inertia. That has hampered attempts to improve chains such as Burtons Menswear and Principles. A further negative factor is the sheer number of Burton brands. The task compared with other fashion retailers, such as Next - which has just one to worry about - is vast. It is clear that the struggle is by no means over. Even Hoerner will not hazard a guess about when the company will achieve respectable profits. Nevertheless, those who gambled on last year's rights at 30p have seen shares almost double in 15 months. Although the forecasts for the current year of about Pounds 25m might look expensive on a p/e of about 30 times, 1994 appears to offer real value if the trend continues. On that basis, the board may well have reason to feel secure in the dining room - even without the bullet-proof glass.</p>

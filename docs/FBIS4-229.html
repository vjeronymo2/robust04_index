			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Clive Govender] </F>   [Text] Durban April 6 SAPA -- African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela will meet Natal ANC leaders in Durban  on Wednesday to review the Independent Electoral Commission's  [IEC] contention that elections cannot be held in kwaZulu in the  current political climate. A working committee, comprising  representatives from the IEC and the South African and kwaZulu  governments, concluded on Tuesday that several factors, linked  to the politically charged climate in kwaZulu, would render free  and fair elections improbable.    These included high levels of political intolerance and  intimidation and the fact the kwaZulu civil service and tribal  structures were unable to assist the process for a free and fair  election.    ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Wednesday's meeting with  Mr  Mandela would centre on the IEC announcement, and "give full  consideration to the implication of that announcement and  provide a preliminary response".    "The present climate of violence makes it impossible for  free  and fair elections (in Natal and kwaZulu) but it is too early to  make a decision."    Mr Mamoepa said a full statement will be issued after the  internal meeting.    Meanwhile, IEC Chairman Justice Johan Kriegler said a  decision on whether elections could be postponed in Natal or  not, was a political one, which lay outside of the IEC's ambit  of jurisdiction.    The matter is expected to be high on the agenda of Friday's  summit between F W de Klerk, Nelson Mandela, Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.    Mr Mandela travelled to Durban on Wednesday to address a  youth conference at the University of Durban-Westville, and will  then meet with the leadership of Natal's three ANC regions.    ANC Midlands spokesman Dr Blade Nzimande said the meeting  would focus on elections in Natal and "yesterday's (Tuesday)  development gives it an added significance".    The SA Congress of Trade Unions and the SA Communist Party  will also attend the meeting, which comes amid spiralling  violence in the province.    Since the declaration of the state of emergency last  Thursday, about 100 people have died in political bloodletting  in Natal, and last month's toll reached nearly 300 -- the  highest recorded in several years.</p>

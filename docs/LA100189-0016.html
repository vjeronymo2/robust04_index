			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER, POWER AND DADDIES  </P> <P> FOR ALL THE TREND-SETTING, high-profile employers that call Southern California  home, it's probably the dowdy, old Los Angeles Department of Water and Power  that pays the most attention to the demands that parenthood imposes on its male  workers.  </P> <P> The DWP, which has a work force that is 77% male, partially subsidizes day care  for employees' children at two downtown centers and is building a child-care  center of its own in the San Fernando Valley. A counselor in the department's  employee-assistance program specializes in child-rearing problems. Lunch-hour  seminars for fathers cover such issues as fathering after divorce, discipline  and preparing for the birth of a first child. A "parenting fair" this summer  drew as many men as women to wander amid booths promoting day-care centers,  child safety, referral services and educational toys.  </P> <P> A 1985 survey that indicated that employees' child-care-related difficulties  were costing the DWP $1 million annually in absences, tardiness and wasted time  set the utility on the road to creating programs that would help employees  better balance work and family responsibilities. To the surprise of officials  who thought the work-family conflict was a women's issue, 400 of the 1,000 DWP  employees who take advantage of the programs are men. Because their employer,  and not their wives' employers, offers such assistance, many of the men have  taken over responsibility for arranging their children's day care.  </P> <P> DWP executives figure that the assistance pays for itself, not only by reducing  lost time but by improving worker loyalty as well. "You don't find steam-plant  operators walking down the street," says Beverly King, director of human  resources. "It costs us a lot if we lose someone who's highly skilled because  we weren't responsive to their needs."  </P> <P> White-collar male employees seem more satisfied with the department's efforts  than blue-collar workers, whose schedules, department officials acknowledge,  may prevent them from attending seminars and whose bosses may be less  understanding of men's evolving role in family life.  </P> <P> Still, compared to most jobs, "men here probably get more support," says Rona  Cohen, a nurse who provides counseling and leads parenting groups at the  utility. "It's a process," she says. "It takes time." JIM SCHACHTER  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Ivan </F> Rejecky; place and date not given: "We Need Cooperation With the  Czech Republic!"]    [Text] No sooner was Jozef Moravcik named prime  minister of the Slovak Republic [SR] than the newly established  opposition began to come out with all kinds of rumors about his  party past. However, the former dean of the Komensky University  Law School and later minister of foreign affairs in Meciar's  government is a level-headed person and untruths, as is evident,  do not upset him.    [Rajecky] Mr. Prime Minister, although only a few weeks have  gone by since you assumed your position as prime minister, can  you tell us how you would evaluate the activity of the present  government thus far, and what are, in your opinion, its greatest  difficulties?    [Moravcik] Little more than one month is really a very short  time to evaluate successes and failures. However, we created  such conditions that will enable us to be successful and realize  our announced governmental program. As an example, I could  mention our successful negotiations with the IMF. A very  favorable international climate has been created which the  Slovak government could utilize for Slovakia's benefit. We are  pleased that it is clear from the reaction of many citizens that  at last a calm atmosphere reigns in our country. And what things  did not work out? First of all, so far we have not succeeded in  coming to an agreement on the funding of social programs. We are  now looking for ways to make a correction in the budget, so that  we do not keep increasing the deficit, but at the same time can  free up a sufficient amount of money that would enable us to  save primarily health care and education from collapse.    [Rajecky] The opposition accuses you, among other things,  that by giving too many concessions to the Czech partner you are  ruining everything that the previous government fought for and  gained for Slovakia. According to some, it is even quite  possible that you are endeavoring to restore the federation....    [Moravcik] That is a very fallacious view on the part of the  opposition. As far as relations with the Czech Republic are  concerned, we have ideas on many issues about possible  compromises that could give the impression that we are too  accommodating. But matters must be judged from the viewpoint of  their long-term impact and final results. Therefore, in this  respect I consider the course of action the present government  has taken prudent, consistently ensuring the realization of our  goals. And as to the notion that we are endeavoring to establish  a new federation--I believe that neither side takes the renewal  of the federation into consideration. The creation of some kind  of union would not bring the desired results either. But I would  like to emphasize that I consider that idea an historically  wasted opportunity. When the state was being split up, we could  have, in my opinion, created a union and the disintegration of  the federation did not have to happen.    [Rajecky] At present there is quite a lot of talk about the  unresolved questions of the borders, division of former federal  property, gold, and, most recently, certificates. Don't you  think that some decisions of the Slovak Government, for example,  precisely about certificates, could have an adverse effect on  mutual relations?    [Moravcik] All the difficulties you mentioned have their  specific, individual character. We could divide them into two  groups--problems which remain from the time of the federation,  and those which concern our future relations. I do not think  that it is necessary to give a lot of attention to the first  group. The second group is of more importance to us, especially  as far as the certificates and the customs union are concerned,  where, by the way, very close connections exist, because that  cooperation also has its political aspects, even though the  economic ones are dominant. What is important is that both sides  have a political interest in maintaining mutual cooperation and  mutual linkages minimally at the present level. But I do not  rule out the possibility that we could have a situation where  one side comes to the conclusion that cooperation in its present  form is not to its advantage. Then we would have to look for  other solutions. But I would not consider it a tragedy in any  case, and for less a possibility that it would lead to a  worsening of our mutual relations.    [Rajecky] There is a lot of work to do, and you do not have  much time in which to realize your goals. Nevertheless--are you  not planning a meeting with your Czech counterpart, Vaclav  Klaus, in the near future?    [Moravcik] It is incumbent on politicians to meet with their  foreign partners whenever it is useful. But I have to say that a  meeting with Prime Minister Klaus is not being planned for the  immediate future.    [Rajecky] You are said to be a reasonable, thoughtful, and  hard-working person. Are you not upset, therefore, by some of  the accusations leveled at you, for example, that while prime  minister you became chairman of a new political party, which  broke the coalition agreements, as the chairman of the Party of  Democratic Left [SDL], Peter Weiss, asserted?    [Moravcik] If criticism is based on truthful arguments, it  cannot upset me. But I admit that not even unsubstantiated  criticism upsets me, although in Slovakia there is more of it  than of the justified kind. It demonstrates the fact that  political culture here is not always of the optimal level. As  far as my chairmanship of the Slovak Democratic Union [DEUS] is  concerned, Petr Weiss and I have already cleared the entire  matter up between us. He appreciated the fact that it says in  our bylaws that if the chairman of DEUS is named to a government  position his function is perfomed by a statutory deputy.    [Rajecky] The opposition also criticizes you for the fact  that although the main task of your government was to lead the  country to early parliamentary elections, your plans extend well  beyond the pre-election period. Do you expect, then, that your  government will be here even after the fall elections?    [Moravcik] The measures that are adopted always must be of a  long-term character. After all, not even laws are passed for  just six months, but for four years, even decades. From this  viewpoint, it would be very wrong if we were to concentrate only  on the period before the early elections. And as to the duration  of our mandate? That, after all, will not be decided by the  opposition. We have a constitutional mandate and responsibility  for executive power. We are not responsible to the opposition  but to all the citizens of Slovakia.    [Rajecky] Let's go back to the international issues. There  has been a lot of talk lately about the possibility that you  will meet with the Hungarian prime minister, but you are said to  have laid down conditions that are unacceptable to the  Hungarians. At the same time, the solution of the "Hungarian"  issue is vitally important for SR....    [Moravcik] ...both sides insist that they are ready to talk,  but so far a meeting has not taken place. But the truth is that  only an unofficial meeting is under consideration, because  official contacts should always produce some concrete result,  some concrete document. I admit--such is not ready. But in any  case, even an unofficial meeting has its value, because at the  very least it provides opportunity for an exchange views and  mutual consultations. At this time we are interested in an  informal meeting with the Hungarian side.    [Rajecky] Isn't it something of a speculation on your part,  that since there will be elections in Hungary before long, you  would rather wait to negotiate with the new government?    [Moravcik] No, there is no speculation on our part. When it  comes to the solving of serious problems, the question of  elections really stays in the background. Hungary and Slovakia  have formulated the basic features of their foreign policy  concepts, and those do not change.    [Rajecky] In conclusion a question concerning your deputy  prime minister and party colleague, Roman Kovac. The opposition,  specifically the HZDS deputies' club in the SR National Council,  demands his removal. What do you think about the reasons they  give?    [Moravcik] They do not have concrete arguments, they use  only  general accusations. As I know the authors of these slanders,  they are capable of making up most anything."</p>

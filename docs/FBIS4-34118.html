			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 14 Jun (PL) -- Today, official sources  reported that the Chamber of Deputies expressed its support here  for any initiative to lift the U.S. blockade of Cuba.    Referring to relations between Cuba and Washington, the  legislature released a communique on Tuesday stating that  differences "are not solved by unilateral and interventionist  means."    Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Deputy Fernando  Charleston read a statement stressing that the blockade of Cuba  is a violation of essential principles of international law,  especially nonintervention.    Charleston also confirmed that the document issued by the  Chamber of Deputies expresses solidarity with the Cuban people  in defense of their sovereignty and self-determination.    A state's decision to establish commercial ties with another  state, the deputy added, is an expression of its sovereignty and  should not be subordinated to the will of a foreign government.  For Mexico, nonintervention in the domestic affairs of another  nation and respect for ideologies are aspects that should rule  their relations, he said.    Meanwhile, Luis Beauregard, also of the PRI, announced that  the statement approved on Tuesday by the Chamber of Deputies  will be sent to governments friendly with Mexico as well as to  those nations that are currently discussing an end to the  commercial blockade of that island.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Pit stop on the way to the market: Despite this week's coal plan, the UK government remains committed to a free market in energy The fact that it took Mr Michael Heseltine nearly twice as long as he hoped to devise his rescue plan for the pits shows that UK energy policy remains the passion-rousing tangle of competing interests it always was. But does the blandly titled 150-page document The Prospects for Coal, which the UK trade and industry secretary finally came up with on Thursday, point the way to a better energy policy for Britain, or does it merely make the tangle even worse by trying to keep alive struggling coal mines? Historians will probably conclude that the white paper was only a brief hiatus in the drive by successive Conservative governments to transfer the whole energy industry to the private sector - and there let market forces have their way. Anyone tempted to think that the coal crisis might have deflected the government from its free-market objectives need read no further than page three of the white paper. 'Competitive markets provide the best means of ensuring that the nation has access to secure, diverse and sustainable supplies of energy in the forms that people and businesses want, and at competitive prices.' Sure, government has a role to play, but the main one is 'encouraging the development of competition'. There is virtually nothing in Mr Heseltine's plan which interferes with these long-term objectives. British Coal is still to be shrunk to a commercial size and privatised. Two of coal's chief competitors, nuclear power and natural gas, are unaffected. The deregulation of the electricity market is to continue. All that has changed is the timetable: it may now take a few years longer, but the danger of a further political backlash diminishes as the coal industry is whittled down. Coal may have touched the country's heart-strings, but so far as Whitehall is concerned it remains a dirty and costly fuel which has to justify its existence. The lack of radical measures in the white paper may even have surprised some Heseltine-watchers who believed him to belong to the more interventionist wing of the Tory party. But if his proposals really amount only to a pause on the way to the free market, his biggest task remains to convince sceptics that such a market is achievable and makes the best sense for Britain. None of the UK's EC partners has set itself that policy objective; virtually all of them subsidise energy in one way or another. Indeed, Mr Heseltine's proposal in the white paper to set up an Energy Advisory Panel to help the government draw up an annual energy report is a concession to the public's instinctive sense that government needs to keep an overseeing eye on the nation's energy balance. There is also a strong current of opinion which believes that privatising coal in present market conditions would be unfair: it would have to compete against other fuels which are bolstered by monopolies and subsidies. The long time horizons needed to keep pits in business handicap them against fuel, sources such as gas, which can be developed quickly. So if Mr Heseltine's aim of privatising coal is to have any credibility he will have to move on smartly to the next items on his energy free market agenda. The first and most urgent is nuclear power; the white paper promises to accelerate a review of nuclear power which was originally scheduled for next year. This state-owned industry still receives large sums of money levied from energy users to help it pay for the cost of decommissioning retired nuclear plant. And it will continue to receive it for five years more. Although there is a strong case on commercial grounds for cutting nuclear power because of its enormous costs, it enjoys considerable support in government circles because of its long-term potential. Provided the technology can be made sound, it could become the cheapest form of power generation in the next century - and environmentally the cleanest at least in terms of emissions. If Mr Heseltine believes in these long-term benefits he might be forced to conclude from the forthcoming review that the cost of helping nuclear was worth it. This would be ironical given the fate of the pits, but the difference is that Mr Heseltine is no believer in the long-term benefits of coal. The second is the electricity generation industry. The widespread dissatisfaction with the concentration of power in England and Wales in the hands of the two generators, National Power and PowerGen, will have to be addressed before long. It may even be a necessary prelude to privatising British Coal, because investors will be wary of placing their money in the company after seeing from the present crisis just how vulnerable it is to the generators' duopoly. British Coal will need a market that has more than two clients. So far, Mr Heseltine has left the question of whether to call a monopoly investigation to Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator. And he has said he needs more time to decide. If Mr Heseltine wanted to reinforce his belief in a free energy market, he might well feel tempted to call for one himself. There is also a new factor in energy policy which will have a growing influence on the energy balance: the environment. The introduction of a household fuel tax in Mr Norman Lamont's Budget was a brave step given the battle to save coal. But it marks the beginning of what is likely to be a long-term trend to increase fuel taxation and force through greater energy efficiency. Other countries such as Germany and the US have also recently overcome long-term resistance to the idea and proposed similar measures. All this needs to be seen against the background of last year's Rio Earth Summit and the commitments made there by the industrial nations to reduce their carbon emissions. Eventually, this could lead to an internationally agreed carbon tax, though it is not yet clear how this could come about. The environmental factor is likely to give a fresh impetus to government interference in the energy sector. Taxation will have to be slanted to encourage use of the cleanest fuels, regulation will have to be strengthened to cut emissions, and subsidies may even have to be provided to help essential industries clean up their acts. At the moment the most one can realistically look ahead is about five years. By 1998 the UK could have a tiny privatised coal industry producing fewer than 40m tonnes a year (less than half recent levels). Several coal-fired stations would have been closed down, and the remaining ones would be investing heavily in equipment to reduce carbon and sulphur. Alongside these there would be a flourishing new sector of more than a dozen power stations burning natural gas (compared to only two now). The generator duopoly would have been broken up into three, possibly four, companies. Nuclear Electric might have been split into two: one half comprising new, commercially-viable nuclear stations (possibly ripe for privatisation), the other half still in state hands consisting of old, soon-to-be-retired stations with their huge clean-up costs. On the fringes, there would be a growing number of 'green' power sources such as wind and tidal, but their contribution would be symbolic rather than substantial. All this assumes the government makes rapid progress - and even then the state would be involved through nuclear power and its efforts to swing energy in an environmental direction. The banner of free enterprise continues to adorn the government's energy policy, but Mr Heseltine still has a long road to tread.</p>

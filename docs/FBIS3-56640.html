As INTERFAX learned from well-informed sources in Tbilisi, he  criticized the Cabinet on Monday at a session held by the  parliamentary majority behind closed doors. The parliamentary  majority had been formed by Shevardnadze's supporters to ensure  more coordinated backing for his reforms.    Addressing the session, Shevardnadze expressed  dissatisfaction with the work of some ministers, and even raised  the issue of forming a new government.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Norwegian bank sector cuts losses in quarter HAVING reached record levels last year, Norway's troubled bank sector cut its losses by almost half in the first quarter of 1992, AP-DJ reports from Stockholm. According to a survey by the Norwegian banking association, Norway's commercial banks made a combined net loss of NKr889m in the three months, down from a NKr1.67bn loss in the same quarter a year earlier. The improvement stemmed from cost-cutting at the operating level as well as reduced provisions to cover losses on loans and write-downs. Improved interest net income also helped. Operating costs were reduced to NKr2.63bn in the quarter from NKr2.87bn a year earlier, while loan losses by commercial banks shrank to NKr2.07bn from NKr2.54bn. While the loan loss figures represented a 19 per cent reduction, loan losses remained the main obstacle to profitability in the Norwegian bank sector, analysts said. They also warned against placing too much emphasis on first-quarter results.</p>

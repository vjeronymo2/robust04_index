			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Return of CIS buyers sparks tea price rally LONDON TEA prices have hit the highest levels for nearly three years on a combination of increased demand from the former Soviet Union and falling world production because of droughts in India, Africa and Sri Lanka. The devaluation of sterling in September has added to the recent rise. Brokers are 'cautiously optimistic' that the recovery will not collapse as it did in May. 'London prices are very rewarding for producers at the moment,' said one broker this week. The all-tea average this week reached 138.66p a kilogram. The former Soviet Union's imports of tea hit an estimated record 231,000 kg in 1990, according to the International Tea Committee, before falling back to 161,000 kg last year. But the break-up of the Soviet Union last year resulted in an almost complete retreat from the world tea market. Now that there is no longer any significant centralised trade, it is difficult to estimate how much tea is being bought by the independent republics but there is no doubt that, since September, interest from the former Soviet republics has re-emerged world wide. Their interest is very much at the low quality end of the market. 'They used to buy a lot of top quality tea,' said one dealer. 'But now they want value for money.' The renewed offtake comes as the world crop is suffering its worst ever production shortfall - estimated at about 110m kg at the end of September. Poor growing conditions in Sri Lanka and southern India alone are estimated to account for almost 80m kg of the shortfall. Production in the major exporting countries last year totalled about 1.4bn kg. The fall is reflected in the volumes sold at the London tea auction, which so far this year have reached only 506,439 packages (53.5 kg each), compared with 618,634 packages at the same stage of 1991. At the same time consumer stocks are thought to be very low in the UK, partly as a consequence of high interest rates over the past year. According to one broker, stocks in the UK - which is likely this year to regain from the former Soviet Union its position as the world's biggest consumer at about 150m kg - are 15 per cent down from 1991 at 30.7m kg. India's Tea exporters have been urged to seek new markets, rather than place too much reliance on rebuilding sales to the former Soviet Union, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta. The Indian Tea Association believes it could maintain its shipments to the Commonwealth of Independent States, provided there was sufficient government support. But the finance ministry does not agree. The Soviet Union used to import about 230m kg of tea a year, of which India had a share of more than 100m kg, about half its total exports. But both figures fell sharply last year. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has warned the association that it will be a long time before the former Soviet economies recover and that tea exporters should look for alternative markets. But Mr HP Barooah, chairman of the ITA, fears that if India does not stick it out in the Commonwealth of Independent States other exporting countries will capture the market. According to Mr Singh, a domestic market of more than 500m kg a year should have given the Indian industry confidence to explore the more competitive markets, like Europe, the US, west Asia and north Africa. 'Instead, the industry chose the easy path of exporting a disproportionate amount to the former Soviet Union,' he said. Last year, India could export only 22.6m kg of tea to the UK and 2.6m kg to the US. The minister regrets that while world trade in tea has increased to 1,100m kg from 400m kg in the 1950s, India's share has fallen to 20 per cent from 44 per cent, with exports stagnating at about 200m kg.</p>

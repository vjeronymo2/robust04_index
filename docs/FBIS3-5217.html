The  sources reported that the Chinese side, therefore, is very  likely to arrange inter-Korean summit talks in Beijing, adding  that China has secretly pushed ahead with these arrangements.    The sources said that it was part of this plan that Li  Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of the  Communist Party of China, visited Pyongyang on 24 February, met  Kim Il-song, and delivered an invitation to visit China in the  name of Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary and Chinese president.    Meanwhile, a ROK Government source on 5 March reported: "It  seems true that China invited President Kim Il-song to visit  China, but there is no possibility of inter-Korean summit talks  being held in China."    The source added: "We understand that China invited  President Kim Il-song to visit in April. Therefore, the summit  talks are impossible due to the timing. Even if the two  presidents were to visit Beijing at the same time, inter-Korean  summit talks in Beijing would be an awkward arrangement in view  of the nature of the talks."</p>

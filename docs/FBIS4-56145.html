			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 25 May (MTI) -- Economic legislation must  definitely receive emphasis at the outset of the next  parliamentary cycle -- this was the unanimous view shared by the  senior officials of the four parties that scored the best  results in the first round of the general elections.    The roundtable was held at the Budapest University of  Economics and was attended by Imre Szekeres, acting deputy  chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), Gabor Kuncze,  head of the parliamentary group and prime minister candidate of  the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), Prime Minister Peter  Boross of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), and Jozsef  Torgyan, the national chairman of the Independent Smallholders'  Party (FKGP).    With respect to what should be done on the economy,  participants said privatization should be reconsidered, the  privatization techniques modified, and a balanced budget ensured.    As regards the latter, Kuncze was of the opinion that the  new  government will probably have to submit a supplementary budget,  with the idea of reducing government expenditures.    Imre Szekeres said the new cabinet faces "fire  extinguishing"  work in the economic sphere. He said a lot depends on how the  outgoing government deals with handing over the ongoing matters,  and on how in-depth the analyses and information it provides  will be.    In the discussion of economic issues, Boross said economic  growth should definitely receive top priority in the future.    Szekeres voiced the hope that the new government can be  formed by the end of June or the beginning of July.    In detailing the mechanism of political and coalition  coordination, the officials of the individual parties set forth  different views. Peter Boross was of the opinion that a  constant coordination constraint can easily render government  work impossible. On the other hand, the senior MSZP and SZDSZ  politicians considered a coalition agreement to be  indispensable, and for efficient legislative work they stated  that they consider it necessary for the six parliamentary  parties to reach consensus.    Szekeres said the Socialists would like to have a coalition  government. He said that if the MSZP will be in the position to  ask coalition partners to participate in the government, then  the parties it can seriously consider, based on similarity in  principle and policy of the manifestos, are primarily the SZDSZ,  and secondly the Federation of Young Democrats.    The matter of the Hungarian president's authority, and the  identity of the future president, was also discussed at the  roundtable. Irrespective of party standing, the politicians  agreed that the president of the Republic should be a person  above party politics.    Kuncze said the Free Democrats do not wish to alter the  constitutional-law status of the president. However, they wish  to make certain authorities more precise.    Szekeres said it is conceivable that the position of the  president will be strengthened, and added that in this case the  president should be elected by referendum. The representatives  of both the MSZP and the SZDSZ were of the opinion that Arpad  Goncz could serve on as president even after 1995.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Sri Lankans seek to calm economic fears SRI LANKA, which has been thrown into political crisis by the assassination at the weekend of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, will make no immediate changes in economic policy-making, a senior official said yesterday. 'There will be no change in the economic programme,' said the official, a close adviser to the late Mr Premadasa, who was killed by a suicide bomber who plunged into a May Day parade. He said the ruling UNP party had sufficient votes in parliament to ensure the election of its presidential candidate, Mr D B Wijetunge, the prime minister and acting president. The government was yesterday trying to ensure calm in the country, especially in the capital, Colombo, where Mr Premadasa's public funeral on Thursday is expected to attract large crowds. So far, no violent incidents have been reported and a curfew imposed after the killing on Saturday was lifted within a day. Besides the president, about 20 other people died in the blast in Colombo. It was the second political murder in just over a week, following the shooting of a senior opposition leader. Businessmen said yesterday the assassinations could create uncertainty about the country's economic future. Shares fell by about 1 per cent on the Colombo Stock Exchange in busy but calm trading. Mr Stanley Jayawardena, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities watchdog, and a leading businessman, said: 'The uncertainty could have an effect on business. Foreign investors who are not too far down the track with an investment may decide to wait.' Mr Premadasa was widely praised in the business community for his economic policies, including one of Asia's fastest privatisation programmes and most extensive deregulation campaigns.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miroslav Pisarevic] </F>   [Excerpts] The 12th Congress of the Association of  Independent Trade Unions of Yugoslavia has begun in Novi Sad.  The motto of the congress is work, income, and social security.  In addition to 200 delegates and some 50 domestic and foreign  guests, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia President Zoran Lilic  also participated in the morning session. Miroslav Pisarevic  reports:    [Begin recording] [Pisarevic] The congress began with the  strains of The International and was opened by Grozdana  Miljanovic, president of the 2-million-member organization. She  stressed that the federal trade union had -- in the period  between two congresses -- focused on the needs of the working  masses and their families. The trade union has supported the  program of the country's economic revival, said Miljanovic.  [passage omitted]    The congress was also addressed by Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia President Zoran Lilic. He stressed that the congress  is taking place at a time when our country is exposed to strong  pressure, blackmail from abroad, and the economic blockade.    [Lilic] We have been punished by a complete blockade and an  attempt at absolute international isolation because we have  chosen negotiations as a way out of the crisis in the former  Yugoslavia, because we have chosen a political solution and  peace, rather than the way of terror and violence. A way which,  unfortunately, has in many ways been paved by the international  community itself, with its diffidence and inclination toward the  extortionist demands of the Muslim fundamentalists. The  unjustified and inhuman sanctions -- which, alas, we must always  mention, and this gathering here today is no exception -- such  as have never been implemented against a single country in the  international community, have been imposed against the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia based on false accusations. Today, many  former politicians that directly participated in the breaking up  of Yugoslavia openly admit this and justify it by saying that it  was carried out under pressure and without an objective  assessment of the realistic situation in the former Yugoslavia.    [Pisarevic] The economic situation in the country was  particularly difficult toward the end of last year. However, we  soon successfully started implementing the new economic program,  President Lilic said, and added.    [Lilic] I would venture to say that the program, which was  already discussed here a short while ago, is proof of our  strength, our perseverance, and our vitality. A growing number  of countries throughout the world are showing interest in the  Yugoslav program and the results that have been achieved so far.  The people that imposed the sanctions expected a breakdown of  the political, economic, cultural, scientific, and all other  life in Yugoslavia. To put it succinctly, they expected complete  capitulation. Instead, something unprecedented in economic  theory has happened. In place of the desired chaos, we have  attained a firm dinar, eliminated the hyperinflation, pared the  money emission down to realistic [word indistinct], and  stabilized the prices and the realistic exchange rate of the  dinar. The Yugoslav dinar on the world exchanges -- and I  especially want to stress this here today -- is a language that  the Western world, particularly the Western business community  on which the world rests, understands very well.    [Pisarevic] We are glad that we can defend the sovereignty  and integrity of Yugoslavia with a strong dinar, stressed Lilic,  and added.    [Lilic] The most important thing for our economic and every  other form of prosperity is to turn our attention to work and  knowledge and first search here for solutions to our problems.  That is why the implementation of the program is our collective  work and mutual responsibility. More order and more work in our  economy, in these complex circumstances, and the mobilization of  all forces for reviving the economy, as stipulated by the  program [sentence as heard]. It is only through our work and  knowledge, and the rational and effective use of our own  potential, that we can attain the position that is rightfully  ours among the countries of the world. The basic thing is to  believe in ourselves, to know what we want, and to have the  strength to actually achieve it. [end recording]</p>

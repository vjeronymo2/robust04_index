			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Major's Leadership in Crisis: Soldiers await firm orders AMONG THE battle-scarred foot soldiers in the Tory ranks at Westminster the widespread message for Mr John Major is that they would like the prime minister to tell them more clearly and more often where they are going - and why they are fighting. As for the charges levelled by Mr Norman Lamont, many backbenchers agreed that there was too much short-termism - 'bouncing along from crisis to crisis' - as one put it, but other MPs commented ruefully that they would have welcomed signs of ministers paying closer attention to opinion pollsters. Tories across the party accept that concessions in response to potential Commons rebellions and changes to unpopular policies are a necessary part of governing with a small majority when people generally still do not feel confident about the economy. But there are doubts - most forcefully expressed on the right of the party - about how thoroughly changes are made, and anxiety that sometimes the least objectionable rather than the right solution is found. 'You can trim a bit too far,' said one MP. Backbenchers with little sympathy for Mr Lamont's argument were quick to accuse him of sour grapes, and to suggest that the populist decision that he had primarily in mind was his own dismissal. As for any broader point: 'If he felt like that, why didn't he speak out while he was still in cabinet?' one loyalist asked. MPs seeking to rebut the charge that policies were taken for short-term popularity rather than for the long term, at times seemed spoiled for choice. Rail privatisation, education reform and measures to restore the state of public finances - including the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel - were all cited. Above all, there was the issue that has riven the Tory party for more than a year. One MP said with feeling: 'You can't really accuse a government which put us all through the torture of Maastricht of having its eyes on short-term popularity.' Even those who do not accept Mr Lamont's account of the working of government, believe that there are ways in which Mr Major should improve his performance. One former minister advised him to ignore the newspapers, while several said he should find himself some new advisers and aides. The most serious concern was that the prime minister did not use the opportunity of Wednesday's speech to spell out where the Tory party was heading and did not offer his Commons troops a way forward which they could cheer. A junior minister said: 'He needed to set out a context, a vision. When you talk to him one-to-one you get a clear idea of where he's coming from, but that gets lost when he speaks in the Commons.' Another put it more bluntly: 'He should be more prime ministerial.'</p>

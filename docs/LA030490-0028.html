			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> ROREM: "A QUAKER READER," "VIEWS FROM THE OLDEST HOUSE." Catherine Crozier,  organ.  </P> <P> Delos D/CD 3076(compact disc). These two suites of pictorial miniatures hold a  wide range of colors and impressions, presented in a tonal language both  sophisticated and accessible. "A Quaker Reader," with its evocations of martyrs  and ecstasies, is the more flamboyant, but both offer grateful and  demonstrative work to the performer. Crozier plays them with clarity and  passion, on the Marcussen organ at Wichita State University. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

The deputies discussed how to make coal  industry, state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises, and  light industrial enterprises extricate themselves from their  difficult position.    State Councillor Li Guixian; Wang Senhao, minister of coal  industry; and comrades of relevant departments and committees of  the state attended the meeting.    Deputy Suo Changyou, mayor of Harbin city party committee,  gave a speech on how to accelerate the pace of technological  transformation and revitalize the old industrial base. He said:  The current prominent issue of Harbin city which is an old  industrial base is the issue of state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises. At present, about 85 percent of  state-owned enterprises in Harbin have historical burdens; their  debt rate is high; their funds are seriously in short supply;  the increase in fixed assets is insufficient; the reserve of  fixed assets is not in flexible use; technological  transformation projects are few in number; and technical  installation is far below the national average.    These reasons have kept the economy of Harbin, and even  Heilongjiang, tagnant. He proposed that the state set aside a  certain amount of money from the increased portion of the  financial revenue it has gained after abolishing tax reduction  and exemption for the old industrial base of Harbin so that it  can use this special fund for a special purpose, and increase  loans for technological transformation. He also urged the state  to give priority to supporting state-owned large and  medium-sized key enterprises, help them raise funds through  reform of the shareholding system, relatively increase Harbin's  open collection of shareholders from society and the amount of  shares listed.    Deputy (Gu Shouxian), director of Jixi Coal Mining  Administration, offered some ideas and suggestions for solving  some major issues of coal enterprises across the province, which  must not be neglected. He said: At present, Heilongjiang's  coal enterprises are in a difficult position of maintaining  normal safety, production, and operation. The state should  strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over the coal  market, improve the transport capacity, increase the number of  railway carriages, urge the users to settle and directly pay the  railway transportation payment, arrange the market in a unified  manner, forbid coal in Shanhaiguan to be delivered to northeast  China, delegate coal export power to Heilongjiang, support coal  mining areas to develop tertiary industry, readjust their  contracting work index, and solve their historical burdens and  the badly needed circulation funds.    Deputy (Chang Baoshi), a worker technician of (Faan)  Machinery Plant in Qiqihar, introduced the difficulties of light  industrial enterprises. He proposed that the state help them  extricate themselves from their predicament as quickly as  possible.    Deputy Ni Zhirong, chairman of the provincial Trade Union  Council, gave a speech on strengthening democratic management  among workers; and Deputy Yang Guojun, mayor of Mudanjiang city,  also gave a speech on the suggestions and demands of  invigorating state-owned, large and medium-sized industrial  enterpirses.    After listening to the suggestions, State Councillor Li  Guixian, said: The state should help Qiqihar's (Faan) Machinery  Plant solve difficulties. This is not a minor matter. The raw  material products turned out by Heilongjiang have been suffering  money losses during transactions. These industries are the  economic pillars of Heilongjiang. They are also of great  signifiance to the state. At present, the distortion of prices  of these raw material products has greatly affected not only  Heilongjiang's economic development but also the national  economy of China. Regarding enterprises of the war industy, the  state is actively doing what it can to help this industry rid  itself of difficulties.    After that, Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry, said:  Heilongjiang is the state's important coal producing base. At  present, it has reached a situation in which its difficulties  must be resolved. As a minister, I feel very unhappy. This  year, the central authorities are concentrating efforts on  solving the default of payment for workers, and will invest 2  billion yuan in coal industry and use 500 million yuan to help  coal mines develop tertiary industry. I believe the prospects  for the coal industry to be bright.</p>

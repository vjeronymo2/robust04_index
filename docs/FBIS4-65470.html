			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Vayrynen: `No, I Am Not </F> Leading Opposition to EU'"]    [Excerpt] Eduskunta Member Paavo Vayrynen (Center Party)  does not feel that he assumed leadership of the European Union's  [EU] opponents during his speech at the party delegation meeting  in Tornio last Sunday [24 April], as the party organ ILKKA  claimed on Monday that he had.    "That criticism is completely wrong in that I do not oppose  EU membership in principle. And I do not feel that I oppose it  at all," Vayrynen says.    He also denies that a power struggle is going in the Center  Party between him and the party's chairman, Prime Minister Esko  Aho.    "I am not competing with Esko Aho in any way at all, of  course. He is party chairman; I am not, and I am not trying to  be. I am a member of the Eduskunta from Uusimaa Province, and he  is from Vaasa Province. No power struggle between us is even in  sight. It's just that we have disagreed on certain issues. And  at least to some extent, those differences of opinion show up on  the issue of EU membership."  <H5>  Impossible Subsidy Package </H5>   Vayrynen is therefore denying that he opposes the EU, but he  reiterates that he is very skeptical about whether it is  sensible to join on the terms that exist and according to the  timetable currently in effect.    "But I have not yet decided what I will do if it turns out  that membership cannot be postponed."    Vayrynen's proposal that the matter be postponed has been  met  generally with the comment that no such alternative exists.    "Assuming that the agreement as it now stands is rejected in  one way or another, will its supporters then feel that the issue  is settled, or will they propose new negotiations the very next  day as a way of making membership possible? As a rule, the  latter is what happens. And that, too, would result in a  postponement," Vayrynen replies.    So if the possibility of postponement exists for the  supporters, then that same possibility also exists according to  Vayrynen's model, he says.    Vayrynen's criticism of the EU agreement is based on the  fact  that we will have to follow a very short timetable in  introducing unrestricted free trade in the food economy without  any corresponding move by the EU to even out the differences  arising from the fact that we have a cold climate, a short  growing season, and other natural conditions. On the contrary,  the EU has arrangements favoring those countries enjoying the  best conditions for production.    "And when I have tried to get it clear in my mind how the  Finnish farmer and food industry will be able to compete under  such conditions, frightening prospects open up."    He points out that there is sizable overproduction in the EU  and that the GATT agreement requires that the EU reduce its  agricultural exports considerably. The big producing countries  expect to partially compensate for that by conquering new  markets in the new member countries.    The fact that Finland is being given the right to use its  own  money to subsidize agriculture does not make things any better.    "Finnish taxpayers would then be forced to compensate not  only for the disadvantages due to climate but also for the  distortion caused by the fact that the EU's common measures will  compel it to subsidize production in the strong producing areas.    ``My opinion is that we will be incapable of paying enough  in  subsidies to support our own agriculture and food industry.''  <H5>  Not Worn Out </H5>   Following the presidential election, in which he was  defeated  in the first round, Paavo Vayrynen has not had any major  political responsibilities. At one point he seemed to be  thinking of challenging Esko Aho in the election for party  chairman at this summer's party congress. Above all, he wanted  to be chairman of the party's Eduskunta group. All of this has  been viewed as part of a power struggle between Vayrynen and Aho.    He claims, however, that he did not consider running for  party chairman.    "But I did think about the matter after being questioned  about it," he admits.    Vayrynen sees nothing strange about the fact that he did not  inform Aho of his ambition to become group chairman.    "Questions of that kind are discussed with the chairman of  the Eduskunta group because what they involve is an election  within the group. And it has not been the custom to discuss them  beforehand with the party chairman," he says.    "As far as I am concerned, there would have been no reason  not to discuss the matter with Aho as well if the opportunity  had arisen. I don't know why (group chairman) Kalevi Mattila did  not take the matter up with Aho."    Nor does Vayrynen share Aho's view that he should not have  given up the post of minister of foreign affairs a year ago.    "In view of the conditions existing at the time, that was  the  only possible solution. I knew from personal experience what it  was like to be a potential candidate for president. It was very  difficult to work in the government, and I wanted to be able to  pursue my election campaign very freely. From the standpoint of  the campaign, it was a good solution.    ``On the other hand, one can speculate as to how the EU  negotiations would have turned out if I had been involved in  them. My position now is that we should have continued the  negotiations. We should have stuck to our principal negotiating  objectives and not have signed an agreement on these terms.''    Vayrynen does not yet see himself as a worn-out pensioner.    "You would think that in a party as big as this one, there  would be something for me to do -- something that I would also  consider meaningful."    The general opinion is that Aho has now won a decisive  victory in the struggle between him and Vayrynen. Vayrynen does  not share that view. He admits, however, that there have been  problems in his relations with party chairman Esko Aho.    "I don't see it as being a matter of a power struggle. Aho  is  indisputably party chairman. I am not thinking of challenging  him, nor do I see anyone else in the running to become party  chairman." [passage omitted]</p>

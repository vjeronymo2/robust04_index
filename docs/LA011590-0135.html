			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FIFA WON'T PUNISH SOCCER STAR  </P> <P> Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona will not be punished by the International  Soccer Federation for his allegations that last month's World Cup draw was  fixed.  </P> <P> Guido Tognoni, a spokesman for the federation known as FIFA, said the $7,700  fine imposed by the Italian soccer league was sufficient and, as far as his  organization is concerned, the matter is closed.  </P> <P> The Italian league's disciplinary commission Friday announced the fine against  the captain of Argentina's national team and the Naples team, which leads the  Italian league. The tribunal, which had jurisdiction because Maradona plays for  an Italian team, said he had ridiculed the Italian organizers of the World Cup  by claiming the pairings of the six groups had been decided prior to the  official draw in Rome on Dec. 9.  </P> <P> FIFA had originally threatened to ban Maradona from the World Cup finals if he  repeated the allegations.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations, February 15 (TASS) -- "The NATO  Council has not been empowered to adopt decisions on the essence  of the Bosnian settlement, including the decision to deal air  strikes in Bosnia. Such decisions must be adopted by the U.N.  Security Council," says a statement by the Russian Foreign  Ministry, circulated here as a document of the Security Council  on Monday [14 February].    "The NATO Council has adopted a statement on the Bosnian  crisis problem. The council has urged all the sides involved  --the Serbs and the Moslems -- to urgently place all their heavy  armaments in Sarajevo district under U.N. control and to  withdraw them from the city. This, in fact, is close to our  stand. Russia has repeatedly advanced the initiative to  urgently demilitarise Sarajevo and place the city under U.N.  administrative control. We regard such measures as the most  important step leading to the settlement of the Bosnian conflict  as a whole. We are also pleased that the NATO Council, just as  Russia, has confirmed its support to the idea of settling the  conflict in Bosnia through negotiations. This calls for the  world community's vigorous pressure on all the sides involved in  the conflict. Unfortunately, an attempt to interpret this  statement as a unilateral ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, who  are threatened by air strikes, can be traced in the positions of  several NATO members. The Russian Federation cannot agree with  such one-sidedness," the statement points out.    The Russian Foreign Ministry stresses: "We are also sure  that  the Security Council should adopt, as we have proposed two weeks  ago, decisions on the problem of de-blocking Sarajevo.  Unfortunately, Russia's proposal was not accepted. This  problem was at the same time submitted to the NATO council  which, as we know, is not vested with the right to adopt  decisions on the essence of the Bosnian settlement. The U.N.  secretary-general had previously asked NATO to report on the  alliance's readiness to use its Air Force if requested by the  United Nations. A decision on such a request must be adopted by  the secretary-general after consultations with members of the  Security Council. This procedure, established by the Security  Council, must be observed without fail."    The document notes that reports were received a few hours  before the announcement on the NATO decision that the Bosnian  Serbs and the Moslems had reached, with U.N. mediation, an  agreement to cease fire, and had agreed on concrete measures to  withdraw their armaments from Sarajevo. "The hasty decision,  adopted outside the United Nations, may thwart this promising  process. Progress towards a settlement is possible only if  neither side gets advantages in the process of demilitarisation,  effected by U.N. Forces," the document stresses.    The Russian Federation, the statement points out, offers the  U.N. Security Council to urgently consider "practical ways to  demilitarise Sarajevo and establish U.N. administration in it".</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MCCANTS' AGENT FINED $5,000 FOR VIOLATING REGISTRATION LAW  </P> <P> Texas sports agent Lance Luchnick, who represented Alabama linebacker Keith  McCants, pleaded guilty today to a reduced charge of violating Alabama's sports  agent registration law and was fined $5,000.  </P> <P> Mobile County Circuit Judge Braxton Kittrell suspended a six-month jail  sentence for the San Antonio lawyer.  </P> <P> Luchnick pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of trying to violate the  registration law.  </P> <P> In a plea-bargain agreement, Luchnick avoided a felony charge for his  representation of McCants during NFL negotiations after the Mobile native gave  up his senior season at the University of Alabama so he could turn pro. McCants  signed with Tampa Bay.  </P> <P> In Alabama, failure of a sports agent to register with the state is punishable  by a $5,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison. The law was passed by the state  Legislature in hopes of protecting student-athletes from unscrupulous agents.  </P> <P> Luchnick said before the NFL draft that he had not registered with the Alabama  Athlete Agents Regulatory Commission. Pearl Maxwell, a commission spokeswoman,  said Luchnick sent in an application but it was rejected.  </P></p>

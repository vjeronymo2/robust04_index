			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADICALS TEMPT ARGENTINA TO RELY AGAIN ON REPRESSION  </P> <P> Last week Argentines witnessed a strange reprise of the guerrilla violence that  plunged their nation into chaos in the 1970s. The smoke has cleared from the  burning barracks at La Tablada, revealing charred bodies but few answers. Is a  new cycle of violence at hand?  </P> <P> The physical evidence of the Jan. 23-24 assault on the 3rd Infantry Regiment --  Chinese and Soviet arms, the revolutionary screed left behind, the inclusion of  women in their ranks -- indicated that the attackers were left-wing radicals.  Later they were identified as members of the Movement of All for the Fatherland  -- a group that had been unheard of until early last month, when it accused  Peronist presidential candidate Carlos Menem of ties with right-wing,  coup-mongering Army officers. Some of the dead assailants also were linked to  the Revolutionary Army of the People -- a Trotskyite group that was largely  wiped out in the 1970s by security forces after it tried to take over Tucuman  province in northwest Argentina. Yet the political parties most closely linked  to the 1970s terrorists have denied any link to the attack.  </P> <P> The most important questions remain unanswered: Do other cadres lie in wait?  Who are they? What do they want? What will they do to get it? Will more attacks  follow? When?  </P> <P> Whatever the answers turn out to be, a few clear winners emerged from the  bloody events that took 38 lives at La Tablada. The army showed that it could  overwhelm an insurgent force (admittedly some hours after the insurgents  overwhelmed a regiment). Cassandras of the right were vindicated for their  ceaseless warnings in recent years of a "subversive resurgence." And urban  guerrillas put themselves back onto the political map.  </P> <P> The greatest victor was extremism itself. The political views of the attackers  matter less than their decision to press those views through violence. Violence  knows no creed, and its use on one side encourages it on the other.  </P> <P> Like a trauma victim after years of recovery, Argentina has had a flashback to  the confusion and out-of-the-blue bloodletting that brought the country to its  knees not so long ago. The greatest danger is that the country will return  reflexively to the same response: lawless repression under the watchless eyes  of a frightened public.  </P> <P> Memories are too fresh and democratic sentiment too strong to permit one  isolated incident, however grave, to drive Argentina back to the policies that  characterized its last struggle against subversion -- torture, murder,  "disappearance," suspension of civil rights. But terrorism is a powerful  solvent of constitutional scruples. If more deadly attacks follow, the pressure  for vigilante responses will grow.  </P> <P> President Raul Alfonsin has attempted to head off these dangers by responding  forcefully to the crisis at hand, but insisting that the response be carried  out within the rule of law. He submitted the 14 surrendering attackers to  civilian justice while establishing a national security council to develop  policies and coordinate actions against subversive activities. "Make no  mistake," he told the nation, "our constant testament for the rights of man  does not constitute weakness in the face of armed subversion."  </P> <P> Brave words aside, the incident remains profoundly troubling. It raises the  ghosts of a decade that still wounds the national soul, a decade in which  Argentina gave the word desaparecido (disappeared one) to the world and brought  itself great international shame. Although the subversive movement in Argentina  was annihilated more than 10 years ago, no one can deny that the depressed  socioeconomic conditions in Latin America today could support a terrorist  resurgence. Peru and Colombia have been in the grips of terrorism for a decade,  with no relief in sight.  </P> <P> Many Latin governments have been struggling to make democracy work -- restoring  political and civil rights, reopening courts and legislatures, peacefully  handing over power to political opponents. Wracked by debt and recession,  though, democratic governments have been unable to show their people a better  life. A return to political violence would only worsen the region's economic  plight.  </P> <P> There is a new breeze blowing in Latin America, a chill wind of despair -- of  stagnant economies, inept politicians and recurrent violence. It is a breeze  that, if it continues to blow, may snuff out Latin American hopes for a better  tomorrow.  </P></p>

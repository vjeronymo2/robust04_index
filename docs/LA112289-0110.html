			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> GOING FOR GOLD AS AN INVESTMENT  </P> <P> Question: In 1982, I bought gold South African Krugerrands for $444 each. In  1988 I started selling them, piece by piece, and received $397 to $415 each,  even though the gold Maple Leaf and other gold coins were going for more than  $470. I was told by Deak International that the low price of the Krugerrands  was because of our boycott against South Africa.  </P> <P> Since gold is gold, regardless of what country the gold comes from, please tell  me if I'm getting ripped off. -- M.D.  </P> <P> Answer: Gold is gold, sure enough, but price is still the measure of the  equation between demand and supply. And the demand for Krugerrands "has just  not been there for several years," according to Karen Jennings, manager here  for Deak International Ltd.  </P> <P> Despite constant arguments that gold is "just another metal," the metal has had  a hypnotic appeal since the Egyptians discovered it about 4000 BC, and for  centuries it was the world's "ultimate store of value" and was the backing for  almost all currencies. Even now, gold is generally regarded as one of the more  reliable hedges against inflation -- which is why the price of the metal soars  during periods of high inflation and drops precipitously during periods of  stable prices.  </P> <P> But holding gold, either as an investment or as an inflation hedge, has always  presented problems. To hold it in "raw" form, as ingots or dust, is unwieldy  because it has to be assayed every time you try to sell it. A much better  solution: Hold it in the form of established coinage, where the gold content is  clearly a matter of record.  </P> <P> For years, then, investors (as distinguished from numismatists, who collect  coins for their historic value and their visual condition) concentrated  principally on two widely circulated international coins -- the Mexican 50 Peso  Centenario and the Austrian 100 Corona. A third coin, the Hungarian 100 Korona,  had a limited circulation for reasons that are comparable to the Krugerrand's  woes -- investors disliked benefiting Hungary's Communist government.  </P> <P> All three coins, though, had one cumbersome feature -- the offbeat weight of  the coins, which made it difficult to determine their current market value.  Both the Corona and the Korona are .98 Troy ounce and the Centenario is 1.2  Troy ounces.  </P> <P> When South Africa, which sits on most of the world's known supply of unmined  gold, decided in the 1960s to create the Krugerrand, leave it undenominated,  but peg it at exactly 1.00 Troy ounce, it was an instant hit because of its  convenience. If you had 100 Krugerrands you had exactly 100 ounces of gold, and  all you had to do was look up the "spot" price of gold on any given day and  you'd know exactly what your holdings were worth.  </P> <P> "But, because of their convenience," Jennings adds, "coins traditionally sell  at a slight premium."  </P> <P> On the day we discussed this, the "spot" price for gold was $367 an ounce and  Deak was buying the Canadian Maple Leaf (also 1.00 Troy ounce) for $372 -- a  $5-an-ounce premium -- but was buying the Krugerrand for $357, a $10-an-ounce  discount.  </P> <P> "But the 'spot' price," she says, "isn't actually the price of an ounce of gold  that's been melted down, as you might think, but is simply the market  determination of gold's value on that day."  </P> <P> Because of the Krugerrand's additional convenience of being exactly 1.00 Troy  ounce, "it was tremendously popular for several years."  </P> <P> But then apartheid and its ugliness flared up, the violence accelerated, and  the world's growing disillusionment with South Africa's unyielding position on  racial relations began sharply eroding the Krugerrand's appeal.  </P> <P> "When the Canadians came out with the gold Maple Leaf in the mid, or late,  '70s," Jennings adds, "it was beautiful timing. Investors really wanted a  one-ounce gold coin, and for several years Canada practically had a corner on  the market."  </P> <P> Then Uncle Sam took the hint and came out with the one-ounce Eagle in 1986. "A  lot of the bigger dealers today," she says, "and we're one of them, won't even  sell the Krugerrand, and we buy them back only because so many of our customers  originally bought them from us. We feel obligated."  </P></p>

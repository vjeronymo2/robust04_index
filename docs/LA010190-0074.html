			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DOZEN WHO SHAPED THE 80S  </P> <P> California's image as a pacesetter held up fairly well in the 1980s in the  world of business and economics. Californians were a force for dramatic change.  </P> <P> Some achieved change on a grand scale -- inspiring a revolution in economic  policy or transforming corporate finance. Some of the change may seem minor,  but it altered our daily routines and our life styles. Some business people  built firms that are monuments to America's spirit of enterprise; others  brought companies to ruin and became symbols of corporate recklessness.  </P> <P> Here is a sampling of California residents who gave American business a 1980s  makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOL PRICE  </P> <P> Back in 1976, San Diego retail executive Sol Price opened a bare-bones,  cash-and-carry store in an aircraft-hangar-sized building in an industrial  section of his hometown. It marked the birth of a store, as well as the birth  of an idea -- warehouse membership outlets that cater to small-business owners  and consumers who want rock-bottom prices.  </P> <P> By the early 1980s, that idea was transformed into a booming industry. But even  as a flock of copycat companies opened similar stores, the Price Club chain  remained a leader.  </P> <P> Price, now in his early 70s and no longer running the company, was the first to  recognize that "a real basic need of small-business customers was not being  met," said Sarah Stack, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> And, she added, "He saw that consumers were able to forgo some creature  comforts to get the best price possible."  </P> <P> Price also was early to recognize, among other things, the value of what is  known as vertical integration, Stack said. One example: After the Price Club  started offering optical lenses, it also got into the business of grinding  lenses so that it could offer the product at a lower price.  </P> <P> Thomas H. Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities, said another  important innovation by Price was the introduction of a customer newsletter  about developments at the stores. Such newsletters, he said, now are regarded  "as a vital component of the business." STUART SILVERSTEIN  </P></p>

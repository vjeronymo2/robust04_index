			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Japanese banks on Friday  [15 April] completed swapping 650 billion yen worth of loans to  Brazil for equities to restructure the debt, banking officials  said.    The so-called Brady bonds will be listed in Europe and most  of the banks are expected to sell them immediately, the  officials said.    The officials said the bonds are expected to be sold for a  total of 350 billion yen. This will leave the banks with losses  of 300 billion yen which they expect to liquidate in closing  their midterm books at the end of September.    The plan is part of the Brady initiative launched in 1989 by  former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.    Under the initiative, creditor banks, after discounting  credit, swap loans to Latin American countries for bonds issued  by the debtor nations.    Banks have previously liquidated bad loans to Mexico,  Venezuela and Argentina using a similar method. The Brazilian  scheme wraps up the initiative, the officials said.</p>

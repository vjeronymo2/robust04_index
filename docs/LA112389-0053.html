			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE MAN ACCUSED OF MOLESTING GIRL, 8  </P> <P> Criminal charges were filed Wednesday against a Glendale man accused of  molesting an 8-year-old girl during a break-in at her parents' house last week,  Glendale police said.  </P> <P> The man took the girl from her bed and removed her clothes but fled when she  screamed, Investigator Ron Insalaco said.  </P> <P> The man allegedly burglarized another residence in his apartment building in  the 1900 block of Vassar Avenue and is believed to have molested a woman during  another burglary earlier this month, Insalaco said.  </P> <P> The man told police his name is Ramon Hernandez, Insalaco said.

The man, who has a lengthy criminal record, including two prison  terms, was being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail,  police said.  </P> <P> After his arrest Monday at his apartment, police found $16,000 in cash and a  loaded handgun in his car, Insalaco said.  </P></p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / The Nature of things: Unravelling the prehistoric codes The study of ancient genes, brought to life so spectacularly in the Jurassic Park film, is beginning to transform archaeology. While re-creating a dinosaur will remain a fantasy for the foreseeable future, researchers are already extracting and identifying DNA from materials thousands of years old. The results will contribute a wealth of information about human history over the past 10,000 years in three main areas: people's evolution and migration patterns; their agriculture and diet; and health and sickness in ancient societies. Research findings illustrate the potential of genetic archaeology in each area. Human DNA has been extracted from prehistoric bones found in Polynesia, by Erika Hagelberg of Cambridge University. Comparing the occurrence of one particular genetic mutation among the ancient and modern inhabitants of the region, she concludes that the islands of the central Pacific such as Samoa and Tonga were probably first settled about 2,500 years ago by people moving west from the Melanesian archipelagos; this contradicts the traditional view that Polynesia was colonised directly from south-east Asia. Many of the puzzles surrounding prehistoric migrations and settlement patterns - such as the movement of people north-westward through Europe and southward through America - will be solved by a systematic analysis of ancient DNA from archaeological sites, combined with tests on contemporary populations. Wheat DNA has been isolated from charred grains found at Danebury, an Iron Age British hill fort, by Martin Jones, another Cambridge archaeologist. His group identified part of a gene linked to glutonin, a key protein which helps to determine the bread-making qualities of the grain, and compared it to modern wheat varieties. Such research will provide fascinating information about ancient foods. But tracking the genetic patterns of crop plants and domesticated animals will also be useful for another purpose: to complement the evidence emerging from the human genetic studies about population movements. Tuberculosis DNA from human remains found in Borneo and Peru, dating from before the first European contacts, has been isolated by Mark Spigelman of the Institute of Archaeology, London, and Arthur Aufderheide of the University of Minnesota. Their discoveries show that the TB bacillus occurred throughout the ancient world. This means that early European colonists should no longer be blamed for bringing TB to the New World. Several research groups are now working to find out whether other diseases such as syphilis, measles and influenza were present in pre-Columbian America. The study of ancient diseases is proving particularly popular, because the findings will be relevant to modern medicine. Epidemiologists could learn a lot from the ebb and flow of bacterial and viral infections over the centuries - and their relation to changes in the virulence of the germs on the one hand and in human living conditions on the other. Although TB, for example, was present in pre-Columbian America, it may not have caused serious disease until the colonists destroyed the structure of indigenous society. Previously, archaeologists had only been able to study slow-acting diseases that leave their mark on human bones, such as leprosy and syphilis. Paleogenetics should enable them to look at the population dynamics of other important infections such as smallpox, plague and malaria. Although bones have so far been the main source of bacterial DNA, Mark Spigelman is developing an alternative - ancient faeces and guts - in collaboration with Colin and Liz Fricker, two microbiologists employed by Thames Water (who are interested in using the same technology to detect traces of bacterial contamination in water). The team has just succeeded in isolating DNA from E Coli bacteria in the gut contents of Lindow Man, an Iron Age bog body dated to 500 BC. The discovery opens up the possibility of investigating germs in ancient cesspits, which would give information about community health as well diseases in individuals. The study of ancient genes is still scientifically controversial - though most of the debate centres on reports of DNA fragments extracted from insects trapped in amber many millions of years old. Some experts refuse to accept that the DNA molecule is chemically robust enough to exist for so long, even if it is sealed in an antiseptic preservative such as amber. They suspect that the 'dinosaur age' insect and bacterial DNA extracted by the Californian researchers, George Poinar and Raul Cano, is actually modern genetic material introduced by accidental contamination. Even the sceptics concede that DNA may survive under exceptional conditions for up to 10,000 years, which covers most of the period of interest to archaeologists. But they point out that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - the gene-amplifying technology used to fish a few DNA fragments out of a sample and make billions of copies for analysis - is extremely susceptible to contamination. The first results of genetic archaeology will have to be confirmed by independent experiments - by scientists working separately on the same or very similar material - before they are generally accepted as valid. But this is unlikely to take long, as scientists are moving rapidly into the field. The prospects are that we will learn more in the next decade about the way our prehistoric ancestors lived than we have over the past century.</p>

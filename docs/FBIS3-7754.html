The French Defense Ministry said a total of six Serbian  Galeb  jets were in the process of shelling a weapons factory near the  central Bosnian town of Vitez when NATO warplanes intervened and  downed four of the aircraft.    A NATO spokesman here said the six Serbian aircraft had  ignored orders to land and four of them were shot down at 0548  GMT by the two U.S. F-16 Flying Falcons which fired six missiles  and then safely returned to their base in Aviano, Italy.    "The NATO pilots issued, in accordance with their rules of  engagement, two `land or be engaged' orders to the aircraft,  which ignored them," a NATO communique issued in Italy said.  "The NATO Flying Falcons engaged the planes, shooting down four  of them." [passage omitted]    In Sarajevo, UN sources said one of the Galeb aircraft was  shot down over the central town of Zenica after taking off from  Banja Luka.    A Serb military official in Banja Luka said, "we cannot  either confirm or deny for the time being" that any Serb jets  had been shot down, and he asserted that Serb planes had abided  by operation Deny Flight.    NATO aircraft have been flying daily sorties over Bosnia  since April 1993 to enforce UN resolution 816 banning all  unauthorized flights over the war-torn former Yugoslav republic.  The UN ban has however been repeatedly been violated by Serb  aircraft. The NATO spokesman said Resolution 816 authorized  "all necessary measures" to ensure respect of the no-flight ban.    In Athens, Liberis told journalists that he regretted the  shooting down of the Serb planes and said the incident  "justifies our decision not to be involved in any military  operations in Bosnia." He recalled that Greek crews had been  pulled out of allied AWACS radar planes after Athens dissociated  itself from a NATO ultimatum threatening air strikes against all  heavy weapons not withdrawn from around Sarajevo or placed under  UN control by February 21.    Pressured by this ultimatum, Bosnian Serb forces besieging  Sarajevo and mainly Moslem Bosnian army declared a ceasefire on  February 9, the same day the NATO deadline was issued.    A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees said in Sarajevo that the humanitarian airlift into the  Bosnian capital and all movements to Serb-controlled areas were  being suspended in the wake of the downing of the four Serbian  aircraft.</p>

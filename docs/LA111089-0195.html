			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HOUSING SALES AND PRICES RISE  </P> <P> Housing prices in Los Angeles moved up slightly during October, and the pace of  home sales picked up from the previous month, the Los Angeles Board of Realtors  reported today.  </P> <P> The upturn almost wiped out the sharp drop in prices and home sales during  September. However, the inventory of homes for sale remains unusually high,  reflecting a cautious attitude among would-be home buyers, said J. Blair Pence  II, president of the board.  </P> <P> The median price was $469,000, up about 2% from September. It was up 12% from  the $419,000 median price of a year ago.  </P> <P> The average price of homes sold in the areas of the city served by the board's  members rose to $558,378 from the previous month's $520,447, an increase of  nearly $38,000, or about 7%. It was up about $76,000, or more than 15%, from a  year earlier.  </P> <P> The average is significantly influenced by the high prices of houses in the  very affluent areas of the city, Pence said. Affordable single-family housing  is still widely available in many parts of Los Angeles, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Armen Khanbabyan report in the "Armenia" column: "Yerevan </F> Does Not Believe in the Purity of Moscow's Intentions" under  general headline: "The Military Leaders of Baku, Yerevan, and  Stepanakert Have Set in Motion Russia's Plan for a Karabakh  Settlement"]    [Text] The past weekend has been extremely tense for  Armenian leaders and intermediaries involved in the peacemaking  activities around the Karabakh conflict. Ian Eliasson, head of  the Minsk CSCE group; Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador at large of  the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs; James  Collins, assistant to the U.S. Secretary of State and the State  Department's chief coordinator on the CIS countries, have  shuttled actively between Baku and Yerevan in an effort both to  coordinate the sides' positions and to bring closer the  approaches of the intermediaries themselves. Bad weather in the  region has prevented their flying in to Stepanakert.    According to Vladimir Kazimirov, much has been achieved, and  never before has peace been so close at hand as now, and today  everything depends on the conduct of the opposing sides: "It is  to dispel the widespread opinion that the sides in the conflict  are incapable of achieving a cease-fire or observing it on their  own." The Russian diplomat stated that Moscow remains committed  to the idea of a peacemaking action with the forces of an  international military contingent. In his opinion, subdivisions  of neutral European countries -- Austria, Sweden and Finland --  could take part in the operation. On the other hand, no one has  yet expressed such readiness. Nonetheless Vladimir Kazimirov  believes that Russia will not agree single-handedly to disengage  the Karabakh and Azerbaijan forces.    For his part Armenian presidential press secretary Levon  Zurabyan stated that some hopes are being pinned on the  quadripartite meeting of defense ministers in Moscow which, he  expects, will make it possible to transform the lull into a  stable peace. At the same time Mr. Zurabyan denied reports by  some media that the Moscow meeting between Levon Ter-Petrosyan  and Heydar Aliyev is already a foregone conclusion. "There is  no specific decision on this count," the press secretary  stressed. This was also confirmed by Vladimir Kazimirov, who  added however that it is essential to work out a substantive,  legally binding agreement on terminating the conflict and  overcoming its consequences. This agreement could be signed by  leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russia as  an intermediary. Possibly, Kazimirov added, this document will  be also joined by Swedish diplomats who are now presiding over  the CSCE Minsk group.    Meanwhile fears are mounting in Armenia that the transition  from war to peace will not only be very complicated but could  also entail unwelcome implications. In particular Suren Zolyan,  a deputy in the Armenian Supreme Soviet, said that "the  peacekeeping troops could very easily turn into occupiers" and  therefore it is vitally urgent to consider the limits of powers  of both observer and disengagement units in areas of their  disposition. Unless all the intermediaries' powers are defined  clearly today, tomorrow any provocation will serve as cause to  introduce these units into the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh  proper, which could lead to a repetition of the 1920 situation.  At that time the Russian army also entered Karabakh as a  neutral force to reconcile the warring sides but soon  transferred that region under Azerbaijan's control. In this  connection there are doubts that Moscow will agree with the CSCE  proposal whereby international observers are to monitor not so  much the actions by sides to the conflict as the activity and  movement of the peacekeeping forces. This leads to the  conclusion that Russia will try to thwart the CSCE efforts and  will start forming a CIS troop contingent (also "international"  in name), which will naturally require some time and at best  delay a settlement.</p>

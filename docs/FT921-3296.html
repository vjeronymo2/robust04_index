			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Law lords to assess legal convention THE LAW LORDS are to review the long-standing legal convention that statements made by a minister in promoting an act of parliament cannot normally be looked at when a court is interpreting the act. The review has been prompted by a case concerning a schoolmaster who was granted tuition fees for his son at the school where he taught at 20 per cent of the normal rate. The Inland Revenue argued that this concession was a taxable benefit. During the passage of the 1976 Finance Bill Mr Robert Sheldon, then chief secretary to the Treasury, argued that the taxable liability on school fees would be very small. There is no reflection of this statement in the act. When the case reached the House of Lords seven law lords decided that a Lords appellate committee should consider 'whether and in what circumstances parliamentary debates on a bill may be used as an aid to construction of the ensuing act.' Mr Michael Bishopp, a partner with accountants Price Waterhouse, said a decision in favour of the Inland Revenue could affect many employees - for example, transport and entertainment workers who receive cheap tickets.</p>

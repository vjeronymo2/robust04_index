			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAT AND THE AYATOLLAH  </P> <P> Khomeini does not represent me as a Muslim; he is the leader of the Shia  minority, often self-righteous and misguided in their interpretation of Islamic  law.  </P> <P> His threat against Rushdie is wrong, and, I think, actually illegal,  Islamically speaking.  </P> <P> But Rushdie knew exactly what he was doing in savagely attacking truths all  Muslims hold dear. My objection to Charles Champlin's article ("The Rushdie  Affair -- a View From the Sidelines," Feb. 23) is this: Muslims have rules of  civilized conduct, in which blasphemy is punishable; to defend the West as  having defined the rules of civilized conduct for the entire world is  hypocritical if one means to say that the West is superior in such matters.  </P> <P> ABD AL-HAYY MOORE  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

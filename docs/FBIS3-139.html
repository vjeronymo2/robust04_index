This four-day seminar was  the first of a series of three to be held this year. It closed  on 26 February and was attended by 73 UNITA officials from  Benguela, Bie, Cuanza Sul, Cunene, Moxico, and Huambo Provinces.  The meeting discussed a number of issues connected with party  operations. Lourenco Bento, the Voice of Resistance of the  Black Cockerel correspondent in Huambo, has sent us this report:    [Begin Bento recording] [words indistinct] in addition to  the  government [as heard] delegates and guests, Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA] General Staff officials, and party  leadership officials. The (?opening ceremony) at the municipal  administration conference hall was chaired by UNITA President  Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, who invited those present to pay a  deserved homage to the late Ivorian President Felix  Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's greatest man and a close friend of  UNITA. [passage omitted]    Our beloved President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi then  introduced Engineer (Plaques), mayor of the city of Huambo, to  those present at the meeting. [passage omitted]    Addressing this methodological seminar of the UNITA General  Secretariat, President Dr. Jonas Savimbi began by describing  Angola as a [word indistinct] country facing complex problems  [words indistinct] Dr. Savimbi also mentioned the irreparable  losses of UNITA Vice President Engineer Jeremias Chitunda,  General Mango Alicerces, and Engineer Elias Salupeto Pena, who  were massacred by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] in Luanda in 1992. [passage  omitted]    Our beloved president also talked about our country's  economic situation. In an allusion to injustices and the  depletion of the country's economic resources by the regime  currently in power, he described Angola as a (?country that is  richer than its own people). He accused the MPLA-PT and its  officials of continuing to be unwavering and intolerant  communists. He promised that UNITA will continue to abide by  principles of openness and tolerance.    The UNITA president noted once again that Huambo must not be  the (?headquarters) of Angola's division. Huambo is just a  rearguard base so they do not kill all of us, Dr. Jonas Savimbi  said. He called on the cadres (?to be organized) and to look  after human and material resources. This four-day seminar ended  26 February.    During the seminar, the cadres discussed with honesty and in  depth the problems faced by areas under their responsibility.  [passage omitted]</p>

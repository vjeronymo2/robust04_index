			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA OFFER: SUSPENSION OF SECESSION LAWS  </P> <P> Lithuania's Parliament offered Wednesday to suspend laws it has enacted since  declaring the republic's independence if the Kremlin agrees to negotiate.  </P> <P> The resolution adopted by the Lithuanian Supreme Council is aimed at breaking  Lithuania's impasse with Moscow, but council spokeswoman Rita Dapkus said it  does not involve rescinding the republic's March 11 declaration of independence  itself as the Kremlin has demanded.  </P> <P> She said the offer will be delivered to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today.  </P> <P> Dapkus said the proposal closely resembled the compromise suggested last month  by French and German leaders but adds a transition period before full  independence and concrete proposals on military cooperation, economic plans and  other topics.  </P> <P> Gorbachev spokesman Arkady A. Maslennikov has said the proposal by West German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand went "along the  lines" of Gorbachev's thinking.  </P> <P> Gorbachev pronounced Lithuania's declaration of independence invalid in March  and followed up with economic sanctions, including a partial blockade that  officials say has left the republic of 3.8 million on the verge of running out  of fuel.  </P> <P> Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said Tuesday that she believes  talks with Moscow could begin this week, and she is expected to be in Moscow  today.  </P> <P> A leader of neighboring Latvia said Wednesday that talks on Baltic independence  would start next week with mid-level Kremlin officials. Deputy Prime Minister  Ilmars Bisers, just back from meetings in Moscow, said talks with Soviet  officials would focus on "the gaining of independence on the basis of a treaty  with the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> All three Baltic republics were reported to be calm Wednesday, one day after  thousands of anti-independence protesters converged on government buildings in  Riga, the capital of Latvia, and Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAGA OF BUCK HELM SHINES LIGHT ON TOWN  </P> <P> This little town in the Trinity Mountains has stepped into the limelight with  its new-found miracle man, Buck Helm.  </P> <P> Banners and posters adorn the town's streets and shop windows celebrating the  rescue of Helm from the rubble of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in Oakland after  last week's earthquake.  </P> <P> "This One's for You, Buck," says a sign in the window of the New York Saloon.  </P> <P> And on Thursday, the Chamber of Commerce, the Red Cross and local officials  staged a press conference seeking donations for victims of the quake and  predicting that Helm's fame would bring new visitors to this mountain tourist  center.  </P> <P> "Any recognition doesn't hurt," said Trinity County Supervisor Dee Potter. "I  think it has increased our business somewhat."  </P> <P> The 57-year-old Helm, who works at the docks in Oakland during the week and  commutes 250 miles to Weaverville on weekends, was pulled from the wreckage of  the freeway last Saturday after spending 90 hours trapped in his car.  </P> <P> The burly longshoreman's clerk remains hospitalized in Oakland with a fractured  skull, three broken ribs, nerve damage to his leg and kidney problems due to  dehydration.  </P> <P> Those who know Helm describe him as strong-willed, occasionally overbearing and  even "ornery." But he also has a reputation for generosity to his neighbors and  devotion to his four children, Greg, 35; Marc, 22; Jeff, 16, and Desiree, 12.  </P> <P> Although many residents in this town of about 3,500 have never met him, Helm's  survival has made him Weaverville's biggest celebrity. It also has helped draw  the attention of the outside world to this Gold Rush town about 40 miles west  of Redding and already a popular staging area for hunters and fishermen.  </P> <P> Normally, the town's biggest event of the year is a Fourth of July festival  that features a rodeo, parade and a destruction derby. But this year, Buck Helm  is even bigger.  </P> <P> "Our Thoughts Are With You, Buck and Bay Area," reads a banner hanging from the  second story of the courthouse building.  </P> <P> On the marquee of the Trinity Theater, Helm shares the billing with this week's  movie: "God Bless Family Helm. Cheeta and Friends," the sign reads.  </P> <P> Along Main Street, with its covered sidewalks and historic buildings,  shopkeepers have posted handwritten signs in their windows to congratulate Helm  -- and indulge in a little self-promotion.  </P> <P> At the Mountain Marketplace natural food store, for example, a sign reads,  "You're a Natural. Hurry Home Buck." And down the street at the Western Shop  clothing store, a poster in the window says simply, "Giddy-Yup Buck."  </P> <P> After Helm's dramatic rescue, television crews and newspaper reporters swamped  the town with requests for interviews. And many local businessmen and elected  officials are pleased with all the attention Weaverville has been getting.  </P> <P> "We have a great tie with the tourism industry, and any recognition of this  area that shows why people come here is advantageous," said Supervisor Potter.  </P> <P> But some of the local townsfolk -- who moved here precisely because it is so  isolated -- are not exactly thrilled with efforts to capitalize on Helm's  sudden fame.  </P> <P> "It's bringing the town a lot of publicity," said Nola Brimhall, a teller at  North Valley Bank. "I'm not sure we want the word to get too far out there."  </P> <P> To aid Helm and other earthquake victims, local residents have collected  donations and organized fund-raising events. On Friday, for instance, "Nila's  Taco Feed" and the "Teen Center Earthquake Relief Dance" are scheduled to raise  money for the disaster victims.  </P> <P> So far, however, Weaverville residents have not decided what kind of  celebration they will stage when Helm finally returns home.  </P> <P> "I think Weaverville should certainly take every advantage to welcome Buck  home," said librarian Doris Callahan, who knows Helm's youngest children  because of their frequent visits to the library.  </P> <P> "I don't know that a banner across the street is necessary saying, 'Come See  Where Lucky Bucky Lives and Eats,' " she said. "But I welcome everybody to the  Weaverville community."  </P></p>

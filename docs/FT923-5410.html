			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Nordic Region: Confusion reigns over Sweden's role in European monetary union THE NORDIC financial markets are in a jittery state. In Sweden, concern about the economic situation and the possibility of a devaluation prompted a sharp outflow of currency in the middle of August, forcing the Riksbank - Sweden's central bank - to hike up its key lending rate twice in the space of a week. The rise in Swedish rates had repercussions in neighbouring Finland where the central bank quickly raised its tender rate in order to prevent a currency outflow. The 3 percentage point rise - from 13 per cent to 16 per cent - in the Riksbank's marginal lending rate last Wednesday took the markets by surprise as the Riksbank had raised the rate by one percentage point only the previous week. The initial rise in the marginal rate, from 12 per cent to 13 per cent, was a response to a large capital outflow of SKr9.9bn in the week ending August 21 (compared with an outflow of SKr394m the previous week). The market's nervousness was partly blamed on Mr Allan Larsson, an opposition Social Democrat and former finance minister, who questioned whether Sweden should join a single European currency. His comments, which were published in the Swedish press, left the markets confused about Sweden's future role in European economic and monetary union, and came at a time when the markets were losing their confidence in the ability of the centre-right minority government to push ahead with the tough economic measures needed to reduce Sweden's budget deficit. The initial rise in the marginal rate appears to have had little effect, with dealers estimating that a further SKr10bn or so may have flooded out of Sweden last week. Prime Minister Carl Bildt said last week that the fixed exchange rate policy would be maintained and said the government would push ahead with its policy for growth. Mr Bildt's four-party government has promised to cut back on public spending, but it has faced problems in passing some of its spending cuts in the parliament because it is in a minority. 'What worries the market is the growing budget deficit and rapid rise in unemployment,' says Mr Thomas Franzen, economist at Svenska Handelsbanken. 'Although the market is quite confident about the government's economic policy, there is a real worry about whether the government can get these measures through Parliament.' Mr Franzen warns that the public sector borrowing requirement for the 1992-1993 fiscal year could reach SKr150bn-SKr160bn. The Riksbank's 3 percentage point rise in the marginal rate pushed up bond yields initially, but since then, yields on treasury bills and bonds have fallen back again. Last week's rise in Sweden's marginal rate prompted an immediate hike in the Bank of Finland's tender rate, from 15.5 per cent to 17 per cent, in an attempt to prevent an outflow of capital. The rise pushed up yields, with the seven-year bond yielding 13 per cent. Dealers warn that while the Bundesbank keeps German interest rates high and the European bond markets remain preoccupied with the forthcoming French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, there is little chance that the Bank of Finland will be able to lower interest rates. The government has a heavy funding requirement this year, but so far about two-thirds of its funding has been done abroad in other currencies, thereby putting less pressure on domestic interest rates.</p>

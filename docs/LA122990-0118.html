			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4 COMEDIANS READY FOR TIP-OFF OF THE TWISTED;  </P> <P> HUMOR: JETT MATTHEWS, JIMMY MCGEE, DICK HARDWICK AND SHANG WILL SHARE THE COACH  HOUSE STAGE TONIGHT IN SAN JUAN.  </P> <P> Comedian Jett Matthews has a fairly good sense of who he is.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty much a pessimistic optimist," Matthews says. "I think there will  probably be a nuclear war, but not before Super Bowl Sunday."  </P> <P> And, hopefully, not before the comedy show tonight at the Coach House in San  Juan Capistrano, where Matthews will appear on a bill with comedians Jimmy  McGee, Dick Hardwick and Shang. The four run the gamut of the comedy spectrum.  There's Hardwick, who worked nine years at Disneyland, including five as the  comic in the Golden Horseshoe Revue. The Fullerton resident talks a lot about  his childhood in Indiana.  </P> <P> "Things are simpler in the Midwest," he says. "You either drink or you don't  drink. Which makes choosing your religion a lot easier too. . . . It's easy to  tell a rich person in Indiana: They've got two cars jacked up in the front  yard."  </P> <P> Hardwick, who does the audience warm-ups for "The Munsters Today" and Fox's  "What a Dummy," plays several musical instruments in his act, including the  drums, harmonica and jew's-harp. He is also known to "rap" the Miranda rights  while moonwalking across the stage.  </P> <P> As a comedian, Hardwick says, his goal is to have the audience walk away  saying, "Gee, that was a lot of fun -- just like a ride at Disneyland!"  </P> <P> Then there's Jimmy McGee, who grew up in a small town in Mississippi where he  would often hang out in the streets watching the winos.  </P> <P> That experience inspired one of his best routines. With the stage lights dimmed  and the sound of a jazz piano playing in the background, he takes on the  character of one of those bleary-eyed winos whose best friend is a bottle of  cheap wine.  </P> <P> In the routine, McGee's wino recognizes a young friend who has just gotten out  of jail. "See, what I tell you about messin' with that cocaine?" McGee says to  his friend. "It's not good for you. It's addictive."  </P> <P> Speaking to his wine bottle, McGee says, "I can quit drinking you any time I  want to."  </P> <P> As he walks away, he drops the bottle. Then he picks up the unbroken bottle  and, in a scolding tone, says: "Don't you try that again."  </P> <P> McGee, who has opened for the Temptations, Debbie Harry and Ray Charles, uses  his wino character to talk about everything from current events to  relationships.  </P> <P> "It's a sad kind of statement on alcoholism, yet it's still funny," McGee says.  "I think it makes you think and laugh at the same time."  </P> <P> Shang, who has appeared on Showtime and recently guested on "A Laugh, a Tear,"  a special on black American humor, describes his comedy as "bizarre, mixed with  part reality."  </P> <P> And just how bizarre and real is that?  </P> <P> "I talk about cannibalism and racism," he said. "See, that's what I mean: You  go from the bizarre to what's going on."  </P> <P> Cannibals, according to Shang, love Domino's Pizza -- "not for the pizza, but  for the delivery guy."  </P> <P> Instead of the pizza being delivered in 30 minutes or less, he says, "in their  minds, it's 'victims in 30 minutes or less.' "  </P> <P> As for racism, Shang says he believes that it's going to end soon: "The way the  ozone layer is breaking down, I think everybody's going to be black."  </P> <P> Jett Matthews, who has been a comedian for six years, is a "Cal State Fullerton  dropout."  </P> <P> "I studied political science, which means I can stand on any street corner in  America and tell you the demographics of the '72 election -- for food."  </P> <P> In his act, Matthews says, "I talk a little politics and a little rock 'n' roll  -- a little bit of everything. It's a little bitter and a little stark. It's  what I do."  </P> <P> How bitter?  </P> <P> "Just a tad, just a smidgen," he says. "I don't think everything's all dark. I  just think it's something to be looked at and talked about. When people come to  see a comedy show, I don't think they should forget everything. At the same  time, I don't preach. It's just my opinions."  </P> <P> Such as?  </P> <P> "A lot of people don't think there should be troops in Saudi Arabia," Matthews  says.  </P> <P> "I think it's a good idea, because the more U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia the  less Camaros on our highways. . . .  </P> <P> "Do you think Orange County people will like that?"  </P> <P> Matthews said he thinks most comics are insecure and do comedy because they're  trying to get something from the audience that they didn't get at home when  they were growing up.  </P> <P> Not him:  </P> <P> "I do comedy because I can't stop the voices in my head."  </P> <P> Jett Matthews, Jimmy McGee, Dick Hardwick and Shang appear tonight at 9 at the  Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $8.  Information: (714) 496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Generating an appetite for foreign cash - China's Huaneng group is looking to the NYSE for fresh funds China's Huaneng group, the country's largest power generating organisation, has emerged as perhaps the most aggressive Chinese company seeking foreign capital abroad, with planned listings in New York of two of its subsidiaries. Huaneng officials make no secret of their appetite for foreign capital to fulfil ambitious expansion plans to the end of this century. They include adding 15,000 megawatts of capacity to the existing 14,500MW under its control. In addition, its coal mines will be extended to produce 30m tonnes by the year 2000, and a coal port will be equipped to handle 38m tonnes annually. An ambitious railroad-building programme is also planned. Mr Cao Leren, the group's senior engineer, describes as a 'breakthrough' the prospect of the Huaneng International Power Development Corporation and Shandong Huaneng Power Development Company being among the first direct Chinese listings in New York. 'We need a tremendous amount of money to carry out our plans,' Mr Cao says. The Huaneng official estimates that funding requirements will reach Yn150bn (UDollars 17.4bn) in the six years to the year 2000. Of this total, the company will contribute one-third from its own resources. Another one-third will be raised domestically, much of it in the form of loans from the newly-established State Development Bank. This leaves a further one-third, or about Dollars 6bn, to be raised internationally, either through share issues, bonds or BOT (build-operate-transfer) equity ventures. The group recently established China's first organisation specifically designed to channel funds into BOT projects. Called the BOT Investment and Development Corporation, its first project is a toll-road in partnership with Beijing municipality. The Huaneng group is also pursuing an innovative strategy in its New York listings. Under the guidance of CS First Boston, Shandong Huaneng Power Development hopes to raise some Dollars 400m through a public offering of 23.4m American depositary shares (ADS). These will be a new class of shares, known as 'N' shares, which will be offered to investors in the US, Europe and Asia. 'N' shares are similar in concept to the 'B' shares listed on China's fledgling exchanges, and which are denominated in dollars for foreigners (China's yuan is not convertible). Each ADS will represent 50 ordinary 'N' shares. The company, under a new electricity tariff schedule, is aiming for a return of 15 per cent of its fixed net assets after costs and taxes. This is in line with guidelines set by the central government for a reasonable rate of return on equity investments in infrastructure projects in the power sector, under BOT-type schemes. Shandong Power operates four power stations with total capacity of 1,200MW in Shandong province, south-east of Beijing. Huaneng International Power, 60 per cent-owned by the Huaneng group, runs power stations in coastal areas with about 6,100MW under its control. The China Huaneng Group grew out of a decision in 1985 to establish a conservation fund to convert oil-fired power stations to coal, and to build thermal stations. In 1988, Huaneng became a group and is now one of China's 10 biggest companies. At the end of 1993, assets totalled Yn46bn against liabilities of Yn39.3bn. Borrowings amounted to Yn35bn, of which about one-third was hard currency-denominated. Net profit for the year was Yn2.2bn, double that of 1992. In all, the group comprises 11 corporations and some 200 associated companies, concentrated in the power sector. However, it is also involved in real estate, trading and finance. Two of its power-operating companies are listed on Chinese exchanges, one in Shanghai and the other in Shenzen. Mr Cao, however, believes that foreign listings are 'much more meaningful' for a company of Huaneng's size and diversity than a listing in Hong Kong, where nine Chinese entities have been listed, or on one of the mainland exchanges. This, he says, is because the pool of capital is so much larger. Mr Cao seems confident - in spite of nervousness in the markets and indications that investors are having second thoughts about opportunities in China - that Huaneng will be well received. The two companies seeking listings, he observes, are both engaged in power generation in a country where there are 'serious shortages of electricity'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hu Xiaoming: "Chinese Hostages in Afghanistan To Be </F> Released Soon"]    [Text] Islamabad, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Two Chinese hostages,  who have been kept in Afghanistan for almost a year, will be  released very soon, an Afghan source said here today.    "We'll try to do something. We hope it will be successful,"  Hamed Gilani, deputy chief of the National Islamic Front of  Afghanistan led by Syed Ahmed Gilani, said in a special  interview.    The two Chinese engineers, Wang Qingpin, about 30, and Zheng  Hongbao, about 40, were kidnapped while working on a project on  June 21 last year at Bostan along Pak-Afghan border, some 30  kilometers from Quetta, capital of Pakistan's Baluchistan  Province.    The Afghan kidnappers, led by Mullah Salam Rocketi [name as  received], held them in Qalat-e Ghelza'i District in Zabol  Province in Afghanistan.    Hamed Gilani said his cousin, 'Abdol Qadir Gilani, will go  to  Qalat-e Ghelza'i and get the two Chinese and other Pakistani  hostages released after 'Eid, the biggest holiday for Muslims  which falls on May 22.    'Abdol Qadir Gilani has recently met Mullah Salam Rocketi,  and the two Chinese engineers and secured the release of two  Pakistani hostages.    Besides the two Chinese engineers, nine Pakistani people,  including Ata Mohammad, deputy commissioner of Ziarat District  in Baluchistan Province, have also been taken hostage by  Rocketi's group.    Rocketi has been demanding a ransom of 600 million rupees  (about 20 million U.S. dollars), return of three Stinger  missiles allegedly captured by Pakistani troops and release of  his younger brother jailed in Pakistan.    The two Chinese hostages recently wrote a letter to Chinese  Ambassador in Pakistan, Zhou Gang, complaining about the inhuman  treatment they received.    They said they had to get up early in the morning to collect  firewood. They could not even get food or would be beaten badly  if they did not obey the kidnappers' order or did not finish the  job.    Some reports said the two Chinese engineers were sexually  abused by the bandits.    "We make it very clear that our talks with Rocketi are  unconditional, and Rocketi has responded very positively," Hamid  Gillani said.    Seyyed Ahmed Gilani, father of Hamed Gilani, is an  influential spiritual leader in Zabol Province as well as in  whole Afghanistan. He helped secure the release of six Chinese  engineers who were also kidnapped to Afghanistan in 1992.    Hamed Gilani said their efforts to set free the Chinese and  Pakistani hostages are based on "humanitarian value and moral  obligation" as well as "private request from the family of the  kidnapped deputy commissioner".    It has nothing to do with Pakistan Government, he said.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Man from the Pru calls for openness: A look at the views on disclosure of a leading life industry executive IT IS almost apostasy for the life insurance industry to acknowledge merit in the growing chorus of public complaints about its products. Yet Mr Mick Newmarch, chairman of Britain's largest life insurance company, Prudential, has done just that in a hard-hitting speech to the Institute of Actuaries last night which is aimed at set-ting a new agenda for the industry. Mr Newmarch singled out the thorny issue of disclosure: that is, what should consumers know about a life insurance product before they buy it? That question, simple as it appears, has been at the heart of probably the greatest onslaught of bad press the industry has ever seen. The life industry has largely been fighting a rearguard action for the past two years to stave off disclosure. The information that is wanted ranges from how much commission a sales agent earns to the exact number of years needed to earn a 100 per cent refund of premiums paid on an endowment policy cancelled before maturity - information that the public badly wants to get its hands on. This rearguard action has only confirmed in the public mind the view that the industry has something to hide. Mr Newmarch said: 'The trading practices of the savings industry - and in particular of life offices - are today subject to attack on an unprecedented scale and this must be a matter of vital concern to all of us.' In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Newmarch said that the industry had compounded the difficulty by insisting that its critics did not know what they were talking about. The recent response that criticism from the Office of Fair Trading was ill-informed was wrong. He said in his speech: 'Perhaps we should consider that maybe it is we who do not understand the fair trading environment.' Mr Newmarch said the industry had met the challenge of the criticism badly. 'This industry has a public-relations problem,' he said. Resistance to more and better disclosure had added to public scepticism about the merits of life insurance - a scepticism that may well be a factor in the recent decline in sales of life and pension products. The greatest apostasy committed by Mr Newmarch was to suggest that not only was the Office of Fair Trading - which is reviewing a new disclosure regime for life insurance - the appropriate body for setting a disclosure regime, but that many of its concerns were legiti-mate. Mr Newmarch said in his speech: 'Either it is possible to persuade the OFT and the most professionally competent media commentators that the current level of criticism of life industry products and sales practices is unjustified, or we must take on board the message that some of our products and our methods of presenting them have not kept pace with the changing expectations of the public.' He told the Financial Times: 'Over the past year or two, life insurance has become a pejorative term.' Privately, Mr Newmarch makes no secret of his view that in seeking a tougher disclosure regime he expects the Pru to benefit. Better disclosure would show the Pru off to its best advantage and shake some of its competitors out of the business al-together. Indeed, Mr Newmarch said, the Pru may consider disclosing to prospective cus-tomers more than is actually required under the law. Mr Newmarch suggested that instead of allowing the Securities and Investments Board to negotiate a disclosure regime acceptable to the OFT, the insurance industry should open a dialogue directly with it and seek OFT endorsement of the industry and its practices. Some industry cynics believe that in making that offer he is hoping to stave off what might be an even more unattractive disclosure regime to be developed by the Treasury. Under present rules, if the OFT finds SIB's life insurance disclosure regime unsatisfactory it is up to the Treasury to direct SIB to draft a new one. The last time the OFT turned down an SIB-designed disclosure regime, in 1989, it was the Department of Trade and Industry that ordered it back to the drawing board. Treasury sources have made little secret for their distaste for the life industry and it may turn out to be a far less sympathetic regulator than the DTI. Mr Newmarch strenuously objects to the suggestion that he would like the regulatory ball back in the DTI's court, although he urged in his speech that the DTI be charged with regulating sales and marketing of retail financial services. The DTI, he said, had the power to remove chairman and board directors from life companies in its powers of prudential supervision. There was no reason why that could not be extended to the sales and marketing arena as well.</p>

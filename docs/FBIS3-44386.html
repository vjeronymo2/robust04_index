On 12 December six persons, including (Wu Yanguang) and  (Wang  Xingwu), from Changting County in Fujian Province, flew to  Dalian from Fuzhou. The trip was arranged by (Zheng Yuguan),  head of a local illegal emigration ring. They were waiting to  leave the country there. A certain individual called Wang,  head of the illegal ring at the Bayuquan Harbor, hid the six  illegal emigrants in the cargo hold of a foreign ship on the  early morning of 18 December after his several-day scheme.  When the foreign ship was sailing on the sea area of Yantai,  the ship's crew discovered the stowaways. In line with the  relevant regulations, the ship's captain handed over the six  illegal emigrants to the embankment inspection station. Upon  receiving the report sent by the embankment inspection station  of Yantai, the border-defense inspection station at the Bayuquan  Harbor dispatched its personnel to Yantai to take the stowaways  back, captured the individual called Wang and detained him for  investigation, and cooperated with the local public security  organs in line with the clues confessed by the stowaways. The  case is being further investigated.</p>

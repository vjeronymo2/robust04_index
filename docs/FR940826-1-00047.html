			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consequently, we would require that Medicare-certified transplant centers and organ procurement organizations (OPOs) separate costs associated with organs transplanted in non-Medicare recipients from Medicare allowable costs prior to final settlement by the Medicare fiscal intermediary. To separate costs, we would require that the transplant centers compute the ratio of the number of organs used for Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of organs used and adjust the costs for organs transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries (proposed &sect;413.202).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Payment for Erythropoietin (EPO)/Epoietin (EPO)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Erythropoietin (EPO) is an anti-anemia drug given to dialysis patients with a specified level of anemia. Payments to ESRD facilities are made in increments of 1,000 unit doses, rounded to the nearest 100 units. Section 13566 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93) decreased the maximum payment for EPO from $11 to $10 per 1,000 units, which is specified in section 1881(b)(11)(B)(ii) of the Act. This amount is subject to adjustment by HCFA, if necessary. Existing &sect;413.170(c) provides that HCFA publishes annually a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice indicating whether an update in the EPO payment amount is appropriate and requesting public comment. We would revise redesignated &sect;413.174(f) to add the statutory reference and to clarify that when we determine that an adjustment to the payment amount is necessary, we publish a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice proposing a revision to the EPO payment amount, but that we will no longer publish a notice routinely on an annual basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the ``Dates'' section of this preamble, and we will respond to the comments in the preamble to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Collection of Information Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 413.184, 413.186, 413.190, and 413.192 of the regulations contain information collection or recordkeeping requirements, or both, that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The information collection requirements concern the documentation required of a facility furnishing dialysis services to patients with end stage renal disease that requests an exception to the prospective payment rate. The respondents who will provide the information include providers that furnish dialysis services to patients with end stage renal disease. No new reporting burden will exist as a result of this regulation, since we propose to place in regulations current documentation requirements already published in Chapter 27 of the PRM. Therefore, the public reporting burden for this collection of information would be the same as that for Chapter 27, which was approved by OMB on September 21, 1991 for use through September 30, 1994, under control number 0938&hyph;0296. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' section of this preamble. A notice will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after approval of the regulations' information collection requirements is obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / N-fuel imports blocked A US federal judge has blocked shipments of spent nuclear fuel from European research reactors, throwing into chaos the US's policy of reducing the volume of bomb-type highly enriched uranium in use around the world. The move also jeopardises US credibility in talks under way in Geneva on renewing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Judge Matthew Perry granted an injunction to the state of South Carolina barring the Department of Energy from storing 409 fuel rods from Europe at the Savannah River nuclear plant. The department is expected to appeal against the decision, which has thrown a spanner into the US's 30-year-old off-site fuel programme, under which the US agreed to accept spent fuel in exchange for participating foreign reactors' commitment to switch to less dangerous low enriched fuel. The trust of the European reactors which signed up for the off-site fuel programme was stretched to breaking point when the US broke its side of the bargain for five years, following a lawsuit brought by environmentalists. Some developing countries point to the US's failure to live up to its commitments as a good reason why they should not agree to an indefinite extension of the NPT.</p>

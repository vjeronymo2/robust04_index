			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ANNUAL SMOKEOUT IS IN THING  </P> <P> Masses of Americans snuffed out cigarettes, cigars and pipes today to take part  in the 13th Great American Smokeout -- a mammoth public health effort aimed at  saving smokers from an early grave.  </P> <P> Sponsored by the American Cancer Society, the 24-hour smoking moratorium is a  warning to men, women and children about the nation's leading cause of  preventable death. The annual smoking death count totals 390,000 -- or an  average 1,000 funerals a day -- from cancer, heart disease and lung disease.  </P> <P> In North Carolina, which depends on a $900-million tobacco crop, the society  distributed a record amount of educational material promoting the smokeout.  </P></p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Markets: All aboard for some vertical integration - The Bottom Line WHEN hordes of German and British holidaymakers descend on the same sun-blessed paradise, it is usually time for the discerning to go somewhere else. In both countries, travel groups have decided that it is not enough to arrange holidays; they also have to sell them and fly the customers to their destinations. Vertical integration is the latest holiday industry vogue. Many of the claimed benefits, however, are still unproved. This week, Owners Abroad, the UK's second biggest tour operator, announced a tie-up with Thomas Cook, the second biggest travel agents' chain. Thomas Cook, which is taking a 10.3 per cent share in Owners, was itself acquired earlier this year by LTU, a large German travel company. Airtours, the third biggest tour operator, bought the Pickfords travel agency last September. Thomson, the industry leader, owns Lunn Poly. This consolidation has been the travel industry's most notable development in 1992. But the year is not over, and it might get more interesting. Owners Abroad received a preliminary approach earlier this year from Airtours, which expressed an interest in buying it. A takeover might raise monopoly issues, as Thomson and the enlarged Airtours would between them have close to 60 per cent of the UK package tour market. Talk of a bid for Owners has helped to lift its share price from a low of 46p last September to 90p at yesterday's close. Generally, however, the market has not been well disposed towards the holiday companies over the past year. In 1991, Owners Abroad out-performed the FT All-Share index for most of the year. Airtours rose further than any other stock. As with most holiday romances, however, the attraction proved transitory. The market's disillusionment is based on a belief that travel companies' margins are too vulnerable to price-cutting, although the criticism is more properly directed at Owners Abroad than Airtours. Airtours saw some erosion of margin, but pre-tax profits for the year to end-September 1992 still rose 32.7 per cent to Pounds 36.5m on turnover up 40 per cent to Pounds 405.6m. Owners Abroad saw 1992 profits fall 19.3 per cent to Pounds 25.5m on turnover up 19.9 per cent to Pounds 772m. Owners said profits were depressed by a Pounds 4.9m restructuring charge which followed the move from London to cheaper premises. The rest of the fall was the result of this summer's price-cutting. Howard Klein, Owners Abroad's chairman, described these as non-recurring events. Moving offices might be a one-off, but price-cutting is as non-recurring as flaming Mediterranean sunsets. This is the real problem with vertical integration. Thomson has not been able to use its ownership of Lunn Poly to boost sales but Airtours and Owners Abroad, being more aggressive, might be able to. If they are too successful, however, Thomson will cut its prices to maintain its market share, as it has done before. Klein protests that his company plans to reduce the number of holidays it sells in 1993 by 5 per cent. At the same time, however, he says its association with Thomas Cook will increase its sales in the longer term. If this is the case, a rise in market share is a likely prospect, with the price-cutting consequences that follow. Owners Abroad is expected to make Pounds 34m pre-tax profits in 1993, with earnings per share of 11p. The Airtours forecast is Pounds 41.5m pre-tax profits and earnings per share of 30p. The prospective multiples are 8 and 9 respectively. Given the relative resilience of the holiday business during the recession, that might seem a harsh judgment. But it will take a few summers of price stability to change it.</p>

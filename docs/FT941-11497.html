			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Russo-Ukrainian conflict 'probable' Conflict between Russia and Ukraine is now 'probable', according to a report by a prominent British defence institute, writes David White, Defence Correspondent. In its annual International Security Review, the Royal United Services Institute warns of rising tension over the Crimea and Russian nationals living in Ukraine. It also cites difficulties over the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine and trade, currency and oil disagreements between the two countries. The institute says the potential for a serious outbreak of violence is greater in Ukraine than in the Caucasus.</p>

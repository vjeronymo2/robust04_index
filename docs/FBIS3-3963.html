			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Chinese officials have privately hinted at the  possibility of more political prisoner releases and have also  said that other differences with the U.S. over human rights  could be resolved, according to Hong Kong-based human rights  activist John Kamm. He said after meetings with State Council,  Public Security and Supreme Court officials in Beijing, he was  "reasonably confident there will be some moves in the next few  weeks".    His talks with officials are the first indication that  despite the tough human rights stance taken by China since the  visit of American Secretary of State Warren Christopher this  month, the Chinese leadership might be willing to make  concessions quietly.    Mr Kamm said while Chinese officials repeated the line that  they were prepared to lose the Most Favoured Nation (MFN)  status, they were at pains to note prisoners who are sick, or  who show a good attitude can be released in accordance with  Chinese laws. They also said other human rights issues could be  resolved with the United States through discussions based on  mutual respect.    While this is far from a guarantee China will make the  "significant progress" on human rights required by U.S.  President Bill Clinton for MFN renewal, Mr Kamm said he was  encouraged. "They're clearly committed to continuing the  dialogue on human rights," Mr Kamm said.    As proof of that, he noted that all officials he requested  to  meet on this trip have agreed to speak to him "I think we'll see  releases of sick prisoners and others," Mr Kamm said. But he  added: "I was led to believe such moves could not be made  immediately after the visit" of Mr Christopher.    In stating that Chinese law left room for prisoner releases  based on humanitarian concerns or signs of good attitude, the  officials tried to make clear that "we will no do these things  because of American pressure, but be cause they are in  accordance with the law," Mr Kamm said. No names or numbers of  prisoners were discussed but Mr Kamm expects to go over a name  list with Justice Ministry officials today.    Meanwhile, sources in the Chinese dissident community said  the authorities had not decided whether to take "resolute  action" against a number of activists who they believed would  organise protest actions in the run-up to the fifth anniversary  of the June 4, 1989, crackdown.    The sources said aside from the fear of fanning anti-MFN  sentiment in the U.S. Congress, the authorities were worried  that an excessive number of arrests would help galvanise the  dissident movement.    In the past month, different groups have sent private  letters  to leaders demanding reforms including an end to the  incarceration of citizens without recourse to the judicial  process.</p>

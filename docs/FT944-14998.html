			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Booker Given that Booker's dividend cover last year was 1.3 times and falling, shareholders have more than a passing interest in its quality of earnings. Salmon farming has become a highly cyclical, commodity business with wide price fluctuations and regular bouts of disease. So the relaxed reaction to the proposed acquisition of Marine Harvest is testimony to the persuasiveness of new chief executive Mr Charles Bowen. The deal will spread Booker's salmon risks by bringing in Chilean production and adding sales in the fast-growing US and Japanese markets. Disease control has also improved significantly over the past few years. Yet it is hard to argue the acquisition will reduce Booker's risks as a group. The purchase will more than treble its salmon production to nearly Pounds 100m a year. Though Booker argue this is modest in the context of group sales of Pounds 3.5bn, fish farming will contribute about a tenth of its profits. Although Booker cannot eliminate salmon cycles entirely, it is currently making good money. It is also convinced it can cut costs faster than the 2-3 per cent a year fall in prices it predicts. But even after cost savings of around Pounds 3m a year, the Pounds 76m purchase price will not look a bargain if the 11 times multiple proves to be calculated on peak earnings. There was a real bargain to be had in 1992 when Unilever sold the Marine Harvest salmon business for Pounds 22m, but Booker passed up the chance.</p>

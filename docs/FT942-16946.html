			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Dresdner may go to US for funds Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-biggest private sector bank, is expected tomorrow to announce plans to raise additional capital through a private placing of American Depositary Receipts in the US. Daimler-Benz, the country's largest industrial concern, may also unveil further details of its previously-announced capital increase following today's meeting of its supervisory board. According to German newspaper reports, Dresdner will become the first German financial institution to take the US route, aiming to raise around DM1.3bn (Dollars 760m) Bank officials said that any capital measures would be unveiled by Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman, at tomorrow's annual press conference to review last year's results and the future outlook. Mr Sarrazin is also expected to announce an increase of at least DM1 on 1992's DM12 dividend. Full details of the plans at Daimler, which is expected to cut its payout, are likely to be revealed at its press conference next Tuesday. Mr Gerhard Liesen, finance director, said recently that he was aiming for a capital increase this summer to bring in around DM3bn. While a Dresdner ADR placing would not involve the bank in greater financial disclosure - as was the case with Daimler when it was granted a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange last year - the plan underlines growing eagerness among German companies to gain greater access to the world's largest capital market. Analysts have raised their expectations of German banks' results following Deutsche Bank's announcement last week of a 16 per cent increase in operating earnings. One observer said yesterday Dresdner could announce a 25 per cent improvement at the operating level for 1993. Expectations of Daimler's 1993 results are far lower - the nine-month result was a DM2bn loss according to US accounting rules, and Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, recently forecast a net profit DM600m for the full year, according to German methods. However, with much of its restructuring costs behind it or provided for, and new Mercedes-Benz car models reported to be selling well, Mr Reuter is expected to present a far brighter picture of prospects for this year and next at Tuesday's press conference. Although he has said the group could afford to hold its 1993 payout at DM13, Mr Reuter has been dropping hints that an unchanged or higher dividend would be unsuitable while the workforce was suffering the effects of job cuts and other rationalisation measures.</p>

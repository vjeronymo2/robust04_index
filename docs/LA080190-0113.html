			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> RIDGELINE PROTECTORS SAY PETITIONS FILLED  </P> <P> The organizers of a petition drive to support a proposed ordinance to protect  undeveloped ridgelines in Laguna Niguel say they have gathered enough  signatures to place the matter on the Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> The campaign received an unexpected boost from the controversy over the  development of 96 acres of land that had been set aside for parks. That matter  was disclosed in news reports of July 13, the day before the petition drive  officially began.  </P> <P> "The people are indeed angry about the parkland," said Paul Willems, a member  of the Laguna Niguel Ridgeline Protection and Preservation Committee. "It's  given impetus to our effort."  </P> <P> By Friday afternoon, more than 4,300 signatures had been gathered, Willems  said. About 3,600 signatures must be verified to qualify the ordinance for the  ballot. The deadline for submitting the signatures is Aug. 10, and committee  members say they will pursue the ballot measure if the City Council refuses to  adopt the ordinance at its next meeting Aug. 7.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance calls for a 300-foot setback on both sides of ridgelines  and would require that grading within 500 feet of hilltops be consistent with  the slope of the land.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Willems said he asked Councilman James F. Krembas to place the  matter on next Tuesday's council agenda, but interim City Manager Dan Miller  said that request cannot be granted.  </P> <P> "There isn't anything specific to put on the agenda yet," he said. "The council  has not had the benefit of staff analysis and legal analysis of the impacts of  this initiative yet."  </P> <P> A separate, city-prepared ridgeline protection ordinance is in the works and  should be ready to present to the Planning Commission on Aug. 14, Miller said,  adding: "We're moving on our own time line."  </P> <P> If they do not get their initiative on the November ballot, committee members  say, they will push for a special election. In signing the petition, committee  chairman Richard Taylor said, many residents expressed sadness that it has  taken so long to find a way to protect the hilltops, most of which are now  dotted with development.  </P> <P> "A lot of people have stated they're sorry it didn't take place 10 years ago,"  he said. "And a lot of people are really disappointed there's so little to  protect."  </P> <P> The land-transaction controversy involves a 1988 deed that officials say gave  Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. about 99 acres previously set aside for  parkland. Krembas, then vice president of Laguna Niguel's Community Services  District, signed the deed relinquishing the land where more than 100 homes have  since been built.  </P> <P> Krembas, who is under investigation by the Orange County district attorney, has  denied any wrongdoing and said he mistakenly signed the public land deed,  thinking it involved another transaction.

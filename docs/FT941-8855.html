			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Statoil buys stake in US gas producer Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, has bought a 38.1 per cent stake in Eastern Group, a US gas producer, trader and distributor. The deal will give the Norwegians a foothold in the US gas market, the second biggest in the world. Statoil has been seeking to export gas to the US but has been unable to obtain prices which would justify such a move. 'Acquiring the interest in the Eastern Group and initiating a marketing collaboration with the company form part of Statoil's efforts to expand its international involvement in the natural gas sector,' it said. The companies have not disclosed the terms of the deal, but Statoil will gain two seats on Eastern Group's board. A gas marketing venture is to be set up through which Statoil will supply Eastern Group with a minimum of 5.6bn cubic metres of natural gas over a five-year period which would be sold in the US market. Statoil will either buy the gas in the US market or swap crude oil imported from Norway and traded by its US subsidiary in exchange for US gas. The Eastern Group is considering going public and may seek a listing on either the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or the American Stock Exchange. In 1993, the company achieved a turnover of more than Dollars 140m and it sells about 2bn cubic metres of natural gas annually. Industry specialists said prices for gas sold at the wellhead in the US spot market ranged between Dollars 1.47 and Dollars 2.15. per British thermal unit. Last year Statoil lifted pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to NKr12bn (Dollars 1.6bn) from NKr9.9bn in 1992.</p>

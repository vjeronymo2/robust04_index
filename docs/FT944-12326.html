			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Pollution cost plea to industry The UK's pollution inspectorate has asked for volunteers from industry to try to prove that tighter environmental controls are not as expensive as critics think. Dr David Slater, director and chief inspector of the Inspectorate of Pollution, last night called for 'a handful' of companies to come forward and co-operate. The companies and the inspectorate would look at the effect of controls on chemical emissions and efficiency, and the economics of integrated pollution control (IPC) - the regime the regulators have been enforcing for the past three years under the Environmental Protection Act. Dr Slater was giving the annual lecture of the north-west region of the Chemical Industries Association at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. He said the inspectorate believed in IPC, but not blindly. It needed to see what the policy was actually doing by collaborating with companies affected by it. 'I am sure we would find that IPC is not, overall, as expensive as some might have us believe.' On keeping costs reasonable, Dr Slater welcomed the appointment by the government of an independent advisory committee to provide the inspectorate with expert external opinion. But he stressed that companies still had to spend money to monitor what they were doing to the environment. He said: 'We recognise that monitoring can be almost a bottomless pit as far as money is concerned.' But he added: 'If you can't measure it, then you can't manage it.'</p>

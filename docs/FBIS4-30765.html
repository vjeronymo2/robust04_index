			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(km)"-signed report: "Viktorie Hradska Will Head the Arms </F> Consortium as of June"]    [Text] Prague -- Viktorie Hradska, the former diplomat and  leader of the defunct Liberal Democratic Party, will become the  new director of the RDP Group arms consortium as of 1 June. She  will take over the most senior post in this consortium, which  affiliates more than 40 companies, from current Director Jan  Vlcek.    The change in the company's management came about after  Vlcek  was criticized for the difficulties in communicating with the  Defense Ministry, without which the RDP Group's arms plans will  not succeed.    "I am resigning so that cooperation with the Army can be  improved," admitted Vlcek. At the same time, however, he added  that he will carry on as a member of the RDP Group shareholding  company's board.    In 1992, Hradska was deputy chairwoman of the government's  Committee for International Relations. She led the Liberal  Democratic Party until March 1992. She then transferred with  her wing of the party to the Civic Democratic Alliance. She was  also recently a serious candidate for the post of ambassador to  Hungary. According to representatives from the RDP Group, her  qualification for the post of director is her ability to conduct  negotiations.</p>

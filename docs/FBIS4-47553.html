The issues of obtaining hybridomata and monoclonal  antibodies to the antigens of various types of mycoplasma and  their uses for the microorganism diagnostics, isolation, and  identification are addressed. In so doing, different approaches  to fusing the cells and producing the MCA-producing hybrids are  studied: using the sendai virus of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for  fusing the myeloma and lymphocyte cells, fusion in a uniform  electric field, and electroacoustic methods. As a result of the  study, MCA-producing hybridomata for M. arginini are  produced, and two MCA-producing clones are obtained. The  findings confirm that production and utilization of MCAs to  mycoplasma makes it possible to carry out species-specific  identification and diagnostics of these microorganisms.

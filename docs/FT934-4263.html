			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: Hoogovens share issue set to raise Fl 330m Hoogovens, the Dutch aluminium and steel group, has priced its issue of 8.3m new shares at Fl 40 (Dollars 21) each to raise about Fl 330m towards bolstering its balance sheet. The retail phase of the two-phase offer opened yesterday and is due to close on Tuesday. If demand is heavy, some shares earmarked for institutional investors and the Dutch state will be clawed back for sale to private investors. The first phase of the offer, a private placement of shares with institutions and the Dutch state, was oversubscribed when it closed on Thursday night. The company said the institutional placement had achieved a good spread between the Netherlands and overseas investors but it gave no further details. The state's participation could raise the national government's stake in Hoogovens to a maximum of around 17 per cent from the current 12.3 per cent. However, the decision by the city of Amsterdam to sell its 5 per cent stake in Hoogovens to institutional investors in the summer means overall ownership by public authorities will be no higher than it was before.</p>

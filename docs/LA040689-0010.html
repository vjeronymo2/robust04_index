			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT 2 RACE  </P> <P> In the race for the Los Angeles Board of Education District 2 seat, The Times  has chosen to support the candidate who will uphold the views of the giant  "bureaucracy on the hill," rather than the candidate who represents the  position of the teachers (editorial, March 29). Teachers' needs are children's  needs. Administrators are far removed from the classroom and children.  </P> <P> Mark Slavkin has the support of United Teachers of Los Angeles and many  concerned parents because they believe that remote bureaucracy cannot support  or understand the needs of children or their partners, the teachers.  </P> <P> GLORIA LASH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

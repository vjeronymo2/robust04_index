			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Prison 'knew security was lax' Prison chiefs at Whitemoor prison, Cambridgeshire, knew that security was lax in the special unit housing IRA prisoners four weeks before last week's armed breakout attempt, the Prison Officers' Association said yesterday. It said that a senior manager at the top-security prison wrote to officers staffing the unit, warning that he was 'fully aware of serious breaches of security'. The association said it had a copy of a letter dated August 9, which referred to cash and cameras being smuggled in through an area where the prisoners received visitors. On Friday six prisoners, five of them convicted IRA terrorists, made an escape attempt armed with two handguns. Mr Derek Lewis, prison service director-general, said the letter was an internal memo from a junior Whitemoor governor about general changes. It would form part of the evidence submitted to the inquiry into the escape attempt. In May last year the Prison Service had given instructions that visitors to high-risk prisoners must be thoroughly searched. The executive of the Scottish Prison Officers' Association yesterday called for a series of 24-hour strikes after a ballot approved action by a majority of nine. On a 69 per cent turnout 1,322 backed strike action, with 1,313 against. The dispute is over pay, market testing of the prison service and a proposed shake-up of grading.</p>

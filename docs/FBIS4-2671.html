			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, on an official visit to Spain, voiced here today  his opposition to the NATO air strikes against Serb positions in  Bosnia.    At a press conference held after his talks with Spanish  Prime  Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Yeltsin said those who ordered the  attacks will have to assume responsibility for possible  subsequent failure of the peace plan for the area.    Yeltsin was angered by not being consulted on the air  strikes  on Sunday and Monday, asking about how Russia could enter into  partnership with NATO when Russia is ignored constantly.    He said Russia has enough means and forces to impose its  influence on the situation in former Yugoslavia and have its  views considered in the world political arena.    Yeltsin arrived here Monday for a three-day visit for  discussions with Spanish leaders on promotion of bilateral  relations and international issues.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Wake-up call for rollover relief - In a Nutshell Capital gains tax rollover relief granted to entrepreneurs in the last UK Budget has been extended to take in shareholders in quoted companies as well as those with shares in private businesses. Before the last Budget, tax reliefs had been available to passive investors in private companies but not to the managers. The British Venture Capital Association felt this still discriminated against entrepreneurs who had taken their companies to the stock market, and lobbied further. An amendment to the Finance Bill, expected to become law shortly, extends relief 'to gains arising from the sale of quoted shares where the qualifying entrepreneur held the shares when they were unquoted'.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Pub sales bring in Pounds 440m for Bass BASS, the UK's leading brewer, yesterday spelt out the full effects of the enforced sale of 2,700 of its pubs to comply with government beer orders. Total receipts from the sales in the year to September 30 were Pounds 440m - an average price per outlet of Pounds 162,000 and 18 per cent above book value. 'We secured better value for shareholders by selling rather than leasing free of exclusive beer supplies,' said Mr Ian Prosser, chairman. The group benefited from an early start to its disposal programme. The 1,500 outlets sold before the end of 1991 realised Pounds 256m, an average of Pounds 169,000; the remaining 1,200 fetched Pounds 184m, an average of Pounds 152,000. This decline prompted a revaluation of all Bass properties, resulting in a write-down of Pounds 496m. Of this, Pounds 480m has been taken to revaluation reserve, and Pounds 16m charged to the profit and loss account. The write-down compares with a Pounds 1bn surplus at the last revaluation in 1989. Pub profits were 25 per cent lower at Pounds 174m (Pounds 231m) on turnover of Pounds 1.1bn (Pounds 1.17bn). Bass estimates that Pounds 40m of the profits decline was accounted for by the reduction in the estate. The rest was due to lower consumer spending, allied to a shift to drinking at home, and increased overheads and repair costs. All of the beer volume lost with the reduction of the tied estate, however, was recouped by the brewing division's success in the more competitive free houses trade and take-home market. Free-trade volumes grew nearly 10 per cent, and loans to free outlets increased from Pounds 398m to Pounds 485m. Supplies to the free trade now represent two-thirds of total production. There was a 5 per cent increase in volume sales to the take-home market; and a 6.5 per cent rise in exports. Bass is left with an estate of about 4,600 pubs, nearly a third of them under direct management. Spending on refurbishment and information systems amounted to Pounds 110m last year, and a further 1,000 pubs will be renovated this year. An exceptional charge of Pounds 75m this time for rationalisation and reorganisation costs within the brewing and pubs operations follows a similar charge of Pounds 55m last year. 'We do not expect any further provisions,' Mr Prosser said. With the UK restructuring almost completed, he is beginning to think tentatively about the possibilities of expanding the group's brewing operations overseas.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Industrial stocks stormed to their third successive peak in hectic trade yesterday, taking the index 108 higher to 5,950, as bullish sentiment was driven by strong demand from foreign investors, notably newly established South Africa funds in the US, writes Matthew Curtin in Johannesburg. The industrials sector carried the overall index to a new high of 5,118, up 46 on the day, as major mining financial counters also notched up sharp increases, led by Anglo American, which added R1 at R228.50 for a cumulative R38 advance since Monday last week. The gold shares index, however, shed 27 to 1,884.</p>

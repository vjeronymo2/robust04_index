			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Observer: Demon barber Wanted  - a new Butcher of Broadway. The New York Times, whose theatre reviews used to be able to make or break new Broadway shows, is changing its theatre critic. David Richards, the paper's lead theatre critic, is quitting after only a year in the job. The word is that his reviews have not been rude enough for some New Yorkers. Richards' departure would not normally be worthy of comment except for the fact that New York is the hub of US theatre and the NYT is the only voice that really matters when it comes to reviewing shows. A bad review could kill a good show when Frank Rich was sitting in the lead critic's chair. Richards' problem, on the other hand, seems to have been that his reviews have been a bit short on vitriol and this has caused a certain tension between him and his superiors. Vincent Canby, 70, the theatre critic for the Sunday NYT, is standing in for the moment, but the word is that Ben Brantley, Richards' 40-year-old deputy, is warming up in the bull pen.</p>

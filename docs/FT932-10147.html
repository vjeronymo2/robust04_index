			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Syria's economy shackled by old institutions: Government contradictions are hampering booming private sector AN EXPLOSION in the number of privately-owned imported minibuses taxiing the streets of Damascus has solved the city's public transport shortage but is causing a headache for town planners charged with reducing traffic congestion. Such is the price of Syria's drive towards economic liberalisation. While the past two years have witnessed a boom in private sector investment, fuelling impressive economic growth, contradictions remain in the government's efforts to establish a more market-oriented economy. There are no plans to sell off the large, overstaffed and inefficient public institutions. Foreign businesses are still deterred by an unwieldy two-tier foreign exchange rate, and political liberalisation remains firmly off the agenda. The regime is still cautious about how far it can go towards a free market. Economic change began in the 1980s in the wake of a severe shortage of hard currency, with the government eager to repatriate some of the many billions of dollars estimated to be held by Syrians abroad. It was spurred by the demise of communism in eastern Europe and, in particular, the break-up of the Soviet Union, Syria's leading ally, and by aid from the Gulf states grateful for President Hafez Assad's stance in the anti-Iraq coalition after the invasion of Kuwait. The government focused on the liberalisation of trade and promotion of the private sector. With 1991's Investment Law Number 10, the cornerstone of reform, investors were able to import equipment duty free, qualify for tax concessions, and repatriate profits in hard currency. Since then, the government's investment office, overseen by Mr Assad himself, has agreed to 757 private-sector projects with a total capital of SPounds 96bn (Pounds 2.87bn). As a result private sector export earnings have shot up from SPounds 1.47bn in 1989 to SPounds 6.37bn in the first 10 months of last year. This, combined with an increased production of hydrocarbons and a booming agricultural sector, resulted in real gross domestic product growth of 7 per cent last year. Agriculture last year accounted for 26.1 per cent of gross domestic product. Crude oil production averages 570,000 barrels a day and export earnings from petroleum and associated products was about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in 1992. Imports have also risen sharply because of an easing of trade restrictions. Shops are now filled with a diverse range of goods, many not available before Law Number 10, and there has been a marked increase in imported cars and agricultural machinery. According to preliminary figures from the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, Syria's import bill last year rose by 28 per cent to SPounds 36bn compared to exports of SPounds 38bn The government's growing confidence in the economy is demonstrated by the 1993 budget, approved by parliament last week, which allocates a 24 per cent increase in projected spending to SPounds 123bn. Despite the success of reforms so far, sources of investment have remained limited to mainly Syrian, Gulf, Lebanese and Jordanian interests. Most western companies are cautious of the remaining hangovers of a command economy and Syria's outmoded infrastructure. Daily power cuts and unreliable international telephone lines do little to boost foreign confidence, although a regional electricity grid with Egypt, Jordan and Turkey is planned for 1997 and Siemens of Germany this month began the installation of 700,000 telephone lines. The main deterrent to foreign investment, however, is the unwieldly foreign exchange controls, with two exchange rates and severe prison penalties for violations of these controls. Mr Khalid al-Mahayni, Syria's finance minister, says the government is committed to unifying the rates, but 'gradually, so as to avoid social difficulties'. Hydrocarbon sales and custom tariffs are calculated according to the official rate of SPounds 11.2 to the dollar, whereas 'all private sector exports are treated by the exchange rate in neighbouring countries', which closely shadows the free market rate of SPounds 43 to the dollar. In the 1993 budget, private investment projects were calculated for the first time at the exchange rate of neighbouring countries as a step towards free market competition in the region. Other planned reforms include new state-owned specialised banks for investors and exporters, and a Damascus stock exchange. Syrian entrepreneurs are unlikely, however, to be buying shares in privatised state assets. Mr Mohammad al-Imadi, minister for economy and foreign trade and one of the chief reformers of Syria's economy, says public institutions will be reformed rather than privatised. 'We believe in the public sector. It plays an important role in our infrastructure. The idea of our economic reform is not to transfer ownership, it is to add to what we already have,' he says. Reform of the public sector entails the promotion of export activities and access to hard currency banking facilities rather than redundancies and cost-cutting structural changes which would be strongly opposed by the establishment. Mr Imadi acknowledges that successful private investors will eventually seek a political voice, but while Mr Assad remains in power such a scenario is improbable. Despite speculation that he suffered further heart problems earlier this year, officials and diplomats in Damascus maintain that he is in good health. Although Syria has the potential to establish a successful mixed economy, a free market will depend on the outlook of his successor.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Post Office faces fresh investigation by MPs A powerful committee of MPs is to reopen its inquiry into the Post Office's future. The decision will intensify pressure on ministers to find ways of enabling the Post Office to secure its commercial future after the forced shelving of privatisation.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ani Parmakasiziyan: "Parliament in 1993"] </F>   [Text] Sofia, December 28 (BTA) -- Parliament had passed  74 acts and adopted 74 decisions in 1993, Parliament Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov said at the closing of the autumn session.  The bulk of the acts amend existing ones. MP's failed to  update social legislation.    Parliament also passed a package of the following acts: Tax  Proceedings Act, Tax Administration Act, Value Added Tax Act.  Their passing by mid-1993 deprived the exchequer of large  revenues, the Finance Ministry claims. The restructuring of bad  credits into a state debt was also stalled. Parliament passed  it at the end of December.    Parliament also passed several agriculture-related acts on  1993 agriculture financial backup and on 1993/1994 autumn and  spring agriculture activities financial backup. Tobacco and  Tobacco Products Act was among the most important  tobacco-related acts. Tobacco producers protests continued  despite their passing.    MP's also passed the National Police Act at the end of the  year on the structure and activity of one of the Interior  Ministry sectors. A bill on the Structure of the Legal System  was not passed.    Debates on the bills often grew into continuous political  disputes: During the debate on the 1993 Budget Act (introduced  in late April and passed in early June) during its updating  increasing budget deficit by 5,470 million leva, during a debate  on a bill amending the Supreme Judicial Council Act (passed at  first reading), which, to quote MP's from the Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS), aimed to remove Prosecutor General Ivan  Tatarchev and Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov from their  posts. MP's had a three-week debate on a SDS MP's proposal on  declassifying MP's and senior state officials' files.    Sometimes the National Assembly would pass important acts  and  decisions in the very last days preceding parliamentary recess.  This was the case with the declaration on Bulgaria's relations  with NATO passed in late December. In August MP's even cut  short their summer recess at the request of the prime minister  to pass the Amendments to the Turnover Tax and Excise Duty Act.    Over the past year MP's ratified a number of bilateral  agreements: with France, Moldova, Ukraine, Italy, Kazakhstan,  Albania and Poland. Parliament gave the cabinet term to  negotiate and sign lending agreements with different foreign  banks.    This year saw the ratification of bilateral agreements on  consolidation and rescheduling of Bulgaria's foreign debt to the  creditors of the Paris Club. The cabinet was given term to  negotiate this country's foreign debt to the commercial creditor  banks.    A special sitting of parliament in February commemorate the  50th anniversary of the deliverance of Bulgarian Jews and the  death of the Jews from Macedonia and Aegean Thrace in the Nazi  death camps. The sitting was addressed by Bulgarian President  Zhelyu Zhelev and Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss. Italian  President Luigi Scalfaro, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Council of  Europe Parliamentary Assembly Chairman Miguel Martines and North  Atlantic Assembly Chairman Louic Bouvard also addressed the  Bulgarian Parliament during their visits to this country.</p>

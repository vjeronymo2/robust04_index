			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 21 (AFP) -- The centre-right coalition  government in Belgium is to remain in power despite the  resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme after he became  embroiled in a bribery scandal, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene  said Saturday [22 January].    After meeting the leaders of the four coalition partners,  Dehaene said in a statement that they "wish the government to  continue its work."    Two other leading socialist officials of Belgium's  French-speaking regional government resigned Friday, a few hours  after Coeme.    Guy Spitaels, former Francophone Socialist Party president  and president of the French-speaking regional government, and  Guy Mathot, another member of that government, announced their  decision to the press just two hours after the Royal Palace  announced Coeme's resignation.    The three leaders had been accused of taking bribes and  channelling funds to the Socialist Party in connection with the  1988 purchase of 46 Italian Agusta helicopters for the Belgian  Army.    Coeme, 48, was defence minister at the time of the 225  million dollar purchase.    A judicial investigation was launched after the  assassination  of former Socialist Party President Andre Cools on July 18, 1991.    In an article entitled "Is a fuse necessary?" the  influential  newspaper LA LIBRE BELGIQUE wrote Friday that the affair had  caused dismay in the centre-left coalition of socialists and  christian-socialists which backs Dehaene's federal government.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Put freight on water Sir, Your article 'Rail freight wins Pounds 43m aid package' (January 19) announces increases in grants by the government to encourage companies to switch freight from road to rail. Under the same scheme, grants are also available for developments that will enable freight traffic to be transferred from roads to the inland waterways. Water transport is environmentally friendly and has the capacity to handle far more than is presently carried. Canal-borne freight currently keeps 200,000, 20-tonne lorry loads off Britain's roads every year and British Waterways, which runs the country's canals, is actively seeking opportunities to increase freight carrying on waterways.

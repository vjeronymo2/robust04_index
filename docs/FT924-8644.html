			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Renold returns to black with Pounds 0.8m RENOLD, the chain and gear maker, yesterday reported a return to profit at the interim stage, but said trading conditions remained tough. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 800,000 for the six months to October 3, compared to losses of Pounds 1.3m last time. Mr John Allan, finance director, said the improvement was due to cost and efficiency gains in the last two years. Employee numbers have been cut by about 20 per cent to 2,900, and a capital expenditure programme launched in 1989 is largely complete. Turnover fell 3 per cent to Pounds 58.4m, although Mr Allan said order levels for the year to September had improved. The chain division was helped by strong automotive and transmission chain sales. Gear products were weak, despite new product launches. UK orders improved, mainly in the chain division. The company expects volume and margin improvements for UK exports following sterling's fall in value. But Germany continued to weaken. Trading profits were Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 400,000 loss). Interest costs were slightly higher at Pounds 1m (Pounds 900,000) after net borrowings increased Pounds 2m to Pounds 14.7m, giving gearing of 28 per cent. Capital expenditure, which fell from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 5m last year, was expected to fall further to Pounds 3m this year. Earnings per share were 0.7p (losses of 2.6p).</p>

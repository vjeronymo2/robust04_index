			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 17 May, at the invitation of  Germany's Saarland Parliament and Saarland Government, Comrade  Guan Guangfu [provincial party committee secretary], leader of  the visiting Hubei Provincial Economic Delegation, held talks  with Saarland Parliament Leader (Helwig) [he lu yi de] and  Saarland Governor (Larsonden) [la song dan] on separate  occasions. The two sides held discussions on issues relating to  continued bilateral cooperation in an extremely friendly  atmosphere. Comrade Mei Xiaorong, Chinese ambassador to  Germany, was also present during the talks.    During his talks with the Saarland Parliament leader and the  Saarland governor, Comrade Guan Guangfu said: The Three Gorges  Project, a world-renowned project being built on the Changjiang,  and the 1,065-kilometer-long Changjiang Gold Channel, a project  being built in Hubei, have created new opportunities in Hubei.  Now is the best moment in Hubei's economic development, as  Hubei is becoming one of China's most dynamic regions for  foreign investment.    Comrade Guan Guangfu said: Hubei's new train of thought for  reform and opening up is as follows: To consolidate the  existing relations of cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan and expand relations of cooperation with Europe, the  United States, and Japan. At present, Hubei is attaching the  greatest importance to closer relations of cooperation with West  European countries.    This is primarily due to the following four reasons: 1)  Europe, the United States, and Japan are the most economically  developed countries and regions in the world. Only by  strengthening relations of cooperation with the most  economically developed countries and regions will we be able to  learn more new things; 2) Europe, the United States, and Japan  are known for their enormous funds as well as advanced science  and technology. Nevertheless, these countries and regions are  now bogged down in an economic quagmire. If they choose to make  investments in and transfer technology to China, both sides will  benefit;    3) Developing economic cooperation with Europe, the United  States, and Japan has remained to date the only way of  accelerating China's reform and opening up and linking China's  economy with the international economy; and 4) International  economic development and civilization are always an objective  reality independent of man's will. The interdependence among  various countries and regions is the motivating force for  development worldwide and progress, which are constantly  propelled by hi-tech development and speedy information  proliferation.    Governor (Larsonden) and Parliament Leader (Helwig) agreed  with Comrade Guan Guangfu, saying: Your friendly visit is bound  to further promote more substantive bilateral cooperation  between Hubei and Saarland. There are still many areas in which  Hubei and Saarland can complement each other; for example, Hubei  is much better than Saarland in respect of using inferior coal  to generate electricity and in manufacturing auto spare parts.  We are very willing to cooperate with Hubei in this regard.  Governor (Larsonden) also laid special emphasis on cultural and  artistic cooperation and exchanges between Hubei and Saarland.    Hubei Province and Germany's Saarland signed an economic and  technological cooperation agreement in 1986. Over the past  eight years, the two sides have carried out some exchanges and  must do more in this area in the future. The two sides pledged  to join hands in opening up new vistas for more substantive  bilateral cooperation in economic, technological, and other  fields after the visit.</p>

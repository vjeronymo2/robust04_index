			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / O'Reilly urges Independent summit Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland, appealed yesterday for everyone involved in the bid for The Independent to meet for talks on the newspaper group's future. The call was made when Mr O'Reilly, who is also chief executive of HJ Heinz, the international food group, yesterday met Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent. 'It was good that we met. I am sorry we did not meet earlier,' said Mr O'Reilly, who bought 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing - owners of The Independent - on the day the consortium that includes Mr Whittam Smith made an offer for the company. 'I said what I have said all along that all the parties should get together,' said Mr O'Reilly, a former Irish rugby international over in the UK this weekend for the Ireland-England rugby game. 'I think that there is a realistic chance that the interested parties will come together to discuss. I am not sure there is a realistic chance they will agree,' he added. The consortium, which brings together Mirror Group Newspapers, the El Pais newspaper of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy and the main founders of Newspaper Publishing, already owns just under 48 per cent of the company. It is expected to make a higher offer for the company next week but it is believed that no final decision has yet been taken. Mr O'Reilly and the Irish Independent clearly have the money to finance the loss-making Newspaper Publishing or seek a larger stake.</p>

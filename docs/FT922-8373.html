			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Observer: Defense de pooper Paris' mayor Jacques Chirac is determined to get to grips with the one enormous stain on his reputation for city management. He has declared war on his city's 200,000-strong canine population. For the past nine years, Paris' front-line defence has been its squadron of green and white motos crottes. With an estimated 10 tonnes of dog dirt dumped daily on the city's 2,500 km of pavements, Chirac's pooper scooters have been kept on round-the-clock alert. Armed with vacuum tubes, they buzz around schlurping up every little mess in sight. But, as with painting the Forth Bridge, the problem piles up anew behind them. However, the time has come, says Chirac, for the citoyens to take a stand. His officials cannot let the bill for running the motos crottes - FFr 43m a year - rise any higher. So those Parisians who dare lift their eyes from the pavement should not be fooled by the delightful new posters by cartoonist Ronald Searle round the city, one showing a desperate owner on his knees, begging his dog to use the gutter. The propaganda is just a diversion. Chirac's most potent weapon is a new list of fines of up to FFr 1,300 for owners of naughty dogs. Not only are the fines considerably tougher than comparable penalties in London and New York, but they also put the fastidious Swiss to shame.</p>

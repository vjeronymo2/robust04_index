			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Car remains most common perk THE CAR is still the most common perk offered by British companies, although one in five is now letting employees trade cars for a higher salary. The findings, published yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry, indicate that employee benefits have not generally been cut during the recession, although companies are tightening up on administration costs. The CBI said it was surprised that perks had survived relatively unscathed, in view of the heavy costs they added to pay bills. Benefits typically add 10 per cent to 15 per cent to the salary costs of basic-level employees, and 40 per cent to 50 per cent for executives. At very senior levels, benefits might add up to as much as, or more than, the salary itself, the CBI said. The survey was carried out with management consultants Towers Perrin and is said to be the largest of its kind ever conducted in the UK. More than 600 organisations with a combined workforce of about 3m were questioned. Almost all companies surveyed - 98 per cent - offer cars to at least some of their employees. Cars even outstripped pensions, which were provided by 93 per cent of companies, and life assurance, also offered by 93 per cent. Bottom of the perks league were vouchers for childcare, at 2 per cent, with on-site creches not far ahead on 4 per cent. The CBI said the survey highlighted the way benefits policies were lagging behind changes in the workforce. Companies said the main change in their workforces was the growth in the number of employees with spouses who were also earning. Almost as many cited an increase in employees' average ages and an increase in the number of women workers. Companies had not adapted benefits to those changes. In particular, little account had been taken of the increase in dual-income families, and it was possible that some benefits were being unnecessarily duplicated. For example, a majority of companies continued to pay for private medical insurance cover for spouses when it was possible that those spouses now qualified for medical cover in their own right. There was also evidence that older workers valued non-monetary benefits such as being allowed to increase their supervisory role and act as mentors to younger colleagues, the CBI said. Many employers are reviewing their policies on cars because of increasing costs and because forthcoming Inland Revenue reforms may mean that tax payments increase by up to 40 per cent for company car drivers. Companies in the financial sector and those with US parents were leading the field in substituting cash for company cars or eliminating car schemes altogether, the survey found. While many employees were now taking money instead of cars, the same flexibility was not on offer for other benefits. Pensions were offered on a flexible basis by 7 per cent of the companies but more than 3 per cent of employers offered choice on no other perk.

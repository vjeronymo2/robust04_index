			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Russian Government's Cavalier </F> Attitude Clouds Opening of Washington Exhibition"]    [Text] Washington -- In an attempt that is desperate  rather than just bold, the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs [RUIE] has brought several hundred examples of our  advanced technology to the U.S. capital, set them up in  Washington's best exhibition hall, lodged in hotels 450 leading  people from all over Russia, set the lowest possible price for a  visit to the exhibition ($10), and sat back to wait for success,  trusting that the event will at least prove promising to the  degree where people say: "You never can tell."    But even with such a sense of humor you do not feel like  joking here. You get the impression that the exhibition's  organizers did not burden themselves too much with the questions  of where, when, for what purpose, and for whom they were holding  it.    There are no industrial enterprises in Washington. Not one.  The city lives on three sources of income: the government,  tourism, and social benefits from the state. "We have not  mounted the exhibition for gapers but for professionals," RUIE  Chairman A.I. Volskiy said on opening it, as though responding  to this doubt. "There is no particular need to entice  professionals, for they themselves will come running to exhibits  such as we have here."    The experienced A. Volskiy probably employed this approach  inherited from the Soviet philosophy of waiting in line ("If a  commodity is good, a buyer will turn up") not out of stagnant  conservatism but out of grim necessity. The exhibition, which  his union spent a whole year preparing, was in desperate need of  money. Just three days before it opened, it was on the verge of  ruin. "If Moscow Mayor Luzhkov had not opened credits for us at  the last minute, the exhibition simply would not have happened,"  V.A. Nikulin, Volskiy's deputy in the RUIE, said.    When and how the Entrepreneurs' Union, which has gotten  deeply into debt with this exhibition, will manage to justify  Moscow's credit is a special question. It is only clear that in  business contacts no special hopes should be pinned on  governmental structures. Both presidents, B. Yeltsin and B.  Clinton, did the exhibition the honor of signing greetings  messages almost a month before it started. The U.S. President  was magnanimous: "Today more than ever the development of the  world economy has become dependent on trade expansion and access  to world markets. Competition among countries is growing, and  under these conditions not one of them can manage without  developing and strengthening political and economic ties which  contribute to countries' prosperity and well-being. This  dependence has been manifested particularly vividly in the  growing friendship of Russia and the United States. From joint  space research and solutions for ecological problems to the  development of advanced telecommunications systems our two  peoples are marching at the front of the world community of  nations."    B.N. Yeltsin was more specific in his greetings message and  emphasized the promising nature of "large-scale" U.S.  investments in Russia's economy and of joint work in the markets  of third countries.    It is already known that the contract part of the exhibition  is bound to succeed, since, according to Volskiy, approximately  50 contracts agreed beforehand will have been signed by the time  it closes. But there is doubt about the accuracy of this  figure, since too much is unpredictable in the course of it --  all the innovations, alas, are of an unpleasant nature.    Above all, Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime  minister, refused at the last minute to fly in to participate in  the exhibition. "When Soskovets was picked for the trip here,  everything was proceeding OK, we reported here. The Americans  raised (their participation) to the level of Secretary Brown.  Now an arms deal with Malaysia has unexpectedly -- well, maybe  not for IZVESTIYA, but for you -- unexpectedly cropped up, and a  huge number of MiG-29's are being sold to it. Soskovets is  snatched away from our trip and dashes off to Malaysia to sign  this contract. Naturally, this side also lets its commerce  secretary go to South Africa for the ceremony along with Hillary  Clinton, the President's wife, and Vice President Gore."    This was how Volskiy explained this strange situation, when  a  Russian Government leader is "snatched away" from a previously  agreed program, as a result of which the U.S. side is obliged  urgently to send its secretary further out of Washington, so as  not to find himself in an awkward situation and to respond to  the cavalier attitude of his Moscow colleagues.    As for the "huge deal," about which A.I. Volskiy deemed it  necessary to speak "off the record," naturally Washington knew  of it the day the accords were reached, i.e. 6 May. But it  cannot have occurred to anyone here that the sale of 18 fighters  (precisely this is the extent of the "huge deal") to Malaysia  would take place at the expense of a provocative gesture toward  America's government and business world.    To all appearances, since the first beginnings of a market  in  our life too little time has passed for our leaders to realize,  not just in mere words but really and truly, the importance of  business and businessmen at the end of the second millennium AD.  It is possible that our Oleg Soskovets will still somehow come  to an arrangement with Secretary Brown. Governments do not bear  grudges. But U.S. businessmen, who over the past 200 years have  never had experience of functioning under a government which  takes 93 percent of their profit and so are none too tolerant of  loutishness from their own capital, are still less inclined to  tolerate it from someone else's.    If you compare the level of the technologies exhibited, then  President Clinton's words about a people marching "at the front  of the world community" are largely justified. But the poor  organization, the wretched staging, the plainly unsuccessful  venue, and the arrogant disdain of our own government place the  exhibition "Russian Technologies-94" clearly in a ranking below  similar events conducted in the United States not only by  countries such as Brazil or South Korea but also the Czech  Republic, Poland, and Romania.    The commercial training of the Russian guests is altogether  beneath all criticism. Although the majority of them are  splendid professionals with a profound and comprehensive  knowledge of their own technologies, they freeze with ineptness  or blush like maidens at such a simple and natural question as:  How much? Some were offering their products for sale on the  U.S. market at such fabulously low prices that visitors could  not help thinking about perfidious Russian dumping. They would  be talking with a representative from Kaluga and would be  astounded, as he himself was astounded, to learn that products  analogous with his cost not $3 in Washington stores, as he was  sincerely convinced, but a whole $30.    Just as irreproachably naive were not only vendors of car  mirrors and distinctive picture-frame moldings but also  developers of superaccurate missiles for the Navy. They too  were flummoxed by the questions: How much? When will you  deliver? How will you train personnel?    In the hotel where the leaders of Russian enterprises and  scientific research establishments, which frequently do, in  actual fact, march at the front of the "whole planet," are  staying, the prudent management disconnected the telephones in  the rooms in advance. In America, as is known, a hotel guest  pays not only for international calls but also for calls within  the city itself. Experience shows that Russians vacate their  room, refusing to pay not only for local calls but also for  lengthy intercontinental calls.    If RUIE Chairman A.I. Volskiy conceived this exhibition as a  demonstration of his own organizing abilities, then the  experiment should be considered perfectly successful. It was  very difficult, very troublesome, and very expensive to hold  such an event. But if solid business contacts had been planned  as the desired result, then resources should be saved up for the  next time, when the chief motive will be not "they will come  running themselves" but "the customer is always right."    The exhibition will last three days and will end Thursday 12  May. Provision has not been made to continue it in other U.S.  cities.</p>

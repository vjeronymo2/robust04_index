			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JCS: "Overview of Party Programs"] </F>   [Excerpts] Brussels, 27 May (BELGA) -- Christian  People's Party (CVP): The CVP, "more than ever," is  advocating a united Europe. The Flemish christian democrats feel  that the Maastricht Treaty is just an intermediate step. They  want to go much further, because they feel that attacking  unemployment, reviving the economy, making the environment  healthy, and guaranteeing peace and security can only be  achieved within the framework of the European Union (EU).    The party's aim is not a free trade zone, but a democratic,  federal, and political union with a bigger role for the European  Parliament (EP). The EP must be put on an equal footing with  the Council of Ministers, which must be expanded to include a  second chamber. All this must be enshrined in a European  constitution. In order to achieve a strong economy, the CVP  wants Europe to forge an Economic and Monetary Union, with a  common currency. In order to stimulate employment, the CVP  advocates the reduction of labor costs and the implementation of  the white paper.    A powerful social policy must be followed. The social and  fiscal systems of the member states must be better geared toward  each other. The economy must work in an ecologically  responsible manner. Moreover, the CVP wants a powerful foreign  and security policy, a European approach to organized crime and  drug trafficking, and a harmonized refugee policy. The CVP  feels that it is more important to deepen the EU than enlarge  it. [passage omitted]    Socialist Party (SP): As far as Europe goes, the  SP is opting for the lesser evil. The SP accepted the  Maastricht Treaty since it preferred an all too liberal Europe  to the threat of a nationalistic Europe. According to the  social democrats, the Maastricht Treaty contains a lot more,  however, than a stringent reorganization of government finances.  They say that "more Europe" is needed to make unemployment  fall, to close all the tax loopholes, to halt cross-border  pollution and crime, and to make provisions for refugees.    The SP also advocates "another" Europe: A tolerant,  democratic, and federal union based on a strong EP and smoothly  working European social consultation process. More attention  must be paid to the redistribution of labor. This recovery plan  must also be corrected in social and ecological terms. Labor  must be taxed less and environmental pollution taxed more.  Social exclusion and social dumping must be combatted fiercely.    The SP also advocates a radical approach to fraud and more  fiscal justice. At a time when the European governments are  reorganizing with a view to the creation of a Monetary Union,  income from capital should be regulated at European level. In  addition, the SP wants an active foreign and security policy.  The SP feels that the EU enlargement must go hand in hand with  further deepening.    Flemish Bloc (VB): The VB wants to have "great  virtue" in Europe. The "pervasive meddlesomeness" and the  "pressure for harmonization" of the European bureaucracy must be  driven back. The broadening of the EU's powers, as set out in  the Maastricht Treaty, including in the areas of education and  culture, must be reduced, and the EP may not receive any  additional powers. The VB has adopted an anti-European stance.    Instead of giving priority to economic and monetary affairs,  Europe must put the emphasis on the "cultural character" of its  peoples. The party, which says it favors more political  respectability, wants to send "non-European guest workers back  to their country of origin." Stringent measures must be taken  to combat crime and drug-related crime in a Europe without  internal borders. Only an independent Flanders, which should  receive 15 seats in the EP, can defend Flemish interests in  Europe. In order to counteract the spread of French language  versus Dutch in Brussels and the surrounding area, the European  institutions must disappear from the Flemish capital.    Flemish Liberal Democrats (VLD): For the VLD, the  European elections are mainly a test case for the policy of the  Belgian Government of Christian-Democrats and Socialists, who  are also pulling the strings in Europe. According to the VLD,  national governments should no longer hide behind Europe when  enforcing unpopular measures, and Europe should be taken out of  the hands of labor unions, lobbies, and pressure groups.    The Flemish liberals advocate an overt administration within  a federal and democratic Europe. The party wants the citizens  to become more actively involved in Europe. Citizens should be  given the opportunity to have their say about the policy through  referendums, and to elect the leader of a European government  directly. The EP should get constitutional powers, and be on a  par with the European Council of Ministers. Its members should  give up jobs which threaten their impartiality.    The VLD wants our country to meet the Maastricht criteria,  so  that it can join the Monetary Union from the very outset, at the  latest in 1999. In the economic field, Europe should safeguard  fair competition. Economic support measures and subsidies  should be done away with, even in the agricultural sector. The  tax burden should be reduced. Social dumping and inequality  between regions should be leveled out by providing direct  support to the social security systems of member states which  have underdeveloped regions.    The VLD warns against the danger of the European Union (EU)  being reduced to a free trade area as a result of its expansion.  The VLD also urges for a European foreign, security, and  defense policy, and for a European approach to environmental  problems, crime, and migration. Once a year, the EU should  determine how many foreigners it will admit on economic grounds.    The People's Union (VU): The VU advocates a  Europe in which regions and national communities can preserve  their own identities. The member states' influence should be  curtailed to achieve a transparent, democratic, and federal  Europe. That is why the party favors a direct representation of  Flanders and Wallonia in the Council of Ministers. For the VU,  the Regional Committee is a prefiguration of a senate of regions  and peoples, which should replace the present Council of  Ministers and carry out the constitutional work along with the  EP.    The completion of the unified market must not be at the  expense of the environment. A European social policy is  urgently required, and the gap between poor and rich regions  should be narrowed. According to the VU, the white paper does  not go far enough. Lower taxes on labor and the reduction of  working hours are indispensable for more employment.  Furthermore, the EU should conduct an active peace policy, and  action should be taken to counteract the spread of French  language versus Dutch in Brussels and the surrounding area, and  against the pressure on the real estate market as a result of  the presence of European institutions.

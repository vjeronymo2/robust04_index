			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Steep rise in complaints over life assurance sales SHARP PRACTICE among life assurance sales agents is rising steeply, according to Lautro, the self-regulatory body that oversees the industry. In its annual report on monitoring and enforcement in the year to June 1991, Lautro recorded a big increase in consumer complaints, mostly about over-selling and the sale of unsuitable products. Complaints rose 77 per cent to more than 4,000. Lautro has changed some membership rules to curb excesses. Some of the increase in complaints could reflect growing consumer awareness of the regulatory body, Lautro said, but there was little doubt that sharp practice had increased. For instance, Lautro found a majority of life assurance companies that rely heavily on tied sales agents - roughly half of all life companies  - 'have serious compliance shortcomings'. The companies have typically failed to comply with rules on checking references, curbing the enthusiasm of new sales agents or providing proper training. Failure to comply with these rules is closely linked to mis-selling. Tied agents are those not employed directly by life assurance companies but who sell the products of one company exclusively and receive commission for each policy they sell. Typically, insurance companies pay far higher commissions to tied agents than to independent financial advisers who sell the best product of a group of companies. A recent study by the Securities and Investments Board found that up to 44 per cent of policies sold by tied agents were cancelled within the first two years, an indication that the policy was mis-sold in the first place. Lautro also found a large increase in the number of investors questioning the advice they had received on personal pensions, particularly where sales agents had urged the transfer out of attractive occupational pension schemes into less attractive private ones. 'Company representatives too often fail to make a sufficiently detailed realistic or objective analysis of the relative merits of transferring their prospective investors to a personal pension or leaving them in their occupational scheme,' Lautro said in its report. It said the number of complaints about personal pensions could understate the extent of the problem. Pensions generally are so complex that few people know whether they have been misled.</p>

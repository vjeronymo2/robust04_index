			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / De Klerk meets Buthelezi over ANC ultimatum SOUTH AFRICA'S president, Mr F W de Klerk, yesterday met the Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in an attempt to end the country's township violence and prevent the collapse of the negotiating process with the African National Congress. Mr de Klerk said that he told Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, during more than three hours of talks that he planned to go ahead with curbs on the right of Zulu tribesmen to carry traditional weapons. The ANC has threatened to boycott talks on a new constitution from tomorrow unless the government acts to end violence by complying with a seven-point ultimatum it issued last month, which included the banning of traditional weapons and the sacking of the cabinet ministers in charge of security. Inkatha insists that spears and clubs are part of Zulu culture. The ANC argues that Zulu weapons increase hostilities in black townships. Mr de Klerk said last night that details of the clampdown on weapons would be withheld until he had met Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the ANC, some time before tomorrow's deadline. The Star newspaper of Johannesburg said yesterday that the ANC would reconsider its threat to pull out of talks with the government if legislation banning traditional weapons was approved; if the government took steps to phase out single-sex workers' hostels - centres of township violence; and if assurances were given that the police would act impartially in township clashes. The ANC has accused police of siding with Inkatha, and it has demanded the hostels be converted into family dwellings. High-ranking ANC officials released a solemnly worded pledge for peace yesterday which made no accusations but reiterated the ANC's position, in a less-demanding style than usual. 'It is the duty of the government to protect all citizens. In particular, the security forces must not favour any party or organisation,' said the statement. 'Individuals must not be allowed to carry weapons in public, traditional or otherwise.' Of the remaining demands, the ANC has abandoned its insistence that Mr de Klerk sack his ministers of law and order and defence; and progress has previously been made on the ANC's call for a commission of inquiry into violence, for the suspension of police officers involved in some recent township killings, and for the disbanding of counter-insurgency units.</p>

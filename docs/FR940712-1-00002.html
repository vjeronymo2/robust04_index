The proposed rule is a necessary supplement to the Executive Branch-wide Standards and has been designed to address the specialized functions and operations of the Corporation. The proposed rule would establish: prohibitions on borrowing and extensions of credit; prohibitions on the ownership of certain financial interests; prohibitions on the purchase of property controlled by the Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); limitations on official dealings with former employers and clients; disqualification requirements relating to employment of family members outside the Corporation; and limitations on outside employment activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before September 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Send comments to Robert E.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published the Standards of Ethical Conduct For Employees of the Executive Branch. See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57 FR 52583, with an additional grace period extension at 59 FR 4779&hyph;4780. The Executive Branch-wide Standards, now codified at 5 CFR part 2635 and effective February 3, 1993, establish uniform standards of ethical conduct for executive branch employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the concurrence of the OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (P.L. 103&hyph;204) authorize the Corporation to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations necessary to implement its ethics programs. The Corporation and OGE have determined that the following supplemental regulations contained in the proposed rule are necessary to successfully continue the Corporation's ethics program in light of the Corporation's unique programs and operations. The proposed supplemental rule addresses issues relevant to the Corporation's specialized roles as the insurer, conservator, receiver, liquidator, organizer of bridge banks, and regulator or back-up enforcement agency for FDIC-insured depository institutions. Upon finalization of the supplemental regulation, the Corporation will, as proposed, delete those portions of 12 CFR part 336 that are superseded by the Executive Branch-wide Standards and the supplemental regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Analysis of Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following regulations are proposed to appear in new part 3201 of 5 CFR chapter XXII.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3201.101&blank;General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;3201.101(a) explains that the regulations would apply to all Corporation employees and would supplement the Executive Branch-wide Standards. Because they are covered under rules applicable to the Department of the Treasury, two members of the Board of Directors, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, would be covered only by those provisions of the supplemental regulation specifically made applicable to them in connection with their activities as members of the Corporation's Board of Directors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Corporation ethics officials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;3201.101(b) explains that the Designated Agency Ethics Official would be the Executive Secretary and that the Alternate Agency Ethics Official would be the Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics) of the FDIC. This provision would delegate authority to the Executive Secretary and the Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics) to act in such capacities as contemplated under 5 CFR part 2638. The provision would continue the designations currently found at 12 CFR part 336, as updated to accommodate organizational changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agency designees. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;3201.101(c) specifies those employees who would hold the authority to act as agency designees under the Executive Branch-wide Standards and the supplemental regulation. It also explains that only the Ethics Counselor or Alternate Ethics Counselor would be able to delegate authority to act as agency designees and that such delegation would have to be in writing and could not be re-delegated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;3201.101(d) would include as an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> affiliate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  those companies which control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, an FDIC-insured depository institution. The definition for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> affiliate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was taken from the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and is intended to be broadly interpreted and include any holding companies, subsidiaries, or other affiliated companies of an FDIC-insured depository institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> appropriate director <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would include the heads of offices and divisions in the Washington office, the highest ranking officials in each division in the regional offices, and the Ethics Counselor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> covered employee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would include all employees of the Corporation required to file confidential or public financial disclosure reports under 5 CFR part 2634 or 5 CFR part 3202.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

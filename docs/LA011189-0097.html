			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR STRESSES PRESSER AIDES' ROLE IN TRIAL'S CLOSING ARGUMENTS  </P> <P> Wrapping up a 2 1/2-month labor racketeering trial, a federal prosecutor argued  Tuesday that Teamsters union President Jackie Presser and two associates  embezzled $700,000 to pay "friends or cronies" who did no union work.  </P> <P> In closing arguments to jurors in U.S. District Court, prosecutor Stephen  Jigger stressed the role of Presser's associates in the alleged embezzlement  scheme. Presser died last July, more than two years after his indictment in the  case.  </P> <P> Harold Friedman, a Teamsters international vice president and Ohio's most  powerful Teamster, and Anthony Hughes, Teamsters Local 507 recording secretary,  have been on trial since Oct. 24.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Dedicated Leader  </P> <P> An attorney for Friedman argued that his client is a dedicated labor leader who  would not participate in such a scheme.  </P> <P> The trial included testimony from 80 witnesses, many of whom were asked  detailed questions about day-to-day Teamsters operations.  </P> <P> Pretrial documents included revelations about Presser's role as an FBI  informant, saying he provided the bureau with information about the union and  alleged links to organized crime.  </P> <P> Presser was the fourth of the last five Teamsters international presidents to  be indicted; he had inherited the job from Roy Williams when Williams was sent  to prison for conspiring to bribe a U.S. senator.  </P> <P> But Presser's declining health caused repeated postponements of the trial, and  his death from brain cancer left only Friedman and Hughes as co-defendants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Racketeering Counts  </P> <P> Friedman, 66, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering, two of  embezzlement and two of filing false reports with the Labor Department. He is  president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters, leader of Teamsters Joint  Council 41 in northeast Ohio and president of both Teamsters Local 507 and  Bakery Workers Local 19 in Cleveland.  </P> <P> Hughes, 52, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and one of  embezzlement. The government contends Hughes was a "ghost employee" at Bakery  Workers Local 19, which is affiliated with Teamsters Local 507 and shares an  office with it.  </P> <P> The case will go to the jury after closing arguments are completed and U.S.  District Judge George W. White issues instructions on the law.  </P></p>

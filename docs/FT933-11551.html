			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US trade watchdog displays its mettle over steel - By dismissing 'unfair' complaints the ITC has sent a clear signal that it is not a puppet of Washington political lobbies the heartland of 'Big Steel' in the US - after the International Trade Commission this week threw out 40 of 72 'unfair' trade complaints on steel, the reaction in Pittsburgh, California, was profound relief. 'I'm thrilled that the ITC voted for free trade and American jobs,' said Mr Bill Baker, the California district's congressman, who had warned that a tariff on hot-rolled steel from Korea would have 'killed' the state-of-the-art USS-POSCO steel finishing plant there, built as a joint venture between US Steel and the South Korean group Pohang Steel. The ITC decision to overturn so many provisional dumping and countervailing duties came as a shock to many. It sent important signals to US steelmakers that they cannot expect protection as they struggle to compete with new technologies and depressed international demand. Tumbling share prices were an eloquent measure of public reaction. It also sent important signals to foreign governments that the ITC is not a puppet of Washington's political lobbies. At a time when the fairness of the US anti-dumping regime is being questioned, it showed the law can and does work more objectively than many like to believe. Mr Baker's joy at the negative injury finding on the Korean product was shared by many US steel users who feared the duties would damage their international competitiveness. The country's integrated steelmakers took a dimmer view. Of the 7.8m tonnes of flat-rolled steel covered by the steel industry's original complaints - which were upheld by the Commerce Department in January this year, triggering the imposition of provisional duties - just 3.4m tonnes will now be subject to duties ranging up to 109 per cent. 'It's hard to judge the results as you would a ball game,' said Mr Jon Jenson, spokesman for the Coalition of American Businesses for Stable Steel Supplies, which represents steel users. The losing users would either have to pay high tariffs on their imports and find themselves uncompetitive internationally or find a domestic source of less satisfactory domestic supplies, Mr Jenson said. The 12 US steelmakers who filed their allegations of dumping and unfair subsidies last year, after the collapse of international negotiations aimed at a Multilateral Steel Agreement, were glum yesterday. They have poured millions of dollars into legal fees on the cases, and are now considering spending millions more. They might appeal against the ITC decision to the Court of International Trade, or bring new cases in the coming months, a spokesmen said. But it was more than steel imports that were on trial on Tuesday when the ITC commissioners each cast 72 votes, product by product, on whether dumped or subsidised imports were injuring the domestic industry. It was the commission itself on trial, before a world trading community which - misunderstanding the complexities of the US 'unfair trade' regime - generally suspects its findings may be politically 'fixed' by the administration. Although many trade lawyers believe the laws are biased towards the domestic industry, the ITC was designed to screen out politics. No more than three of the six commissioners can be of one party; terms are for nine years, and a commissioner cannot serve a second full term. The commissioners cannot discuss their votes among themselves, and hear each other's votes for the first time when the public does. Mrs Paula Stern, a former ITC chairwoman, was unsurprised by Tuesday's vote. 'The cynicism about the independence of the commission is grossly unfair,' she said. During the vote on Tuesday Mr David Rohr, a Democratic commissioner, addressed accusations that politics played a role in the ITC's finding. 'Though there may be differing political persuasions among commissioners, that has no bearing on today's result,' he said. One by one the commissioners described sifting through mountains of evidence  -25,000 pages of questionnaire responses, and 61 volumes of briefs - and the factors they had to assess in reaching their decisions. Ms Janet Nuzum, a Democratic commissioner, said: 'The fact that different commissioners have decided differently in particular products or particular countries is a reflection of the variety of factors we must consider, the extensiveness of the evidence, and the complexity of the record.' Ms Carol Crawford, a Republican commissioner, caught the mood of most when she said she believed a small amount of imports were 'unlikely to have an adverse effect on the domestic industry's market share price or revenues'. But where the import penetration was significant, she voted for injury. The way is now clear for negotiation of a Multilateral Steel Agreement, where, according to Mrs Stern, 'negotiators had their hands tied because they had the dumping cases pending'. Still, she warned, the MSA 'must not be seen as nirvana' because it will deal only with steel subsidies, and thus dumping, in the future. 'We still have a raging debate in the Uruguay Round on how the dumping laws should operate,' she said, adding that the US anti-dumping regime still failed to recognise the needs of steel users whose exports must compete abroad.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Baillie Gifford to manage Provincial's investments Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh investment management company, is to manage the stock market investments of Provincial Insurance, the privately-owned general insurance company. The Pounds 420m of funds will bring the total managed by Baillie Gifford to Pounds 5bn, reinforcing its position as the largest Scottish fund manager and one of the leading independent fund managers in Britain. Provincial, based at Kendal, Cumbria, hived off its life assurance and unit trust business to Prolific in 1988 to concentrate on general insurance. Baillie Gifford is to manage Provincial's insurance reserves and general funds, which were managed by Prolific. Last year Baillie Gifford won the contract to manage Provincial's company pension fund. The Provincial fund will be the largest single block of money under management at Baillie Gifford after Scottish Mortgage, its biggest investment trust.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY MAY BE TRIED IN KILLING OF GIRL  </P> <P> Since we don't have the funds to fight the gun-happy NRA, maybe we need a law  to prohibit children under 14 from firing guns. Children under 14 are involved  in 250 shooting deaths a year.  </P> <P> This 9-year-old Cub Scout, Bible class leader and honor roll student may be  tried for murder. The tragedy occurred in Pennsylvania, where the law states  anyone charged with murder must be charged as an adult, no matter what the age.  </P> <P> ALLEN LIDYOFF  </P> <P> Montebello  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TURNER TO STUDY MGM/UA BOOKS  </P> <P> Turner Broadcasting System Inc. has sent representatives to California to study  MGM/UA Communications Co.'s financial records, even though the Turner board  recently cut off discussions on a bid for the troubled movie studio, it was  reported today.  </P> <P> The Atlanta Constitution quoted unidentified sources as saying Turner  Broadcasting is researching finances of the studio to help Chairman Ted Turner  ascertain a "fair price" for MGM/UA. Turner spokesmen had no comment on the  matter.  </P> <P> Some analysts have estimated the studio could sell for $1.7 billion. But a  previous $1.5-billion MGM/UA sale agreement with Qintex Australia Ltd. fell  apart in October, and News Corp. Ltd., which bid $1.25 billion for the studio,  apparently dropped out of the bidding.  </P> <P> Ted Turner wants to bid for MGM/UA in partnership with Tele-Communications Inc.  of Denver, the nation's largest cable-TV operator and Turner Broadcasting's  biggest shareholder after Turner, the paper said.  </P></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Report beggars to the police, PM tells public An effort to clear Britain's streets of beggars was urged by Mr John Major yesterday. The prime minister called on the public to be 'rigorous' in reporting beggars to the police. He pointed out that they could be fined up to Pounds 1,000 and jailed for up to three years if they resorted to violence.

Beggars were an eyesore and could drive tourists and shoppers away from cities. They caused offence to many and their activities were particularly damaging to areas dependent on tourism. Mr Major maintained that the social security system made begging unnecessary, and called on those responsible not to shrink from enforcing the rigorous penalties that were available.

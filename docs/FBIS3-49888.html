			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Ion Ratiu, vice president of the National </F> Peasant Christian Democratic Party, Petre Roman, president of  the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front), and Niculae  Spiroiu, minister of national defense, to journalists Christiana  Terenche and Clementina Filip on NATO's Partnership for Peace  offer; place and date not given: "Reactions to Partnership for  Peace"]    [Text]  <H3>  Ion Ratiu, President of the Foreign Policy  Commission of the Chamber of Deputies: "The Responsibility Is  Ours" </H3>   This is the best solution we could have hoped for, since the  alternative would have been to have the Visegrad countries  immediately accepted under the NATO umbrella. In such a  situation, we would have been left outside the Western defense  system and would have inevitably had to gravitate toward the  CIS. Although it is not perfect from our viewpoint, since it  does not offer us firm guarantees, the "Partnership for Peace"  project gives us the opportunity to gradually move toward  fulfilling the minimum requirements for our integration in the  alliance. At the same time, the "Partnership for Peace" means  that no discrimination is being made between the former  communist countries in Eastern Europe. Romania has announced in  advance its intention of accepting the "Partnership for Peace"  formula. The only question mark remains whether NATO might not  subjectively decide, in the forthcoming future, that the  Visegrad countries are capable of qualifying, while we are not.  Therefore, it is up to us to prove that we are a positive asset  for the alliance in this part of Europe. Romania has now the  possibility of proving that it deserves to be included in NATO.  The responsibility is ours, hence our task is to prove that we  can qualify for integration in the alliance.  <H3>  Petre Roman, NATO rapporteur for Eastern Europe: "The Time  Factor Plays an Essential Role" </H3>   The "Partnership for Peace" is a compromise between two  obvious trends and situations currently prevailing in Europe.  On the one hand, the very pressing request of the former  communist countries, including Romania, to accede to the status  of NATO member and, on the other hand, Russia's categorical  rejection of an eventual expansion of NATO. The argument of the  former communist countries -- an argument which I also sustained  before various international forums -- is that Russia remains an  exceptionally great power, with a very strong military machine  and a pretty vague new military doctrine, while the old strategy  linked to the Soviet imperialist spirit is still prevalent.  Russia claims that the entire process of democratization and  reform is going to be endangered by NATO's expansion, which  would be tantamount to an expansion of the bloc policy,  something that prevailed during the Cold War period. What is  certain is that we are left with the feeling of a possible  revival of Russian imperialism, for reasons that are well-known  in our history. Therefore, I believe that the target of our  integration in NATO -- until we become full-fledged members --  is the main task of the Romanian foreign policy. On the other  hand, the solution with the "Partnership for Peace" only offers  some thinking time off to everybody. The United States cannot  accept the viewpoint of the Russian imperialism and is obliged  to make all efforts to dissociate itself from such a trend. It  is obvious that the time factor plays an essential role. The  revival of imperialist trends would mean a lot of sorrow and  material sacrifice for the Russian people. The "Partnership for  Peace" also emphasizes another trend, that of concrete U.S.  disengagement from Europe. The United States has major  problems, economic and particularly social. The same applies to  Western Europe. The problem is the following: In this  precarious economic context, on what terms can security be  ensured? One cannot forget that NATO is not only a political  body, but mainly a military one. Therefore, ensuring a balance  also presupposes deterrence, particularly deterrence of the  Russian imperialist tendencies. Consequently, the functioning  of the "Partnership for Peace" scheme implies the achievement of  its declared goal. In practical terms, it means deterring any  influences and tactics through which Russia may attempt to pull  the ropes in Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe.  <H3>  Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, Minister of National  Defense: "The Romanian Military Is Capable of Integrating in  NATO" </H3>   In my opinion, the "Partnership for Peace" is a much better  solution than the discriminatory admittance of East and Central  European states to NATO, provided that it is a provisional step  and permits access to the European defense structures. From our  viewpoint, that is from the viewpoint of the Romanian military  body, I believe that it is capable of integration in the  military structures of the alliance's member states, thanks to  the reform measures it has adopted thus far.</p>

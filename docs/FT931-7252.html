			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Brussels aid to help ailing industrial areas THE EUROPEAN Commission intends to devote more resources to poor and industrially declining regions, including Merseyside in the UK, and eastern Germany. The Commission yesterday adopted a plan to try to arrest industrial decline as part of the Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 117bn) EC structural aid programme agreed at December's Edinburgh summit. The traditional industrial regions of Merseyside, Hainaut in southern Belgium, and the eastern Lander, or states, of Germany will be entitled to the higher levels of funding until now directed to backward regions and the poorest member states. Highlands and Islands in Scotland qualifies for the higher funding too. Brussels also wants to reform the Social Fund, currently used for training both young and long-term unemployed, in order to target part of its war chest to industries facing structural change. The aim is to retrain workers before they become unemployed - a move seen by some members including the UK as a disguised industrial policy. The Social Fund was worth Ecu7.2bn out of a total EC structural aid budget of Ecu63bn in the 1989-93 period. The Commission is also seeking more flexibility in the criteria for allocating aid to 'Objective 2' areas, or industrial regions in decline. The plan is to channel money to areas in danger of developing high unemployment because they which are vulnerable to big factory closures. This more direct attention to industrial restructuring was largely ignored at the Edinburgh summit, when the 12 agreed the 'Delors 2' package on EC finances for 1994-99. When the package was put together last year, the aim was to target funds towards industries like defence, electronics, cars and textiles, to improve EC competitiveness. Although the emphasis now is on preserving and creating jobs, a row over whether this constitutes market-distorting interventionism can be expected when the Commission's plans go to the Council of Ministers.

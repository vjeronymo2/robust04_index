			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Technology: Driving at new speeds - Robert Patton considers a new concept in CD-Rom drives Matsushita's new CD-Rom drive, unveiled in Tokyo this month, could provide the company with a specialised niche in the multimedia market. The latest drive enables users to transfer data from CD-Rom to another disc, edit the data, and read it at roughly the same speed as from the CD-Rom. It is the nearest the industry has come to creating recordability in the CD-Rom format. The drive will read conventional CD-Rom discs at quadruple speed and allows the user to write, erase and rewrite up to 650 megabytes of data onto optical discs. The drive uses a 'phase-change' recording technique, which reversibly alters the structure of the disc. Matsushita is not the first to produce such a dual-purpose drive. This February, Sony introduced the MD (MiniDisc) data drive, an offshoot of the MiniDisc audio format which also combines read-write and read-only technology in the same drive. But where the MiniDisc has yet to develop its market, CD-Rom has become an essential part of every computer system that aspires to the 'multimedia' catch word. When Sony's MiniDisc format was being developed, recordability was an essential part of the concept. According to Andrew House, a Sony spokesman: 'We never thought that write once was a really effective alternative.' The field of audio, video and data recording is strewn with the bones of formats that died because they did not allow consumers to make their own recordings. The compact disc is the only recording medium since the LP record that has achieved broad market success without offering recordability. That shortcoming is the principal reason for the continued market success of the audio cassette. With recording media for computer applications, the ability to rewrite data is even more vital. This makes the success of CD-Rom as a medium of distribution and storage for computer data remarkable. But CD-Rom arrived at a time when there were no better alternatives. The market needed a means of distributing large quantities of graphical data to users. Hard disc drives of comparable size were expensive. Some drives could handle removable media, but the capacity of a CD-Rom disc was 5-10 times that of a removable hard disc. A rewritable CD-Rom drive is technically impossible at the moment. The process of recording data on a CD involves burning microscopic pits into the surface and the process is not reversible. But there are other optical disc recording methods which combine the capacity of the CD with the advantage of recordability. Magneto-optical (MO) recording uses a laser beam to change the magnetic state of the recording surface using a technique called Kerr-rotation. The changes are read magnetically during playback. Most optical disc drives for personal computer applications use magneto-optical technology. Governed by an international ISO standard, MO drives are now available with capacities of 230 MB per 3.5-inch disc and are expected to surpass 600 MB by 1996. Magneto-optical is also the technique Sony uses in MiniDisc and MD Data recorders. A second optical recording technique, shown by Matsushita at the Japan electronics show, uses the laser beam's heat to change the phase of structure of the recording surface from an amorphous state to crystalline and back again. It is this ability to change structure and reverse that is the basis of the rewritable CD-Rom/optical drive. It is likely that when CD-Rom/phase-change drives appear in the shops next year, they will be the only game in town for those who want to read pre-recorded software and multimedia data CDs in a drive that can both read and write the same amount of data at the same speed. The only alternatives available now involve two drives, a conventional CD-Rom combined with a 650+ MB hard disc drive or one of a few very expensive optical recorders currently produced for commercial and industrial applications. But in a year or two, next generation magneto-optical drives are likely to reach the capacity of a CD. Matsushita hopes that by then its CD-Rom/phase change drive, which uses discs of 120mm diameter, will have carved out its own specialised niche in the market. In addition, CD-Rom drives might be used side-by-side with high-capacity magneto-optical drives. One thing is certain: the market wants high-capacity, high-speed, rewritable media. One way or another, the market will get it. By November, Matsushita will be shipping samples of their CD-Rom/phase-change drive priced at Y100,000 (Pounds 633) and some time next year, volume shipments will begin.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Windwards impatient over delay to EU banana deal Banana exporters from the Windward Islands are becoming increasingly impatient with internal wrangling at the European Commission that has delayed a transfer in their supply quotas for the fruit. Windward Islands' exporters are awaiting a change in their quotas so that they can ship to the European Union bananas from elsewhere, such as Latin America, to compensate for the loss of their own crop in tropical storm Debbie in September. The commission's banana management committee has already recommended a quota transfer for the islands, but the proposal has been blocked by German commissioners because of Bonn's opposition to the whole banana regime. 'We're getting frustrated. We can't defray our fixed costs or keep our regular customers supplied unless we get a quota increase,' said Mr Bernard Cornibert, Windward Islands' banana London representative. St Lucia, for example, is shipping only 3,000 tonnes of bananas a week to the EU market following the devastation of its crop. At this time in a normal year, its deliveries would be closer to 6,000 tonnes. Mr Cornibert says that meeting the same range of fixed costs on smaller tonnages of fruit has increased costs by 20 to 25 per cent. At the same time, the islands risk losing customers who they are at present unable to supply. He said it would take St Lucia up to 9 months to restore production to its former levels, but its rehabilitation plans are dependent on aid from the EU under the Stabex economic programme. St Lucia expects to receive Ecu 3.5m and Dominique should get Ecu 3.6m, but payment of the grants has also been delayed. Bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries enter the EU tariff-free, but quotas and tariffs are imposed on so-called dollar bananas from Latin America under the EU's import regime. The regime is so controversial that the commission is stymied on whatever action it tries to take by opposition from Germany. An official said the quota issue could come to a vote next Wednesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Provokers' Confession, Witnesses' </F> Testimony"]    [Text] The date of 25 June 44 years ago was the date when  the United States provoked a war of aggression in Korea. The  fact that the United States planned, prepared for, and provoked  a criminal war of aggression in Korea has been confessed by the  provokers themselves. This is a historic fact to which  witnesses and the world have testified.    First of all, the United States mapped out a detailed plan  and made scrupulous preparations for the war of aggression in  Korea. As far as the United States was concerned, its invasion  of the northern half of the Republic was a central question in  U.S. policy toward South Korea at that time. In this  connection, the United States had made preparations for an armed  invasion of the northern half of the Republic right since the  end of World War II.    At that time, then U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Muccio  stated definitely: A northward invasion is a central question  in the U.S. policy toward South Korea. Therefore, this question  should not be slighted.    Already in May 1950, the eve of the war provoked, (Jones),  director of the South Korean Affairs Department of the former  U.S. Agency for Economic Aid, said: They are armed with  American-style weapons. One hundred-thousand-strong South  Korean troops, who have been trained by U.S. Army officers under  the supervision of a U.S. Armed Forces' mission in Seoul, have  completed all of their preparations. They are ready to start a  war at any time.    At that time, (Seybold), director of the (?Foreign Affairs  Bureau) of the MacArthur Command, pointed out: As far as a  conquest of North Korea is concerned, the battleships or  aircraft in Japan will participate in battles on the side of  South Korea. Therefore, there will be nothing to be worried  about as far as the Navy and Air Force are concerned.    LIFE, a U.S. magazine, wrote: We have never seen an  example--in which much preparations have been made--in any kind  of war waged up until now, throughout the entire period of our  history, other than when the Korean War started.    (CONBADIE) of France wrote in the 29 July, 1953 edition:  Judging from all facts today, the United States had already made  preparations for the Korean War right since the end of World War  II.    An American publication entitled "Who Ignited the Korean  War?" pointed out that such meticulous preparations had been  completed in May 1950.    The warmongers, who had finished their preparations for the  war, watched only for an opportunity to ignite a war.    On the foremost front along the 38th Parallel on 18 June,  1950, Dulles, a former U.S. presidential special envoy who had  sneaked into South Korea for a final check-up for preparations  for a Korean war, mapped out a scenario--for the puppets--aimed  at covering up their provocation of a war, saying: Along with  counter-propaganda that North Korea invaded first, you should  launch an attack on North Korea. If you hold out for two weeks,  the United States will bring a charge that North Korea has  invaded South Korea during that period so that the United  Nations will have to mobilize ground, naval, and air forces in  its name. We will see to it that everything goes on smoothly.    On 20 June two days later, he clamored: The purpose of my  visit to South Korea as a special envoy of President Truman is  to study the situation about the preparations for a war--which  we have actively pushed for--and to present my opinion that you  had better not hesitate in launching a northward invasion if  there is nothing insufficient. In my opinion, everything has  been prepared satisfactorily. As long as preparations have been  made, the sooner, the better.    Dulles then gave an order that a northward invasion be  launched on 25 June.    In June 1950, at that time, Robert, director of the U.S.  military advisory group, spat out the inside truth by saying:  Why did we choose the date of 25 June? Herein lies our  prudent intention. June 25th is a Sunday. The United States, a  Christian country, and South Korea regard Sunday as a Sabbath  Day. No one will believe that we launched a war on a Sunday.  In other words, this is aimed at making people believe that we  have not ignited a war first.    It is a stereotyped trick of the United States to wickedly  maneuver to shift its responsibility for a provocation onto  another's shoulders.    In his book entitled "A Secret History of the Korean War,"  an  American reporter exposed: The United States Government has  already prepared a draft of a resolution to be used at the  United Nations. Without undergoing (?negotiations) and  investigation at the UN Security Council, it demanded that the  United Nations brand North Korea an aggressor.    An American critic disclosed: The news about 25 June, 1950  that North Korea attacked South Korea has been come out of the  pockets of Syngman Rhee and MacArthur.    The true nature of the war provokers was made clear also in  a  report filed by the UN Commission on Korea to the UN Secretary  General on 24 June, one day before the provocation of the war.    The report pointed out: Up to now, our commission has not  received any information from any intelligence organization that  the North Korean armed forces have an attempt for an aggression.  On the contrary, the North Korean regime is now absorbed in  implementing the two-year people's economy.    (Herringer), a former professor of the University of  Pennsylvania, pointed out: The one that was dealt an unexpected  blow was not the United States, but the communist camp.    An American scholar (Meier) exposed the truth by noting: The  People's Army launched a counterattack after withdrawing two to  three kilometers on all fronts of the 38th Parallel after having  been dealt an unexpected attack from the South Korean Army.    Like this, the United States believed that its scenario for  provoking the Korean War would remain a secret forever. But, it  has been fully revealed to the world by Americans' own  confessions, documents, and the world's media.    The truth about the U.S. imperialists' provocation of the  Korean War can never be covered up.</p>

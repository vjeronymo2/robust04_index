"SBSI is an illegal organisation. If workers wish to forward  complaints, they should do so through the SPSI," he said,  referring to the country's only recognised labour organisation,  the All-Indonesia Workers Union.    Suyono, speaking to reporters during a meeting with  Tyfountex  Co. Ltd. employees in Sukoharjo district, said workers should  consult the legal SPSI in the event of any disputes. "If there  is any dispute between you and your company, you may lodge your  complaints through SPSI who should respond immediately," he  urged the company's workforce who went on strike on February 11  to protest against working conditions. Tyfountex, meanwhile,  has not given the workers any assurance.    Suyono reminded employers to meet all regulations of  workers'  rights in order to improve productivity. "Employers should meet  all the rights of the worker in accordance with regulations so  that they can improve on their job performance."    During his visit, the military commander also stopped over  at  Batik Keris Co. Ltd., who similarly faced a strike a few days  ago. Batik Keris director said the company had settled the  dispute with its workers. "All our employees have gone back to  their work," he said. The company employs some 25,000 workers.</p>

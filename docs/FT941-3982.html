			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Newspaper resumes Pergau onslaught The Sunday Times, whose coverage of the Pergau dam affair was cited by Malaysia as the spark for its ban on contracts to British companies, yesterday returned to the attack, accusing the British government of 'grovelling' to the Malaysians. Mr Andrew Neil, the editor, last week sent the Malaysian government a copy of a letter signed by him and printed in The Times saying his paper had 'no vendetta against Malaysia or its prime minister' Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Sources close to the Malaysian government described the letter as a 'step in the right direction', which might help restore relations. Yesterday the newspaper devoted a front-page article and three inside pages to the affair, including allegations about the role of Dr Mahatir's associates. In its Comment column the Sunday Times reiterated that it had nothing to apologise for and attacked Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, who had accused the newspaper of putting jobs at risk. Describing him as 'an obscure political pigmy', it said he is 'prepared to wear out his kneepads kowtowing before the Malaysians'.</p>

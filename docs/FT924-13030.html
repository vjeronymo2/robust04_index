			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: Inheritance invalidated Sir, You are, of course, correct in saying in your feature on wills (Finance and the Family, October 10) that the witnesses cannot be beneficiaries and that, if they are, their inheritance will be invalidated. But there could be an innocent trap in that bare statement. Section 15 of the Wills Act 1837 not only deprives an attesting witness of any benefit under the will, but it also deprives the spouse of such a witness of any such benefit. Max Bitel, Max Bitel, Greene, solicitors, One Canonbury Place, London N1 2NG</p>

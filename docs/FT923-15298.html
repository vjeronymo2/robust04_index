			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Lukewarm trading TRADING was quiet yesterday in the money markets, reflecting the disinclination of dealers to gamble on an early cut in UK base rates. Another factor was that the banking system was relatively flush with cash. As a result, the Bank of England had no need to inject money into the system through bill purchases. The three-month interbank rate - a good reflection of what the markets think base rates will be in the future - was quoted last night at 10 1/32 per cent, down  1/32 of a point from the previous close. That underlined sentiment in the market that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is unlikely to find an opportunity over the summer to cut base rates from the current 10 per cent. 'Even though all the indicators are that the economy could benefit from a cut, the pound's weakness means the options are strictly limited,' said a money market trader. The limited interest in speculating on a broadly based reduction in borrowing costs was reflected in only a small amount of activity on the sterling futures market. The September future contract traded within a narrow spectrum, finishing the day at 90.12, hardly changed from the 90.11 recorded on Tuesday night. Last night's closing price indicates the market's perception that there is little probability of a change in base rates by mid-September. With the cash shortage in the money markets estimated by the Bank of England at only Pounds 200m, its technical operations were limited to lending about Pounds 185m to the discount houses. The terms of the deal were not specified, but it is thought the houses have to repay the cash today, at close to the 10 per cent base rate. The extremely low shortage surprised some dealers. It was mainly due to unspecified payments into the economy by the Treasury totalling some Pounds 800m. The Bundesbank said it accepted bids for DM35.9bn in tenders for securities repurchase funds. It allocated DM27.2bn of 35-day funds, mostly at rates of 9.65 per cent. It also accepted some bids made at a lower allocated rate of 9.60 per cent. The central bank allocated DM8.7bn of 63-day funds, mostly at 9.65 per cent, and accepted nearly a third of all bids made at this rate.</p>

Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GIRL CAGER DIES DURING PRACTICE  </P> <P> A female high school basketball player who became ill during a practice session  collapsed and died as she was being led out of a gymnasium. Her brother also  died as a high school athlete.  </P> <P> Patty LiVolsi, 16, a junior at Immaculate High School, collapsed in a hallway  Monday evening moments after she told an assistant coach she was feeling  nauseous, Coach Joseph Appello said.  </P> <P> She was pronounced dead at Danbury Hospital. The State Medical Examiner's  Office in Farmington performed an autopsy today, but released no information  pending further study.  </P> <P> LiVolsi's older brother, Greg, died several years ago of a heart condition  while he was in high school, said Appello. He was a football and basketball  player.  </P> <P> The team has dedicated the basketball season to LiVolsi.  </P> <P> Father Robert Post, principal of Immaculate, said LiVolsi had had a physical  before the school year began.  </P> <P> "I read her physical this morning, and there was nothing to indicate that there  was any disorder," Post said today.  </P> <P> Post said he did not know whether LiVolsi had ever been tested for a heart  condition like her brother's, but said he knew of no previous incidents when  she had felt ill before a game.  </P></p>

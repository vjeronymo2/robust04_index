			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION RULING ON MINORS WILL NOT BE APPEALED  </P> <P> In a surprise action, the state attorney general's office said Monday it will  not challenge an appeals court decision preventing enforcement of a state law  requiring unmarried minors to get parental or judicial consent for an abortion.  </P> <P> In a terse announcement, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's office said that in  the "best interests of the state" the ruling will not be appealed to the state  Supreme Court. Instead, it said, the issue will be returned to San Francisco  Superior Court for a trial.  </P> <P> The state's decision not to appeal means that it could be months or even years  before the law could take effect, provided its legality is eventually upheld in  court.  </P> <P> The unexpected move came in one of the two highly charged legal disputes that  have emerged in the California courts after last July's ruling by the U.S.  Supreme Court giving states more leeway in regulating abortion. The other case,  pending before the state Supreme Court, tests the state's right to deny  Medi-Cal funded abortions to low-income women.  </P> <P> Under the consent law, unmarried minors -- those 17 or under -- must obtain the  approval of a parent, guardian or judge for an abortion unless there is a  medical emergency.  </P> <P> The measure was passed by the Legislature in 1987 but was quickly challenged by  opponents before it could take effect. In December of that year, San Francisco  Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin issued a preliminary injunction barring  implementation of the law pending trial. The judge concluded that the  challengers were likely to prevail in their claims that the statute violated  the state Constitution.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, named as a defendant because of his role as the state's chief  lawyer, appealed the injunction, contending that the law is constitutional and  urging that it be allowed to take effect pending trial. But on Oct. 12, a state  Court of Appeal upheld the injunction, concluding that the plaintiffs in the  suit had offered considerable evidence that the statute is unconstitutional.  </P> <P> It had been widely expected that the attorney general would take the issue to  the state Supreme Court. But in Monday's brief announcement, made by an  assistant to Van de Kamp, the state said it will await a trial instead.  </P> <P> "Rather than petition the Supreme Court to hear the case at this stage, we have  concluded that the best interests of the state will be served by developing a  full evidentiary record," said Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Richard Martland.  </P> <P> He noted that the Court of Appeal, at this stage of the proceedings, had  considered only the evidence presented by the challengers to the law. At trial,  he said, the state's position could be presented in more detail.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, a candidate for governor, has said that he is personally opposed  to abortion but has publicly supported a woman's right to an abortion.  </P> <P> An anti-abortion movement leader denounced the attorney general's action,  noting that it will result in a lengthy delay before the law could take effect.  </P> <P> "This has been in the courts for nearly two years already, and now we're going  back to lowest level in the court system," said Janet B. Carroll, legislative  director for the California Pro-Life Council. "We believe this frustrates the  will of the 80% of the people who favor parental consent laws.  </P> <P> The action, however, was welcomed as "entirely appropriate" by Dorothy Ehrlich,  executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern  California, whose attorneys represent opponents of the law in their suit  against state officials.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] </F>   [Text] The most ambitious initiative for regulating world  commerce in our century, the so-called Uruguay Round of  Multilateral Commercial Negotiations -- which was set in motion  in 1986 in Punta del Este, within the context of GATT -- ended  in December 1993. The Final Act of the Uruguay Round, which I  and representatives of 120 countries will sign today at a  historical meeting in Marrakech, includes -- in addition to the  matters regarding tariff reduction -- trade in agricultural  products and the so-called new issues (services, intellectual  property, and investment). The Final Act also provides for the  creation of the World Commerce Organization (WCO), which is due  to gradually replace GATT.    Brazil was one of the original GATT signatories in 1947, and  has actively engaged in all the multilateral commercial  initiatives that have been launched since then. The relatively  homogeneous distribution of Brazilian foreign trade among our  main partners justifies the priority that we have attached to  strengthening the multilateral system of commerce, with open  structures and with stable rules, and to the improvement of the  conditions for having access to export markets. According to  figures that were recently released by the GATT Secretariat, the  set of agreements to be signed in Marrakech will promote an  increase in world income by at least $230 billion until the year  2005. For Brazil, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round should  entail an increase of at least $2 billion annually in our  foreign trade figures, in addition to the indirect earnings  stemming from the growth of the world economy.    The importance of the Uruguay Round for Brazil is also  directly related to the implementation of a domestic commercial  liberalization and deregulation program, and to the broad  objective of promoting the competitive integration of our  country into the world economy. In light of the current  atmosphere of non- conflictive coexistence of the globalization  and regionalization trends of the world economy, Brazil -- in  its capacity as global trader -- is naturally interested in the  consolidation of stable, balanced world trade rules. Within  this context, the priority that we have attached to the  implementation of Mercosur [Common Market of the South], and to  a recent initiative to create a South American Free Trade Area,  will supplement, yet not with an exclusionary approach, the  efforts that we have made for the sake of strengthening  multilateral policies in commercial relations.    Despite the fact that the results of negotiation do not  always fully match prior objectives, the positions that finally  prevailed, particularly as concerns the regulatory side of the  Uruguay Round, are convergent with our essential interests. The  improvement introduced into the GATT mechanisms for the  settlement of controversies, and the creation of the World  Commerce Organization, will certainly contribute to  consolidating a set of stable rules that will be able to  substantially reduce the possibility of protectionist outbreaks  and unilateral measures. The reincorporation of agricultural  trade into GATT, the reversal of what has so far been an  increasingly strong trend to subsidize agricultural products,  the reincorporation of textile trade into GATT rules, and the  gains obtained in the access to markets for some Brazilian  priority products open promising prospects. In addition,  despite the fact that the reduction of tariffs on important  Brazilian export products, like orange juice and shoes, has not  been as thorough as expected, the average reduction by  approximately 40 percent of the import tariffs levied by  developed countries will certainly open new prospects for the  competitive sectors of our economy.    Over the past few weeks, we witnessed with increasing  apprehension the attempt by some countries to overcharge the  agenda of the ministerial meeting in Marrakech with matters that  were not included in the deliberations during the closing  session of the Uruguay Round. Strong pressure was exerted to  condition trade on, among other factors, the social patterns of  work. Thanks to coordinated reaction by several developing  countries, among them Brazil, those attempts, which in the final  analysis would have exported unemployment from rich to poor  countries, did not move forward.    We hope the results of the intense negotiations made during  the seven years of the Uruguay Round will wipe out, once and for  all, the phantom, announced by so many, of the fragmentation of  world commercial trends into isolated blocs, and of the untimely  return to the commercial wars that marked the 1930's and which  would certainly jeopardize the foundations of the new  international order that we have to build in the post-Cold War  world. The standing commitment of the ministerial meeting of  Marrakech, that no measures that can harm or negatively affect  the implementation of the results of the Round will be adopted,  will be particularly relevant during the transition period from  GATT to the World Commerce Organization, which will begin on 1  January 1995.    During the next few months we will engage in intense  information clarification work, with a view toward obtaining as  soon as possible the ratification of the Final Act of the  Uruguay Round. In the contacts I intend to have with Congress  and with the productive sectors I will try to convey my firm  idea that the World Commerce Organization will decisively  promote commercial liberalization and the strengthening of the  multilateral system of commerce, which are essential objectives  of Brazilian foreign policy.</p>

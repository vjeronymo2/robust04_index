			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Caught in the superstores'cross-border crossfire: Andrew Bolger explains why the William Low chain has become a bid target Scotland has become one of the most fiercely contested battlegrounds in the war raging through the UK food retailing sector. It has been targeted both by aggressive discount retailers, wooing canny consumers, and the larger UK supermarket groups such as J. Sainsbury and Tesco, both of which have relatively small market shares north of the border. This competitive crossfire was cited yesterday by Mr James Millar, when the 63-year-old chairman of William Low explained why his board was recommending that the group - which he joined 35 years ago - should accept Tesco's takeover bid. Mr Millar said his Dundee-based group had prospered during the 1980s, buoyed by the growth of the Scottish economy and the retail sector. But recent price deflation, and continuing pressure on margins and sales, had exposed the group's small size - and consequent inability to benefit from the economies of scale enjoyed by its larger competitors. Like-for-like sales were running 5 per cent below last year's level. Mr Millar said: 'The Tesco offer represents better value for shareholders than Wm Low could achieve as an independent retailer, as the harsher retail food market and our lack of scale limit our prospects for profit growth over the next few years.' Tesco is certainly comfortably ahead of Wm Low on a variety of performance indicators: sales per sq ft; sales and profits per employee; and return on capital employed. Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman, said he saw considerable potential for improving the performance of Wm Low's stores by introducing its own lower prices and product ranges, alongside a Pounds 35m refit programme. Excluding rationalisation costs, the deal was expected to have a neutral effect on Tesco's earnings this year (which ends in February), but should make a positive contribution thereafter. Tesco said there was a strong fit between its 16 Scottish stores and Wm Low's 45 outlets in Scotland and 12 in the north of England. This deal would give Tesco a larger presence in Scotland at a single step, without adding to industry capacity. The combined group would have 13.7 per cent of the Scottish market - second only to Argyll Group, which owns the Safeway and Presto stores. The City generally welcomed the deal, although some analysts questioned how well Wm Low's typically smaller stores would fit into Tesco's portfolio. Only 16 of the Wm Low stores are above 20,000 sq ft. Tesco said it had been developing an interest in smaller superstores, and 30 of the William Low stores were more than 15,000 sq ft. One analyst said the deal represented both an opportunity and challenge for Tesco. While giving it Pounds 500m of additional annual sales and scope for profit enhancement, the changes to the stores' identity, products and prices would have to be carefully timed. He added: 'The question of overcapacity does not go away - and the question of what to do with the smaller stores in the portfolio will have to be resolved.' Tesco said it was pleased to be maintaining the progress reported at its annual meeting in May, when it said sales were more than 3 per cent up in existing stores and more than 10.5 per cent higher in total. Although profit margins for the first half of the year were unlikely to be enhanced, progress was being made on margin management. This deal may well put an independent Wm Low out of the reckoning, but the fierce struggle for profits and shares in the UK retail food market looks set to continue.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Jan 31 KYODO -- Senior trade negotiators  from the so-called "quad" economic powers have reached a  provisional agreement to establish the proposed World Trade  Organization (WTO) on January 1, 1995, trade sources said Monday  [31 January].    The pact under the Uruguay round of multilateral trade  talks,  completed December 15, calls for the creation of a more powerful  world trade watchdog by July 1, 1995. But its establishment has  been quickened at the request of the secretariat of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The United States and Canada have already accepted the  request, while the European Union has indicated its approval.  Japan has not lodged any objections to the idea.    The sources said the only uncertainty remains over the  timing  of the body's creation, despite the agreement between the four  groups, because each of over 100 participating parties needs to  ratify the proposal.    Also at the four-way talks, the U.S. urged Japan to reopen  negotiations on proposals to scrap or reduce tariffs on four  items.    The sources said Japan resisted U.S. pressure, citing the  tariff problems already resolved at the Uruguay round of talks.  But they said the U.S. is likely to restate its point when U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor arrives in Tokyo for trade  talks Tuesday.    The U.S. has proposed ending tariffs on wood products,  copper  and white liquor and a tariff cut for leather products.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Crisis talks held to avert rail strike BRITISH RAIL is holding separate talks today with the two main rail unions in an attempt to prevent the second 24-hour strike on the network which is due to take place on Friday next week. Mr Paul Watkinson, British Rail's personnel director, said last night the corporation could not afford any more damaging disruption on the railway network. Last Friday's stoppage cost British Rail Pounds 10m in lost fare income. The meetings scheduled for today follow an announcement yesterday by Aslef, the train drivers' union, that it intends to join the 24-hour stoppage planned by the RMT, the main rail union, for April 16 in protest at the threat of compulsory redundancies. British Rail said in its invitation to the rail unions for talks that it wanted to 'clarify' the problems. But the RMT said last night that it was going into the discussions with the intention of 'negotiating positively and constructively'. Some 67 per cent of Aslef members voted in a postal ballot by 55 per cent to 45 per cent to support a one-day stoppage followed by a rolling programme of industrial action. At the moment, the prospect of an early settlement of the disputes with both Aslef and the RMT looks remote. Mr Derrick Fullick, Aslef's general secretary, said yesterday that British Rail must honour existing national agreements that cover job security, and added that he was not convinced by British Rail's present assurances. The RMT wants British Rail to accept there should be no future compulsory redundancies and to agree to a ban on contract work. So far British Rail has said it could not agree to these demands. If today's talks fail to achieve a breakthrough British Rail may be forced to adopt tougher tactics than it has done so far. Some senior managers are in favour of confronting the rail unions, but so far British Rail has adopted a conciliatory approach.</p>

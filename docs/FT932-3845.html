			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo rallies Recent weakness in Glaxo shares was checked after the company gave a briefing to a group of UK pharmaceuticals analysts. The stock has fallen from its mid-May level of 655p to the low 580s, amid worries about profit margins in the US. At yesterday's close, Glaxo shares were 14 higher at 596p following well above average turnover of 6.3m. Kleinwort Benson was believed to have been an aggressive buyer. Glaxo was said to be taking a bullish view of sales of its anti-migraine drug Imigran and to have substantial cost-cutting measures in the pipeline; it was also understood to be confident of defending the patent on its Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Wellcome shares, however, remained firmly depressed, relinguishing an early rise which took the stock up to 730p and settling a net 6 down at 720p with turnover a hefty 5.5m.</p>

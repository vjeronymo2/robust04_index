			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Clinton steps into row over Thorp nuclear plant PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has stepped into the controversy over the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in a move which could further delay the start of its operations. President Clinton has told seven leading congressmen that he will raise the issue with the British government after his administration has looked into ways of combatting nuclear proliferation. In a letter to the president on February 23, just days before his first meeting with Mr John Major, the seven congressmen warned Mr Clinton that plutonium produced at Thorp would add to the world's stockpile and increase the risk of the spread of nuclear weapons. The seven congressmen - Mr Ed Markey, Mr Tim Penny, Mr Mike Kopetski, Mr Lane Evans, Ms Nancy Pelosi and Mr Charles Schumer - some of whom are considered Washington heavyweights, also wrote to Mr Major before his visit, but have not yet received a reply. Their letter urged that 'a decision by the UK against commissioning the Thorp plant would be a significant contribution to efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons'. The US questions about Sellafield took Mr Major by surprise on his Washington visit and he called for hurried briefings from London. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said four days ago that preventing the spread of nuclear weapons was one of the administration's top concerns when considering foreign aid requests. Mr Christopher's comments followed the news earlier this week that North Korea had flouted a United Nations deadline for inspection of nuclear facilities. The UK government is embroiled in three separate inquiries into whether the plant should go ahead. President Clinton's interest in the destination of plutonium produced by Thorp will complicate the British government's task and could worry Thorp's foreign customers. In a reply to the congressmen, President Clinton said that once the US had concluded its review, 'we will surely wish to consult with the British on appropriate steps we could take together to combat nuclear proliferation'. Downing Street declined to comment last night on the possibilityof US intervention in British nuclear policy. British Nuclear Fuels, which has built Thorp, said 'plutonium which Thorp will reclaim cannot be converted into weapons grade material without substantial expertise and equipment'.</p>

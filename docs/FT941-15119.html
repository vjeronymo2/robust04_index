			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Global fix modifies German work-out As Mr Carl Boehm-Bezing of Deutsche Bank jumped out of his chauffeur-driven S-Class Mercedes and hurried up the steps of the Frankfurter Hof on Saturday, he was asked whether he was confident that a deal would be reached to guarantee the survival of Metallgesellschaft, Germany's fourteenth biggest company. 'Of course I am confident,' he answered, through clenched teeth, as he went in to chair a meeting of 120 bank creditors. But it was not until 10 hours later that he appeared in front of a pack of journalists with Mr Kajo Neukirchen, MG's chief executive, to explain that a deal had been done. Confidence was in short supply as the Wednesday deadline for the refinancing negotiations came and went without agreement. First Norddeutsche Landesbank, the Hanover-based bank to the state of Lower Saxony, then a clutch of French institutions voiced objections so vociferous that they threatened to derail what one MG official described as 'the biggest rescue operation since Dunkirk'. Bankers recognised from the start that they would lose far more money if the group were allowed to go bankrupt than if it were bailed-out. But equally there was no doubting the sincerity of bankers' opposition to the terms of the original deal, as presented to them in the first week of January. Brinkmanship was thus underscored by genuine passions and on Thursday and Friday of last week the group's future looked far from certain. Objections focused in part on what NordLB called Deutsche Bank's 'dictatorial' style in trying to bully through a 'take it or leave it' solution with no room for negotiation. Foreign bankers - representing more than half the 40 banks with the biggest exposure - went further, accusing Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank of trying to implement a German-style solution without taking account of international norms for such refinancing packages. 'They were trying to play it like another German work-out, but it is a global fix you need here,' said one foreign banker last week. 'It was very much Germany Inc and could have done with more internationality,' said a German working for a foreign bank after the talks on Saturday. 'We will all learn something from this.' One banker noted that such negotiations were always characterised by a fierce battle between shareholders and bank creditors seeking to protect their different interests. But the situation in Metallgesellschaft's case was complicated by the fact that Deutsche and Dresdner banks were not only big creditors but also big shareholders. Representatives of the two banks sit on MG's supervisory board, making them in some eyes partly responsible for the mess which they were trying to clean up. 'There was a feeling that the big banks had their own agenda and that we did not know the full story,' said one banker, complaining about the lack of independent advisers to the negotiations. Similar sentiments showed through in the French banks' insistence that they receive more information about MG's financial condition. 'In the end it was a question of who blinks last,' said another banker. Deutsche and Dresdner, with the backing of the German financial community - after NordLB came into line - enabled a deal to be done by giving in to the foreign banks' demands that they make a larger contribution. The talks ended with a round of applause for Mr Neukirchen, MG's chief executive, and Mr Boehm-Bezing. Bankers said yesterday that they were pleased with the final package. 'This is the best possible solution for all those involved and especially for MG,' said Mr Rick Polet, of the Dutch ING Bank. MG's survival has been guaranteed, and Mr Neukirchen will be able to exercise his fabled restructuring skills. on putting the group back on its feet. In the boardrooms of the big German banks there will be time, now the deal has been done, to conduct a extensive post mortem.</p>

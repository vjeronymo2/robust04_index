			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Nuclear Electric seeks right to make direct sales NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned power utility, wants the right to sell electricity directly to large industrial consumers in the UK, bringing it into head-on competition with the privatised generation companies. Nuclear Electric is to apply today to Offer, the power industry regulator, to become a 'second-tier supplier', which would enable it to enter into contracts with large consumers. At present, the utility is restricted to selling into the pool, the wholesale market for electricity. Although Offer will review the application, Mr Michael Hesel-tine, trade and industry secretary, will have the final say. Nuclear Electric's move, however, will be welcome to the government because it should sharpen competition in a market where there have been loud complaints from industrial users about rising prices. Large companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries, Blue Circle Industries and British Steel have been demanding government action to adjust electricity costs in line with those of continental competitors. If allowed, Nuclear Electric intends to offer 15-year fixed-price contracts to industrial users with steady 24-hour demand. Its systems are designed to provide base-load electricity and its costs are not linked to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Dr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Power's chief executive, said he would not be surprised if National Power and PowerGen, the other big generators, objected to the application. 'But it has clearly been a real anomaly when we, as a major generator, have been unable to supply customers directly while in other cases licences have been issued to companies who have no generating capacity at all.' PowerGen said: 'We see this as a logical step in the evolution of the competitive market.' A significant point of concern for the other generators is that Nuclear Electric should not be allowed to use the Pounds 1.2bn nuclear levy which it receives from domestic electricity consumers to subsidise its prices in the industrial market. They are likely to demand that that should be a condition of the licence. Nuclear Electric already commands 22 per cent of the electricity market in England and Wales, but it is keen to establish itself as a leading generator, in anticipation of the government review of the nuclear power industry starting at the end of this year. Its capacity will increase substantially next year with the start-up of Sizewell B power station. Next year also sees regulatory changes that will enlarge the market where the generators can sell direct. Nuclear Electric hopes to obtain its licence by December 1. Thorp court ruling, Page 10</p>

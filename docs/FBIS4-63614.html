			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of document signed by former Vice President Aleksandr </F> Rutskoy, dated 19 May 1994 and delivered by him to the Moscow  City Prosecutor's Office, under general headline: "Reply to the  Authorities"]    [Text] As is well known, acting Russian Prosecutor General  Ilyushenko has instructed the Moscow City Prosecutor's Office to  investigate the legality of the public utterances of opposition  leaders on 9 and 14 May 1994. On 19 May former Russian Vice  President Rutskoy gave explanations to the Moscow City  Prosecutor's Office. Rutskoy's attorney, Yu.P. Ivanov, who was  present when these explanations were given, asked our editorial  office to publish the full text of them.    To the Moscow City Prosecutor's office from Aleksandr  Vladimirovich Rutskoy    Explanations    In connection with the series of questions raised by  representatives of the Moscow City Prosecutor's Office about my  speeches on 9 May 1994 and 14 May 1994, I am able to provide the  following clarification.    First, I should like to note that the investigation of the  legality of the actions of the participants in the rally which  took place during the Victory Day demonstration is being carried  out on the direct instructions of acting Russian Federation  Prosecutor General Ilyushenko. In my view, this post does not  exist. There can only be an acting prosecutor general if there  is a legally appointed prosecutor general who is temporarily  absent -- on vacation, for example. In this instance President  Yeltsin, ignoring his own Constitution and the opinion of the  Federation Council, is keeping one of his own minions in this  artificial post (acting prosecutor general). It is no  coincidence that former Prosecutor General Kazannik calls  Ilyushenko nothing more than a puppet. Ilyushenko does not have  even an elementary notion of personal dignity. One might think  that after the vote at the Federation Council, which rejected  his nomination, Ilyushenko would simply have given up his claims  to this post. But he has not done so, and this, it seems to me,  is the best indication of his moral qualities. He has a  definite interest in me. It was he who, together with Andrey  Makarov [staffer of Interdepartmental Commission To Combat Crime  and Corruption], was a most active liar who spread rumors which  impugned my honor and dignity when he accused me of involvement  with some Swiss bank accounts which I was supposed to have. In  so saying, in my view, he not only lied but also committed  perjury. And I hope that Ilyushenko will still be accountable  for this vile act.    As for my actual actions on 9 and 14 May, I see nothing  unlawful in them. The texts of my speeches contain nothing  "criminal."    Yes, I believe that today the country is being ruled by a  regime of President Yeltsin's absolute power.    Yes, I believe that this regime is pursuing an antipeople  policy of selling out to foreign interests and thereby  destroying our Motherland.    Yes, I believe that representatives of the patriotic  opposition must come to power in the country, and I hope that,  despite all the regime's convulsions, victory will go the  patriots.    Yes, I believe that it would be good if this happened by the  50th anniversary of the Victory over Fascism, that is, by May  1995.    I think that the unification of various social forces and  support for their demands by the majority of the people will  force President Yeltsin to honor the public commitment he made  (and which he himself is crudely violating) to call early  presidential elections. I hope that these elections will be won  by the presidential candidate for whom the most important thing  is service of the people and the Motherland, a candidate who  will pursue an economic program which reflects first and  foremost the interests of the hapless working people today.    It was just such a result that I had in mind when I spoke  about the future victory! That is how I see it.    I believe that my speech was couched in ideological terms  which are the norm today. That is how many political leaders  speak today, and there was nothing unusual in my speech. The  propresident sycophants (officials in the president's entourage  as well as journalists who serve the regime) are using far  harsher terms about me and the patriotic opposition.    So why do they find my replies intolerable? The answer is  obvious. These people live in a state of perpetual fear. The  fear of responsibility. Responsibility for what they done: the  destruction of a mighty Fatherland -- the USSR; the  impoverishment of the majority of the people; the gunning down  of the legislative authorities; and much more. The only way in  which these cliques can suppress that fear is by driving their  political opponents into the concentration camps. In my case  they want to find a new pretext for arresting me. I despise  these pygmies. And I think I have the right to criticize them  publicly irrespective of the fact that they are "representatives  of the authorities." In my criticism of this or that individual  there is no legal norm which would oblige me to make my  criticism commensurate with the office in question and thus I am  not breaking the law. But there is one thing of which I want to  assure those ordinary citizens who believe in me -- I am  prepared to stay in jail the rest of my life for the sake of my  people, my Motherland, and its true interests. I have not  appealed to Yeltsin and his puppets for a pardon and I am not  going to.    Nor can I make any comment on the burning of the Russian  Federation flag because I simply did not see that happen. I can  only express my own opinion about why this flag was burned.  Today's Russian Federation flag looks like the one that was used  during the Great Patriotic War by Vlasov's traitors. For that  reason I can understand the feelings of former front-liners who  fought against Vlasov's traitors and defended a different flag  -- the red flag. And defended it with their blood....    I have nothing more to add to that.    [signed] A.V. Rutskoy, 19 May 1994</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Signs of lower rates help Mexico recover - The government's monetary easing has prompted domestic investors to return A month is a long time in Mexico's stock market, and since the dark days of September almost everything seems to have fallen into place for the country's investors. After falling some 35 per cent from June to September 28, the market's main BMV index has since recovered by 25 per cent. The rally, stronger and longer than many had expected, has been led by domestic rather than foreign investors, and follows a string of good economic news. In early October, Mr Bill Clinton offered conditional support for the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta); third-quarter results appeared to be better than expectations; and last Tuesday, the government allayed fears of a large currency devaluation by announcing an increase in the permitted fall of the peso against the dollar. Putting the pieces together, investors concluded that economic growth would soon pick up and interest rates were likely to fall. Interest rate-sensitive stocks - such as banks, retailers, and construction companies - have led the stock market's rally. Shares in GF Bancomer and Banacci, Mexico's largest banks, are up 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively over the past month; Cemex, the leading cement company, gained 53 per cent; and Grupo Sidek, part of which is a tourist and development group, 33 per cent. The anticipation of Mr Clinton's conditional support for the North American free trade agreement sparked off the buying, as many investors reckoned that the agreement was inevitable, and could be in place by the first half of next year. With Nafta approved, more foreign investment is expected to flow into Mexico, and interest rates, which have been kept at around 19 per cent in part to maintain foreign reserves at close to Dollars 20bn, could be lowered. A decline in interest rates would be welcomed by Mexican companies, and would appear justifiable from the perspective of the domestic economy. Monthly inflation has been hovering around 0.6-0.9 per cent, indicating that real interest rates are close to 8-10 per cent. High rates have pushed down economic growth expectations to 2.5-3.0 per cent this year, and have contributed to the fall in the stock market from June to September. Tuesday's successful renegotiation of the annual wage and price accord removed the one remaining doubt. The government backed away from its unstated goal to fix the peso to the dollar, and instead increased the maximum permitted devaluation of the peso from 2.3 per cent a year to 4.6 per cent a year. The government's decision, combined with moderate wage increases announced on the same day, 'allays fears about the over-valuation of the peso, removes a great deal of uncertainty, reduces the chances of a major devaluation, and sets the stage for single-digit inflation in 1993,' says Mr Scott Galle from DA Campbell Associates, a fund manager which specialises in Latin America. The government's reversal will make the peso more volatile, since the band at which the currency can fluctuate against the dollar will grow from around 3 per cent to nearly 8 per cent in 12 months. Mr Jorge Mariscal, manager of Latin American equities at Goldman Sachs, says this will discourage short-term investment in favour of longer-term holdings - the government's presumed goal. On Wednesday, the first signs of lower interest rates occurred. After rising for seven consecutive weeks, rates on 28-day government paper edged down 0.2 percentage points to 19.5 per cent: on 364-day paper they fell 0.5 to 19.10 per cent. Equity analysts immediately started to recommend interest rate-sensitive and export-oriented stocks in spite of their recent rises, since they would benefit most from the easing of the exchange rate. Mr Scott Kalb, an analyst at Smith Barney, particularly likes the bank stocks, which were hit hard in the third quarter. Mr Mariscal is enthusiastic about export-oriented stocks, and those competing in the trade sector, since their margins will rise slightly as a result of the faster rate of devaluation. Cemex is likely to benefit from the government's announcement this week to help finance the building of 530,000 low-income homes. But he and another analyst warn that Mexico is not yet free of troubles. The current account deficit may have stabilised, but it is still likely to top Dollars 20bn this year. Mexico's thirst for foreign capital is therefore likely to continue, leaving it vulnerable to unfavourable events in the US. While Mr Clinton supports the principle of Nafta it is still too early to tell when a new Congress will vote on it, and whether the Mexicans can accept his interventionist parallel accords on labour and the environment. If his commitment to Nafta looks in doubt, and foreigners take their capital elsewhere, the government will have to keep the brakes on the economy for much of next year as well.</p>

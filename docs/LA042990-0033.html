			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CARING FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS LEAVES MANY HOSPITALS ALONG BORDER IN CRITICAL  CONDITION  </P> <P> Some had their limbs severed by the wheels of a train headed north from the  Laredo, Tex., rail yards. Others were mangled in car crashes as they tried to  flee the Border Patrol. All were among the illegal aliens who end up in Buddy  Flores' hospital on the Southwest border.  </P> <P> Pregnant women from Mexico, who have heard that Mercy Regional Medical Center  in Laredo will not turn them away, show up ready to deliver a child who will  automatically be a U.S. citizen.  </P> <P> Many have had no prenatal care. Others arrive midway through a difficult or  troubled labor that their midwife decided she could not complete.  </P> <P> In a city with a large population of legal residents without insurance or money  to pay for medical care, illegal aliens are draining resources at Flores'  Catholic hospital and "occupying intensive care beds that are short as it is,"  he said.  </P> <P> The hospital writes off $20 million a year in bad debts and charity care, but  Flores doesn't know how much is spent on undocumented aliens. Under Texas law,  no patient can be refused emergency services.  </P> <P> "Three years ago, I would have told you this was an occasional problem  (delivering babies from women here illegally)," Flores said. "It's a consistent  problem now. If they're in active labor they know we can't refuse them."  </P> <P> Laredo's problems are not unique: Hospitals and trauma units from San Diego to  Miami have been experiencing financial difficulties in treating undocumented  aliens, according to border-state lawmakers.  </P> <P> "It is not unusual for a border-area hospital to treat a large number of  patients who may be illegally within the U.S. Almost always the hospital must  write off the cost of this medical care because the patient cannot pay and  invariably has no medical insurance," said Rep. Kika de la Garza, a Texas  Democrat whose district borders Mexico.  </P> <P> De la Garza is co-sponsoring the Trauma Care Center Alien Compensation Act that  would provide $20 million a year in grants to hospitals that incur at least 15%  of their uncompensated costs from treating illegal aliens in their trauma  units.  </P> <P> "The legislation would recognize immigration-related problems as a federal  responsibility not to be shouldered alone by hospital trauma centers," De la  Garza said. "From Los Angeles to Miami, trauma centers face reimbursement  problems that threaten trauma care for all patients."  </P> <P> Co-sponsored by Rep. Bill Lowery, a San Diego Republican, the bill would apply  only to trauma patients and would not cover the problem of illegal aliens  delivering their babies in the United States.  </P></p>

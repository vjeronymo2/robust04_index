			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Trustees Britain's most prestigious hotels group and one of its biggest undertakers have one thing in common: their fates are in hands of trustees of trusts set up by the companies' founding families. The charitable trusts that have protected the Savoy from Forte's advances for so long have finally agreed to talk, while the Field family trusts could hold the key to the battle for control of Great Southern. In such cases trustees can find their positions most uncomfortable. It would be only natural for trustees to feel loyalty to the company in which the trust holds shares but their only consideration should be the financial interests of the trusts' beneficiaries. Whatever else has brought the Savoy trusts to the table it can hardly be a coincidence that the company's performance has been so poor it was forced to cut its dividend and therefore the trusts' income. The Field family trusts have also had a thin time having done without dividends from J D Field for some years. It would be easy in both cases to argue that the beneficiaries are not getting the best deal available and the trustees have clearly become concerned. In theory, trustees should be even more single-minded in maximising the value of their shares than other institutional shareholders. In practice, managements often consider them a pushover. But it will be no bad thing if the Savoy and Field managements ultimately pay the price for not looking after the beneficiaries better.</p>

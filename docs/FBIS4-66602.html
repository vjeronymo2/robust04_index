			<p>CSO     [Text] Sabroom (Tripura) Feb. 15--The much-awaited  repatriation of Chakma refugees today took place in the border  town of South Tripura, amidst assurances from the Bangladesh  Government that their safety and security would be ensured,  reports PTI.    Seventy seven families from the Kathalcharri evacuee camp  here numbering 282 refugees trekked over a bamboo bridge erected  temporarily by Bangladesh to Ramgarh on the other side.    Assuring the refugees of safety and security, the Bangladesh  minister for communication, Col (retd) Ole Ahmed, who came over  to Sabroom to participate in a meeting organised by the Indian  Government, said, "We are prepared to do everything to make  their resettlement smooth. I ensure them that they are not going  to an area of uncertainty but only to their home."    Describing this as a "unique and historic" event the Tripura  governor, Mr Romesh Bhandari who played an active role, said  there was no reason to doubt the genuineness and sincerity of  these assurances of the Bangladesh Government.    The governor however said that such fears and apprehensions  that were being expressed, needed to be taken note of by "our  Bangladesh friends. In the initial stages particular attention  would need to be paid on this count so that apprehension and  fear could be replaced by confidence and trust.    The Union of state for home, Mr P.M. Sayeed, who also  described this event as "historic" said that India had accepted  them when they came here following atrocities and killings, but  it had been at a considerable cost to the people of Tripura.    The Centre, he said, had given them free rations and spent  over Rs [Rupees] 43 crores for their upkeep.    Mr Sayeed said, "We have not involved any third country and  we have shown that we can solve our problem by ourselves.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Management: Big Blue soothes its big investors - IBM's board of directors has established a corporate governance sub-committee Boardroom changes at IBM and Eastman Kodak, two of the US's largest companies, have underscored the growing muscle of both non-executive directors and activist shareholders in US corporate life. IBM, under its chairman, Lou Gerstner, has become the first large US company to set up a sub-committee of the board devoted to matters of 'corporate governance' - that is to say, the framework within which the business makes decisions and the role of shareholders in influencing policy. At Kodak, non-executive directors last month ousted Kay Whitmore, the chairman and chief executive, for not moving with sufficient aggression to improve the company's lacklustre performance. The directors' coup at Kodak was the latest in a series which has toppled chief executives at an extraordinary number of poorly performing blue chip US companies, including IBM, General Motors, American Express and Westinghouse Electric. The non-executives at these companies were responding, at least in part, to growing pressure from institutional shareholders to produce a sharply improved financial performance. In the past, the outside directors at many US companies tended to be fairly passive followers of the lead set by management. Now, however, big investors are insisting directors fulfil the function they were elected to carry out: acting as fiduciaries on behalf of shareholders, making sure management runs the company efficiently and on their behalf. The leaders of this 'corporate governance movement' want boards to give more power to non-executives. For example, a common demand is that new directors are nominated by a committee composed of outsiders. And the institutions are insisting that their views on both governance issues and strategy are given more weight, particularly at companies producing poor financial results. The IBM initiative represents a novel way of tackling this challenge, and seems to be Gerstner's response to strong shareholder criticism of the board's passivity under John Akers, who was forced to resign as chairman last spring because of the group's poor performance. Gerstner, keen to improve relations with investors, encouraged the board to create a new 'directors and corporate governance committee' composed of non-executive directors. It will be presided over by James Burke, former chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson and the man who led the search for a new chief executive when Akers was ousted. The committee will review the size, composition and functions of the board and board committees, as well as retirement policies towards non-executive directors and their pay. It will also review and respond to significant proposals from shareholders and oversee the company's position on issues of public responsibility, such as equal employment opportunities and protection of the environment. Finally, it will nominate new board directors, and as part of the process will evaluate any recommendations from shareholders. Cari Christian, executive director of the United Shareholders Association, an activist umbrella organisation, said: 'We are very supportive of what they (IBM) are doing. The company needed to be more aware of shareholders and communicate with them . . . I think you're going to see more and more companies moving in this direction.' There is a danger that corporate governance committees could be used by strong managements as a public relations exercise, to suggest a willingness to involve shareholders where none really exists. James Heard, president of Washington-based Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which advises large investors on corporate governance issues, says: 'I could see such a committee as little more than window dressing, or as quite formidable if it were the point of contact with shareholders pressing for change.' But while governance committees could reduce shareholders' dealings with executive directors, this does not seem to worry the activists. DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer at the California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in the US, says: 'We feel the principal contact should be between shareholders and directors. Directors represent shareholder interests . . . Where we have achieved most success in dealing with a company has been through working through directors.' However, shareholder groups seem unlikely to issue blanket demands that other companies follow the IBM model. Bowman notes that most situations are company-specific. Heard says the fact that a company recognises the need for better relations with shareholders, and is doing something about this, is more important than the specific structure it adopts. He points to Kodak as an example of a company taking a somewhat different approach to IBM. Kodak's non-executive directors were so concerned with the company's performance and mounting investor ire that they formed a special board committee at the start of this year to take a more active role in group strategy or, as they called it, 'corporate directions'. Last month, frustrated by Whitmore's slow pace in restructuring the business and giving it a clear sense of direction, they told him he had to go. The coup differed from those at other blue chip companies in one interesting respect. In their public statements, the directors made no secret of the fact that Whitmore had been forced out and the reasons for this. They also let it be known that he had been under pressure from the board to perform better for the past two years. This may not have left Whitmore with a great deal of dignity, but it sent a significant message from directors to shareholders: we acknowledge your concern and we want to communicate more openly.</p>

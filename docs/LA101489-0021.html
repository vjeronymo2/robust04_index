			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL MAJOR TEST FOR TOREROS  </P> <P> Like a pitcher carrying a no-hitter into the latter innings of a game, the  University of San Diego's football team does not want to question its success.  </P> <P> Whatever is working, go with it. Just bear down and go after the next hitter.  </P> <P> And to USD, the game at 7:30 tonight at Occidental College represents the  cleanup guy, the perennial masher.  </P> <P> The Toreros (5-0) have mowed down three line-drive hitters and a couple of  Punch-and-Judy types.  </P> <P> It's now time for Occidental, the Whammer of California Division III football.  </P> <P> USD has not beaten Occidental since 1981. They tied them, 13-13, to open the  1987 season but lost last year, 20-16.  </P> <P> In that game, the Toreros had fourth and six on the Occidental seven with 15  seconds left but failed to score when Brendan Murphy's pass into the end zone  was trapped by Ken Zampese. Two plays earlier, Ken Jones appeared to have  caught a winning touchdown pass, but the ball was knocked loose by a Tiger  defender.  </P> <P> Occidental's Tony Werbelow, who has returned as a graduate student for his  final season, completed 17 of 22 passes for 176 yards. Most of those statistics  came in the first half when the Tigers built a 20-14 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "He shot our eyes out," said USD Coach Brian Fogarty, who is 0-4-1 against  Occidental.  </P> <P> But this may the Toreros' year. Earlier this week, USA Today listed USD as one  of the biggest surprises of the year. The NCAA has ranked USD No. 4 in the West  Region of Division III.  </P> <P> Occidental (3-1) has lost two games on the field but was awarded a victory  because Azusa Pacific used an ineligible player. USD defeated Azusa, 24-6.  </P> <P> USD is limiting opponents to 217 yards and 8.4 points per game. The offense is  averaging 321 yards (220 rushing and 25.4 points.  </P> <P> Linebacker Lenny Territo leads the team with 42 tackles; nose tackle Dave Dunn  has 33 and a team-high five sacks.  </P> <P> Fullback Todd Jackson is averaging 113 yards per game.  </P></p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / The young pretender This is getting dangerous. If Mr Tony Blair is chosen to succeed Mr John Smith, we shall have to consider voting Labour. The last time I did that was in 1964, or it could have been 1966. Those days are now long gone. It is as if we have been beamed up to a different planet, with Labour or a large section of it left behind. The party may show by its selection of a new leader that it has at last caught up, that it understands how different our polity has become. If so, British public life will be transformed. We would see a break in the gloom that began to descend after April 1988, when Thatcherism peaked out. Did I say gloom? Look around. The electorate is trapped. We either continue with a moribund Tory government, or take a chance with a party many of us mistrust. Only something completely fresh, like a totally remodelled Labour party, could break such an impasse. Voters would enjoy the forgotten luxury of real choice. A majority might decide that the kindest way to treat the Conservatives would be to put them out to grass for a season or two. There would be little fear, as there was in April 1992, of Labour atavism. The people's party might even win an overall working majority, although I would not bet on it. Just as likely, many who might have voted Liberal Democrat in 1992 but were deterred by the apprehension that that would lead to a Lab-Lib coalition will not be so put off in 1996 or 1997. Either way, the opposition would take over. The reason is plain. It is best expressed in a wry remark attributed to an unnamed Conservative MP in one of the Sunday papers. People will vote for Mr Blair, said this phantom Tory, 'without feeling they are voting for Labour'. The young pretender will thank nobody for recycling that observation. It expresses what his enemies consider to be his fatal flaw. The widespread endorsement of Mr Blair's candidacy by the newspapers is also said to be resented by Labour activists. The correct response is: grow up. If Labour insists on being led by whoever is most disliked by the media, it is not serious about victory. If it only feels comfortable with whoever most accurately personifies the traditions of a party four times rejected by the electorate, it will lose again. As Mr Kinnock would argue, the real sufferers would be the poor and the disadvantaged, the very people Labour exists to help. This is not to say that Mr Blair is superhuman. He may or may not prove to be a good leader. Whether or not he is chosen will tell us more about the Labour party than it does about him. We already know of several counts against him, not the least of which is that he is without experience of office. If he becomes leader, he will fall under a sharper spotlight than has yet played upon his boyish young features. If he has faults of personality, they will be revealed. If not, some of the tabloids will invent them. Short of changing its name, his programme for modernising the Labour party is about as radical as you could imagine. If he presses ahead with it he risks internal rows. If he holds back, he will be derided for his caution. Whatever he does, the fawning that has attended his putative candidacy is likely to be replaced, should he win the prize, by scepticism. His advantage is the subconscious perception that his beliefs have their roots in Christianity, as did those of Mr Smith. Mr Gordon Brown, the alternative 'modernist' contender for the Labour leadership, is seen in a different light. Ostensibly as reform-minded as Mr Blair, Mr Brown was in early life an intellectual of the now old-fashioned socialist left. Britain is more likely to restore social democracy in the name of Jesus Christ than of Karl Marx. To be fair, Marx would not recognise Mr Brown's contemporary utterances, which are similar though not identical to those of Mr Blair. Yet the shadow chancellor's intensity, his fierce attention to his anger, his apparent lack of self-confidence, work against him. If you voted for Mr Brown you would know that you were voting Labour. Mr Blair's philosophy is expressed in a foreword to Reclaiming the Ground, essays published last year by Hodder and Stoughton and the Christian Socialist Movement. On the cover is a photograph of Mr John Smith, who contributed the key chapter. Mr Blair's few pages demonstrate how Labour could capture ground from the other parties. Try this: 'There is right and wrong. There is good and bad. We all know this, of course, but it has become fashionable to be uncomfortable about such language.' Tory minister after Tory minister has tripped up with 'back to basics' of this sort, but in a Labour leader it could be an asset. Or try: Christianity . . .'is about the union between individual and community, the belief that we are not stranded in helpless isolation, but owe a duty both to others and to ourselves and are, in a profound sense, dependent on each other to succeed'. It is probable, given a long enough search, that you might find similar sentiments expressed by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the treasury, or even, at a stretch, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. This does not make Mr Blair a closet Conservative. He remains attached to Labour principles. Anyone who thinks of voting Labour if he leads it should do so with his or her eyes open. This is no left-wing Tory, but a proponent of familiar elements of Labour thinking, spoken in language that should be acceptable to southern opinion. In Reclaiming the Ground he affirms his belief in equality, adding 'not that we are uniform in character or position, but on the contrary that despite our differences we are entitled to be treated equally, without regard to our wealth, race, gender or standing in society'. Those of us who can recall 1964 will remember not only the excitement that preceded the election of the then Mr Harold Wilson but also the long years of disillusionment that followed. Again, this speaks of the party more than the man. It was Labour, and the unions, that scuttled 'In Place of Strife,' the Wilson government's effort to bring order to labour relations. Mr Blair is likewise just a chap. He is a former barrister who has mastered a couple of prominent shadow cabinet briefs. A Labour party at ease with the philosophy he expresses would, however, be more than that. It would refresh British politics.</p>

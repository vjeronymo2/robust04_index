Kazimierz Nalaskowski said Tuesday that a  possible appeal by the defence minister to the constitutional  tribunal against the part of the 1994 budget law which pertains  to the armed forces may only relate to the final shape of the  law and may be lodged after the end of the legislative procedure  i.e. when the budget law is adopted by the Senate and signed by  the president.    Under the law on the constitutional tribunal, ministers are  not entitled to lodge appeals against the budget law but they  have the right to ask for support from such entities as the  cabinet, the prime minister, the Sejm committees and a group of  50 deputies that are eligible to file appeals against the  budget, Nalaskowski said.    On Monday, Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk told a press  conference in Bydgoszcz that he would appeal to the  constitutional tribunal against the budget law adopted by the  Sejm on Saturday. Kolodziejczyk declared that "what has happened  to the Defence Ministry's budget this year is scandalous" and  accused the legislative authorities of deeply interfering in the  prerogatives of executive power.</p>

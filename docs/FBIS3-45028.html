			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The upcoming visit  to three West-European countries by Qiao Shi, chairman of  China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee,  will be another major move to promote contacts between the NPC  and foreign parliaments, following his five-ASEAN nation tour  last year.    These remarks were made by Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the  NPC Standing Committee, at a meeting here today with Chinese  correspondents who are going to cover the event.    He said the upcoming visit shows that China places great  importance on its cooperation with Germany, Switzerland and  Austria in the fields of politics, economy and trade, science  and technology as well as culture.    It is also a symbol that China desires to develop its  long-term and stable friendly ties with the three countries,  based on the principles of seeking common ground while reserving  differences, mutual respect, non-interference in each other's  internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit.    Qiao is scheduled to pay an official goodwill visit to the  three countries from January 16 to 30 at the invitation of the  Presidium of the Bundestag of Germany, President Gert Haller of  the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, and  President Heinz Fischer of the National Council of Austria.    Qiao is China's first NPC chairman to visit West European  countries, Cao said.    He noted that the diplomatic work of the NPC and its  Standing  Committee is an important component part of China's entire  diplomacy.    To conduct friendly contacts in a planned way between the  NPC  and its standing committee on the one hand and foreign  parliaments on the other, according to China's foreign policies  and principles, is of great significance to deepening mutual  understanding and friendship, promoting the state-to-state  relations and creating a better international environment for  the country's modernization drive and reform and opening to the  outside world, he said.    Cao said between July and August last year, Qiao paid a  successful visit to the five ASEAN nations of Indonesia,  Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, which  strengthened bilateral relations and regional economic  cooperative ties.    The visit also pushed forward the friendly ties and  cooperation between the NPC and the ASEAN countries'  parliaments, contributing to safeguarding the regional peace and  stability, he said.    Cao disclosed that during his visit, Qiao is expected to  exchange views with the parliament and government leaders of the  three countries on bilateral relations, exchanges and  cooperation between the NPC and the those parliaments as well as  international issues of common concern.    Qiao will also visit some enterprises, scientific and  research institutions, schools and ports and make wide contacts  with personages from all walks of life, he added.    Cao said China has enjoyed a long history of friendly  contacts and traditional friendship with Germany, Switzerland  and Austria.    The recent years have witnessed sound growth of bilateral  relations in political, economic, cultural, scientific and  technological fields. The exchange of visits between the NPC  and the parliaments of these countries has increased, thus  bringing their relationship closer, Cao said.    He said the NPC is ready to further its relationship with  the  parliaments of the three countries, maintain its frequent  exchanges of visits with their parliamentary leaders.    He expressed the belief that QIAO's visit is bound to give  an  impetus to the promotion of the ties between China and these  three countries and exchanges and cooperation between the NPC  and the parliaments in these countries.</p>

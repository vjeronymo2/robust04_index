			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Combatants settle bitter dispute over canal ONE of the longest and most bitter corporate disputes in Britain came to an end yesterday when Mr John Whittaker, chairman of Peel Holdings, and Mr Nicholas Berry, chairman of Stancroft Trust, agreed to bury the hatchet over Manchester Ship Canal. The dispute has been raging since 1986, when Mr Whittaker won control of the ship canal company after a year-long takeover battle, defended in the latter stages by Mr Berry, who had bought his way in as chairman. The two have contrasting backgrounds - Mr Berry, Eton and Oxford; Mr Whittaker the son of a successful northern entrepreneur - and they have come to hate each other. Their agreement, which has to be ratified by small shareholders, will pave the way for MSC to be absorbed by Peel, which already owns 82.2 per cent of the company. MSC's separate quotation will disappear - 99 years after the canal opened. The roots of the dispute lie in MSC's land and property holdings, which give it an investment potential well in excess of what it achieves as operator of a profitable small port. Mr Berry thought Mr Whittaker had won control of MSC too cheaply. He organised resistance among minority shareholders to veto plans and eventually force an acceptable offer. The offer, which Mr Berry designed to be acceptable to himself, was announced yesterday. The deal comprises Pounds 23 for each ordinary share plus a Pounds 7 zero coupon loan note, worth Pounds 10.50 in five years, or earlier if MSC gets full planning permission to develop a 300-acre canalside site at Dumplington, near Trafford Park as an out-of-town shopping centre. Mr Whittaker's original offer in 1986 was worth Pounds 6.25 per ordinary share. Mr Robert Hough, chairman of MSC and deputy chairman of Peel, said the offer would value MSC at about Pounds 234m. Total minority holdings now accounted for Pounds 41.5m of this - approximately the total value of the company when Mr Whittaker won the takeover battle. Mr Berry owns half the MSC minority holdings by value. His Stancroft Trust owns Mintel, which is the largest shareholder in Kunick, the gaming machine company, Grampian Television and Barlows, a property developer. He is the son of Lord Hartwell, a former owner of the Daily Telegraph. Theoretically, the deal can still be stopped. Under MSC's constitution, approval requires a simple majority of shareholders by number and a 75 per cent majority by value. The latter condition has already been met, but Peel and Mr Berry have only one vote each to cast among 2,000 on the register. However, Mr Berry said the offer was being recommended by the small shareholders' association. End of battle in sight, Page 19</p>

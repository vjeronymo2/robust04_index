			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Major issues raised in the public comments included the maximum five year restoration period, the provision requiring new construction in developed areas to be elevated to three feet above the highest adjacent grade, the absence of a ``hold harmless'' provision for delays in meeting the restoration schedule, and the definition of ``developed'' areas. Several comments suggested that the proposed regulations pertaining to these provisions be rewritten based on concern that the regulations do not comply with Congressional intent as reflected in the legislative history.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes have been made since the proposed rules were published in April 1994. We decided that because of the changes, and because of the technical nature of the issues that these regulations address, the public and all affected parties should have another opportunity to review and comment on the rule before FEMA publishes a final rule. This interim final rule will permit FEMA to meet the statutorily mandated date of October 28, 1994 for promulgation of regulations, and it will give the public and all affected parties 45 days in which to review and comment on the interim final rule. When the 45-day comment period ends, FEMA will review and evaluate all written comments received during that period, and will publish a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of Developed Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments were received on the definition of ``developed area''. One comment requested clarification on whether open space is to be included within the definition of ``developed area''. A related comment requested that the definition be expanded to include existing publicly-owned property that is critical to the well-being of the community. FEMA recognizes that there may be some confusion over whether publicly-owned open space is included within the definition of ``developed area''. These areas are meant to be included in the definition of ``developed area'' since they generally support the residential, commercial, and industrial well-being of the community. The term ``public facilities'' in paragraph (a) encompasses publicly-owned open space, buildings, and facilities, such as schools, hospitals, public parks and open space, and historic sites. FEMA believes that it is unnecessary to alter the regulations to clarify this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment expressed concern that the 75% figure in the definition in which an area must be improved with residential, industrial, and commercial structures is an arbitrary threshold. FEMA believes that the 75% figure in paragraph (a)(1) is a reasonable threshold for determining a ``developed area'' which is considered or is generally recognized as a city, town, or suburban area that consists of residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, structures, and streetscape and public areas that form a distinct neighborhood or section of a city or urban place with the basic urban infrastructure in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A related comment concerned areas within a city in which there are vacant lots and parcels. Vacant land that contains no structures or buildings may be included within a ``developed area'' if the land had been previously developed and redevelopment of the site can be generally supported by the infrastructure in place. This vacant land is considered ``infill''. Land that is in a natural or undisturbed state or in agricultural production at the time the designation is adopted is not considered ``vacant'' land or an ``infill site'' within a ``developed area''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment requested that non-residential subdivisions be given the same consideration as residential subdivisions at 44 CFR 59.1(c) of the definition which addresses ``vested rights''. The intent of this paragraph is to recognize areas as ``developed areas'' where the investment in the land and infrastructure is substantial and development is underway and infrastructure and structures are being built on an ongoing basis. FEMA agrees that the interim final rule should recognize and include nonresidential structures and has made changes to paragraph (c) to include nonresidential subdivisions. In addition, FEMA includes single lot-type developments, such as planned unit developments, that are a minimum of 20 contiguous acres.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerns were raised that the proposed rule precludes all development in areas outside of the ``developed area''. The suggestion was made that the regulations allow nonresidential construction in these areas because of the importance of economic development to the community and because many local communities currently impose adopted floodproofing criteria in order to minimize flood damage. The suggestion was also made that the regulations should restrict residential construction in areas outside of the ``developed area''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final rule does not preclude development in areas outside of the ``developed area''. The term, ``developed area'' is a means to determine which elevation or floodproofing requirement must be applied for new construction within Zone AR. The definition also does not classify or establish the location of residential and non-residential construction or other land uses. The establishment of regulations governing the use of land is a decision that resides within the state and local land use authority. Nonresidential and residential construction can be built in areas outside of the ``developed area'' as long as they are built in accordance with the minimum NFIP floodplain management criteria and at the elevation established at the site. While the NFIP floodplain management criteria require the elevation of residential structures, nonresidential construction has the option of elevating or floodproofing. Criteria for floodproofing are established in the NFIP Regulations that the NFIP community must apply, at a minimum, if this option is chosen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

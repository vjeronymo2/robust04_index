			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 23 KYODO -- Japanese political  leader Masayoshi Takemura met U.S. Defense Secretary William  Perry and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili  at the Pentagon on Monday [23 May].    An aide to Takemura, leader of new party Sakigake  [Harbinger], later told reporters that Perry showed strong  interest on the current state of Japanese politics and asked  Takemura for his views on its impact on Japan's foreign policy.    New party Sakigake is a splinter group of the largest  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Takemura served as  chief cabinet secretary of the previous government of former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Takemura, whose party quit the ruling coalition last month,  assured Perry that Japan will stick by its close relationship  with the United States under the present government of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata or any future "post-Hata" government.    Takemura also told Perry that "there is no doubt" that Japan  will play its part in implementing any sanctions the United  Nations may impose on North Korea in connection with its  suspected nuclear arms development.    Takemura is currently on a private visit to the U.S.    He is expected to meet other senior U.S. Government  officials  before leaving for San Francisco to give an address, the aide  said.</p>

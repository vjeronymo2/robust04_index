			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Three-week deadline set for US-EC trade pact THE US yesterday withdrew the immediate threat of trade sanctions against the European Community in its row over EC public purchasing policies. The decision followed a three-hour meeting in Brussels between senior trade negotiators. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said after the talks that the two sides would aim to settle differences by the time he next meets Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, in Washington on April 19. If agreement is not reached by then, both sides will be 'free to act as we wish'. The Community has outlined a package of new proposals on public procurement, which Sir Leon said met EC concerns about the US market and vice versa. The two said they had agreed not to reveal details of the package. At the end of what appeared to have been difficult talks, Mr Kantor insisted he was 'neither an optimist, nor a pessimist, but a realist' over the prospect of averting the clash on EC procurement rules. 'On first reading, there is not complete agreement. Some of it may not be in our interest. We have work to do.' He said he 'was pleased that a constructive proposal was put on the table', but added: 'We may not be able to reach an agreement.' An EC official expressed satisfaction that the immediate prospect of conflict had been averted, noting that this would have complicated negotiations both on procurement and on wider international negotiations on trade reform under the Uruguay Round. He nevertheless conceded that the April 19-20 deadline for agreement would create intense pressure on negotiators. Mr Kantor said later: 'If we cannot get this done in the next three weeks, then of course . . . the US will be forced to invoke sanctions.' At the heart of the dispute is US anger at a new EC Utilities Directive, which opens up the EC procurement market to foreign bidders, but allows EC authorities to favour EC bidders so long as they are no more than 3 per cent more expensive than foreign competitors. Sir Leon said yesterday he had agreed to make preparations to dismantle the offending article giving preference to EC bidders, so that it could be removed rapidly in the event of agreement on April 19. He said the EC proposals were 'recognised by the US as being promising, but require a considerable degree of further exploration and discussion'. EC negotiators remain adamant that the US must remove discrimination in the way US state and municipal governments award procurement contracts if the EC's 3 per cent preference is to be discarded. Mr Kantor said that amendment of the offending article would not be acceptable. As a measure of the gulf still to be bridged by negotiators, Mr Kantor later insisted the Buy America Act 'has had no effect on European suppliers'. On wider bilateral trade negotiations, he said tariff cuts had been discussed that would be 'much larger than has been discussed in the past, both in terms of the sectors and in terms of the reductions of tariffs involved'.

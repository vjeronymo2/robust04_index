			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Channel 5 winner will have to retune VCRs THE Independent Television Commission confirmed yesterday that the successful applicant for the Channel 5 franchise will have to carry out the retuning of several million video recorders. Estimates for the retuning cost have ranged from Pounds 50m to Pounds 200m. In advertising the franchise the ITC warned it might not award a licence at all unless the work could be done efficiently. The new television channel will be able to reach 74 per cent of the population but about 3m video recorders would suffer serious interference because they are tuned to frequencies to be used by Channel 5. Applicants for the franchise are expected to include Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian television entrepreneur, and Five TV, a consortium which includes Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto. Mr Oliver Novick, vice-president for corporate development at Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest, said yesterday the ITC announcement 'means we can now get down to the business of developing detailed and comprehensive plans'. The winner of the franchise will have to pay for most of the retuning. Bidders have to include a detailed plan on how they propose to retune or modify the 15 per cent to 20 per cent of VCRs and the 10 per cent of satellite receivers expected to face interference. The plans will be published for comment and will be taken into account in deciding whether the ITC believes a bidder will be able to maintain a service throughout the 10-year period of the licence. Mr George Russell, chairman of the ITC, has described retuning as 'at best a headache, at worst a nightmare'. Mr David Glencross, chief executive of the ITC, said he was optimistic the problem could be solved. If the commission was not satisfied 'it will feel it is justified in not awarding the licence'. The ITC has prepared a code of practice which specifies that retuning should be done within 21 days of a request being made or interference beginning, whichever is later. The winner of the competitive tender for the new channel will also face growing competition from cable and satellite television. Mr Glencross said yesterday: 'We are not guaranteeing that we will award it (the licence). We are not guaranteeing that if it is awarded it will be a commercial success. It is a commercial risk.' The new channel must start by January 1 1995 and should cover no less than 30 per cent of the population from the outset. The full 74 per cent coverage has to be reached within six years of launch. It must begin with at least 30 per cent original programming. News, current affairs, childrens' and religious programmes are mandatory. Six further programme types are listed such as documentaries, adult education, drama and arts. A bidder deciding not to show such programme types has to explain how it can meet the government's stipulation that Channel 5 offer high-quality programmes catering to a wide variety of tastes and interests. Mr Glencross emphasised that nothing in the 1990 Broadcasting Act specified that Channel 5 should be located outside London, and the ITC was not allowed to discriminate in favour of an applicant offering local television services as opposed to a single national channel. Channel 5 could, however, be a subscription service rather than one funded by advertising.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Gartmore Banque Indosuez could hardly have chosen a more auspicious moment to offer 25 per cent of Gartmore. The heady level of world stock markets is inflating the value of funds under management across the industry. For a pension fund manager like Gartmore, that feeds through directly into higher fees. Due to its enviable investment record, Gartmore is also winning new business hand over fist. An especially good investment performance last year will keep the three-year investment record in good shape, even if it now suffers a run of bad luck. Since Gartmore is only the fourth largest pension fund manager in the UK - and less than one third the size of MAM measured by funds under management - there is room for further growth without the costs associated with a big push in unit trusts or an overseas acquisition. The Goode committee's proposals on pension law reform were not onerous enough to cause a stampede away from defined-benefit pension schemes, so demand for fund managers' services looks secure. If Gartmore can keep its costs under control and maintain a decent investment record, its earnings outlook is rosy. The worry is that gearing to the level of equity markets cuts both ways. If share prices started to trickle back, it would require a prodigious new business effort to maintain funds under management and fee income. A stock market shake-out would send the sector reeling. Not even a fund manager which called the top for its clients would be immune from that.</p>

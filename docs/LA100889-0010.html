			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOST IN THE JUNGLE;  </P> <P> THE GEOGRAPHY OF DESIRE BY ROBERT BOSWELL; (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 320 PP.;  0-394-57690-X)  </P> <P> I very much wanted to like this ambitious novel by a good writer, whose  previous fiction has garnered deserving praise. "The Geography of Desire"  showcases Robert Boswell's virtuosity as a phrasemaker and storyteller, but the  book's message is unfortunately skewed by a Latin setting too rarefied to be  believed.  </P> <P> I happen to have read "Geography of Desire" in a northern Honduran coastal town  similar to the one described in the novel, which is set in the backwaters of a  country like Nicaragua around the mid-'70s. Boswell deliberately blurs his  coordinates in order to highlight his main theme: the hero's attempt to  reconcile his polymorphous desires with personal authenticity. The coastal  resort of La Boca is portrayed as a sultry paradise menaced by the gathering  revolution. All its residents, adolescents included, speak a stage dialogue  spotted with epigrams and elliptic phrases. They move in a kind of liquid  amber, as if they were already living in memory. As a movie, "Geography of  Desire" would fall somewhere between "Mosquito Coast" and "Night of the  Iguana." But it has neither the raw, narrative force of Theroux's novel, nor  the densely textured atmosphere of Tennessee Williams' plays.  </P> <P> Leon, the expatriate protagonist, is served up as a post-modernist homme moyen  sensuel who seeks redemption by plotting accurately the latitudes and  longitudes of his desires. In the most stunning scene of the novel, Leon's  jilted young lover, Lourdes, shouts in despair,  </P> <P> "Is it geography. I've studied the arrangement of the continents, the  prevailing winds, the ocean currents . . . I can name you the layers of the sky  . . ." Lourdes then races naked through the jungle, where she rapes her adoring  childhood admirer, Benjamin. Unappeased, Lourdes spends the night with a  stranded gringo backpacker. In the morning she beats him unconscious, makes off  with his clothes and his hunting knife and returns to town to murder her rival,  beautiful Pilar, whom she baselessly accuses of becoming pregnant to steal Leon  away from her.  </P> <P> Pilar, a Marxist revolutionary who loves Leon without condition, aspires to a  small refuge of lucid sensuality between the "abyss of mindless emotion" and  "the wasteland of heartless intellect." For all her ill-starred attractiveness,  Boswell's Pilar finally seems as self-consciously invented as Hemingway's  counterpart in "For Whom the Bell Tolls," who waits for the earth to move when  she makes love with Robert Jordan. A more successful portrait is that of Leon's  friend, the storyteller Ramon, who uncovers the miraculous hidden within the  ordinary. Ramon's gift deserts him when he unleashes the monster of Lourdes'  jealousy out of a blind obsession with assuring a better future for his son.  </P> <P> The metaphor linking inner and outer geographies is brilliantly conceived, but  the novel is damagingly divorced from the reality of the world it portrays. Its  political and social concerns are poorly clothed abstractions, and the  narrative and dialogue are encrusted with aphorisms that please the ear but  create a hard, alienating surface. La Boca itself, for all its exotic locale,  lacks the harsh colors and subtly corrupt atmosphere of Central America's  Caribbean coast.  </P> <P> In my Honduran counterpart to La Boca, Eros and revolution are similarly wedded  into the visible and invisible landscape, but conversation centers on the  depletion of lobster and shrimp stocks in the ocean, and the disappearing  mahogany forests as the sawmills move ever closer to the coast. The curious  hammetism of La Boca induces a corresponding detachment in the reader, rather  than the timeless universality the novel intends. Too many of the secondary  characters in "Geography of Desire" are pale borrowings from Garcia Marquez and  other Latin novelists, or manipulated projections of Leon's and the author's  erotic preoccupation. The gnomic platitudes of the dying revolutionary, Samuel,  are simply preposterous.  </P> <P> The thicket which traps sounds and shadows from the dinosaur age as well as the  lovemaking of La Boca's recent ancestors is a deft magic realist touch but it  serves no illuminating purpose to the main theme. The reappearing terodactyl  takes on significance only when it casts a shadow larger than that of the  airplane about to bomb La Boca. Lourdes' crime of passion is the most powerful  scene in the book, and one the residents of my Honduran village would find  instantly credible, as they hear or read about similar stories every week.  </P> <P> The narrator's redemption of Leon after a week of bereavement, and his  emergence from near drowning in the ocean as a resurrected "good man", comes  across not only as a rigged ending, but as simply irrelevant. What is most  convincing about Leon is his search for an honest connectedness, a continuity  of feeling, in the wake of his marital failures. In the end, he is defeated by  the two-headed beast of his desire which cannot choose between the loving Pilar  and the volcanic Lourdes, and he proves incapable of loving either one. The  shapes of Leon's desire cannot fill the larger shapes of his loneliness, and so  they remain unredeemed.  </P> <P> Lourdes' mother's verdict on Leon may serve this novel equally well: "He  sincerely desires to be good. That is often the most dangerous kind of person."  And, she might have added, the most seductive of novelists' footfalls.  </P></p>

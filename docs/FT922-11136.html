			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Just the job-share for personnel - In a Nutshell Employing a personnel manager is low on the list of priorities of most small businesses because of the cost involved. Yet as a business grows, managing staff can be a problem. An answer may lie in a pilot programme being undertaken with five south London businesses to share the services of a personnel manager for a year. The Locum Personnel Service has set up Q-Tab, a training consultancy, with funding from Aztec, a south-west London Training and Enterprise Council, and Wandsworth Council. Each of the participating companies will pay Pounds 2,000 towards the cost, equivalent to Pounds 5,600 for each company. They will be allocated 40 days' help and advice a year. The personnel manager involved is Trevor Croucher, who has 15 years' experience in the public sector. Q-Tab hopes the scheme will be taken up in other areas and plans to repeat the pilot in its own area if it is successful. *Q-Tab. Suite 18, Lombard Business Centre, 50 Lombard Road, London SW11 3SU.

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lure of gold outweighs political risks of Tajikistan - A look at a joint venture using foreign capital in the central Asian republic that is expected to be producing to ten tonnes a year by 1998 Tajikistan's first gold joint venture using foreign capital hopes to be producing ten tonnes (321.540 troy ounces) a year by 1998, against the country's previous peak gold output of 2.5 tonnes. Like many other mining projects in the former Soviet Union, this venture involves a small western company - British &amp; Commonwealth Minerals. It has 49 per cent and operating control of the joint venture that has won the rights to an area in the Central Asian nation's Zeravshan Valley containing two mines, both fully-developed, a treatment plant and proven and probable gold reserves estimated at 16m ounces (497 tonnes). The Tajikistan government, which owns the rest of the joint venture, is contributing the exploration rights and about Dollars 500m worth of infrastructure and mining equipment, much of it new, remaining after the former Soviet Union collapsed three years ago. European and Canadian investors last month provided USDollars 40m towards the venture. This was raised by London broker T. Hoare for Nelson Trade &amp; Finance, a Toronto-quoted company that once financed the controversial Hollywood movie, 9 1/2 Weeks. This financing scheme resulted in Nelson, which previously owned 25 per cent of CBM, taking full control. Mr Richard Northcott, chairman of Nelson, said that after costs and payments to the estate of Mr Cameron Glover, who set up CBM and died recently in an air accident in Argentina, about Dollars 30m was available for the Tajik venture. Mr Northcott said that, when more equity funding was needed, Nelson would consider applying for a London stock exchange quotation. In the meantime, both the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank offshoot, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development had been approached to provide debt capital. The joint venture seems likely to be followed by a spate of other mineral deals involving western companies in Central Asia, whose five republics are estimated to contain well over half the former Soviet Union's minerals wealth. Tajikistan itself not only offers gold but has large deposits of silver, antimony and boron. Mineral specialists ask a number of questions about working in Central Asia, issues faced by a multitude of western energy groups that have established local offices. The main issue will probably be political risk - will cash-poor nations like Tajikistan ultimately allow their mineral wealth to be exported, and, if they don't, will they have the money to develop it themselves? A second question is whether Russia, which has been blocking the region from exporting its natural gas and oil, will allow Central Asia to develop its natural wealth independently. Western officials in Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, tend to give the Tajik government the benefit of the doubt, but stress that it is too early to be sure. 'You can cut a deal with this government. Whether they honour it is another question,' said one western analyst. 'They haven't really been put to the test yet.' Russia's reaction to all the new activity hasn't been gauged. Yet the deals are piling up, both in Tajikistan and the rest of the region. Only this week, the UK company Gold &amp; Minerals Excavation signed a gold exploration deal for Tajikistan's southern Darwaz region. Canada's Gulf Minerals is looking into a tailings project in the same area, according to Mr Giorgi Kashlakov, a senior economic adviser to the prime minister. Lonrho, the international mining and trading group, meanwhile, after losing out on the Zeravshan mining project, is considering a large antimony-gold deposit in central Tajikistan near Iskanderkul Lake, Mr Kashlakov said. Outside Tajikistan, CBM itself is negotiating to develop gold deposits in the neighbouring Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan. These are in addition to previous gold deals announced by Canada's Cameco in the Kyrgyz Republic, Newmont of the US in Uzbekistan, and a venture involving London Stock Exchange-listed Bakyrchik Gold in Kazakhstan. CBM's success in Tajikistan so far appears attributable to long-cultivated contacts in Tajikistan's extremely complex political sphere. CBM has had an advantage because Mr Richard Wilkins, commercial director of the joint venture company, Zeravshan Gold, has been developing close relationships with both sides in Tajikistan's civil war since 1991. Mr Wilkins is confident that the political risk for CBM is low, and that the company will be able either to ship its gold to market, or sell it to the Tajikistan government for dollars at world prices. 'My job is to keep up contacts with the government,' Mr Wilkins says. 'Even if they overturned the whole leadership and brought in the opposition, it wouldn't worry me.' CBM expects the joint venture to produce its first gold from the Jilau open pit mine where mining and processing is taking place only ten days a month because of lack of funds. By targetting some high grade ore, Jilau could be producing at an annual rate of 80,000 to 100,000 ounces by the end of 1995, suggests Mr Roger Turner, chairman of the joint venture company. More work would be needed at the Taror underground mining complex before production could begin in earnest in 1998, particularly on how the ore, which contains substantial quantities of arsenic, should be treated. Mr Turner pointed out that environmental clean-up was not a problem as the mines and plant were new. However, the joint venture would have to ensure that the mining town of 2,000 people - with its infrastructure of roads, power plant, water and sewage plants as well as a school and hospital - was kept supplied. At present there were shortages of some essentials, such as fuel for central heating. Meanwhile, Tajik Geology has been contracted by CBM to do Dollars 2m of exploration work a year in the Zeravshan Valley.</p>

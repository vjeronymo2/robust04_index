			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / BNP share sale price set low THE FRENCH government yesterday set a lower than expected price of FFr240 (Pounds 27.33) on shares in Banque Nationale de Paris, the country's third largest bank, in an attempt to draw investors to the first issue in its privatisation programme. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said the issue, which will be offered to investors from today, 'is aimed primarily at French households'. Analysts in Paris said the price of the issue, which values the bank at about FFr43bn, was at least FFr10 lower than forecast. This demonstrated the government's desire to guarantee a successful start to its plan to privatise 21 groups. 'They want to begin with a bang,' said Mr David Harrington, of James Capel in Paris. Mr Alphandery also gave details of a group of stable investors that will hold about 30 per cent of BNP's shares. These mainly comprise French financial and industrial groups, but they will also include General Electric of the US, BAT Industries of the UK, Roche Holding of Switzerland, Dresdner Bank of Germany and the Kuwait Investment Authority. BAT said participation in the core shareholding was the most certain way of ensuring it received shares in the bank. A position in the so-called 'noyau dur' would also be an advantage in participating in the privatisation of Seita, the state tobacco monopoly. Under the terms of the BNP issue, which will close on October 12, some 72m shares will be offered for sale. The privatisation of BNP will raise about FFr28bn for the government. The target for the year is FFr40bn. Lex, Page 20</p>

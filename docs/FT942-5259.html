			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Obituary: Lord Thorneycroft - cabinet minister and party chairman A lost cabinet battle over curbing public expenditure and the brilliant generalship which helped to achieve the 1979 general election victory launching Baroness Thatcher on her 11-year premiership were the two peaks in the distinguished political career of Lord Thorneycroft, who has died at the age of 84. His firm advocacy of monetarist policies was central to both those outstanding events - separated by an interval of 21 years - during his terms as chancellor and as chairman of the Conservative party. Lady Thatcher's initial insistence that the palliative of printing money could no longer be used to treat the nation's economic ills reflected the unheeded warnings given by Peter Thorneycroft when he resigned as chancellor in January 1958, just 12 months after he had succeeded Harold Macmillan as the occupant of 11 Downing Street. The resignation was timed to achieve maximum effect. It was tendered on the eve of Macmillan's departure on the first extended tour of the Commonwealth undertaken by a British prime minister after the second world war. Thorneycroft, with strong support from his two ministerial lieutenants at the Treasury, Mr Enoch Powell, financial secretary, and Nigel Birch, economic secretary, had sought to hold down the estimates so that current expenditure in 1958-59 did not exceed the total for the previous year. In cabinet Thorneycroft was out-manoeuvred by Macmillan, whose pro-Keynesian attitude mirrored the memories of the hardships resulting from mass unemployment in the 1930s, which he had seen at first hand as MP for Stockton-on-Tees. The prime minister's persuasive arguments for a more flexible approach left Thorneycroft isolated in a cabinet still struggling to restore the equilibrium of the Conservative party after the Suez crisis. The chancellor said in his resignation letter: 'I recognise that in order to achieve my aim some combination of politically unpopular courses would have been necessary. I never-theless regard the limitation of government expenditure as a prerequisite to the stability of the pound, the stabilisation of prices and the prestige and standing of our country in the world.' Mr Powell and Birch left office at the same time. Macmillan went ahead with his Commonwealth tour, dismissing the resignations of the three Treasury ministers as 'a little local difficulty'. It was two decades later, and after another Tory chancellor (the then Anthony Barber) had acquiesced in policies which resulted in sterling M3 rising by about 25 per cent in 1972 and 1973, before Thorneycroft, as party chairman, saw the monetarist principle he had espoused endorsed by the then Mrs Thatcher and her shadow cabinet. During his tenure as chancellor, Thorneycroft was at the centre of another damaging political storm. In September 1957 there were allegations that his decision to increase the bank rate by 2 percentage points - it went up to the then crisis level of 7 per cent, its highest point for 36 years - had been 'leaked'. Mr Harold Wilson (now Lord Wilson), then the shadow chancellor, led a sustained campaign for a public inquiry in which he relied heavily on what he called 'very disquieting reports in a number of responsible newspaper and City circles'. Those suggested that there had been considerable selling in the gilt-edged markets on September 18 and 19 as a result of advance information about the bank rate increase. Innuendo abounded as Thorneycroft strongly repudiated any suggestion of impropriety. A tribunal presided over by Lord Justice Parker found that there was 'no justification for allegations that information about the raising of the bank rate was improperly disclosed to any person'. Thorneycroft, who first entered the cabinet as president of the board of trade in Churchill's 1951 administration, spent more than two years on the Tory backbenches, amid rumours that he was about to renew an earlier flirtation with the vocal but politically impotent Liberals. Macmillan, in an adept exercise in political management, persuaded Thorneycroft to return to office in July 1960 as minister of aviation. He moved closer to the upper reaches of the cabinet when appointed minister of defence in 1962. Thorneycroft was widely praised for the skill and tact with which he overcame old inter-service rivalries to integrate the three service departments into a unified Ministry of Defence. He became the first secretary of state for defence in April 1964. After the Tory election defeat in October 1964 Thorneycroft occupied a prominent place on the opposition front bench in the Commons. He was seen by some of his parliamentary colleagues as a possible alternative to Mr Edward Heath (now Sir Edward) and Reginald Maudling in the somewhat confused atmosphere which marked the approach to the leadership contest after the resignation of Sir Alec Douglas-Home (now Lord Home) in 1965. His opportunity depended on the emergence of a deep division in the parliamentary party with the choice between the two principals ending in deadlock. Maudling's decision to withdraw after the clear preference shown for Mr Heath in the first ballot left Thorneycroft a non-runner in the leadership stakes. Thorneycroft became a life peer in 1967 and quickly proved to be as formidable a debater in the calmer atmosphere of the upper chamber as he had been when the Commons was at its most boisterous. His harmonious relationship with Mrs Thatcher, however, did not last indefinitely. He was replaced as party chairman in 1981 after suggesting that some of her policies were unduly harsh. His ministerial experience was buttressed by a detailed knowledge of company management. At different times he was chairman of Pirelli General and Trusthouse Forte.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Plans for bus deregulation mark end for Travelcard LONDON Transport yesterday publicly acknowledged for the first time that the popular Travelcard season ticket scheme, allowing unlimited use of the capital's buses, Underground and local trains, was doomed. Mr Alan Watkins, LT's chief executive, told the cross-party Commons transport committee that the proliferation of bus operators resulting from the planned deregulation of London bus services would make it impractical to carry on with the scheme. He said the Travelcard could be replaced by a chargeable electronic 'smart card' that would react with equipment on buses or stations to debit users for each individual journey. 'I don't think something called Travelcard is likely to survive,' Mr Watkins said. 'We need to give a safe berth to something of that kind, but we believe the only way of doing that is through electronic ticketing.' Mr David Bayliss, LT's director of planning, predicted that if a card were introduced allowing unlimited bus and train use, it would either be restricted to certain routes or be sold as a high-priced premium product. The Travelcard scheme, launched in May 1983, allows Londoners to buy a ticket for periods ranging from a day to a year and travel as much as they like by bus, Underground or British Rail trains within the zones for which the ticket is valid. Critics say Travelcards are underpriced because holders in effect get free transport around the capital for all journeys beyond a daily return trip to work. Travelcard's many supporters say the ticket eases traffic flow by encouraging people to use public transport. Mr Watkins said it would be impractical to operate the Travelcard after deregulation because it would mean trying to draw up a revenue-sharing agreement among 40 or more bus operators. The government plans to privatise London Buses this year and deregulate services in the capital by 1995. Its plans were fiercely attacked in written evidence submitted to the transport committee by Grey-Green Coaches, one of the biggest companies operating London bus services under contract to London Transport.</p>

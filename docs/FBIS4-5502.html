			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The government Tuesday [12  April] endorsed a bill to provide consumers with greater  protection against accidents and injuries caused by defective  products. The product liability bill would require consumers  seeking compensation to simply prove that a product was faulty,  instead of having to prove negligence by the maker which is  necessary at present.    But the bill failed to include a provision holding makers  liable for damage or injury through assumption of a link between  the damage or injury and a product defect. The bill also limits  the duration of liability by corporations to 10 years after  products are put on the market, differing from the 20 years  stipulated under the civil code.    Speaking before a regular news conference Tuesday, Economic  Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota said the bill  marks "a big turning point" for Japanese consumers.    Consumer protection in this country has improved to levels  of  the European Union, she said, terming the bill "the biggest  reform effort for upgrading people's livelihood under the  current cabinet." The bill is basically in line with  recommendations made by the social policy council, an advisory  body to the prime minister, in December last year.    The measure will be introduced in the parliament later  Tuesday and could be implemented by the middle of 1995. It took  almost 20 years for the bill to be finalized since the council  first began debate on better consumer protection from defective  products in 1975.    Under the bill, a product is regarded as defective if it  lacks the safety that a user is entitled to expect.    Judgment on the safety will be made according to three  criteria -- the nature and normally expected functions of the  product, the timing of the product's shipment and whether or not  it was in normal use. This is down from nine criteria  recommended by the council.    The scope of products subject to the proposed law is defined  as manufactured or processed products.    As a result, blood products, some of which were infected  with  the virus that causes AIDS, will be covered by the law. The  council originally proposed that blood products be excluded.    The bill says those held liable for damage or injury are not  only makers and importers but companies indirectly engaged in  manufacturing, such as those indicated in a label of the  product. But makers will be cleared of responsibility if they  can show that defects could not have been foreseen even with  up-to-date technologies available at the time of the product's  distribution.    This provision is intended to avoid discouraging  manufacturers from pursuing technological innovation, which  would eventually work to the disadvantage of consumers, an EPA  official said.    International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai  described the bill as "well balanced" in light of the overall  framework of Japan's civil code and the current global trend  toward better protection of consumers.    The Trade Ministry will make efforts to establish legal and  other frameworks to upgrade products' safety, Kumagai told a  regular press conference.</p>

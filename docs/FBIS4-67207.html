			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philip Sherwell in Bangkok: "Thai Drugs Trial </F> Told of &pound;1,000 for `Mule'"]    [Text] Sandra Gregory stood in the witness box in her  Bangkok drugs case for the first time yesterday and blamed her  co-accused, Robert Lock.    Choking back tears, Gregory told the court her fellow Briton  had promised to pay her &pound;1,000 to act as a "mule" by  smuggling 87 grams of heroin to Japan for him.    She said he had bought the drugs which she was caught with  at  the city's airport last year.    Sitting in leg-irons and a faded prison tunic, Lock, 30, who  has denied all charges, watched the proceedings impassively.    He was carrying no drugs when he was arrested with Gregory  after they checked in with his girlfriend, Ruth Billingham, for  a flight to Tokyo. Lock insists he was simply going on holiday  to Japan with Billingham and met Gregory at the airport.    But the court has previously heard that undercover narcotics  agents at the British Embassy had tipped off Thai customs to  watch out for Lock, whom they suspected of drug smuggling.    Gregory, 28, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorks, who faces a  minimum 25 years in jail after pleading guilty, was found with  the drugs hidden in her body in four condoms.    After giving evidence for two hours she said from her cell:  "I couldn't believe I was talking about myself. I can't believe  I am in this position.    "I did it because I needed the money to get back home. It  sounded too good to be true and there was supposed to be no  chance of getting caught."    In her evidence she told her lawyer that Lock, who ran a  jewellery business in Bangkok, came to her guesthouse a few  hours before the flight last February and gave her the drugs.  They had met previously to discuss the trip.    Gregory, who had been teaching English in Bangkok for two  years, told the court she was suffering from fever and wanted  the money for a ticket home.    Under cross-examination from Lock's lawyer, Khun Puttri,  Gregory said she had only previously seen heroin in newspaper  pictures.    The lawyer focused on apparent discrepancies between her  initial written statement and her testimony yesterday, most  notably on how much money she claimed Lock was to pay her.    The case, which has already lasted a year, was adjourned  until May 16.</p>

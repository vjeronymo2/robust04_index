			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: CrossRail would be folly Sir, The 'business as usual' tone of the comment following the collapse of the CrossRail bill ('Search starts for a way to revive CrossRail', May 12) and your editorial comment ('CrossRail debacle', May 12) surely miss the point. It would appear that the economic return from investing in CrossRail is inadequate and that the Commons committee was mindful of this when blocking the bill. You remark that the Jubilee Line was given the go-ahead as a political gesture; but to go ahead with the CrossRail project would be to repeat the folly. There is a need for more investment in public transport infrastructure, but let us invest wisely. Projects with good social cost benefit returns do exist. But these often appear to lack the glamour of the mega project or they serve less politically charged interested groups. Nevertheless, in the long run the economy will be better served by the adoption of a more rational and consistent approach to transport investments.

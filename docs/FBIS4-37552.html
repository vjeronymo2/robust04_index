			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Hashemi-Rafsanjani by former </F> French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and other members of  selected panel in Crans Montana on 16 June -- live; in French,  with passage by passage translation into Persian by unidentified  moderator; italics indicate portions audible in French that  differ from Persian translation]    [Excerpt] [Dumas] Mr. President, I am listening to  our conversation in Spanish, this is one of the wonders of the  airwaves, but it does not matter. We have a certain number of  questions interesting those taking part in the forum and I would  like to ask them.    The first question concerns regional tensions centered  around  Iran. What will be the policy of the Islamic Republic toward  the territories occupied by Kurdish people in Iraq and Turkey?  Second, what do you think about the development of ethnic  conflicts in the republics of the former Soviet Union, and what  is the Islamic Republic's attitude concerning these conflicts?  This is the first question summing up the various interventions  from the participants to the forum.    [Unidentified moderator] Your Excellency, Mr. President. My  first question is regarding relations between Iran and its  neighbors, in particular the territories in Iraq and Turkey  inhabited by Kurds. The second question is on the policy of the  Islamic Republic of Iran toward differences in the states of the  former Soviet Union?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] On Iran's neighbors. Our principled  policy is to have peaceful and friendly cooperation with them.  And should issues occur, the principle is to solve them through  negotiation and debate. Regarding Iraq and Kordestan, naturally  our declared policy is to respect Iraq's territorial integrity.  Territorial integrity must be maintained. The Kurds in Turkey  and Iraq will be members of these countries. However, it is of  course possible in these countries to give them rights, as a  nationality, with their own consent.    Regarding the states which have separated from the former  Soviet Union. Unfortunately, difference have occurred in some  places. Our policy is to help them solve the differences. Our  advice to others, even Russia, is not to interfere in these  countries. In a country where people have been liberated after  70 years, it is natural to have various forms of demands and for  differences to occur. Others should help solve the problems  properly, not interfere, and not weaken the independence of the  country.    [Dumas] Thank you, Mr. President. If I may, I will ask  two other questions -- one about an issue of great concerns to  Europeans, namely Bosnia. As we all know, there are armed  Muslims opposing Serbs in several regiosn of Bosnia, there is a  war. How do you see Iran's role? What role can Iran play in  this situation? Is it a purely diplomatic role? Could it be a  support for these combatants taking the form of arms supplies?  Or coudl we envisage a direct intervention? What is your  country's position on this worrying Bosnian conflict?    [Moderator] Your Excellency Mr. President. Thank you for the  answers, and now I must ask another question. My first question  is about Bosnia. As you know, a group of Muslims live in this  country and are in conflict with the Serbs. What is the policy  of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding these Muslims? Does  Iran have a purely political role or a role in providing arms to  the Muslims? Are the other means of aid provided by the Islamic  Republic a form of direct interference, or do they come under  the category of ordinary aid?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Regarding Bosnia. Unfortunately, there  has been a tragic situation there. The hands of the majority of  the people of this country have been tied, but a minority, the  Serbs, have been allowed to commit aggression. That is, they  can have a direct link with the former Yugoslavia, which  supports them. Our policy is to end the war, with the help of  the United Nations and you, the powerful European countries and  neighbors, and through peaceful ways and negotiations. If the  war is to continue, despite the intentions and wishes of all  sincere individuals, the present situation will have to change.  If you, the United Nations and others, feel unable to end the  war, you should allow the innocent party to have defensive  capabilities.    Of course, we have until now acted according to the UN  policy. Our aid has been very clear. It was financial, fuel,  and humanitarian. We proposed to send a peacekeeping force,  because it has been said that the peacekeeping force there is  weak. In the future we shall try to progress with the UN  policy. But we firmly ask everyone to have a just policy. Do  not allow the violation of a peoples' right. This would create  a center of aggravation and disease in the Balkan region, and  this would be difficult to cure in the future.    [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. President for your reply. One of  the gentlemen at the session wishes to ask you a question.    [J.P. Carteron, not further identified, in French] Mr.  President, I would like to ask you a very important question for  us here. Iran's relations with France and Switzerland are not  good. Serious court cases provoking a violent dispute are  currently under way. Your deputy foreign Minister, Mahmoud  Va'ezi, was recently received by French President Francois  Mitterrand. This is obviously a gesture by both sides. Does  this represent a coming together? At last, Mr. President, I  would like you to tell us, how do you see the means to improve  your relations with France and Switzerland on a very specific  plan?    [Moderator] Mr. President, my question is considered very  important here. My question concerns France's and Switzerland's  relations with Iran, which are not at all good. Recently Iran's  Deputy Foreign Minister Va'ezi was in France, where he met  Francois Mitterrand, and apparently some measures were taken. In  your excellency's opinion, what are the significant factors  contributing to the improvement of Iran's relations with France  and Switzerland, and what suggestions can you make in that  respect?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Very well. It is possible to speak in  length about that, but our time is short here. I think if our  friends in France try not to be influenced by the false  propaganda which is waged against Iranian policies, then we can  quite easily expand our cooperation. The political intent  toward further cooperation exists in Iran. [passage omitted]    [Dumas] Thank you, Mr. President. Could I ask you now a  question about a worrying issue -- Algeria? As you know, the  Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS, is openly fighting the  authorities in Algeria. What attitude does Iran want and what  attitude can it adopt concerning this situation? I sum up: Can  Iran be a mere observer, a mediator, or is it actively  supporting the FIS?    [Moderator] Thank you, Your Excellency Mr. President. My  other question is regarding Algeria. As you know,  fundamentalist Muslims, the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], are  virtually at war with the Algerian Government. I would like to  know, what is the policy of the Islamic Republic here? Has  there only been advice or has there been help by the Islamic  Republic for these groups?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The Algerian issue must be important  for  you, as well. An unfortunate event occurred in Algeria and the  vote of a nation's majority was not respected. I think it must  be one of the most bitter problems for the champions of  democracy. We think the solution in Algeria lies in respect for  people's vote. I think we have been blamed because we spoke our  views frankly and without hesitation. There has been no other  interference on our behalf in the Algerian issue.    Our advice to you, as well as the people and Government of  Algeria, is that we should come out of this. There is no other  way except respect for people's vote. We are not at all happy  with the destruction and the killings in this Muslim country.  We are surprised that you, the champions of democracy, fail to  see this very clear situation. I wish you would also answer  this question of mine. [passage omitted]</p>

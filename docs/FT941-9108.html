			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone sale approved Shareholders of Hartstone Group have approved resolutions regarding the sale of Cogetex in France and part of the UK hosiery business, which includes Bear Brand, to Courtaulds Textiles for Pounds 45.4m. Hartstone breached its banking covenants last summer and its current standstill agreement with its lenders expired yesterday. The company said no further formal standstill arrangement had been put in place because it believed conditional medium term facilities, which would extend until January 1996, would be forthcoming within the next ten days.</p>

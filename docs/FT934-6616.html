			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Accidents at work reach record low The number of deaths from accidents at work is the lowest on record, the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday. The commission's annual report says 430 people died from workplace accidents in the year to March, compared with 473 in the previous 12 months. The rate of fatal accidents has fallen for the third year running. It is expected to be 1.3 per 100,000 employees this year, less than a quarter of that at the beginning of the 1960s and half that of the early 1970s. Sir John Cullen, who retired as chairman of the commission in September, said the trends reflected 'some genuine improvements in safety, particularly in the high-risk sectors where we have concentrated effort, namely construction, mining and manufacturing'. He conceded that the improvements were partly attributable to changes in the structure of industry - a move away from high-risk heavy industries. The lack of improvement in the rate of non-fatal injuries, when changes in employment were taken into consideration, meant that the commission could 'derive little comfort' from the figures, he added. Mr Frank Davies, the new chairman, said that he welcomed the government's commitment to deregulation but it would have to be achieved without a reduction in standards. Mr Davies said the commission needed to come to terms with the fact that most British companies were small. He called for a partnership between the commission and private-sector safety officers and organisations. The number of serious accidents in the workplace was down from 29,707 to 28,018 and minor accidents from 154,338 to 140,365. While the non-fatal injury rate was down, the commission believes that the real position, after adjustments for industry changes are taken into account, could be worse than last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary by Yahya Rabah, Palestinian ambassador </F> in Sanaa]    [Excerpts] The pact announced last 22 April between Fatah  and the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has been widely  welcomed by all segments of the Palestinian community, both  inside and outside the homeland. [passage omitted]    Against this backdrop came the pact between Fatah and Hamas  -- a pact that has been widely welcomed and that defies Israel  and underscores the ability of principal Palestinian forces to  frustrate those who are wagering on Palestinian infighting,  which is preached by outside circles, including the Israelis.    As for the Palestinian opposition factions, no matter what  their political persuasion -- Islamic, nationalist, or leftist  -- there is an audible dialogue going on asking such questions  as these: What is our position? What is our role? How are we  perceived by our people? And, increasingly, difficult questions  are being asked.    Regrettably, certain Palestinian opposition leaders are  still  locked in a vicious circle and spitting out old slogans that  have grown out of touch with reality and are clinging to others  surrounded by [word indistinct]. However, instead of losing  patience, the PLO leadership should display a spirit of national  understanding and tolerance. This is because the Palestinian  homeland stands in need of all its sons, and it will take  considerable effort to establish an independent Palestinian  state. The easy way out and haphazard policies cannot hold out  for long. The remarkable Palestinian journey from exile to the  homeland will infuse the Palestinian people with an enormous  measure of [word indistinct] with self and to slough off  illusions and [word indistinct] false offensive.    Brothers: The Fatah-Hamas pact will create new mechanisms to  promote further successes. We have opened the door wide for  diaspora Palestinians to participate in the national march in  the face of adverse and untoward circumstances. We may as well  open the door even wider for a national effort inside the  homeland within the framework of the state, entity, and  independence.</p>

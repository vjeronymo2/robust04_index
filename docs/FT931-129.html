			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: EBC declines EBC Group, the West Country construction and development group, yesterday unveiled pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 1.28m for 1992. Recession severely affected all divisions but the private housing market has been devastated, said Mr Bert Cockroft, chairman. The group intends to achieve a complete withdrawal from housing activities 'as promptly as conditions permit'. It made a Pounds 3.6m provision to cover consequent losses. Turnover fell to Pounds 53.6m (Pounds 59.9m). Earnings per share were reduced to 9.35p (12.17p). A proposed final of 2.25p halves the total to 4p.</p>

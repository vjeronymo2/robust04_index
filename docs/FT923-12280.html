			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Fighting rages as Yugoslav PM offers peace talks MORTAR and machine gun fire echoed through Sarajevo last night, indicating that warring factions in the Bosnian capital had ignored a ceasefire negotiated by the European Community. The fighting persisted several hours after the deadline of 6pm set for the truce between the three main ethnic groups of Moslems, Serbs and Croats. It came as Mr Milan Panic, the new prime minister of Yugoslavia  - comprising Serbia and Montenegro - made a hastily arranged visit to Sarajevo. Bosnian radio, which also reported renewed clashes around Tuzla and Jajce, north of Sarajevo, said the mortar attacks had pinned down Mr Panic at the United Nations headquarters after talks with Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Panic offered to start immediate peace talks with Bosnian leaders to end the four-month war in Bosnia. After almost three hours of talks with Mr Izetbegovic, he said the Yugoslav and Serb side was ready to end 'this stupid, unbelievable, unconscionable war'. He said he had given Mr Izetbegovic 'a very short time to reply' and that, if he did not agree, the world would know which side wanted to continue the war. Mr Panic's peace mission follows the imposition on May 31 of tough UN sanctions on Yugoslavia in retaliation for backing Serb militia in Bosnia. Fighting between Serbs and mostly Moslem forces loyal to the Bosnian government yesterday continued in Gorazde, eastern Bosnia. Radio Sarajevo said civilians and Bosnian forces had suffered heavy casualties. Around 70,000 people are reported to have been trapped in Gorazde, which for three months has been surrounded by Serb militia and entirely cut off from the outside world. Gorazde is the region's last Moslem stronghold. The EC-sponsored ceasefire was intended to last at least 14 days, allowing time for all three sides to hand over heavy artillery to UN peacekeepers. It also calls for some 1.2m refugees to be allowed to return home. Mr Panic said his peace mission had the backing of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the militant leader of Bosnia's Serbs. The 62-year-old California millionaire who has US-Yugoslav dual nationality was due to travel to New York yesterday to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general. During a visit at the weekend to Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, called the ceasefire agreement 'a testing point'.</p>

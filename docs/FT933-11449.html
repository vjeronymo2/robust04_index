			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BAT to cut price of US cigarettes next month BAT INDUSTRIES will begin discounting a number of its US cigarette brands next month in response to Philip Morris's reduction in the wholesale price of Marlboro. Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, said yesterday that the wholesale price of Kool and Capri, its main premium brands, would be reduced by 40 cents a pack to match the Marlboro discount. At the same time, the list prices of its lower-priced brands, notably GPC, would be raised. 'It is too early to say what will happen in the retail market,' he said. But tactical action would be taken where necessary to protect market share. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said: 'The most recent developments indicate that the price of full revenue brands will be permanently reduced, making the industry as a whole less profitable but still strongly cash generative.' It was not the end of the road for premium brands, he added. 'The top end of the market is still highly profitable.' However, improving margins on discount brands would not fully compensate Brown &amp; Williamson, BAT's US subsidiary, for the profit reduction. Though the US price war would have a continuing impact into 1994 and beyond, Mr Broughton said it was unlikely to spread to other international markets. 'The US market is different from the rest with higher margins and different pricing categories.' The effect on BAT's results in the first half of the year was largely confined to a Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m) drop in Brown &amp; Williamson's trading profits, as a result of reductions in the stocks of Kool held in the trade. Overall operating profits from tobacco operations increased from Pounds 518m to Pounds 623m on turnover ahead from Pounds 5.51bn to Pounds 5.63bn.</p>

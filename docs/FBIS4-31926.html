			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by R.W.: "Public Opinion Research Institute for </F> RZECZPOSPOLITA; Important and More Important Elections"]    [Text] "From my point of view, the self-governmental and  parliamentary elections are equally important"--this according  to almost 40 percent of adult Poles, respondents to a poll  conducted at the request of our daily by the Public Opinion  Research Institute [PBS] in Sopot. Nearly 30 percent of  respondents believe that the parliamentary elections are more  important, and almost 20 percent that the self-governmental ones  are. Generally, then, the parliamentary elections are evaluated  as more important than the local elections. The poll was carried  out a week before the election date.    Both kinds of elections are often compared. Public opinion  researchers estimate that participation in the local elections  may be lower than in the parliamentary elections. A lot is  being said about the fact that the local elections have acquired  a political character, which results, among other things, from  the fact that they are being held just a few months after  parliamentary elections; those elections were lost by  postsolidarity and rightist groupings and won by parties with  origins tracing back to the Polish People's Republic. Thus, it  is another test of forces for both the winners and the losers.  In many cases, the coming elections will also acquire the  characteristics of a referendum for or against the  self-governmental authorities that have been in power since 1990.    We evaluate the intentions of our fellow countrymen slightly  differently from our own. According to 30 percent of the  respondents to the PBS poll, for other people the parliamentary  elections are more important; 14 percent say that the  self-governmental elections are more important; 4 percent  believe that neither set of elections is of any special  significance; and, according to 24 percent, Poles attach equal  importance to the self-governmental and parliamentary elections.  Almost 30 percent of the respondents had difficulty evaluating  the views of other people.    Representatives of groups that are higher in the social  hierarchy (the management cadre, well-off and educated people)  say relatively frequently that, for other people, more important  are the parliamentary elections; however, they themselves  usually say that both kinds of elections are equally important.  Also, the view has been confirmed that the idea of  self-government is more important for small communities. In  rural areas and small towns, there are more people for whom the  self-governmental elections are of greater importance than  parliamentary elections.    The poll was carried out on 11 and 12 June on a 1,043-person  representative sample of adult inhabitants of the country.  <H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |From your point of view, which elections, parliamentary or self-governmental,|  | are more important?                                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hard to tell                          |11 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Parliamentary elections               |29 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Self-governmental elections           |18 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Neither of them                       |5 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |They are of equal importance          |37 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

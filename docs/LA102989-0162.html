			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: ALL AT SEA ON THE MEXICAN RIVIERA  </P> <P> Cruise veterans can expect a deja vu season on the Mexican Riviera this winter,  with one familiar ship sporting a major face lift, another carrying a different  name and a big, bright ship coming in to replace its medium-size sister.  </P> <P> Princess' newly refurbished Fair Princess, the former Fairsea, kicked off its  winter Mexican Riviera season from the Port of Los Angeles in early October,  and is set to sail every Saturday through May 5 to Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta  and Cabo San Lucas.  </P> <P> Fares begin at $1,095 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip air  fare. Passengers not needing air fare can deduct a travel allowance. Princess  has lowered its Mexican Riviera cruise prices for 1990 across the board, by  $170 to $325 per person.  </P> <P> Biggest new features include an upgraded and expanded stage area in the  remodeled showroom, with the latest in sound and lighting systems. Live  satellite TV has also been installed to present televised sports events on  board. There are also new shops, plus new carpeting and upholstery and improved  service areas in the dining rooms.  </P> <P> Royal Caribbean Cruise Line makes its debut in the Los Angeles area this winter  with an already-familiar vessel, Admiral Cruises' Stardancer, which will be  transformed in early January into the Viking Serenade. Both companies are owned  by Royal Admiral Cruises.  </P> <P> The transfer will be made at the conclusion of the Stardancer's Jan. 6 sailing  to Mexico, when the ship will go into drydock for two weeks. Its car-carrying  capabilities will not be marketed by RCCL, and eventually the car deck will be  eliminated.  </P> <P> Seven-night cruises to the Mexican Riviera begin Jan. 27, calling at the same  ports as the Stardancer did -- Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas.  Prices begin at $995 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip air  fare. Passengers who don't use the air program will receive a $250 travel  allowance instead.  </P> <P> Carnival's 1,022-passenger Tropicale, based in Los Angeles since its debut in  1982 (except for two brief Alaska summers), will reposition to the East Coast  after its Dec. 31 New Year's cruise to Mexico. It will be replaced April 8 with  the bigger, newer Jubilee, which came into service in 1986 and carries as many  as 1,850 passengers.  </P> <P> Prices and ports of call will be the same, with seven-day sailings that include  round-trip air fare costing from $995 to $2,295 per person, double occupancy,  and calling at Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas.  </P> <P> Royal Cruise Line's Crown Odyssey will make two nine-day round-trip sailings  from Los Angeles Jan. 18 and 27. The nine-day cruises call at Puerto Vallarta,  Zihuatanejo, Acapulco and Cabo San Lucas, with four full days at sea to enjoy  the ship and its activities.  </P> <P> Prices begin at $1,998 per person, double occupancy, for a fairly spacious  inside double cabin (154 to 162 square feet) with two lower beds and bath with  shower. Passengers not using the add-on air fares can deduct $100 from the  cruise fare.  </P> <P> The 212-passenger Seabourn Pride, from San Francisco-based Seabourn Cruise  Line, sails from Acapulco to Los Angeles Nov. 28 on a seven-day voyage priced  from $3,725 per person, double occupancy. You can expect top-of-the-line food  and service on this new suites-only vessel.  </P> <P> Other seven-day sailings between Los Angeles and Acapulco are scheduled through  Feb. 13; 14-day round-trip cruises from Los Angeles are priced from $6,700 per  person, double occupancy.  </P> <P> Princess' Island Princess will make a series of 10-day sailings round trip from  Los Angeles that call at Acapulco, Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San  Lucas, as well as a seven-day Christmas cruise that departs Dec. 22 but does  not visit Acapulco. Prices begin at $1,645 per person, double occupancy,  including air fare, for the 10-day cruises and $1,545 for the Christmas cruise.  </P> <P> And from San Diego, Bermuda Star Line's 713-passenger Bermuda Star departs  Saturdays between Nov. 11 and April 14 on seven-day round-trip Mexico cruises  calling at -- you guessed it -- Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas.  </P> <P> Economy inside cabins begin as low as $895 per person, double occupancy,  including round-trip air fare or a $200 travel-allowance deduction. But unless  you're really economizing, you might prefer the mid-price cabins on this  vessel. Outside cabins cost from $1,095 per person, double occupancy, with $200  off that if you don't need the air fare.  </P> <P> Princess' Island Princess, the Seabourn Pride and the Crown Odyssey Cruise Line  also call at Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa. But what the Mexican Riviera really needs are  more new ports of call that can handle large ships and offer shore excursions.  </P> <P> Smaller expedition and shallow-draft vessels are introducing some different  ports, including the new resort development of Huatulco (Windstar Sail Cruises'  Wind Spirit on a repositioning voyage from Alaska to Barbados, Sept. 23, 1990),  and the charming fishing and surfing village of Puerto Escondido (Special  Expeditions' Sea Lion on a sailing from Costa Rica to Manzanillo, departing  Dec. 27).  </P></p>

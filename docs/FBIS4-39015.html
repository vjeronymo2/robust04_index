			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin "is likely to use  some form of persuasion on the upper chamber of the Russian  parliament in order to force a positive decision on the  introduction of Russian peacekeepers into Abkhazia during the  second consideration of this problem by the Federation Council,"  an employee of the presidential administration declared to  Interfax Friday.    He expressed his supposition saying that the refusal to  support the presidential address regarding forces' introduction  voiced the day before is "a kind of a gesture, an appeal to the  presidential team to develop such documents thoroughly." The  employee has no doubts that the majority of the Federation  Council understands the need to conduct a peacekeeping operation  in Transcaucasus.    The second consideration of the issue on introduction of  peacekeepers into Abkhazia in the Federation Council is  scheduled for June 21.    According to an Interfax source, "a slight" delay in the  introduction of peacekeepers into Abkhazia "is an unpleasant but  not a fatal fact." He does not predict any threat of resumption  of a widescale conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Aegis about to complete refinancing AEGIS, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media buying and planning group, expects to complete its Pounds 60m refinancing package by Monday. Some 14 per cent of its open offer of 231m new shares, at 20p a share, was taken up. Of the 68.2m preference shares, 7 per cent were taken up. Last month the group announced a rescue package that will dilute shareholders outside the company's core backers who underwrote the issue. Their holdings will now be cut from 57 to 13 per cent. The shares not taken up by qualifying shareholders will be subscribed by Warburg Pincus, Omnicom, Electra Private Equity Partners, SFEC, and SCP Lagoon in accordance with the underwriting arrangements. After the refinancing, Warburg Pincus will increase its holding from 11 per cent to 28 per cent of the fully diluted equity. Electra and Omnicom, the US-based advertising group, become new shareholders with 7 and 13 per cent respectively. SFEC's holding is reduced from 32 to 14 per cent. A further 25 per cent of the ordinary shares will be held by former holders of convertible shares. New share dealings are expected to begin on Monday.</p>

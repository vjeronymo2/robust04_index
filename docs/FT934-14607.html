			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ericsson joins Inmarsat consortium ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications manufacturer, has thrown its weight behind Inmarsat, a 71-nation satellite operator, in the race to create a global mobile telecommunications network. The link has created the biggest potential competitor yet to rival a Dollars 3.4bn scheme proposed by US company Motorola. Both organisations plan to launch a series of telecommunications satellites by the end of the decade which would allow a single portable telephone to be operated anywhere in the world. Mr Kurt Hellstrom, the president of Ericsson Radio Systems, said yesterday that he would work 'with Inmarsat to develop the necessary infrastructure' for the network so that a portable telephone could switch automatically between a cellular network and a satellite link. Ericsson and Motorola are two of the world's biggest companies involved in building cellular telephone networks and handsets. Inmarsat is a co-operative established in 1979 to provide satellite communications for ships. Since then it has moved into new markets for emergency services and the media. Mr Hellstrom said that Ericsson preferred to join forces with Inmarsat over Motorola because of Inmarsat's 'open system' plan which would allow any manufacturer to make telephones for the network. The Inmarsat scheme, called Project 21, faces a struggle to catch up with Motorola's plan, called Iridium. Companies from North and South America, Europe and Asia have already agreed to provide Motorola's consortium with Dollars 100m in cash and promised another Dollars 700m as the first stage in financing Iridium. Normally, Inmarsat would have to turn to its owners, such as Comsat in the US and European telecommunications organisations like BT and France Telecom, to contribute to the capital cost of a network of satellites. But earlier this week, Inmarsat said it would reorganise to become more like the private sector with which it is increasingly competing. It will propose next year that its 71 members be allowed to buy and sell stakes in Inmarsat. Mr Olof Lundberg, director general of Inmarsat said: 'If we are going to join the commercial world, we need a new set of attitudes.' He said that Inmarsat would have to move closer to mass markets and learn about marketing and bring products and services quickly to the market place.</p>

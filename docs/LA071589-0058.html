			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE BUDGET OKD BUT PANEL WANTS B-2 TEST  </P> <P> The Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday approved President Bush's  $305.5-billion defense spending request for fiscal 1990 virtually untouched but  stipulated that no new money can be spent on the controversial B-2 stealth  bomber until it completes its first flight tests.  </P> <P> The committee's bill, which soon will be presented to the full Senate, is a  strong endorsement of the budget submitted to Congress by Defense Secretary  Dick Cheney, who called for an expenditure of $4.8 billion on the stealth  bomber while eliminating a number of other popular weapons, including the  Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey helicopter and the Navy's F-14D jet fighter.  </P> <P> The Senate panel's work also gives considerable impetus to Cheney's request for  full production of the B-2, which recently suffered an $800-million budget cut  in the House Armed Services Committee. Some members of Congress are seeking to  restore to the budget such items as the V-22 and the F-14 at the expense of the  costly B-2 program.  </P> <P> Although the Senate committee trimmed $300 million from the Administration's  request for the B-2, Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said the cut would have no  impact on the Pentagon's plan to purchase 132 of the new bombers. He indicated  that the committee had viewed the $300 million as padding in the  Administration's request.  </P> <P> Moreover, Nunn, whose opinion carries great weight on Capitol Hill, gave the  B-2 program a strong personal endorsement. He said the new bomber is necessary  because the current-generation B-1 bomber cannot penetrate Soviet air defenses,  as some had hoped it would.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sticker Shock'  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Nunn acknowledged that he sympathizes with B-2 opponents who  claim the aircraft is too expensive. "All of us are undergoing some 'sticker  shock' here," he said.  </P> <P> It is now estimated that the B-2 program will cost the government $70 billion  by the time the 132nd one has been purchased, making it cost about $500 million  per aircraft.  </P> <P> Nunn noted that much of the support for the B-2 hinges on the upcoming first  flight test. Northrop Corp. is expected to fly the sophisticated,  boomerang-shaped bomber for the first time within the next week, possibly as  early as today.  </P> <P> "If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over," Nunn joked. "It is far too  expensive to be a stealth taxi."  </P> <P> Although the committee rejected a proposal by Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) -- a  former test pilot and astronaut -- to withhold 1990 funding for the B-2 until  the flight testing has been completed, the panel agreed to a compromise  "fly-before-you-buy" policy proposed by Nunn and the committee's ranking  Republican, Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia.  </P> <P> The panel stated that none of the money contained within the 1990 budget for  the B-2 could be spent until the bomber successfully completes its first flight  tests, until it is certified airworthy by the Defense Science Board and other  top officials and until Northrop has initiated testing of its capabilities for  eluding radar detection.  </P> <P> In addition, no more than 25% of the money can be expended before the secretary  of defense reports on the results of the testing of its ability to elude radar.  And the panel specified that future production costs of the aircraft may not  exceed $295 million per bomber.  </P> <P> The Pentagon already has spent a total of $23 billion on B-2 research and  development.  </P> <P> Nunn acknowledged that B-2 supporters face "some real battles" in Congress  later this year to protect the program against cuts proposed by supporters of  other programs that were eliminated in this budget. "It's going to be very  difficult," he said.  </P> <P> Senate committee members supported Cheney's budget primarily because they were  pleased with his willingness to eliminate some popular procurement programs,  according to Nunn. He said it has been apparent for at least five years that  such "hard choices" were necessary under the current budget restraints, but  neither the Congress nor the Pentagon had been willing to make them.  </P> <P> "I think Secretary Cheney will be delighted with this action here," he said.  </P> <P> Although the committee provided no procurement funds for the V-22, which is  being developed by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters, it did add  $255 million in research and development funds to complete the flight testing  of the craft. Nunn said this was done because the committee believes there is a  commercial market for the combination helicopter-airplane.  </P> <P> The Senate panel also provided $4.5 billion for continued research on the "Star  Wars" space-based missile defense system, or Strategic Defense Initiative, but  that figure could be slashed by as much as $1 billion before the 1990 defense  bill is enacted by Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Star Wars' Cuts  </P> <P> Indeed, the House Armed Services Committee cut SDI funding to $3.8 billion and  the figure is likely to be trimmed even more on the House floor. In the Senate,  Nunn noted that chamber has only narrowly defeated drastic cuts in SDI in the  last several years.  </P> <P> Strong proponents of the program, such as Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), are  fearful that supporters of the V-22, F-14 and other terminated programs will be  trying to fund their programs by cutting SDI as well as the B-2.  </P> <P> The Administration requested $4.8 billion for SDI in fiscal 1990.  </P> <P> The Senate committee's bill also places heavy emphasis on improving ordinary  conventional equipment for American infantry soldiers, such as flashlights and  electronic gear. Nunn said he has often heard from soldiers that their gear is  not as good as the electronic equipment that can be purchased commercially.  </P> <P> As a result, Nunn said, the committee has instructed Pentagon officials to  "occasionally stroll through Radio Shack and see what's available in the  commercial world."  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH MEETS HYPE: Northrop and the Air Force are rallying to promote the  stealth bomber's first flight.

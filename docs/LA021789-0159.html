			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TODAY'S GAMES;  </P> <P> PALOS VERDES OVERSHADOWS REST OF BOYS' 4-A FIELD  </P> <P> Palos Verdes High School is the undisputed Goliath in the sparse field of 4-A  boys' soccer teams that begin Southern Section playoffs today.  </P> <P> Four Orange County entries are among the 15 teams that will be hoping to upset  top-seeded Palos Verdes (29-0).  </P> <P> "They play at an incredible speed," Ocean View Coach Paul Kollar said of Palos  Verdes. "It is lightning fast. They have exceptional athletes. Average athletes  can't keep up with them."  </P> <P> Kollar is happy his team is in the bottom half of the bracket while Palos  Verdes is in the top half. But he is unhappy the Sea Hawks (14-7-4) drew the  tournament's second-seeded team and must make a 2-hour drive. Ocean View, the  third-place team in the Sunset League, plays at Simi Valley (22-3-1).  </P> <P> The Sunset League's second-place team, Marina (15-6-4), is in almost the same  predicament, playing at fourth-seeded Newbury Park (18-3-1) in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "If you look at the pairings, both us and Marina, possibly the southern-most  teams, are playing (teams in) the northern-most league, the Marmonte League,"  Kollar said.  </P> <P> "I don't want it to sound like sour grapes, because we could have drawn Palos  Verdes, and it would have been an hour instead of 2 hours, but you mean to tell  me they couldn't have paired them up a little better?"  </P> <P> Marina can play with the best the bracket has to offer. The Vikings tied  Newbury Park, 0-0, in the South Torrance tournament this season and lost, 1-0,  to second-seeded Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Edison, the Sunset League's top team, gets the home-field advantage in a  first-round match against Rolling Hills (11-6-5), the Bay League's third-place  team.  </P> <P> The good news for Angelus League champion Mater Dei (11-8) is it has a home  match against Claremont (15-5-5). The bad news is a victory would match the  Monarchs against Palos Verdes, assuming Westlake, a wild-card winner Wednesday,  loses to Palos Verdes in the first round.  </P> <P> "Palos Verdes, when we see them, will be 30-0," Mater Dei Coach John O'Neil  said. "If we get past the first two opponents, it's going to be fun."  </P> <P> Servite, the only other county participant in 4-A playoffs, lost its wild-card  game, 3-2, to Upland Wednesday.  </P> <P> Orange County schools are well-represented in the Southern Section 2-A  playoffs. Thirteen of the 29 teams in the main draw, including top-seeded  Brea-Olinda and third-seeded Pacifica, are from the county.  </P> <P> Brea Coach Manny Toledo always fields strong squads. The Wildcats were 2-A  champions in 1986 and finalists in '87. Last season, as a wild-card entry, Brea  advanced to the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> This season's squad might be Toledo's best. Brea (14-3-1) clinched its fifth  Orange League title in six years and went through league play undefeated and  untied for the first time.  </P> <P> "Offensively I have to say this is probably the most explosive team I have had  since I have been at Brea the past eight years," Toledo said.  </P> <P> Though the Wildcats weren't tested in league play (they outscored opponents,  34-6), Toledo said his team played a tough nonleague schedule and is peaking at  the right time.  </P> <P> Brea beat teams by a goal or two in the first round of league play, but in the  second round the Wildcats outscored every opponent by at least three or four  goals, Toledo said.  </P> <P> Brea has a first-round bye and plays the winner of today's game between La  Quinta (10-7-3) and Ganesha (12-7-3).  </P> <P> Brea is led by the Ochs brothers, Jaysn (18 goals) and J.R. (11 goals). Goalie  Jeff Bettencourt has eight shutouts this season, two away from the school  record.  </P> <P> Pacifica (13-1-2) also drew a bye and takes on the winner of the Righetti  (14-8)-Montebello (15-4-2) match. Eight county teams are paired against each  other, so at least six (including Brea and Pacifica) will be in the second  round of 16. Esperanza (12-3-2) has the best record of the rest, followed by  Trabuco Hills (10-2-5) and Anaheim (11-4-3). El Dorado, Kennedy, Los Alamitos,  Valencia, Woodbridge, Katella, Laguna Hills and La Quinta are the other county  entries.  </P> <P> Whittier Christian (15-3-3) is the top-seeded team in the small schools  division, and is the only team in the 31-team draw with a first-round bye. The  Heralds will play the winner of today's match between Webb (3-0-3) and Temecula  Valley (12-9-1).  </P> <P> In the girls' 3-A division, No. 2 Mater Dei (12-4-2) will play host to Trabuco  Hills (10-8-1) today. Mater Dei, an excellent midfield-control and defensive  team, is led by goalkeeper Michelle Lodyga and midfielder Tina Manfre.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Agoura (19-0) has a first-round bye.  </P> <P> Other 3-A matches involving county teams are: Foothill (6-7-2) at No. 3 Moreno  Valley (14-2-1), San Gorgonio (15-4-4) at No. 5 La Habra (12-3-4), Redlands  (14-8-4) at No. 6 Canyon (15-2-3), Fullerton (8-5-6) at No. 7 Orange (10-1-2),  Sunny Hills (9-7-2) at No. 8 Pacifica (10-2-1), Rosary (8-5-2) at No. 9 Troy  (10-2-2), Bishop Montgomery (9-9-2) at La Quinta (12-1-4), Kennedy (10-9-1) at  Woodbridge (11-9-1) and Long Beach Poly (9-5-4) at El Modena (7-7-2).  </P> <P> Times staff writer Barbie Ludovise contributed to this story.  </P></p>

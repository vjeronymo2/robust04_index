			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) was created in 1968 through amendment of Title III of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. Sections 1716  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ). GNMA is a wholly-owned government corporation within the Department of Housing and Urban Development and supports Federal housing initiatives by providing liquidity to the secondary mortgage market and attracting funds from national and international capital markets into the U.S. residential mortgage market. The operations of GNMA are overseen by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and by the President of GNMA, both of whom are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Through its MBS program, GNMA guarantees the timely payment principal and interest on securities issued by private institutions and backed by pools of Federally insured or guaranteed mortgage loans. The GNMA guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Each year, GNMA guaranteed securities provide the financing for approximately 95% of all loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) (Government mortgages). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of July 1994, more than one trillion dollars in securities have been issued assisting an estimated 15 million families to obtain financing. In excess of $440 billion of GNMA guaranteed securities are outstanding, of which more than $429 billion are based on single family (1&hyph;4 unit) residential mortgage loans. The GNMA guarantee lowers the cost of home ownership by attracting the substantial amounts of investor funds necessary to allow low- and moderate-income borrowers to acquire housing with Government mortgages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA's Current Single Class Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the development of single class MBS, investments in residential mortgages were largely illiquid. Beginning in 1970, GNMA pioneered the creation and orderly maintenance of a secondary mortgage market by guaranteeing, with the full faith and credit of the United States, privately issued certificates backed by pools of mortgages provided for the purchase of single family, multifamily, and manufactured housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Holders of GNMA MBS receive monthly payments of principal and interest made on the underlying mortgage loans. The amount of interest ``passed through'' to security holders is reduced by payment of a fee to cover servicing of the mortgages (in the case of single family mortgages, at an annual rate of 44 basis points on the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage) and a fee to GNMA for its guarantee (for single family mortgages, at an annual rate of 6 basis points). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the ``modified pass-through'' approach used by GNMA, the issuer of the MBS is initially responsible for advancing scheduled but delinquent principal and interest payments to security holders. That is, if mortgagors fail to make timely payments of principal and interest, the issuer of the GNMA MBS promises to advance the necessary funds so that scheduled payments can be made to the security holders. If the issuer fails to advance or pass through payments, GNMA pays pursuant to its guarantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MBS guaranteed by GNMA have a single class of ownership interests. Each security bears the same coupon rate of interest, has the same scheduled maturity, and has the same expected weighted average life. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evidence of ownership of GNMA securities takes two forms: physical securities or book entry securities. Beginning in July of 1990, all GNMA MBS, except for serial notes and construction loan securities, were issued in book entry depository form. More than 90 percent of GNMA securities are currently held in book entry form. The Participants Trust Company (PTC) is the depository that holds GNMA securities in book entry form. The PTC collects and disburses principal and interest (P&amp;I) payments to its participants for all deposited MBS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=75 g=1 f=1 --> II. Operating a GNMA Multiclass Securities Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The GNMA Multiclass Securities program will be operated in a manner consistent with the traditional GNMA approach of relying upon the private sector to the greatest extent possible, maintaining GNMA in the position of a guarantor rather than an issuer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> The GNMA REMIC program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The MBS making up the corpus of the trust will be assembled by a knowledgeable and financially sound firm (the Sponsor) that also takes the initiative in forming the trust, in developing the structure for the REMIC Securities (i.e., how many tranches with what characteristics), in preparing the description and disclosure for the offering documents and in marketing the securities. The principal responsibility for initiating and carrying out GNMA REMIC Securities transactions will rest not with GNMA but with the sponsor and with the Trustee of the issuing trust, assisted by trust counsel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

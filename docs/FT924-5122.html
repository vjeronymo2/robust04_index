			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Scandal drains Miyazawa support SCANDAL has taken a heavy toll on Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party with public support for the government falling sharply in recent months to 20 per cent. An opinion poll showed that the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was now as fragile as that of Mr Noboru Takeshita in April 1989, when he had to resign over the Recruit scandal. The sharp rise in disapproval of the government and the party is likely to intensify the instability at the top of the LDP as it prepares for a highly sensitive cabinet reshuffle. The party's leadership has already been destabilised by a power struggle provoked by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. A split in the LDP's largest faction could follow. The public outcry over the long running scandal is likely to intensify next week with mounting pressure on Mr Takeshita. He will be asked to clarify how much he knew about the role of organised crime in 1987 in halting a right-wing campaign against his bid to become prime minister. The opposition parties have called on Mr Takeshita to testify to the parliament's upper house after giving evidence to the lower house on Thursday. That testimony drew a critical public response yesterday. The opposition parties are considering putting a motion calling on Mr Takeshita to resign from parliament. Japan's industrial production in October was 2.6 per cent down on September and 6 per cent down on October last year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said. Inventories of unsold stock, expected to drop as production falls back, rose by 1.4 per cent for the same month, however.</p>

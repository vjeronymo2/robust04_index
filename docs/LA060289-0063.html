			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Australia aboriginal artists tell fantastic stories about the long-ago doings  of beasts and humans. Using the simplest of alphabets -- constellations of tiny  dots, relieved by curved and straight lines -- these "dreamings" are quite  irresistible.  </P> <P> Paintings couch mythic versions of history in minimalist patterns and muted  color that inevitably remind the viewer of contemporary art.  </P> <P> Indeed, although these patterns were painted on the earth for thousands of  years, their rendering in acrylic on canvas dates back only to the early 1970s.  Although the basic units of the patterns are virtually identical, their  deployment varies depending on the story, and each painter has a distinctive  style -- whether of machine-like identical dots or blurred big dots or tiny  flecks.  </P> <P> Also on view are linear bark paintings of creatures whose bodies are ornamented  with patterns reminiscent of weavings; a few small sandstone rocks painted with  the real and imagined beasts of the Australian desert; and wooden statues with  shrunken arms and long thin torsos representing the delicate Mimi spirits, who  venture out only at night. The sampling is generous and the wall-label  annotation, precise, detailed and charmingly presented. (Caz, 8715 Melrose  Ave., to July 29.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

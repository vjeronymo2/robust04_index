			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission Limitation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three alternative numerical emission limitation formats are proposed to provide sources with a maximum degree of operational flexibility in complying with the standards. These emission limitation formats are: a mass percent reduction of VOC in the process unit wastewater stream, an effluent concentration limitation for VOC for individual wastewater streams, or a mass removal requirement for combined wastewater streams. The rationale for providing these alternative emission limitations is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The percent reduction format is based on the VOC removal efficiency of a steam stripper; however, any treatment process that can achieve the proposed efficiency can be used to comply with the standard. (See section IV.G for more discussion.) Percent reduction was chosen because it is the best representation of control technology performance, and it may be applied to any configuration of wastewater streams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effluent concentration limitations are also based on the performance of a steam stripper. Effluent concentration limitations are provided as alternatives to the percent reduction standard to allow compliance flexibility for facilities required to treat process unit wastewater streams. The use of this alternative is limited to facilities that are treating only affected wastewater streams. The effluent concentration limit is not applicable to situations where combinations or mixtures of both affected and unaffected wastewater streams are treated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dilution becomes a concern when more than one waste stream is sent to a single treatment process. For example, diluting a waste with other materials having a volatile organic concentration less than 500 ppmw as a means by which an owner or operator lowers the volatile organic concentration of the waste from an affected stream to a level below 500 ppmw would not comply with the requirements of the proposed standards. A process that simply mixes, blends, combines, or aggregates a waste with other materials does not destroy the VOC in the waste or remove the VOC from the waste. Consequently, when a waste is treated by an organic destruction or removal process, and the waste has been mixed or aggregated together with other wastes or materials with a volatile organic concentration less than 500 ppmw prior to the point of waste treatment, the proposed standards would require that owners or operators meet special requirements to ensure that organics in the waste have actually been removed or destroyed. Under the proposed rules, an owner or operator would be allowed to use a mass reduction requirement to meet the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Required mass removal is an alternative for combined wastewater streams. This provision would require that mixed wastes be treated by an organic destruction or removal process that reduces the volatile organic concentration of the waste to meet a site-specific treatment process mass removal limit. This limit would be determined by the owner or operator on a case-by-case basis using an equation specified in the rules that accounts for the reduction in the volatile organic concentration of the resulting treated waste stream due to dilution. To use this equation, the owner or operator would first determine the volatile organic concentration at the point of waste entry for each individual waste stream that is mixed together prior to entering the treatment process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equipment Design and Operation Format.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another regulatory format proposed for process unit wastewater stream treatment is an equipment design and operational format. The equipment standard consists of the installation of a steam stripper designed and operated at specified parametric levels. The specifications for the steam stripper were developed to provide a standard piece of equipment (with associated operating conditions) that can achieve either the mass percent VOC removal or the effluent concentration of VOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This equipment design and operational format was included to provide an alternative means of compliance that all sources would be able to use, while achieving the desired emission reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equipment and Work Practice Format.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A final equivalent standard proposed for controlling process unit wastewater emissions is an equipment and work practice standard. This format is based on the recycling of process unit wastewater in a closed collection system to the process. When recycling is used, process unit wastewater emissions are controlled with equipment emissions, and the process unit wastewater is reused. This format is proposed to encourage chemical recovery and waste minimization and pollution prevention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Vent Collection and Vapor Recovery or Destruction Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An emission standard and two equipment and design standards are proposed for VOC that are routed to vapor recovery or destruction devices used to control VOC from vent collection sources. The proposed emission standard includes two alternatives: a weight percent reduction and an outlet concentration. A mass emission limit was not appropriate for these emission points because variation within the industry, including capacity and processes, greatly affects emission rates, and data were not available to determine the mass limits that would address this variation. In general, a weight percent reduction format will ensure that BDT is applied and the required emission reductions are realized. However, combustion technology that is equivalent to BDT cannot be demonstrated to achieve the selected percent reduction for streams with low VOC concentrations. Therefore, an alternative concentration limit that is achievable has been included. The combination of the weight percent reduction or concentration limit will ensure that the best technology is applied to all SOCMI process emission points, whether they have higher or lower concentrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal investigators have asked the Navy to retrieve a cargo door that tore  off a United Airlines Boeing 747 jet over the Pacific nearly four months ago,  sending nine passengers to their deaths. The door is believed to be resting on  the ocean floor more than three miles under water and about 85 miles southwest  of Honolulu. United and Boeing would share in the cost. A National  Transportation Safety Board spokesman said the Navy was asked to search for the  door, but the Navy said it has not received a formal request. NTSB  investigators have said retrieving the door would help determine what caused it  to pop open at an altitude of 22,000 feet on Feb. 24.  </P></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: GRE expands with Pounds 19m US motor insurance buy Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurance group, is to increase its presence in the US motor insurance market through the acquisition of The National Corporation of Indianapolis. Guardian, which recently announced an ambitious expansion in the UK direct motor market, is paying a total of Pounds 19m - made up of an initial Pounds 13m and two further contributions of Pounds 3m. The purchase will be funded from its existing resources. National and nine associated agencies introduce and manage the business of the The National Insurance Association, a so-called 'reciprocal insurance exchange', similar in some ways to a mutual. It specialises in non-standard motor insurance so the acquisition will strengthen Guardian's position in this area of the US market. Two of the group's existing subsidiaries - Globe American and American Ambassador, bought in December last year, are both specialists in this business. As a result of the acquisition the total number of states in which Guardian operates in the non-standard market will increase from 10 to 17. 'The synergy between the National group and our existing operations should bring powerful benefits to many parts of the business,' said Mr Jim McDonough, international director. National underwrites non-standard motor business in 13 states. Its gross premium income in 1993 amounted to Pounds 35m, making an underwriting profit of Pounds 2.4m and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.6m. It has produced an underwriting profit in each of the last three years.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Changes for SE Asian Warrant Fund South East Asian Warrant Fund, an investment company, is proposing to turn itself into an open-ended fund with monthly redemptions. According to Olliff &amp; Partners, the brokers, the fund has gross assets of about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) and is trading at a discount of approximately 10.5 per cent. The fund had originally planned a share buy-back scheme to eliminate the discount but this was opposed by a large stakeholder, Regent Fund Management. The new proposals will be considered at extraordinary meetings to be held before the end of October.</p>

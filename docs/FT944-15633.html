			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Euronews seeks new investors The four big public television shareholders in Euronews - Europe's attempted answer to CNN of America - yesterday pledged to fund the satellite news station for the next two years and to bring in private capital. The French, Italian, Spanish and Swiss public television companies, which together own about half of Euronews, promised to provide 'the necessary funding' for the station to continue in 1995-96. Euronews has so far piled up losses of FFr150m (Pounds 18m) in its first two years of transmitting identical pictures in five different languages for 20 hours a day, despite a FFr20m a year subsidy from the European parliament. Its main problem is that despite a claimed audience in the tens of millions, through cable, satellite and terrestial re-broadcast, it has failed to pull in much advertising.</p>

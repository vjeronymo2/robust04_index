Speaking to Gansu deputies attending the ongoing session of  the National People's Congress, Hu called on local officials and  people to further emancipate their minds and seize development  opportunities.    Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of  the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, also said that it  is necessary to proceed from specific conditions in Gansu, and  promote local economic growth through reforms.    "We must attach great importance to agriculture as the  foundation of the national economy, and improve basic farming  conditions," he told the deputies examining the government work  report delivered by Premier Li Peng.    Hu said that it is imperative to readjust the rural economic  structure and develop highly efficient farming that offers  greater and better yields.    He also called for efforts to expand township-run  enterprises  in rural areas and increase farmers' income.    "We must also further invigorate state-owned large and  medium- sized enterprises and continue to enable them to play a  leading role in the national economy," said Hu, who worked in  Gansu for 14 years.    Moreover, it is necessary to promote a social atmosphere of  respecting knowledge and professionals, further enhance unity  among people of various nationalities and maintain social  stability, he said.    Hu Jintao expressed the belief that so long as relations  between reform, development and stability are handled properly,  all kinds of work will be done better this year.    He also stressed the need to perfect the national people's  congress system in the course of promoting socialist democracy.</p>

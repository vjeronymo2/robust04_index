			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CANADA HURDLER'S DRUG BUYS TOLD  </P> <P> Julie Rocheleau-Baumann, Canada's top female hurdler, purchased banned steroids  and human growth hormone from a Quebec bodybuilder and admitted drug supplier,  a federal drug inquiry into amateur athletics was told today.  </P> <P> Benoit Levesque, 29, testified under oath that Rocheleau-Baumann approached him  last June seeking the drugs, which are used to help athletes build muscle.  </P> <P> "She thought it was the best way for her of competing without any substances  being detected on her," said Levesque, who has won numerous Canadian  bodybuilding titles.  </P> <P> Rocheleau-Baumann, 25, now living in Switzerland, has refused to appear before  the Canadian inquiry sparked by the Ben Johnson scandal and denies using drugs.  She finished sixth in the 100 meters at Seoul but recently failed a random drug  test instituted by the Canadian Track and Field Assn.  </P></p>

Addressing a Ramadhan fast-breaking dinner for journalists, Ms.  Benazir Bhutto said that the support to the cause of Kashmiris  is included in the 1947 principles of our independence, and we  are continuing the support to Muslims of Bosnia, Afghanistan,  and Palestine under the same spirit.    The prime minister said that for us, the Kashmir cause is a  part of our faith in God, and we have made intensive efforts and  taken practical steps in this regard; and instead of remaining  silent as in the past decade, we have fully highlighted the  Kashmir issue. The prime minister said that one of our goals is  to do away with Pakistan's international isolation. She said  that Pakistan was on the verge of being declared a terrorist  state during the past regime.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that her government has decided to  present the Jammu and Kashmir issue in its correct perspective.  Pakistan values freedom, for which the Muslims of the  subcontinent launched a struggle under our great leader Jinnah.  She said that her government's political will and determination  have helped in taking the Kashmir issue from one capital to the  other and from one city to the other, thereby apprising the  world leaders of the miserable condition in Kashmir. She said  that the opposition should have cooperated with us in this  regard, but it disappointed us.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that she visited Cyprus within a few  hours after assuming the office to apprise the Commonwealth  leaders of Indian atrocities in Kashmir. Eventually, the  government decided to present the issue before the the UN Human  Rights Commission in Geneva. This is the first time since the  1950's that this has happened.    Referring to internal issues, the prime minister said that  she has directed the authorities to ensure fiscal discipline to  contain the budgetary deficit that presently stands at about 60  billion rupees. The federal and provincial governments will  have to cut their nondevelopmental expenditures at all levels.</p>

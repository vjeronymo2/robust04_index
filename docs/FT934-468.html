			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / How Aladdin helped build a castle - but lost out when it had to be reconstructed: Barry Riley enters the Cave of Gatt and a gripping story unfolds - but will it end happily ever after? Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, where the wind is bitterly cold and the rain often lashes down from a grey and sullen sky, a Magic Kingdom once grew out of the damp farmland. Its fairy castle turrets rose towards the sky and its walls resounded to the sounds of happy crowds and fireworks. But the magic faded and the Kingdom lost its power, and the allegiance of its millions of subjects waned. This is the story of its rise and fall. There were moguls from the west, from the Holy Wooden Empire of the Clintonians. One was a man called Eisnar, rich and powerful, his wealth expanded by his almost unlimited options. He was already a Grand Vizier in his native land but he vowed to conquer other parts of the earth where his market share was low compared with the local entertainment product. So he came east and journeyed in search of the treasures which he believed were hidden there, in particular in the Christmas video market. In the course of his travels he seized literary gems, especially those in which there was no longer any copyright, such as Beauty and the Beast and Jungle Book, and turned them into animated wonders which all the world flocked to see. But still he did not rest content, because there was resistance to his ambitions and a bigger share of the multimedia leisure spending market could still be gained. So the cunning Eisnar drew up a scheme for a new Magic Kingdom and printed it in a special prospectus and on the cover he painted a picture of a pink castle. And he pinned it up on walls and inserted it into local newspapers and waited for local gamblers and traders. Sure enough, he did not have long to wait before Aladdin, a local merchant and investor, came looking for Eisnar. 'I find your scheme very attractive,' he cried. 'Before long it will be paying out great dividends. Please let me invest.' (In real life, of course, people do not subscribe to prospectuses with pink castles on the front, but remember, this is a fairy story.) Thus an elaborate contract was drawn up and partnerships in the scheme were granted to Aladdin and many of his friends. And Eisnar raised his hands and issued the command for the Magic Kingdom called EuroDisney Resort to be created out of an empty landscape. Such was his power that it was done. But soon the mighty Eisnar began to become angry. The returns were slipping below budget. The local people began to become restless under his rule and to protest about his 'cultural imperialism' as they called it. He needed to increase his power. But only Aladdin could help him to achieve this. Therefore he promised the greedy Aladdin that he would increase his dividends, but only if he helped him in a special mission. They journeyed out into the wilderness and came to a spot at Geneva, where the mountain lake feeds a mighty river between many high banks. 'This is the entrance to the Cave of Gatt,' Eisnar announced. 'I cannot enter, but you can. Do not be afraid. The Cave extends almost for ever, some say as far round as Uruguay, but you do not need to go far. Just inside the entrance you will find the Magic Lamp. I need it for my audiovisual industry. Bring it to me as quickly as you can. Beware of this, however: you must ignore the other riches within and must return by December 15.' At this, his voice became harsh and frightening. 'If you do not succeed the Cave of Gatt will crumble and you will be trapped for all eternity behind the high tariff walls. For so the emperor of the Clintonites has decreed.' Fearfully, Aladdin entered the cave, which to his ears seemed to be filled with the sound of endless talking. But immediately he gasped in wonder. All around were the great treasures of the world, spices from the East Indies, rice from Thailand, textiles from China, computers from Taiwan, jumbo jets from Seattle. Then he saw the entertainment section, with piles of Michael Jackson CDs and heaps of videos such as Rambo 2 and Child's Play 3. In the middle lay what must be the Magic Lamp, battered and dusty, and surely worthless. Then he made a grave mistake. Tempted by the treasures all around, he picked up a Peter Pan video. At once the ground began to shake violently beneath his feet, and he heard the angry voice of Eisnar bellowing from the entrance to the cave. 'You foolish knave, you have disobeyed my instructions and you have infringed my intellectual property rights. You shall pay the ultimate penalty. You shall be consumed by a trade war.' Desperately Aladdin looked around. Surely he could not get out by December 15 now. He picked up the Magic Lamp and looked at the primitive object to see why it might be so valuable. Was it broken? He rubbed the side to see if it might be made of gold. The result was amazing. There was a sudden blue flash, a clap of thunder, and a hazy figure appeared. 'I am Sir Leon, genie of the Magic Lamp,' the apparition pronounced. 'Your every directive is my command, or at least, will be the basis for meaningful negotiations at the highest level.' Aladdin looked around in panic at the crumbling Cave of Gatt. It might fall in at any moment. 'Can you get me out of this mess?' he cried. 'No problem]' answered the genie. 'It may take all night, but I can fudge an answer somehow] And then I can appear on BBC breakfast TV at the peak audience time]' And so the Cave of Gatt did not, after all, collapse but was propped up. Aladdin returned home and life continued much as before, but he realised that somewhere Eisnar was still at large, and in his anger and frustration might be seeking revenge, especially as the newspapers said that EuroDisneyland was threatened with closure. Several months passed, and then one afternoon he heard a strange sound outside his house. Looking through the window he saw a stooped old pedlar with long white hair hobbling along the road, carrying a bundle of papers. In a quavering but penetrating voice the old man called out repeatedly: 'New shares for old] New shares for old]' Other people were approaching him, offering shares in companies such as Fisons, Tiphook and Queens Moat Houses, yet he turned them away. But then Aladdin came up with his EuroDisney certificates. Suddenly the old pedlar seized them, crying: 'Excellent sir, you are the investor I have been searching for. Your shares are worthless, without hope of dividends, but why not take these perpetual zero coupon loan certificates instead?' They sounded good, Aladdin admitted, but why was there a picture of a small furry animal in the corner? 'It is logical,' replied the old man, who seemed to become younger by the minute. 'When you have Mickey Mouse securities it is wise to recognise the fact.' And so Eisnar - for indeed it was he in disguise - went away in triumph because he no longer needed Aladdin, and he began to work his spell on the Magic Kingdom. The capital was restructured, some new magic carpet rides were built and the marketing was sharpened up. New auditors were hired, to replace the over-fussy previous firm. A new tunnel to the north was opened, encouraging Anglo-Saxon hordes to visit at special cut prices, with a special opportunity to purchase duty-free drinks. Aladdin was upset, because he believed he had been deceived. But he remembered the old Magic Lamp, which was still in his possession, and he rubbed it vigorously. Again Sir Leon the genie appeared in a puff of smoke. 'Your wish is my directive, subject of course to satisfactory harmonisation procedures and the required legislative implementation by all member states,' he said. 'You must stop Eisnar,' cried Aladdin. He has restored the power of the Magic Kingdom and may achieve total cultural domination.' 'Don't worry about a thing,' replied Sir Leon. 'It should be easy. With a wave of my regulation book I shall require full compliance with the Third Theme Park Directive, including sub-section 13(c). Furthermore, all Mickey Mouse impersonators must be paid a minimum wage of Ecu1,000 an hour. Lastly, all food prepared at the site, including ice cream, must contain 10 per cent garlic from the garlic mountain. That should fix it.' Thus was Eisnar repelled, and the clouds gathered and the rain fell and a great forest grew around the Magic Kingdom and hid it, until even the highest turrets of the castle had vanished. But sadly Aladdin and his friends did not live happily ever afterwards. The moguls of the Holy Wooden Empire developed a new scheme. They created monsters called Tyrannosaurus and Stegosaurus which roamed the land, crushing and consuming local opposition and creating a famine in the box offices. But that will be another story, the one they shall call Jurassic Park 2.</p>

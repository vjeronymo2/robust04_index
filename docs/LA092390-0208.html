			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN'S DELIBERATIVE STYLE TEMPERS DECISIONS  </P> <P> The environmental movement swelled larger by the hour this spring as Earth Day  approached. Politicians, scrambling for support, lined up behind the so-called  "Big Green" initiative, closely identified with Democrat John K. Van de Kamp.  </P> <P> Dianne Feinstein, Van de Kamp's opponent in the primary, found herself in a  tight spot. On the subject of the state's most sweeping environmental  initiative, where was Feinstein? Day after day came the same, standard answer:  She was studying the issue.  </P> <P> Not until Earth Day dawned did she announce her support for the November ballot  measure, which she now embraces as if it had been hers from the beginning. She  routinely uses it as a weapon against her Republican opponent in the governor's  race, Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> Feinstein's advisers find the turn of events an illustration of the candidate's  decision-making and of the impact of the eclectic set of advisers she relies on  in her quest to become governor.  </P> <P> The hallmarks, they say, are her near-obsession with detail, with finding  answers to searching questions about the issue at hand, even if that means  appearing to publicly dawdle. After the deliberative process is finally  concluded, the result is set loose with all the dramatic flair she can command.  </P> <P> Despite Feinstein's oft-spoken desire to act as a mediator to solve  California's pressing problems and the image she tries to project as someone  who can unify this disparate state, she and her advisers say her process of  decision-making can be an intellectual brawl. Her style is more a reflection of  the no-holds-barred world of San Francisco politics in which she matured than a  mirror of the calm, elegant candidate voters see on their television screens.  </P> <P> Feinstein says she likes nothing better than getting together a group of  advisers, preferably strong-minded ones, and hammering out a solution to the  crisis at hand.  </P> <P> "Asking questions and getting a response -- and arguing the response -- is the  way I think best," Feinstein said in an interview.  </P> <P> "You can get rid of doubts. You can take thoughts, expose them to the light of  scrutiny, have people feel free to come back at you. There's no way, no matter  how much you think you know about something, that you can know all of the  angles."  </P> <P> But she alone decides. "Decision-making is basically lonely," she said. "You  make the decision -- because you've got to stand by the decision."  </P> <P> Not everyone views that as an advantage. John Barbagelata, a conservative  Republican and a foe of Feinstein since 1969 when they both successfully ran  for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, criticizes her as unwilling to  entertain options other than the one that would benefit her.  </P> <P> "She's very headstrong. She runs the show. I don't think anyone can tell her  anything," said Barbagelata, who left office in 1978. He recalled asking  Feinstein to put on the ballot a multimillion-dollar sewer system improvement  that she supported. Feinstein, he said, refused.  </P> <P> "She will not go to the voters with issues," he said, attributing that decision  to a reluctance to listen to others.  </P> <P> The deliberateness that Feinstein and her allies say is at the core of her  decision-making is shared by her opponent Wilson. In both cases, it may be  borne of their municipal beginnings: Each governed a city with the political  imperatives of coalition and consensus.  </P> <P> Feinstein, as San Francisco mayor and as candidate for governor, relies on a  core of regular advisers that is supplemented issue by issue with experts whose  relationship with her can go back decades or weeks. Apart from family members,  there is no stereotyping Feinstein's advisers. They are young and old, male and  female and they represent different races.  </P> <P> Among the regular advisers, there are essentially two overlapping spheres of  influence -- one made up of loyal holdovers from her decade at the helm of San  Francisco, the other of political professionals assembled for this campaign.  </P> <P> The symbol of San Francisco's influence is Hadley Roff, Feinstein's campaign  chief of staff, who met the candidate at Stanford University more than three  decades ago. Their political alliance began when Feinstein, in mid-1979, asked  Roff to become one of two deputy mayors.  </P> <P> Her other deputy mayor, Rudy Nothenberg, also remains a Feinstein adviser. Now  San Francisco's chief administrative officer, Nothenberg advises primarily on  fiscal issues. Among others from San Francisco is Feinstein's adviser on her  pet issue of growth management, Michael McGill, who served briefly in her  Administration and has informally worked with Feinstein for years.  </P> <P> Longtime family friend Henry Berman, the campaign's treasurer, and Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) routinely advise Feinstein, as does Rev.  Cecil Williams, who runs Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San  Francisco's Tenderloin area. Nancy Pelosi, formerly Feinstein's neighbor and  currently the Democratic congresswoman from San Francisco, is another informal  adviser.  </P> <P> In the heat of the campaign, Feinstein relies strongly on the relatively new  group assembled for the race -- Bill Carrick, the campaign director; his  partner and media consultant, Hank Morris; press secretary Dee Dee Myers;  political director Percy Pinkney and issues director Vicky Rideout.  </P> <P> For her supplemental core of advisers, Feinstein has borrowed liberally from  the ranks of Democratic legislative experts. Steve Thompson, head of the  Assembly Office of Research and a close ally of Speaker Brown, was Feinstein's  chief issues adviser during the primary campaign.  </P> <P> Rick Battson, an aide to Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), helps on  water policy, and Lucien Wulsin, an aide to Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los  Angeles) advises on health issues. Barry Groveman, a former Los Angeles deputy  district attorney and a co-author of Proposition 65, the 1986 anti-toxics  initiative, is Feinstein's prime environmental adviser.  </P> <P> Her advisers do not speak with one voice. Williams and Pelosi, for example,  disagree with Feinstein on the major issue of capital punishment, which she  favors and they oppose. Aides suggest that trustworthiness, rather than  ideological point of view, is most important to Feinstein.  </P> <P> "She disdains sycophants," said Roff, her chief of staff, who said she prefers  "people who know their own mind."  </P> <P> Feinstein says she has never had a formalized "kitchen cabinet," a group of  ambitious peers such as accompanied a former California governor, Ronald  Reagan, from Sacramento to Washington.  </P> <P> "It just never worked for me," she said.  </P> <P> Campaign director Carrick, for one, attributes the absence of such a group to  Feinstein's gender. When she initially ran for a seat on the San Francisco  Board of Supervisors, Feinstein was swimming against the prevailing political  tide, Carrick said. Influential politicians tried to talk her out of her plans  on the grounds that there already was a woman on the board. She ran anyway and  won more votes than any other candidate. Later, she ran unsuccessfully for  mayor before assuming the office after the shooting death of Mayor George  Moscone.  </P> <P> "(Her) whole history is a different sort of history than people who plot their  political career by the hour," Carrick said.  </P> <P> The closest Feinstein comes to having a kitchen cabinet is the support she  receives from her family. Her father and uncle, Leon and Morrie Goldman, were  her first political influences. Her husband, Richard C. Blum, now serves as  what Feinstein calls a "general" in the expensive effort to get her elected.  </P> <P> Wilson's campaign, and Van de Kamp's before it, have tried to portray Blum as a  mysterious marionette who controls Feinstein's views and moves. Blum and other  advisers say that is not the case.  </P> <P> "She and I are sort of like any other couple," said Blum, who married Feinstein  in 1980. "I give her my advice and sometimes she listens and sometimes she  doesn't. It's sort of a normal, healthy marriage. We're like other human  beings. We don't see eye to eye."  </P> <P> Blum says, and others agree, that he and Feinstein think alike on most issues.  In their differences -- which he will not discuss openly -- Blum is said to  lean toward more progressive positions than Feinstein naturally takes.  </P> <P> Other Feinstein advisers believe that Blum has been influential in bringing in  experts to help Feinstein, among them a host of volunteer financial advisers  who helped the city cope with the drastic effects of Proposition 13.  </P> <P> No one suggests that Blum carries the day with any regularity.  </P> <P> "Dick Blum gives his opinion, but he does not by any means win the battle all  the time," said Williams, a friend of the couple as well as an adviser. "I've  heard him say, 'That's all I can say. Dianne's made up her mind.' He knows and  all of us know that when she makes up her mind, she's determined."  </P> <P> The other family member of influence is Feinstein's only child, Katherine, 33,  a labor lawyer whose presence on the campaign trail is more regular than  Blum's. Aides say she has not only provided a source of companionship during  campaign trips but also has been instrumental in crafting Feinstein's  criminal-justice platform.  </P> <P> Family or outsider, all Feinstein advisers say they are confronted regularly by  her immense appetite for details. In an interview, Feinstein spoke with pride  about Monday meetings she held with department heads while mayor of San  Francisco. There, she said, she could quiz the police chief at length about  crime statistics, down to particular types of crimes in particular  neighborhoods, and press for detailed solutions.  </P> <P> The emphasis on details is notable because Feinstein, particularly during the  primary, was criticized for being vague. Aides lay the blame on a related  Feinstein attribute -- a reluctance to address issues unless she feels she has  a command of the particulars. In the primary, when she was attacking subjects  that she had not mastered as the mayor of a contained, urban city, Feinstein  was on the defensive, advisers say.  </P> <P> "Dianne doesn't like to wing anything," said her husband, Blum. "She would just  rather not talk about a subject if she's not prepared for it. . . . There were  a bunch of issues eight or nine months ago -- where she hadn't formed her own  policy -- that a mayor doesn't work on."  </P> <P> In a political season, candidates daily are called to answer on specific  policies. Feinstein's reluctance to take a position was most obvious before  Earth Day last April. Although she ultimately did come out in favor of "Big  Green," Feinstein took political hits almost daily during the period she was  studying the matter.  </P> <P> That and other incidents during the primary helped foster an image of Feinstein  as either unwilling to commit herself or unfamiliar with issues -- troublesome  political negatives that her own campaign director acknowledges were rooted in  Feinstein's approach.  </P> <P> "She wanted her questions answered about her concerns about what it would do or  what it wouldn't do, whether it was realistic, whether it was pragmatic," said  Carrick. "She asked a lot of questions about its impact on the agricultural  industry -- whereas the easy political thing to do would have been to write  that off and move on."  </P> <P> "Deliberateness and campaigns don't generally have a lot of compatibility, "  Carrick added. "So, sure, it's a frustration, and it gets us into trouble from  time to time."  </P> <P> Aides say that once Feinstein is comfortable with details of a particular  issue, her confidence rises and she can command an almost instant recall.  </P> <P> McGill, an aide to Feinstein while she was mayor, described a virtual  transformation he said took place when Feinstein approached a problem in San  Francisco. Regularly, he said, she would alert staff members to an event that  was about three weeks away and would give them an initial reading of her  thinking. The staff would set to work fleshing out ideas.  </P> <P> "The first week, she'd be a little snappish and say, 'I can't spend much time  on that' (because of more pressing business)," said McGill, now Feinstein's  adviser on growth issues.  </P> <P> "The second week, she had already absorbed things we thought she was not  listening to. As the event approached, she would start absorbing with amazing  speed.  </P> <P> "At the end of three weeks, she would stand there and give a recitation like  she had been an expert on the issue for a year."  </P> <P> During the campaign, Feinstein reads voraciously from issue books compiled by  her staff. In the books are memos by the candidate and her advisers that show  her evolving thoughts and her staff's assessment of the options.  </P> <P> Tellingly, during an interview about her advisers, Feinstein took pains to  praise two of them, though neither for intellectual prowess nor political  savvy. One was praised for an ability to write concise and understandable  memos, the other for perfecting a style of memo-writing that Feinstein found  particularly appealing.  </P> <P> Feinstein and her advisers tried to build in the sort of deliberate preparation  that does not come naturally in a campaign. McGill's efforts on growth  management, for example, began with a call from Feinstein last fall. The first  draft of a plan was delivered in January, with successive drafts crafted in the  following months. The plan has yet to be publicly announced, but Feinstein has  written letters to environmental leaders offering some details.  </P> <P> About the same time she sought out McGill, Feinstein also asked Los Angeles  attorney Barry Groveman to handle environmental issues. After a few meetings,  he forwarded an outline, parts of which have been released publicly in various  forums. Behind the scenes, Feinstein has also courted environmentalists in  private get-acquainted sessions.  </P> <P> Aides and Feinstein say that not all of Feinstein's grasp of issues comes from  memos. In San Francisco, she commonly trekked into the city streets to get a  handle on visible problems, from drug use to potholes.  </P> <P> Williams, who has accompanied Feinstein on countless visits to the poor and  homeless in San Francisco, predicts that she will lean on aides to provide the  same hands-on experience across the state if she is elected governor.  </P> <P> "Even with the experts (to advise her), she's still going to put her feet on  the street," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FEINSTEIN'S TOP AIDES  </P> <P>  Dianne Feinstein's campaign team is reflective of the larger group of advisers  she depends on: They are a mix of newcomers and longtime loyalists, men and  women, Anglos and minorities. Of the senior staff, one has known Feinstein  since their days together at Stanford University more than 30 years ago;  another jumped aboard the campaign just this summer. Here are the senior staff  members:  </P> <P> BILL CARRICK, 40, an Aiken, S.C., native whose accent betrays his roots, is the  director of the Democratic effort, having taken over with his partner Hank  Morris after Feinstein's original campaign manager, Clint Reilly, quit in a  well-publicized huff. Carrick is well-versed in Democratic heavyweights -- he  formerly served as political director for Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.  He also was national campaign director of Rep. Richard A. Gephardt's  unsuccessful run for the presidency in 1988.  </P> <P> HANK MORRIS, 37, carries the title of media strategist and consultant, and as  such has been credited with the single defining item of Feinstein's campaign  thus far, the gripping television commercial that vaulted her past Atty. Gen.  John K. Van de Kamp to victory in the primary. Morris joined the campaign with  Carrick in November, 1989, and still operates largely out of his New York  office. He previously has worked for former governors Hugh Carey of New York  and John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV of West Virginia.  </P> <P> HADLEY ROFF, 58, comes as close as anyone outside of Feinstein's family to  being a longtime confidante of the former San Francisco mayor. They met at  Stanford University, and Roff was working at City Hall when Feinstein first  gained a seat on the Board of Supervisors. In July, 1979, seven months after  she became mayor, Feinstein picked Roff as one of two deputy mayors, a position  he continued to hold after she left office in 1988. He began working for  Feinstein again in February, 1989, when her candidacy for governor had been  largely dismissed. He serves as chief of staff, working in the campaign's San  Francisco headquarters.  </P> <P> DEE DEE MYERS, 29, is a holdover from the original Feinstein campaign  organization. She joined as press secretary in May, 1989, before original  campaign director Reilly quit. At Feinstein's side at almost every appearance  she makes, and Feinstein's most constant defender to reporters, Myers is  somewhat of a campaign junkie. She served as press secretary for Los Angeles  Mayor Tom Bradley and worked on his 1986 gubernatorial campaign. She also  worked as California press secretary for 1988 Democratic nominee Michael S.  Dukakis and in Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential race.  </P> <P> DUANE GARRETT, 43, is a San Francisco lawyer who signed up along with Roff in  February, 1989, and serves as the campaign chairman, the titular head. Leaving  most of the strategic workings to Carrick and Morris, Garrett most recently has  concentrated on the most pressing concern of the Feinstein campaign, raising  enough money to combat Sen. Pete Wilson. Garrett served in the same role for  Bradley's 1982 run for governor. In 1984, he was the national co-chairman of  the Democratic presidential effort of former Vice President Mondale, and held a  similar post four years later for former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt.  </P> <P> JOHN PLAXCO, 39, is concentrating this political season on raising the mother's  milk of campaigns -- money. The Louisiana native works with Garrett and  Feinstein's husband, Richard C. Blum, in raising the millions of dollars she  will need to have a chance against the well-financed Wilson effort. Plaxco,  rarely present at public events, has been for a year the campaign's state  finance director, a job he held in the campaign of state Controller Gray Davis.  In the last election cycle, that of 1988, Plaxco was the California campaign  manager for the presidential bid of Illinois Sen. Paul Simon.  </P> <P> VICKY RIDEOUT, 33, has accomplished the move that bystanders can find  mystifying and that political veterans learn to expect. Three months ago, she  was deputy campaign manager for Democratic candidate Van de Kamp, issuing  blistering reports on alleged failings of Feinstein. With his campaign over in  June, she came aboard the Feinstein effort the next month as issues director.  She has earned praise from the candidate and other advisers for concise and  understandable memorandums on various issues debated during the campaign.  Rideout previously served as senior domestic political adviser for the 1988  Dukakis campaign.  </P> <P> PERCY PINKNEY, 48, began working for Feinstein last January as political  director, a job in which he links Feinstein with various political entities  across the state. Previously, he did the same job for Los Angeles City  Councilman Robert Farrell in his bid for the Assembly, and for Edmund G.  (Jerry) Brown Jr. when he ran for governor. Pinkney rides somewhat of a thin  line these days: Feinstein has spent much time disdaining organized political  groups, yet finds herself now needing any organized help she can get.  </P></p>

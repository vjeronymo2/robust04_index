			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Brian's bait tempts some fishy clients - Common Markets A CONUNDRUM faces every interested British cook. Why is it so difficult to obtain the fresh fish our island waters so bountifully supply? Over the past 50 years, 7,000 traditional wet fishmongers have disappeared from the country's high streets and the supermarkets have failed to rise to the challenge. But this has allowed the rise of the travelling fish market. Today there are 1,200-1,500 small refrigerated vans on Britain's road uniting suppliers - fishermen and fish merchants based in Newlyn, Brixham or along the east coast - with their customers either at home or in staff canteens. There are 200 vans carrying fish out of Grimsby alone to Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol, Liverpool and London. One is driven by Gary Simons, 32, whose father, Brian, started the business in the late 1970s when the building trade went into one of its periodic declines. He now sells 40,000 stone of fish a year around the country. Fish which he buys in Grimsby on a Monday - his salmon comes from Scotland, smoked trout from Gloucestershire - is packed under ice for his 3.15am start on Tuesday. After a short sleep he is with his first customer in Bedfordshire at 7am and then it is on to Mill Hill, North Wembley and Harrow. He stays in digs overnight and has a rendezvous arranged with a Grimsby fish merchant to top up his stock. When I met him there had been a run on salmon courtesy of a Delia Smith recipe on the television the night before. On Wednesday it is St John's Wood, Regent's Park and Harley Street. On Thursdays he leaves central London via customers in Brondesbury Park, Finchley and Barnet and returns to Grimsby at about 6pm utterly exhausted. Friday is spent, more mundanely, doing the books and scrubbing down the van. I sat in the van and watched Simons in action. Dressed in a white coat, nipping in and out ringing a number of doorbells simultaneously to see whether his customers were in and, if they were, what they wanted, he looked just like a fleet-footed milkman - except that he was delivering brill, dover and lemon soles, halibut, herring fillets, smoked salmon and kippers. Brian's Fresh Grimsby Fish, 28 Stallingborough Road, Healing, Grimsby, South Humberside DN37 7QL. Tel: 0472-887557, mobile 0860-844508.</p>

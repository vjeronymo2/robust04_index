			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> LA PLACITA'S BELOVED FORMER PASTOR LUIS OLIVARES AFFLICTED BY AIDS  </P> <P> A few days after he was found to have AIDS, and still weak from a serious bout  with meningitis, Father Luis Olivares got up out of his hospital bed to keep a  date with his parishioners at historic Our Lady Queen of Angels Church.  </P> <P> It was to be his last Mass at La Placita, as the church is known to  parishioners -- his despedida, or going away celebration. After nine years as  pastor of the landmark downtown church, Olivares was to be transferred to  another parish. The parishioners were aware that he had been ill but did not  know of the AIDS.  </P> <P> Olivares celebrated Mass from his wheelchair and gave a stirring homily. "The  feeling between him and the people there was unbelievable," his former  associate pastor, Father Mike Kennedy, said. "There wasn't a dry eye in the  house."  </P> <P> Olivares, who has crusaded tirelessly on behalf of his flock -- declaring La  Placita a sanctuary for Central American refugees and for undocumented  immigrants -- is now facing the toughest personal battle of his life.  </P> <P> Friends and sympathizers began rallying to his support while he was still at  the hospital recovering from meningitis last month. In the course of treating  him for the bacterial infection that attacks the brain and spinal cord, doctors  discovered that he had the AIDS virus. Doctors said they believed that he  contracted the disease from contaminated needles while undergoing treatment for  other ailments in his travels in Central America.  </P> <P> Olivares made the nature of his illness public soon after the Sunday Mass at La  Placita. He did it, he said, to "let people know that anybody can get this  disease and not to abandon those who happen to get it, regardless of how they  contracted it."  </P> <P> Flowers, posters and other expressions of support from his many friends in the  community crowded his hospital room last month. A stream of visitors included  union leader Cesar Chavez, actor Martin Sheen and Los Angeles Archbishop Roger  M. Mahony. Later, in a statement, Mahony voiced sadness about Olivares' illness  and admiration for his work.  </P> <P> "Father Olivares has served the poorest of the poor here in Los Angeles with  great commitment and courage, and he has aroused the conscience of us all as we  try to understand our responsibilities toward newly arrived peoples and those  whose lives are not sheltered by laws and protections," he said.  </P> <P> Noting that he and Olivares "have approached various social issues with  different strategies at times," he added that they nevertheless share a  commitment to "live out the Gospel."  </P> <P> Olivares, who had been scheduled to report to a new parish in Ft. Worth, Tex.,  said his Claretian Order has released him from that obligation. He plans  instead to live in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Doctors said it was impossible to predict how long Olivares will survive. But  they said that, once the illness manifests itself in a serious infection as it  had with Olivares, the patients generally live from two to six years longer.  </P> <P> "Though it sounds very terminal, I haven't given up," a frail and unusually  soft-spoken Olivares said. "I have a lot of hope."  </P> <P> Dr. Laurence Heifetz, Olivares' primary physician, said the priest had almost  fully recovered from the meningitis when he was released from the hospital late  last month. "We expect he'll get back to normal before the next manifestation  of the HIV (AIDS virus) will hit," he said.  </P> <P> Dr. Davida Coady, a professor of medicine at UCLA and a personal friend of  Olivares', said, "We hope he will have several years of active life."  </P> <P> Olivares has traveled numerous times to Central America since 1984 to visit  refugee camps and to meet with government and church officials.  </P> <P> Coady, an expert on medicine in underdeveloped countries, said she checked with  several clinics in El Salvador where Olivares had received treatment for  various minor maladies related to his health problems, including diabetes.  </P> <P> The physician said she is convinced that the priest was infected with the AIDS  virus at a clinic six years ago where medication was injected, apparently with  contaminated needles. Although she declined to provide further details about  the clinic, citing confidentiality issues, she said she learned that other  people have been infected with the AIDS virus at the same facility. Heifetz  said he concurred with Coady's assessment.  </P></p>

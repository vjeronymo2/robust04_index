Mainland economic entities, in  particular, have increasingly participated in business  activities and taken more economic stakes in various sectors,  triggering an unprecedented change in Hong Kong's economic  landscape China-owned firms have mushroomed in Hong Kong their  numbers increasing from 200 in 1985 to 15,000 by last year.    They have provided jobs for more than 90,000 employees,  almost four percent of the territory's labour force -- with  10,000 of them mainlanders, five times the number in the early  '80s. Although no accurate figure is available, a conservative  estimate puts total capital assets and investment by mainland  entities in Hong Kong at more than US$30 billion, 10 times that  in 1985. China's economic stake in Hong Kong is conservatively  estimated to account for nearly 15 percent of the territory's  economy.    Mainland firms have not only grown quantitatively, but also  have greatly improved business quality. Some have become  dominant players in their business sectors, with the Bank of  China group developing from a relatively small retail bank in  the early '80s into the territory's number two bank.    Mainland economic entitles also have developed from their  traditional business of banking and China-related trading in the  early '80s into seven major economic sectors. In the financial  sector growth is attributed to several major state-owned  enterprises. Before 1984, mainland firms were generally  discouraged by Beijing from participating in the financial  sector, but their expansion began in late 1984, with the Bank of  China Group, Conic Investment and CITIC (HK) invited by the Hong  Kong Government to take part in the rescue of financially  troubled banks in the mid-'80s.    In the past few years mainland firms have aggressively  engaged in corporate activities and by last year, mainly through  backdoor listings and H-share flotations, they controlled more  than 50 territory-listed companies. In the banking sector, the  Bank of China founded its Hong Kong headquarters in the '50s.  Since those modest beginnings the mainland presence has soared,  with CITIC and China Merchants acquiring local banks, Ka Wah and  Union Bank in the late '80s.    Recently the number has in creased further with the People's  Construction Bank and Everbright taking over territory banks.  By the start of this year, mainland firms have taken direct and  indirect control of more than 20 banks. As a result, China-  controlled banks have topped both the Hong Kong and Shanghai  Bank and Hang Seng Bank in business in the territory. By the  end of 1993, deposits taken by the Bank of China group alone  account for 24 percent of total bank deposits in the territory.    In the property market, mainland firms were traditionally  more cautious, but since 1985 -- partly because the market  started dramatically reactivating, and partly because China's  "window firms" began mushrooming in Hong Kong mainland firms  have been engaging boldly in the industry. By the end of 1993,  it was estimated that mainland investment in property reached  more than HK$30 billion.    In 1992 alone, Chinese investment reached about $6.5  billion,  accounting for 25 to 30 percent of all property deals of more  than $100 million each, leaving the mainland the third biggest  investor after Japanese and Taiwanese firms in that year.  Although an austerity programme, launched to cope with China's  overheating economy in late 1993 was thought to have slowed down  mainland investment, no firms have been seen selling properties.  In addition, there are clear signs that mainland firms'  property investment is heating up following deals done by both  China State Real Estate Development Corp and CITIC Pacific.    Moreover, several mainland construction firms, including  China Overseas Land, are busily engaged in property investment.  It is estimated that more than 50 percent of property  transactions in 1993 involved mainland firms, suggesting that  territory tycoons are investing in the mainland market, and  mainlanders are jumping in to fill the gap in Hong Kong.    Thanks to China's reform policy, trade between China and  Hong  Kong has increased at double-digit rates since 1985 and mainland  firms are benefitting due to the fact that almost all  China-related firms are engaged in import-export business.  Although no precise figures are available, it is estimated that  mainland firms have taken at least 85 percent of the total  volume of China trade, amounting to 20 per of Hong Kong trade,  or up to $107.7 billion in 1993.    Mainland firms can be expected to continue to dominate the  business because of economic integration which will intensify  rapidly in the coming three years. In addition, mainland firms  traditionally have taken a considerable stake in land and sea  transport, and also of China-related warehousing business in  Hong Kong. Mainland firms, including China Merchants, China  Travel, Continental Mariner and provincial "window" firms, have  drastically expanded business in the transportation sector. It  is estimated that mainland firms have shared about 15 to 20  percent of total business turnover in the sector since 1990.    CITIC, China Travel and China Merchants already have taken  as  much as 15 percent of air transport services and MTR services.  Mainland firms are taking more stakes from British-backed  utility firms in the public transportation sector, a trend  likely to continue in the run-up to 1997.    Another area of rapid mainland-interest growth is the  tourist  industry. In the past eight years, mainland firms have jumped  into Hong Kong's tourist industry. Only three main tourist  firms were registered in the early '80s but, by 1992, 36  agencies were owned by mainland firms, accounting for about 10  per cent of turnover. They have a virtual monopoly of  China-Hong Kong tours and now own 13 hotels and a number of  unregistered small hostels, worth about $6 billion.    One sector where mainland participation has been relatively  small has been manufacturing. According to Hong Kong Government  figures, in 1985 only 15 Chinese firms were engaged in  manufacturing, mainly related to toys, electronics and textiles.  However, mainland firms have maintained constant investment in  the manufacturing sector over the past few years and by last  year more than 100 Chinese firms were directly engaged in the  manufacturing industry in Hong Kong.    Direct investment by mainland firms accounted for up to 12  per cent of total foreign investment in the territory's  manufacturing sector between 1992 and 1993. In the past eight  years, mainland firms have lifted their shares by 10 to 15 per  cent in each of the seven key economic sectors and are playing  an increasingly important role in Hong Kong's economy.    Yet this appears likely to be only the beginning of the  Chinese economic presence in Hong Kong. Despite some negative  impact which may seemingly be imposed by mainland business  expansion, Hong Kong's business environment as a whole appears  to have been enhanced rather than disadvantaged. No matter how  aggressive mainland expansion is in Hong Kong, it is now  welcomed by the territory's business community.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The erosion of the premium on the FT-SE 100 futures contract provided a perfect opportunity for arbitrage and contributed to a day of internationally-inspired market weakness, writes Peter John. Fears that the US was poised to raise interest rates and prompt an investor dash away from Europe were compounded by a 556-point slide in the Japanese Nikkei and speculation that the Kuwait Investment Office was preparing to sell a huge amount of UK stock. The KIO denied the sale speculation but the rumnour set the trend for a jittery day. The December futures contract started to trade some 10 points down from its previous close of around 3,100, and was sold down straight away. December spent much of the day some three points below the underlying cash market while dealers calculate that, at this stage in its cycle, it should be priced some six points above cash. The weakness was exacerbated by some institutional selling and gave a chance for arbitrageurs, dealers who trade on the price differential between two markets, to unwind positions they had taken when the futures were at a healthy premium. December drifted to end the day at 3,067 by the official close, three points below cash, on turnover of 12,511 contracts. It continued to slide in the after-hours session and hit 3,061 with another 3,000 contracts traded. Options turnover was a high 50,711 contracts. BT, which was downgraded by US house JP Morgan, was the most active stock option on turnover of 2,700 lots. It was followed by BP with 1,900 lots.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Three guilty on fraud charges BRITAIN'S longest criminal trial ended yesterday after 17 months when three men were found guilty at Nottingham Crown Court of charges relating to the collapse of Britannia Theme Park in Derbyshire in 1985. The three are expected to be sentenced this week. The case centred on the activities of a group of companies over a five-year period and alleged fraudulent trading, deception and theft. Mr Peter Kellard, of Rosebery Road, Bournemouth, was convicted of 19 of 22 fraud charges against him and was acquitted of three charges. Mr Edward Dwyer, of East Avenue, Bournemouth, was found guilty of all six charges against him. Mr John Wright, 56, the park's former chairman, of Norwich, was found guilty of five charges, and acquitted of the final charge he faced. Mr Keith Emmett, 55, of Cosgrave, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was acquitted last Friday of all three charges against him. The theme park had been open less than three months and owed more than Pounds 8m when it collapsed.</p>

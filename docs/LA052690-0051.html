			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REPEATING NO EASY TASK FOR WOODLAND HILLS WEST  </P> <P> American Legion District 20 baseball, featuring defending World Series champion  Woodland Hills West, opens play today at high schools throughout the San  Fernando and Antelope valley and Glendale areas.  </P> <P> Defending its title, even on the home front, will be more difficult this year  for West. This season, there are 24 teams in the district, an increase of five  from 1989.  </P> <P> The Western Division features Woodland Hills East (primarily Taft High  players), Woodland Hills West (El Camino Real), Granada Hills, Agoura, Reseda,  Chatsworth, Encino-Crespi (Crespi) and Las Virgenes (Calabasas). Woodland Hills  West won the division and district titles in '89, finishing with a  regular-season mark of 19-3.  </P> <P> West again should be the team to beat -- perhaps beyond the district level.  Eleven players return, including third baseman Del Marine, the 1989 national  legion Player of the Year.  </P> <P> Also expected to play for West are Pat Treend, Jason Cohen, Bobby Kim, Jeff  Marks and Greg Lederman of El Camino Real High. Left-hander Joey Rosselli of  Alemany High, a pitcher-first baseman and newcomer to the team, also will play.  </P> <P> "We went out last year to have fun and everything fell into place," said West  Coach Don Hornback, an assistant with the team last season. "The kids played  very, very well. To expect us to repeat (the World Series title) is  far-fetched. To hope we do isn't."  </P> <P> The Eastern Division includes North Hollywood, Burbank, Sun Valley (Poly), Van  Nuys-Notre Dame (Notre Dame), Glendale, Verdugo Hills, Valley Encino-Tarzana  (Birmingham) and Panorama City (St. Genevieve). Panorama City (18-4 in district  play) is the defending divisional champion.  </P> <P> The Northern Division features Palmdale, Lancaster (Antelope Valley), West  Hills (Chaminade), Newhall-Saugus (Saugus), Studio City (Van Nuys), Quartz Hill  and San Fernando. Newhall-Saugus (17-5) is the defending champion.  </P> <P> Play in Ventura County's District 16 begins next Saturday.  </P> <P> Last August in Millington, Tenn., West became the first District 20 team to win  a World Series title, defeating Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, in the championship  game.  </P> <P> Single games are scheduled each Wednesday and Saturday, with a doubleheader on  Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Glynwed rises 47% to Pounds 45.5m - Result reflects improvement across all the group's activities Recovery accelerated in 1993 at Glynwed International, the diversified Midlands engineering group, the fortunes of which, with 70 per cent of its sales in the UK, have tended to mirror those of the national economy. Glynwed yesterday announced a 47 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 30.9m to Pounds 45.5m for the year to December 25. This translated into earnings per share of 14.91p, up from 9.2p. For the first time in three years the dividend is fully covered. With a proposed final of 7.5p, the payment is maintained at 11.65p for the fifth year running. With Mr Gareth Davies, the chairman, looking forward 'to another year of solid progress,' the market responded by pushing the shares to a year's high of 399p, up 12p on the day. However Mr Davies warned that in the current first half the results were 'likely to depend more on our own efforts than on any underlying improvement in our major markets'. Turnover rose from Pounds 908.3m to Pounds 965.8m, to produce operating profits of Pounds 53.1m, against Pounds 43.8m. Five of the six main operating divisions - consumer products, foundry products, metal services, plastics, steels and engineering - increased profits. Losses in the tubes and fittings division were reduced from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 2.2m. Throughout the recession, Glynwed has been bearing down hard on costs. It reported that last year the return on capital employed climbed from 13.8 per cent to 18.5 per cent. There was a 9 per cent increase in turnover per employee. Gearing fell to its lowest level since 1988 at 34.3 per cent, and it paid Pounds 10.1m of interest compared with Pounds 12m in 1992. Net borrowings fell to Pounds 69.8m, against a restated Pounds 102.2m. COMMENT Glynwed is in the position of being able to make money whatever happens to the UK economy. It maintained a strong cashflow right through the recession. The steady attrition of costs over recent years means that any upturn in its markets would turn quickly into higher profits. There are signs of that upturn and, in any case, over many of its sectors, Glynwed has been gaining market share. Returns from a property sale have already got the year off to an unexpectedly good start. The omens are good for pre-tax profits this year of at least Pounds 60m. This would produce earnings per share of 19.5p, providing the cover for an increased dividend, and give the shares a prospective multiple of more than 20. After the dog years, it does not look a good time to sell.</p>

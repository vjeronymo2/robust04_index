			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Management: Pin stripes to jeans - Martin Dickson looks at a growing US trend to casual dress at work It must be Friday because Bill Marx, head of AT&amp;T's network systems division, is pacing his New Jersey office in one of his awesome golfing sweaters. And down the corridor in the public relations department you can find spokesman Kevin Beagley sporting a blue Hawaiian-style shirt, jeans and Nike sneakers. Friday is the one day of the week when staff at Network Systems' headquarters are allowed to wear casual clothes to work. Jeans, slacks, sweaters and brightly coloured shirts suddenly replace the drab conventional garments of the business world. Network Systems is just one example of a widespread trend among US businesses towards more casual dress in the office, aimed at improving employee morale and productivity. According to Michael Losey, president of the Washington-based Society for Human Resource Management, an association of personnel professionals: 'Being able to dress casually in the office is a benefit for current employees and a recruiting tool for new employees. It's a morale booster. It opens the communication lines and brings senior management and the rest of the staff together.' Personnel managers argue that casual clothes can reduce stress and status distinctions, helping create the right kind of atmosphere for a business to succeed in the 1990s. Today's rapidly changing competitive environment means workers down the line must be prepared to accept added power and responsibility, and challenge those above them. The trend began in California, as do so many American fashions. A decade or two ago companies there began introducing one casual dressing day a week - often called 'dress down Friday' - while seven-day-a-week informality has always been the norm of the young, mould-breaking computer businesses of the state's Silicon Valley. 'We don't have a dress code,' says Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, 'the only rule is that you must wear something.' From California, the practice has gradually spread nationally. A poll of 500 businesses conducted last year on behalf of jeans manufacturer Levi Strauss - admittedly, hardly a neutral party - discovered 67 per cent of companies allowed some casual dress: 14 per cent every day, 23 per cent most days, 26 per cent one day a week and 24 per cent on special occasions. Losey thinks the trend will continue: 'I don't think we'll see a large number of organisations go to casual dress on a daily basis. But I do think you'll see organisations offering either a weekly or bi-weekly casual day.' A multitude of factors appear to lie behind the change, including: the entry to positions of power of the 'baby boomer' generation, which tends to be less formal than its parents; the much greater number of women in the workforce, bringing with them more varied styles of work clothes; increasing amounts of work being conducted from home or inflexible hours, which blurs the distinction between office and leisure; and a trend for employees to 'work out' at the office, accustoming staff to the sight of casual sports gear. However, the practice still varies considerably by region, with casual dress most common in the Rocky Mountains and least so in the northern midwest and northeast, with their more conservative, sartorial traditions. Yet even the most traditional companies are now unbending. Take AT&amp;T, for example. The New Jersey telecommunications group, which 10 years ago was known as an archetypal, buttoned-up, grey-flannel-suit outfit, now has an informal 'dress down Friday' policy across the company. It might be thought that adopting casual Fridays would make a company less productive, on the grounds that employees wearing informal clothes would subconsciously think the weekend had already begun. However, many companies which have introduced such a scheme insist this does not happen and in some cases productivity actually increases. There are, however, limits to the trend. Employees working in areas where they are in contact with the public, or where conservative clothes are the norm, still tend to wear more formal garb. Examples include salespeople, consultants and lawyers. And companies impose restrictions on the degree of informality they will permit. At Network Systems, for example, shorts are frowned upon, though some other companies permit them in summer, provided they are neither frayed nor too short. Casual, in other words, does not mean sloppy or overly sexy.</p>

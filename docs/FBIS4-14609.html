			<p>BFN     [Text] State Duma's Speaker, Ivan Rybkin, met Russian  President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Thursday. They discussed  in detail all issues of concern to society, Rybkin told INTERFAX.    Rybkin said Yeltsin had given him the draft agreement on  civil accord in Russia which was still being worked on. Rybkin  pointed out that no terms had as yet been announced for signing  the document. He added that there was no reason for hastily  working out the agreement since it was very important. He  stressed that a large number of socially significant  institutions were to sign it -- political parties, religious  denominations, the government, trade unions, the president and  the Federal Assembly chambers.    Rybkin said the draft agreement would be considered by the  State Duma's Council next Monday. Thereafter, it is to be  considered by the parliamentary factions and only then will it  be submitted at a plenary session of the State Duma.    Commenting on the initiative by Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev on the establishment of a Eurasian union, Rybkin  emphasized that the single economic space already provided for  similar legislation in this sphere. Serious efforts by the CIS  Parliamentary Assembly are needed to bring the legislation  together and some new institution like the one which exists in  the European Union, a kind of common parliament, may be needed.    Such a parliament is necessary as a body which will  coordinate activities of countries seeking closer economic  cooperation.    However, Rybkin believes that the proposal on the  introduction of a single currency on the territory of the  Eurasian Union put forward by Nazarbayev is preliminary. Rybkin  repeated that national currency units existed in the EU  [European Union] together with the single currency unit -- the  ECU -- and that this model must not be ignored.</p>

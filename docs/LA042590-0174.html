			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS ON THIN NHL ICE;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: THE FIVE WHO TOOK PART IN THE PLAYOFFS COMBINED FOR NO GOALS AND A  MINUS-6 RATING, SPARKING GRUMBLING.  </P> <P> Not one of the NHL's Soviet players made it to the second round of the Stanley  Cup playoffs. Also, none of those who participated in the opening playoff  series did much to help his team's cause.  </P> <P> The five who took part -- Sergei Makarov and Sergei Priakin of Calgary, Alexei  Kasatonov and Viacheslav Fetisov of New Jersey and Alexander Mogilny of Buffalo  -- combined for no goals, 12 assists and a minus-six rating in 24 playoff  games.  </P> <P> That prompted Don Cherry, who once described the Soviets as "money-grubbing  Reds," to claim that the Soviets wanted to lose so they could join their  national team for the world championships in Switzerland. Makarov, Kasatonov  and Fetisov are playing for the Soviet Union, which was the victim of a major  upset by Sweden.  </P> <P> The Soviet players had a difficult time adapting to the NHL, for a number of  reasons. The culture had much to do with it, as did the steady diet of tough  games in a relentless 80-game schedule.  </P> <P> When some of the Soviets finally got the hang of the regular season, they found  themselves thrust into the playoffs, with greater intensity and greater  demands. They lacked the ability to raise their game that extra notch.  </P> <P> Igor Dmitriev, assistant coach and chief spokesman for the Soviet national  team, indicated that the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation was embarrassed by the  players' poor performances and would hold a camp in Moscow in August to prepare  them for next season.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of problems," Dmitriev told the Toronto Sun. "It wasn't just  new team, new country. The biggest thing was training. I think they were not so  prepared for the NHL. You have to understand, they were in training their whole  lives. They didn't have to do anything on their own before."  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Leading Article: High-cost TV GOVERNMENTS tend to get misty-eyed when they contemplate high-technology projects. But those with misty eyes rarely have clear vision. Such has been the case with the European Community's programme to push high-definition television. Earlier this year, it looked as though the programme was set for a merciful death. But, following a gasping attempt this week by EC ministers to resuscitate the project, it may linger on for a little longer. Europe's HDTV failure stems from the government-backed 'techno-imperialism' of companies such as Philips and Thomson. The idea was that a home-grown standard would help Europe's industry outflank Japan's. The snag was that the plan did not take account of the market. Broadcasters were reluctant to make programmes in the new standard and it was doubtful whether consumers would be prepared to buy expensive new TV sets. The irony is that Europe has been overtaken not by Japan but by the US, where development has been more market-driven. The EC would do well to bury its project. Unfortunately, the Commission and most countries seem determined to press ahead with a slimmed down scheme to subsidise production of TV programmes. Even Britain, which has criticised the strategy, seems willing to go along. It is understandable that Britain is thinking of compromise, since other countries have moved substantially in its direction. Proposed EC funding for the plan has been cut from Ecu850m to Ecu285m and may fall further. If the HDTV initiative were an isolated case, there would be something to be said for waiving it through in the interests of being communautaire. But it is not. Similar white elephants in the past include Jessi, which aimed to build a strong European semiconductor industry, and others could be in the pipeline. Only last month the Commission proposed spending Ecu13.1bn on research and development by 1998. Subsidised R&amp;D is not the answer to Europe's weaknesses in high technology. Philips is ailing despite an excellent record in R&amp;D. The problems are that European companies have often been bad at turning research into money-spinners, and other sectors of the economy have been slow to absorb the benefits of technology. It is not simply that such subsidies are a waste of taxpayers' money. Aid is also counter-productive because it is almost invariably channelled through big companies which have close links with government officials. This delays necessary adjustments in what are often industrial dinosaurs, while nimbler companies - which may have a better chance of profitable innovation - are unfairly discriminated against. Europe's technology policy should concentrate not on pushing technologies against what the market demands but on facilitating the dissemination of technology in vigorously competitive markets.</p>

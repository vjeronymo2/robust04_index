			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Storm directors depart over dispute STORM GROUP, the USM-quoted animation, licensing and merchandising company, lost its chief executive and a US-based executive vice president yesterday after a boardroom disagreement over the future direction of the company. Mr James Driscoll, chairman, founder and creator of The Shoe People, one of Storm's childrens' cartoons, said they had disagreed with the decision to refocus the group on its core royalty-driven licensing, merchandising and publications activit-ies. Although Storm will continue to develop animation ideas and undertake commissioned cartoon productions, Mr Driscoll said it would no longer use its own funds to make animated cartoons. He said Mr Gary Smith, chief executive, and Mr Brian Larcher, executive vice president of the US subsidiary, disagreed and resigned amicably. Last year Storm spent between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 1.7m on productions. Meanwhile Mr Jerry Alpert, another US-based executive vice president of the group, has been appointed to the board. Mr Alpert has been responsible for building up the group's worldwide network of agents and developing its US licensing business. Mr Driscoll said yesterday that the group would announce two more large worldwide licensing deals with 'major US properties' in the next two weeks. Last year Storm was appointed Paramount Pictures' exclusive licensing and merchandising representative in Britain. Paramount's properties include Star Trek, Cheers and the Addams Family.</p>

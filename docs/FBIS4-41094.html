			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The citizenship bill was debated in the Latvian  Saeima today on its third reading. As expected, the debate was  primarily devoted to Clause 14, which regulates the general  arrangements for the naturalization of non-citizens. [passage  omitted]    The quota principle could be an obstacle to admission to the  Council of Europe. This was pointed out in a speech by Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs. In a secret ballot, this quota was  removed from the law by majority vote. Thereby, the Saeima this  evening accepted the law on citizenship. The voting in the  secret ballot was: 66 deputies for; 11 against; three  abstentions.</p>

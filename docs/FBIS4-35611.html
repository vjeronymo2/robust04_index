			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad al-Razzaz has stated  that 21.446 billion pounds will be earmarked for servicing the  internal and external debts in the new budget, which will begin  on 1 July. Dr. al-Razzaz pointed out that the treasury bills  make up most of the internal debts owed by the government. He  stressed the importance of the treasury bills in streamlining  the budget deficit and absorbing the surplus in the country,  whether from individuals or banks, to reduce inflation. The  minister also stressed the importance of the treasury bills in  stopping the drop in interest rates on savings in Egyptian  pounds and in maintaining the rates of exchange.    Dr. al-Razzaz added that the state is spending 1.5 billion  pounds to adjust the financial structure of the Egyptian railway  and 220 millions to extend electricity to the countryside.</p>

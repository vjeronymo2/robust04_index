			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Wimpey's home truths The stock market is clearly expecting that the green shoots of recovery will soon blossom into flowers but some chilling corporate news this spring may yet deliver a nasty frost. Wimpey's promise yesterday that it will announce further substantial write-downs on its residential land and commercial property this March, for example, is only likely to damp recent hopes on the housing front. Although Wimpey has been among the most perennially pessimistic of construction companies, its continuing revaluations suggest the spiral of asset values may still not have reached its floor. Two months ago, Wimpey's then chairman was forecasting further falls in construction output with recovery delayed until 1995. Wimpey itself certainly looks tired from the waiting. Provisions this year may amount to Pounds 100m, whittling away shareholders' funds to less than Pounds 500m. Borrowings of about Pounds 180m remain uncomfortably high. With cash continuing to drain out of the business, it still has some way to go before sorting itself out. Unfortunately, it is rapidly running out of things to sell. Even if a housing recovery does arrive, shareholders may continue to doubt the prospects for volume house builders. The wreckage of recession will take time for such housebuilders to clear. And, shorn of the restraints of an exchange rate discipline, the government is likely to be unusually careful in preventing another inflationary house price boom.</p>

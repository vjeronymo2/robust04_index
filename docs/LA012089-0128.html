			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Adolph Coors Co. said it would abandon the "Original Draft" label it began  putting on its flagship beer seven months ago, saying too many customers  thought the brew's ingredients had been changed. New labels on cans and bottles  that will reach store shelves in three weeks will simply say "Coors," said Mike  Marranzino, brand director for the brewer, which has its headquarters in  Golden, Colo., west of Denver.  </P></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There was improved demand for landed, with emphasis on better liquoring teas, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Coloury Assams sold well, particularly pd's, but prices were 2 to 6p easier with quality, while plain sorts were again neglected. Bright and good medium east Africans often gained several pence but plainer descriptions were irregular and barely steady. Ceylons met good but selective demand with better sorts firm and lower quality teas tending easier. Offshore: good general demand. Brighter teas were firm to dearer but plainer types were sometimes easier. Quotations: quality 165p/kg, good medium 140p/kg, medium 108p/kg, low medium 90p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 166p/kg for a Rwanda pd.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Canadian bank lifts provisions BANK OF Nova Scotia has boosted its fiscal 1992 loan loss provisions by CDollars 200m (USDollars 168m) or 45 per cent, to reflect its exposure to Olympia &amp; York and other troubled borrowers. The bank, Canada's fourth biggest, nonetheless reported a small increase in second-quarter earnings, with the extra write down exactly offset by a recovery in third world loans. As a result, the second-quarter provision of CDollars 110m is unchanged from the previous three months. The provision in the second quarter of 1991 was CDollars 85m. Although they are among O&amp;Y's biggest lenders, the Canadian banks are generally well-equipped to absorb substantial losses. BNS for instance, reported that its risk-weighted capital-to-assets ratio improved in the second quarter to 8.6 per cent from 8.3 per cent a year earlier. Net earnings rose to CDollars 171m, or 75 cents a share, in the three months to April 30, from CDollars 163.3m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. The improvement was largely due to wider margins as both domestic and foreign interest rates continued to decline. Return on equity slipped, however, to 16 per cent from 17.6 per cent. BNS disclosed earlier that its total exposure to O&amp;Y is CDollars 600m. But with the loans largely secured by prime office buildings and marketable securities, the bank said that it expects 'substantial recoveries'. Total non-performing loans, net of provisions, rose to CDollars 1.87bn on April 30 from CDollars 1.74bn three months earlier.</p>

Male and female citizens; on the occasion of the  advent of 'Id al- Fitr it gives me pleasure to convey to you my  most sincere greetings.    We ask that God may bring us to the next 'Id with prosperity  and blessings and that he will inspire us with the wisdom and  ability to serve the country and restore tranquillity and  prosperity to our people, and security and stability to our  country which is experiencing a difficult period in its history.    Brothers and sisters; I have had the opportunity to stress  that Algeria is in need of all its faithful sons who are  earnestly concerned for it and are eager to restore it to its  true place among nations, and who do not spare themselves on its  behalf. [passage omitted]    Thanks to these sacrifices the country will be victorious  over its enemies who are criminals, traitors, and mercenaries.    On behalf of the state and in my own name, I express to them  full and effective solidarity with them. I also express the  solidarity of the state and its officials with the Armed Forces  staff, the security men, and all the sections of society, the  women and men who are still loyal to the covenant of 1 November  1956 [outbreak of the armed revolution].    Citizens, men and women; the month of Ramadan which is  considered as one of the pillars of our holy religion has been  spent by the Algerian people in difficult circumstances as a  result of violence, and in the climate of an acute economic  crisis. However, our people have been able to overcome these  trials thanks to the strength of its faith, its love for its  homeland, and attachment to its unity. The faith and  determination of the Algerian people are the two pillars on  which the action of the state is based in order to entrench a  new era beneficial to all Algerians.    Brothers, sisters; I will continue work relentlessly and  without any hesitation to reinforce the institutions of the  state, restore security, and realize national concord and  solidarity between all Algerians, and in order to undertake the  reforms liable to revive the national economy. In this  framework, we will also continue the fight against violence and  criminality on the one hand, and promote serious dialogue with  all the parties that respect the Constitution on the other, with  a view to restoring stability to the country.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today issued a statement condemning a new attack in  Hadera, Israel.    A bus in Hadera was bombed earlier today with six Israelis  killed and 28 wounded, including 18 Israeli soldiers.    "This action, like those before it, is a further attempt by  extremists to derail the peace process," Clinton said, adding  that "they must not be allowed to succeed."    "We believe the best response to the enemies of peace is to  demonstrate that negotiations can change realities on the ground  and give hope to Israelis and Palestinians for a peaceful  future," Clinton said.    White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that Clinton  telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to express  condolences over today's bus explosion.    Clinton stressed the urgency of bringing an end to the  on-going talks on implementing the PLO-Israeli peace accord  signed in Washington on September 13 1993.    During the telephone talk, Rabin agreed with Clinton on the  need to reach prompt agreement on the implementation, Myers said.</p>

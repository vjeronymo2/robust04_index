			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Philippine energy chief quits Mr Delfin Lazaro, Philippine energy secretary credited with resolving the country's chronic electricity shortages, has resigned, President Fidel Ramos said yesterday, Jose Galang writes from Manila. The resignation, from September 20, came on the eve of Mr Ramos's trip to Europe and the public listing today of Petron Corporation, which Mr Lazaro had steered to privatisation. Mr Ramos said Mr Lazaro was leaving 'because he has done his job and has fulfilled his commitment'. He is known to have offered to resign as early as last June, reportedly because of conflicts with other energy officials. Mr Lazaro was given emergency powers in 1992 to tackle an energy crisis responsible for 10 to 12 hour daily rationing. Businesses losses ran to about 7bn pesos (Pounds 172m) a month. With the aid of emergency powers granted by Congress, the government was able to skip bureaucratic tangles and gave priority to 'fast-track' power stations. Mr Lazaro will be replaced by Mr Francisco Viray, president of the state-run National Power Corporation, which owns most of the country's generating capacity.</p>

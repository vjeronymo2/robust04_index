			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEACHERS REMAIN OUT AMID NEGOTIATIONS  </P> <P> With education grinding to a standstill, the Los Angeles Unified School  District entered its second day of a teachers' strike as district and union  officials continued intense negotiations focusing on possible new salary  offers.  </P> <P> A district source said the Los Angeles Board of Education was considering a  package of proposals from United Teachers-Los Angeles that were presented late  Monday. No specifics were offered.  </P> <P> But UTLA President Wayne Johnson denied reports that the union had proposed a  new salary package for a 22.5% raise over three years. The district has offered  21.5% over three years.  </P> <P> Johnson said he had not been in communication with any district official as of  late this morning. "I am much less hopeful today than yesterday," he said.  </P> <P> Although some schools reported higher attendance among students today, high  school students in particular continued to leave campus in large numbers.  </P> <P> At Franklin High School in Highland Park, about 500 students walked out at 10  a.m. to stage a protest outside the school. Police were called in when students  began blocking traffic, but no injuries were reported and no arrests were made.  </P> <P> Students said school administrators attempted to lock gates to prevent students  from leaving.  </P> <P> Said Angelina Barriga, an 11th-grader: "As soon as we started walking out, they  closed the gates and shut the doors and barricaded students." She said students  got out by jumping fences, breaking through gates and rushing past school  police officers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the two sides issued conflicting reports on how many teachers  remained on strike today. Union officials said at least 25,000 of the  district's 32,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians stayed out on the  picket lines on the second day of the strike.  </P> <P> "We're hanging strong," union spokeswoman Catherine Carey said.  </P> <P> The district, however, said early indications today showed that teachers were  "trickling back" into schools in three regions -- the south San Fernando  Valley, the Eastside and Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said between one and seven teachers per  school who had not been in class Monday reported to work this morning.  </P></p>

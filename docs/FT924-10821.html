			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Marks and Spencer profits rise 20% MARKS and Spencer, the clothing and food retailer, yesterday demonstrated its continued dominance of the UK high street by posting a 20 per cent improvement in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 257.1m. The rise was flattered by the absence of any exceptional charges, which depressed the previous year's figure by Pounds 16.9m. But even excluding this factor, profits were still 11 per cent up as the company squeezed higher net profits from near-static sales. Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are now running the business more efficiently than we have for many years and therefore need a lower gross margin, passing the benefits of that on to the customer in terms of better-value goods.' However, the City was worried by the company's flat UK sales and the cautious stance on current trading. It was also disappointed with the 5 per cent rise in the interim dividend to 2.2p when earnings per share rose 22 per cent to 6.2p. The shares fell 15.5p to 327 1/2 p. Sir Richard described the dividend payment as an 'amber light' on current trading. 'I do not think that our dividend is anything other than prudent. The economy does not give me a lot of hope. There is still a long hard haul ahead,' he said. In the half year to September 26, group turnover fell 0.3 per cent to Pounds 2.64bn. Clothing sales in the UK rose 1 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn while food sales were only 0.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.02bn. Operating profits, however, were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 253.3m as the company widened its net profit margin from 8.9 per cent to 9.6 per cent. Interest income, up from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 10.1m, also boosted the profits gain. The contribution from financial services rose from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 12.6m. The group's international operations recorded a mixed trading performance. In spite of heavy opening costs, the continental European stores increased profits from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 6.6m on sales up 35 per cent at Pounds 97m. Sir Richard warned that sales were beginning to soften. The company's trauma in Canada continued although losses were reduced from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 700,000. Kings Supermarkets and Brooks Brothers in the US lifted profits by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 3.3m. The company's four Hong Kong stores improved their contribution from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 3.4m but Brooks Brothers in Japan reported a weakening of sales. Lex, Page 20</p>

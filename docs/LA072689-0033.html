			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : GRANT TO GEORGE RUSSELL WELL DESERVED; SUMMER CRUISES GET READY TO  HIT THE WAVES  </P> <P> George Russell has been the jazz composers' jazz composer for nearly four  decades. Like Fletcher Henderson before him, he has been held in high esteem by  his contemporaries, despite the failure of the larger jazz audience to  acknowledge his skills fully.  </P> <P> It was particularly gratifying, therefore, when it was announced last week that  Russell had received a $375,000 award, spread over a five-year period, from the  John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  </P> <P> The 66-year-old Russell, who has been teaching at the New England Conservatory  of Music for the last 20 years, is currently in Paris, rehearsing a 15-piece  band for a summer European tour, his fourth in the last four years. Reached by  telephone earlier this week, he described his reactions to the award in  typically controlled language.  </P> <P> "It certainly floored me when I heard about it," Russell said. "But I'm doing  fine now. Everything happens in its proper time, and my first reaction was that  it had come at exactly the right time -- economically, of course, but also at  the right age for me. I'm at the stage now where I think I can handle a  windfall of this size. There was a time when it might have been overwhelming.  </P> <P> "The Norwegians have an expression that goes: 'It takes a strong back to carry  a good day.' I hate to equate good days with money, because that's not  necessarily true. But the MacArthur grant is certainly going to enable me to  make some of the goals that I wanted to get."  </P> <P> At the top of Russell's want list is the completion of his second book, "The  Science of Tonal Gravity." Two-thirds along the way, it will be an expansion of  his "Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization" -- the first, and still  the best and most practical, approach to the art of improvisation.  </P> <P> "Finishing the book has always been top priority," he said. "I've been focusing  on it for a long time, even when I didn't have time off to think about it. But  that's just as well. Too much time off would unfocus me. I seem to work better  under deadlines. If I get time off, I get lazy. Hopefully the award will allow  me to find the right balance of time to complete the book."  </P> <P> Russell saw no possibility that the award would have a significant effect upon  his compositions. The complex multi-rhythms and disjunct melodies of his early  work -- so influential in the '60s on musicians as diverse as Art Farmer, John  Coltrane, Eric Dolphy and Don Ellis -- have evolved over the years into a  mature music that almost defies categorization.  </P> <P> "I'll continue doing what I've been doing," he said. "My present work tries to  achieve a kind of world view or synthesis of many kinds of musics, one that  doesn't ignore the sounds of our time. My hope is that it's a complete music --  physical, emotional as well as thought-provoking."  </P> <P> DIG OUT THE DRAMAMINE: Two upcoming jazz cruises are beginning to take bookings  for their necessarily limited space.  </P> <P> The first -- on NCL's Southward -- embarks from Los Angeles on Aug. 28 for a  four-day trip to the south, with stops in Catalina, San Diego and Ensenada. The  stellar jazz contingent on board includes Lorez Alexandria, Bill Henderson,  Harry (Sweets) Edison, Jack Sheldon, Red Holloway, Plas Johnson, Art Hillary  and others. Chuck Niles of KKGO and Bob Parlocha of KJAZ will emcee the  performances. Information: (213) 471-1710.  </P> <P> The second cruise takes place on the Regent Sun, departing from Vancouver,  Canada, on Sept. 17 and arriving in Los Angeles four days later.  </P></p>

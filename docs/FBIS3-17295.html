Taking  part in them were units of the 201st Russian divisions, subunits  of the Armed Forces of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Russian  border troops, a total of about 2,000 personnel.    Under the overall leadership of Russia's Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev, the troops repelled attacks made by a designated  opponent towards the town of Kurgan-Tyube then went over onto  the attack and expelled the opponent from Tajik territory.    The head of the Russian military department gave a high  assessment of the combat training and the coordination of the  actions of the various units of the peace-keeping forces and  specially emphasized that these were planned exercises and not  in any way a demonstration of strength or anything similar.    Fortunately war, even in training, ends sooner or later and  the soldiers who were tired by the temperature of 28 degrees  could relax a little. Those who had proved most worthy were  presented with orders and medals and the songs introduced  pleasant variety into service life.    In the afternoon the Defense Minister went to Farkhar  [Parkhar], a rayon center in Khatlon Oblast where he was made an  honorary citizen yesterday. Pavel Grachev made an unofficial  approach towards this a year ago when he ordered an aircraft to  be sent there with medicines and doctors in order to halt an  epidemic of a very severe form of hepatitis which affected  almost half the town's inhabitants. There were gifts this time,  too. The local hospital was given 5,000 disposable syringes.    Summing up the results of his trip, Pavel Grachev said that  the exercises showed that the treaty on the collective security  of CIS countries was already operating, although not to the  desired extent. He said that this was because the Armies of the  majority of the states which had signed this document in  Tashkent were still in the stage of being set up. Touching on  the stay of Russian troops in Tajikistan, a subject which many  find painful, the Defense Minister said that it was better to  ensure the country's security on distant frontiers and the most  important thing was that Russia did not have the moral right to  abandon the 200,000 ethnic Russians living there to their fate.</p>

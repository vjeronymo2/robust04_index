			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Property: Where to find your guest-house The West Country always has working guest-houses for sale. They range from properties such as the thatched and listed grade II Newlands Cottage at Newton Poppleford near Sidmouth at Pounds 140,000 (Fulfords, 0395-578126) to seaside terraces at Pounds 79,950 in Paignton (Constables, 0803-529300) or Weymouth (Palmer Snell, 0305-788727). Constables in Exeter (0392-422122) and Millerson (0579-344401) both offer Four Chimneys at Bratton Clovelly, on the north-west fringe of Dartmoor, for Pounds 160,000; this was built in the 17th century as three cottages. Others include the Victorian Withydown House at Stoke St Gregory, near Taunton, for Pounds 220,000 (Stags, 0823-662822); Eastdown House near Dartmouth, at Pounds 195,000; and Downhayes at Spreyton, near Crediton, at Pounds 275,000 (both Jackson-Stops, 0392-214222).

The hall, a late 16th century manor listed grade II* amid nine acres, is now a small country hotel. It is a receiver's sale. In Norfolk, the imposing Victorian Holly Lodge at Heacham, near Hunstanton (and Sandringham), has been a country house hotel. If it reverts to a family house, there would still be enough bedrooms for b&amp;b guests. Price: Pounds 285,000 (Bedford, 0284-769999).</p>

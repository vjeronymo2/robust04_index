			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Romanies Jointly"] </F>   [Text] Kosice--An agreement on joint entry into the  elections was signed in Kosice yesterday by representatives of  the five largest Romany parties and movements from east and  central Slovakia. In concluding the agreement, the chairmen of  the Romany Congress, the Romany Civic Initiative, the Union of  the Romany Civic Initiative, the Romany Party of Social  Democracy, and the Party of Integration of Romanies proceeded  from their parties' failure in the last elections, which was  caused by their own fragmentation. There are at present eight  political parties and 12 cultural associations of Romanies in  Slovakia associating almost 90 percent of the 520,000 Romanies,  most of whom live in eastern Slovakia. According to the parties  to the agreement, they also contemplate joining an electoral  coalition but have not yet decided on a partner.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Col. Khalifah Haftar, commander of the </F> National Libyan Army, and Burayk Suwaysi, official spokesman for  the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, by Mufid  'Abd-al-Rahim "Somewhere in the United States"; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Rahim: If  your differences with the Libyan opposition factions are not  substantive, why create this new organization?    Haftar: We will be distinguishable from others by  our program of action. We do have differences with certain  factions. We would not have quit the NFSL if there had not been  differences between us. We do not want to be mere public  relations people trumpeting non- existent successes without  taking concrete action against the regime. Based on our  understanding of how this regime handles Libyan forces inside  and outside the country, we feel that the way to deal with this  regime is through military operations and violence.    'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you an armed organization out  to topple the Libyan regime by force? I am asking this question  because the new organization is headed by a military man.    Suwaysi: Let me first put the record straight.  Colonel Khalifah was not appointed chief of the new  organization. He remains the commander of the National Libyan  Army, virtually all of which has switched sides and joined our  new organization. Colonel Khalifah is also a member of the  constituent assembly of the new organization, which plans to  choose its leadership by a democratic vote that will be held  during a general congress in four to five months. Media reports  to the contrary are not true.    It is not true that we are a military organization only. We  will use all means, including military, to advance our  objectives. We will use violence as a means to an end, and only  as a last resort. We would very much like not to have to resort  to violence, which will, naturally, result in bloodshed, and  that we certainly do not want.    If the regime fulfills the people's demands peacefully, then  so be it. Otherwise, we will have no other alternative but to  resort to violence against it. [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Rahim: Have you contacted Arab  governments, specifically neighboring countries, given that they  are more important to you as a Libyan opposition movement. Have  you opened any official bureaus in any Arab or foreign country?    Suwaysi: We have not contacted these countries, as  yet. If this takes place, it will be in a very limited manner,  for example like the contacts that should have already been held  with the Egyptian brothers. Of course, we intend to contact all  the Arab countries soon. We have not opened official bureaus  either because we are still a new movement, no more than 40 days  old.    'Abd-al-Rahim: How do you view your movement's  relationship with the United States, which is without any doubt  an important country to you because part of your armed elements  and members of your movement are in the United States?    Suwaysi: Our relationship with the United States  will be as with any other country, based on Libya's national  interests. We will develop this relationship to serve the  Libyan cause without harming the Libyan people's interests. We  hope that the United States will understand the Libyan people's  cause and their legitimate demands for freedom, democracy, and  human rights. [passage omitted]    Haftar: The National Libyan Army, groups of which  are in the United States and Europe, is also comprised of  nationalist elements within the Libyan Armed Forces who have  patriotic feelings. They can carry out military operations  against the forces supporting the regime in parallel with the  operations we will carry out abroad. [passage omitted]    We believe it [the United States] will adopt a neutral stand  on the establishment of our movement until we contact it  officially to explain our new approach to the situation, an  approach that is different from that of the NFSL. [passage  omitted]    Suwaysi: [passage omitted] A military strike on  Libya sounds like the easiest option open to the Clinton  administration. We are certain that al-Qadhdhafi would like  nothing better than for the United States to launch an air  attack on Libya to recoup some popular support for his regime.  Such an attack would be a disaster, since it would once again  cast al- Qadhdhafi in the role of a hero and victim.    'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you saying that you and the  Clinton administration do not see eye to eye on how to exploit  the Lockerbie affair to topple the al-Qadhdhafi regime?    Suwaysi: No. We have said publicly that the  removal of al- Qadhdhafi is a matter for the Libyan people. We  are not asking the United States to dislodge al-Qadhdhafi for  us; all we want from the United States is to understand and  support the Libyan people's goals.    Given that the United States has not been able to muster the  required UN Security Council vote to impose a moratorium on  Libyan oil exports, it may be tempted by its "cowboy" mentality  to deliver a strike against Libya. Such a course of action, in  our opinion, will hardly eliminate al-Qadhdhafi; it may even  make him stronger for having been the target of an external  attack. [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you aware of any further plans  to harm Libyan opposition figures after the disappearance of  [former Libyan Foreign Minister] Mansur al-Kikhya?    Haftar: No. It must be pointed out, however,  that a decision to hit Libyan opposition figures is determined  by whether the resources and opportunity are available. If  these are available, al-Qadhdhafi will not be deterred by any  scruples. To our knowledge, al-Qadhdhafi now lacks the ability  to target Libyan opposition figures.</p>

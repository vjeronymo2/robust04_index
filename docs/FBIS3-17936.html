			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow 29 Mar, TASS -- "Citizens of the Crimean  Republic have clearly confirmed their striving for integration  with Russia for the second time within the past three months and  supported the policy of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov,"  ex-secretary of the Russian Supreme Soviet's Constitutional  Commission and head of the Russian Fund for Constitutional  Reforms Oleg Rumyantsev told ITAR-TASS here today.    Rumyantsev commented on results of the recent Crimean  plebiscite. He said he has "close comradely relations" with  Meshkov" and is trying to "render the Crimean Republic regular  support in the sphere of state-legal development."    Rumyantsev is sure that Meshkov's policy aims not to  separate  the Crimea from Ukraine, but to settle relations with both  Ukraine and Russia on the basis of agreements, create a single  legal and ruble space, and "become a real integration  locomotive."    In the opinion of the jurist, "if this policy is not ruined  in Kiev or Moscow" the Crimea may become a bridge of cooperation  in finances and double citizenship experiment. The Commonwealth  does not have a single area to test double citizenship, he added.    The Russian Fund for Constitutional Reforms has been asked  to  develop a notion of a law on Crimean citizenship. "It will be  very interesting to test the double citizenship idea (supported  by Crimean residents) as this mechanism can play a key role in  integration of the complex federal formation that appears on  territory of the former Soviet Union," said Rumyantsev.    This would mean the sides mutually recognize juridical  documents -- passports, graduate certificates and the like and  the law enforcement bodies provide for human rights and freedoms  on both territories. "Without any changes in borders or  international-legal basic features, the double citizenship  institute can help formation of a new single legal space," said  Rumyantsev.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank expands in US with Dollars 140m buy Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday announced a further addition to Citizens Financial Group, its fast-growing US retail banking subsidiary, with the proposed Dollars 139.9m (Pounds 93.2m) acquisition of the Massachusetts-based Quincy Savings Bank. Royal Bank said it would inject Dollars 115m of capital into Citizens to fund the purchase, which is the fourth acquisition in the past year, and the seventh since it acquired Citizens, the fifth largest New England bank, in 1988. Royal Bank is paying 1.9 times the book value of Quincy, or Dollars 25.75 per share. This is higher than the multiple of its past acquisitions, which it said was because of growing competition to buy banks as part of an industry consolidation. Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, said that the acquisition, which is subject to approval by Quincy's shareholders and regulators, would reinforce its presence on the east coast of Massachusetts south of Boston. He said that Citizens would be able to cut costs significantly in Quincy's 14-branch network by centralising operations. Some branches are expected to be closed and combined with existing Citizens branches. Quincy made a first quarter profit of Dollars 1.9m this year after reporting a full-year loss for 1993 of Dollars 8.5m. This was mainly caused by provisions for loans and real estate losses of Dollars 23m following the New England property market downturn. Mr Mathewson said Royal Bank had examined Quincy's asset quality and was satisfied that no further problems would emerge. He said it had a very strong deposit base, and Citizens hoped to sell other products to its customers. He said that Citizens expected to expand further through acquisition, but expected that it would not grow beyond Dollars 12bn in assets. The purchase of Quincy, which has assets of Dollars 833m, will bring Citizens' assets to Dollars 8.9bn. Mr Mathewson said the purchase would weaken Royal Bank's capital ratios only slightly. Royal Bank did not intend to sell Citizens, 'but obviously we want to make it a better business which would be more attractive'.</p>

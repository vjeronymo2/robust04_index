			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Clarification" issued by Justice Minister Aregba Polo in </F> Lome on 3 April -- recorded]    [Text] The Fourth Republic's Constitution has assigned two  essential electoral tasks to the Supreme Court. The first one  is the proclamation of results. The Constitution has assigned  to the Court the official proclamation of results. Before this  proclamation it should check the material and formal aspects of  the poll. It does not deal with the details of the electoral  exercise, but simply judges whether the organized poll appeared  to be legal. The National Electoral Commission [NEC] was of the  view that the poll appeared to be legal in 76 constituencies,  but in the remaining five, incidents occurred to such an extent  that it was advisable to transfer the results to the Supreme  Court for examination. After examination, the Court concluded  that it had to announce all the results because candidates  affected by the incidents had the chance to lodge their  electoral complaints for settlement.    The second mission assigned to the Court concerns election  disputes. It receives complaints from dissatisfied candidates,  checks the regularity of electoral exercise, and hands down  verdicts. It can confirm the validity of polls or annul the  election of a candidate in case it believes the electoral  process has been violated. The Supreme Court received 29  appeals for annulment. During the examination of the appeals,  it analyzed all the legal aspects to check the validity of the  challenged polls. The examination resulted in the annulment of  the elections of three candidates out of 81. In one case, the  annulment resulted from the ineligibility of an alternate, while  in the remaining two cases the annulment was due to the serious  irregularities that affected the fairness of the voting.    Concerning the conciliation procedure at the level of the  NEC, I point out that it was followed as proved by the letters  exchanged by the NEC chairman and the president of the Supreme  Court. Togo is a law-abiding state. Each citizen has to  respect the decisions made by the judiciary, and it is in this  spirit that each citizen should consider the decisions made by  the Supreme Court.</p>

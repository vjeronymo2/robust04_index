			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, May 9.    Mr. Salman Kurshid, Minister of State for External Affairs,  said the Government was in no way associated with the meeting on  Tibet held here by some parliamentarians from March 18-20.    The Government's position was that Tibet is an autonomous  region of China. Under Indian laws, individuals had the right to  express their opinion freely. It was the Government's hope that  non-official activities of certain individuals would not affect  the ongoing process of improvement of Sino-Indian relations.    This position had been conveyed to the Chinese Government,  he  said in a written reply, during question hour in the Lok Sabha.  <H5>  Friendly Ties with Dhaka </H5>   India is committed to the maintenance of friendly and  cooperative relations with Bangladesh. The dialogue with that  country to resolve outstanding issues as also India's endeavors  to consolidate bilateral cooperation would continue, Mr. Kurshid  said.    The major bilateral issues to be resolved with Bangladesh  included sharing of waters of the common rivers, early  completion of the repatriation of Chakma refugees, illegal  immigration from Bangladesh, insurgency-related developments and  further expansion of cultural, commercial and economic  cooperation.    The Government had made an offer to several heads of  missions  accredited to India to facilitate a visit to Jammu and Kashmir.    These included ambassadors from Islamic and other countries.  In pursuance of this, since February, 1994 three groups of  envoys, including heads of missions from some Islamic countries,  have visited Jammu and Kashmir. The Government arranged the  logistics. A programme of briefings and visits was arranged in  consultation with the State authorities. The heads of missions  utilised the visit to meet a wide section of people in the  State, Mr. Khurshid said.  <H5>  Pak. Propaganda Countered </H5>   Pakistan was carrying out an extensive propaganda on Kashmir  in the U.S. with the help of anti-India elements. Adequate  resources had been provided to the Indian Embassy and consulates  to counter such propaganda, he said.    The Government had also engaged the services of a lobbying  firm in the U.S. to supplement the efforts of the Indian  missions. The Government was apprising other governments of  Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism.    The Government had seen reports about a sizable number of  highly trained and well-armed foreign mercenaries, including  Afghan nationals, infiltrating into the State with the covert  support of Pakistan and who were indulging in acts of subversion  and terrorism.    According to reports, a few thousand such mercenaries are  still in Pakistan.    The Government was maintaining constant vigil and taking all  measures to combat terrorism and to safeguard, at all costs, the  unity and territorial integrity of the nation, Mr. Khurshid  said. -- UNI</p>

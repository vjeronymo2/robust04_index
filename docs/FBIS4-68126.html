			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Kurayshan] </F>   [Excerpts] The public prosecutor of the State Security  Court has issued a decision dismissing the case of seven  Jordanian Afghan defendants. The public prosecutor announced  that the case does not fall within the court's jurisdiction and  that he would refer the case to the attorney of the State  Security Court, who should refer it to the competent judicial  quarters.    The decision stated that the State Security Court charged  the defendants with participation in a conspiracy to carry out  terrorist acts and planning to commit crimes against people and  public funds.    The decision said that, after investigating this case and  studying it in detail, the public prosecutor of the State  Security Court became convinced that the first defendant, Bura',  and the second, Yahya, are members of the Jordanian Afghan  movement who had left Jordan for Afghanistan in 1989 where they  received military training. They stayed there for over a year,  during which time they took part in the war there. In 1991,  they returned to Jordan.    In 1993, the two defendants got together again and discussed  the idea of establishing a religious jihad organization that  seeks to remove vice by force and to achieve the highest  objective of this organization, the establishment of an Islamic  state. The two set out the objectives of the organizations as  follows:    1. Declaring as infidel the ruling regime in Jordan and all  its civil and military institutions.    2. Attacking the state's civilian and military personnel,  since they are followers of the ruling regime.    3. Assassinating certain Jordanian personalities, including  intellectuals, economists, and men of letters.    4. Blowing up the Parliament building, since it is the  legislative authority that passes legislation conflicting with  the Holy Koran.    5. Smashing movie theaters and liquor stores inside the  Kingdom.    6. Declaring as infidel women who do not wear an Islamic  veil  and considering them prisoners of war.    The two defendants, Bura' and Yahya, then began looking for  sources to finance this organization, especially to acquire  weapons and pay for the expenses and financial obligations of  the members of the organization. Consequently, the second  defendant, Yahya, issued a ruling sanctioning the theft of funds  from non-Muslims and considering the money they get from those  people war spoils, as long as those people do not pay Islamic  tax for their stay in a Muslim country. The second defendant  also sanctioned the theft of bank funds which, they argue, are  usurious. He also said it was permissible to take the money of  a Muslim who does not pay alms tax either by force or by fraud.    In accordance with this edict, the two defendants agreed to  rob several stores and banks, such as the Arab Bank, Umm  al-Summaq branch, and a goldsmith in al-Fuhays. They also  planned to attack foot patrols to kill them, since they follow  an infidel ruling regime, and to seize their weapons.    The two defendants also agreed to recruit other elements to  this organization. Thus, the first defendant, Bura', recruited  another defendant, Wa'il, after explaining to him the aims of  the organization and the methods it would adopt to achieve these  aims.    On 17 November 1993, defendant Yahya left Jordan for Saudi  Arabia where he was arrested, while the first defendant, Bura',  and the third defendant, Wa'il, began to prepare for the thefts  that were agreed upon among the three defendants. Wa'il bought  a 7-mm pistol [as published] for 400 dinars and two tear gas  grenades to be used in the theft operations. [passage omitted]    After verification, it has become clear that the established  facts here are not in conformity with the provisions and  elements of the first charge against the defendants; namely,  participating in a conspiracy to carry out acts of terrorism,  and that the actions carried out by all the defendants, even if  proved to be true, do not constitute more than an offense, or an  agreement to perpetrate crimes against people and their funds in  violation of the provisions of Articles 157/1 and 158/3 of the  Penal Code No. 16 of 1960.    Since this offense, even if proven true, does not fall  within  the jurisdiction of the State Security Court in accordance with  the provisions of Article 3 of the State Security Court Law No.  17 of 1959, amended by Law No. 6 of 1993, I have decided to  dismiss the case as not falling within my jurisdiction, and to  refer the file of the case to the attorney of the State Security  Court to refer it to the competent judicial quarters.    The defendants are:    1. Bura' Ghanim 'Abduh, alias Abu-Malik, 33 years old.    2. Yahya Ibrahim al-Zughli, alias Abu-Humam, 35 years old.    3. Wa'il Rashid al-Waza'ifi, 24 years old.    4. Ahmad Nasuh al-Waza'ifi, 26 years old.    5. Ahmad Musa Naji 'Amirah, 25 years old.    6. Isma'il 'Abd-al-Wadud al-'Isawi, 22 years old.    7. 'Ali Muhammad Mahmud al-Faqih, 24 years old.</p>

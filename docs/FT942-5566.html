			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: HK shipping group to seek listing in Oslo Jinhui Shipping &amp; Transportation, a Hong Kong-based company with a large fleet of dry bulk freighters, plans an Oslo Stock Exchange listing. It will be the first Asian company to be quoted on the Norwegian market. Jinhui, which is incorporated in Bermuda, will issue up to 49m shares to raise USDollars 90m after costs at an indicative price of between Dollars 1.70 and Dollars 2 a share. The company, which forms part of the Hong Kong-listed Jinhui Holdings, plans an international share offering as well as a smaller public offering in Norway. It will issue shares equivalent of up to 49 per cent of its equity. The Jinhui move follows a recent trend for private shipping groups to seek public listings to raise their profile and improve their ability to raise funds to finance the renewal of their fleets. Jinhui made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 11.6m on net revenues of Dollars 18.2m in the year ended March 1994. It expects to make a profit of Dollars 18.4m on net revenue of Dollars 30.5m in the year ended December 1994 after a change of its year-end. The company has a fleet of 35 vessels active in trade with China. It also trades commodities such as steel products and non-ferrous metals and has investments in Chinese transport infrastructure projects. The shares will go on offer to institutions from June 6 with the final price to be set on about June 20. The offering is being co-ordinated by Nomura International and Christiania Fonds. In a separate move, Stolt Partner, an Olso-listed shipping company, announced plans for a Dollars 75m rights issue. It will issue 15 new shares for every four held to fund, with additional loan finance, the purchase of five second-hand tankers valued at Dollars 121m and two new tankers from Stolt Parcel Tankers.</p>

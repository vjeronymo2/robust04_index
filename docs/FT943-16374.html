			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (4): Tyre cord company sees potential in exports - Kordsa is cutting costs to improve efficiency 'You won't find this in any factory in Europe,' says Mr Akif Azizoglu, the plant manager, pointing to a strange arrangement of strip lighting suspended above the looms at the Sabanci group's Kordsa tyre cord factory, just outside Izmit on the northern shores on the Marmara. Cost savings are a principal preoccupation of the company, as it prepares for Europe and the approaching customs union with the European Union, which is scheduled to come into effect in 1995. Ms Guler Sabanci, the 39-year-old general manager of Kordsa, talks of almost nothing else. 'Sales and profits may be reduced but by improving our efficiency we can more than make up for it. Looking at our cost, we have done everything possible to be ready,' she says from her office in the new Istanbul headquarters of this family-run conglomerate. Kordsa - the 'SA' being the signature of all Sabanci companies - is the only tyre cord factory in Turkey, the first company to be located at Kentsa, the Sabanci industrial complex near Izmit, and the first Sabanci company to list shares on the Istanbul stock exchange. The company has been going through a tough patch in recent years, with new investments raising financial costs. Kordsa reported pre-tax profits of TL105bn in 1993, a decline of 21 per cent in real terms. Sales were up by 63 per cent, although this was barely in line with inflation. Ms Sabanci believes the market is undervaluing the company. Certainly, the share price has underperformed the market, increasing by 272 per cent in 1993, compared with a rise of more than 400 per cent for the index as a whole. In the first quarter this year, Kordsa has fallen by 57 per cent, again rather worse than the rest of the market. The main problem has been heavy borrowing expenses, which accounted for 12 per cent of costs. There was also a cash squeeze early in 1993, related to payment arrears on business with Iran, which forced the company to make short-term bank borrowings. The company, like others dependent on the health of the car sector, is likely to be hard hit by the downturn in automotive demand in Turkey's current economic slowdown. However, brokers believe the long-term picture looks fairly robust, with the company enjoying an apparently impregnable position in the domestic market and a growing presence as an international supplier. Kordsa is a 100 per cent Turkish company, unlike the other companies on the site - Brisa, a tyre joint venture with Bridgestone of Japan; Dusa, a polyester link-up with Du Pont of the US; and the most recent arrival Beksa, a steel cord collaboration with the Belgian steel cord maker Bekaert. The Sabanci group is in good company - both Pirelli and Goodyear are located nearby. Uniroyal, which used to have a link with Sabanci's industrial rivals, the Koc family, has since pulled out of Turkey. Starting with technology provided under a licensing agreement with Goodyear, Kordsa has now developed home-grown technology for a wide range of processes. Indeed, Kordsa is selling know-how under a joint venture agreement with the Egyptians called the Nile Kordsa company. The Sabanci group's 40 per cent equity stake represents the machinery, supplied to the Egyptian venture which started production in 1993. 'It's Kordsa technology, both the process and product technology,' explains Ms Sabanci. Kordsa now produces 24,000 tonnes of tyre cord a year, as well as a number of other industrial fabrics including conveyor belt liners. The company uses a variety of suppliers apart from Dusa, including Allied Chemical and Hoechst. 'We are operationally quite independent,' insists Ms Sabanci when asked about the allegations of transfer pricing with the other group companies. 'Each makes its own five-year plan. We're independent and self-sustaining. However, we're never alone.' The vertical integration of related production facilities is a vital part of the Sabanci business strategy. Kordsa has a captive market in Brisa's tyre production. Equally, the more recent investment in the Du Pont joint venture provides the group with a reliability of supply in what is a fairly specialised market. On the surface, the arrangement is not that cosy. As Ms Sabanci explains: 'For example, we sell to Goodyear, Brisa's biggest competitor.' But as she is the first to admit, 'we need to protect Kordsa. We have to have a reliable supply with a reliable cost.' Kordsa's cost-cutting programme is now in its third year. Company officials estimate it has reduced costs by 25 per cent, shrinking the workforce, introducing new machinery such as the new German-built yarn twisting machine and improved team work, saving scrap material. Like many Turkish companies, Kordsa was spoilt by the low cost labour environment enjoyed in the 1980s. 'We were too relaxed,' Ms Sabanci concedes. With such high domestic borrowing costs, companies were forced to become over-capitalised. Ultimately, Kordsa's real strength lies in its export potential. Despite the collapse of the Soviet market, where the company enjoyed a growing presence, Kordsa expects to increase its export share this year, with more than half of the production now destined for overseas markets. A large slice of that will go to Iran. Mr Azizoglu estimates that 30 per cent of Kordsa's exports are for that market, although trade continues to be disrupted by Tehran's recent payments crisis, resulting in some stock build-up at the plant. However, he is realistic about being able to make up for the loss of the local demand. 'We think we can compensate for some portion, but to cover it all, that's impossible.'</p>

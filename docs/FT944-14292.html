			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Media Futures: CD-Rom move at Anglia MAI Broadcasting, owner of two ITV companies, Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television, is planning a significant move into the new media and hopes to be a large publisher of CD-Roms by next year. Anglia Multimedia has already produced two CD-Roms - one on British castles and the other The Human Body, which has been licenced to Encyclopaedia Britannica for sale in the US. Anglia is now planning to produce 13 titles by the end of the year, mainly for the educational market. and will move into the consumer market next year. By then the ITV company, famous for nature series such as Survival, hopes to be producing between 18 and 24 CD-Roms a year. 'We are concentrating on the creative and rights side. We don't want to bet on any particular hardware architecture,' says Ajay Chowdhury, director of new media at MAI Broadcasting. The initiative is being backed by Lord Hollick, the MAI chief executive, who has installed a CD-Rom computer in his office. Anglia, which is believed to be the first ITV company directly to produce CD-Roms, is planning titles in co-operation with English Heritage, the National Maritime Museum and other organisations. It also plans to exploit its own programme library to produce CD-Roms on nature, using the Survival catalogue. Peter Stibbons, an Anglia media development executive, believes the TV background is vital in producing CD-Roms, for both education and the consumer market. Apart from exploiting the programme library, Anglia is now looking at CD-Rom potential when producing new programmes, so that any additional material can be shot at the same time. Anglia is also involved in producing interactive 'real time' cartoons for TV, in particular a cartoon character called Ratz, whose behaviour can be influenced by children calling in to the programme. Perhaps the most potentially dramatic Anglia initiative, however, is as part of an experiment which has already begun on Cambridge Cable in Anglia's transmission area. This project involves offering a wide range of on-demand services, including home shopping and banking, and allowing viewers to chose the time they want to watch the evenings scheduled programmes. The consortium, which includes Anglia, Online Media, a subsidiary of Acorn Computers and ATM, providers of the video servers which deliver programming, is already available to 10 cable subscribers. The number will be increased to 250 next year.</p>

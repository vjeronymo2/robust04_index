			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Argentina stays in spotlight with two more launches TWO companies yesterday maintained the high profile of Argentina in the international bond market by launching Eurodollar transactions. The issues, for Telefonica Argentina and Banco de Credito Argentina, follow hard on the heels of a Dollars 200m deal for Argentina Telecom launched last Friday. Acindar, a steel company, is expected to launch a Dollars 100m deal soon. The spate of issues follows approval by the CNV, the Argentine regulator. Borrowers are also keen to launch issues before the end of July and the start of the holiday season in the US and European markets. Telefonica Argentina yesterday raised Dollars 100m over three years through a deal lead-managed by Lehman Brothers International. The bonds pay an 8 per cent semi-annual coupon and were re-offered to investors at par. At this level the yield is 328 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. The borrower is a monopoly provider of telecommunications in southern Argentina and the business areas of Buenos Aires. On Friday, Argentina Telecom, which supplies the north of the country, raised Dollars 200m five-year funding at a yield spread of 345 basis points. Banco de Credito launched a Dollars 75m two-year issue, with a put option after one year, via Citicorp Investment Bank. The yield spread was far wider at 545 basis points, reflecting the weaker credit quality of the issuer. From an issue price of 98.666, the bonds were quoted at 98.875 bid by late afternoon. Participants in both issues reported smooth placement underpinned by demand from retail investors. Earlier this month, accusations of corruption against Mr Collor de Mello, Brazil's president, and weak stock markets in the region caused most new issue plans to be shelved. While the Collor scandal remains unsolved, Brazil has since agreed a debt restructuring package with its commercial bank creditors. Last week, Argentina's credit rating was raised by two notches to B1 by Moody's Investors Service. While the mood among investors is now more positive, bringing issues for Latin American borrowers can still be difficult. Banco de Chile's planned Dollars 75m issue via Bankers Trust, the first by a Chilean borrower, has been postponed beyond this week. Sources said negotiations between the issuer and the Chilean authorities were slowing the progress of the deal. In the mainstream of the international bond market, potential issuers were detered by the uncertain tone of European bond markets. General Electric Capital launched a Dollars 150m four-year deal, lead-managed by ScotiaMcLeod. The 6 1/2 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.55, for a yield of 6.63 per cent. The lead manager said the deal was priced to yield 43 basis points more than a new Canadian government bond which also carries a 1996 maturity date. However, other participants in the deal claimed the spread was as low as 15 basis points over the government bond yield curve. Following a sharp rally in the Canadian market in recent weeks there are few outstanding issues trading below par. For example, an outstanding GECC issue maturing 1996 was trading at 110 per cent of face value.</p>

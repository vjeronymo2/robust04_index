Sea-Based Missiles Also Are Launchable From Aircraft"]    [Text] All modern Russian ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with  which navy submarines have been outfitted have been constructed  at the state missile center Design Bureau imeni V. P. Makeyev  (Miass). With the reduction of strategic arms good possibilities  are being afforded for the transformation of military into  commercial carriers. The bureau has proposed two fields for use  of naval submarines for putting peaceful research or  technological satellites into space or into the upper layers of  the atmosphere.    The Priboy project (BMN N 39) was oriented on the launching  of missiles from the sea surface. The Aerokosmos project  proposes that heavy aircraft, especially the An-124 "Ruslan,"  and in the future, the An-225 "Mriya," be used as launch pads.  The rocket engine (it is proposed that reoutfitted SS-N-23 and  SS-N-20 engines be used) is fired only after the launch pad,  together with a parachute system, descends from the aircraft to  an altitude of about 12 km. The launches can be made at a  distance up to 4000 km from airfields (superclass or first  class).    Despite such different launch methods the Priboy and  Aerokosmos projects combine a high operability, mobility and  total autonomy. They do not require a cosmodrome and these means  that there is no need for alienating extensive areas beneath the  zone of falling of spent stages.    An extremely important circumstance is that an object can be  attached to a rocket on vessels or aircraft directly at the  bases of the client (in some cases this will help in avoiding  COCOM restrictions).    As reported by Rem Kanin, head of the KBM laboratory, the  commercial operation of the Aerokosmos system will presumably  begin in 1996-1997. The Shtil-3A (SS-N-23) rocket can be put  into an equatorial orbit with an altitude from 200 to 700 km  with a payload 730-950 kg.    BMN: The AO Aerokosmos (founders -- State Rocket Center  Design Bureau imeni V. P. Makeyev and the Chelyabinsk  association Tekhnopolis) was established for realization of the  project. The association RAM-KON, AO Volga-Dnepr and a number of  design bureaus and scientific research institutes participating  in the reoutfitting of SLBM intend to take part in the project.

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Observer: Peer pressure Say what you will about Sir John Banham, the former director general of the CBI, he keeps rattling the establishment cage. His criticisms of the way Britain is run in his new book, Anatomy of Change, will not endear him to Whitehall mandarins, and he has not made his chairmanship of the Local Government Commission any easier by highlighting the Government's own inability to make up its mind. Given that Sir John has just added the chairmanship of Tarmac to his growing portfolio of directorships, he could be forgiven for wanting to lighten his load of public duties in order to concentrate on his business career. However, Sir John's job of reviewing local government is only halfway through and he insists he has every intention of staying on until the task is finished in about a year's time. That sort of devotion to public duty is surely worth a peerage. Will it be Lord Banham of Avon, covering Gloucestershire, Somerset and Bristol, or Lord Banham of Centrepoint?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli </F> Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres with domestic and foreign  correspondents at the Parliament Hall in Bucharest -- live;  'Arafat and Peres speak in English with simultaneous translation  into Romanian]    [Text] [Announcer] The news conference is starting. From  my position here, I can see Mr. Ion Iliescu, PLO Leader Yasir  'Arafat, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and Mr. Viorel  Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the Romanian Government, taking  their seats in the Presidium.    [Unidentified correspondent] [words indistinct] the  Bucharest talks, and whether you fixed a deadline for the  signing of a future agreement.    ['Arafat] We are still continuing our negotiations and it  seems that, this evening, we will continue these talks, thanks  to the president's kindness. We hope to unite all the bridges  of understanding and solve the differences between us. I am  sure of that, particularly in view of the goodwill shown by Mr.  Peres, and we will make progress in the peace process.    [Manea] Magdalena Manea of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. Mr. 'Arafat,  Mr. Peres, would you say that there are similarities between the  conflict in Bosnia, former Yugoslavia, and the current conflict  in your region? Are you maybe waiting for the Bosnian conflict  to be resolved first?    ['Arafat] Definitely we are eager to see the Bosnian  conflict resolved. I do not like to call it Bosnian, I would  like to call it a part of the Balkanization process. This is  not the first time that a Balkanization is going on in this  region, after World War I and World War II. Therefore, here we  are faced with a third kind of war, a hot and cold war. We are  doing all our best to find a solution to this conflict.  Actually, I do not like to call it conflict. After all, can  there be a conflict among brothers?    [Peres] I do not know enough about the conflict in  Yugoslavia, but Tolstoy said that all happy families are happy  when they are alive. If they are unhappy, they can be unhappy  in different ways. Consequently, Yugoslavia's unhappiness is  different from the unhappiness prevailing in the Middle East.  In Yugoslavia, you had an aggressor and a victim, while in the  Middle East, you have two negotiators striving to end this  conflict.    ['Arafat] If you will permit to butt in, I have good  relations with all the sides and I am doing all my best for a  solution, without propaganda. I am trying to do all my best,  but without too much fuss. This is my mission.    [Iliescu] The conflict in Bosnia has [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] AFP. There are rumors that Rabin and 'Arafat  will sign an accord around 3-4 May. Can you confirm that you  have reached an agreement with Mr. 'Arafat in this respect? Can  you specify the day when the aforementioned accord will be  signed? The question has already been put to you, I believe.    [Peres] I believe that Chairman 'Arafat has already said  that we will try to find the time for further consultations  tonight. I do not think that we can announce a date in this  respect. First of all, we would like to be very sure in this  respect. Any deadline should be observed, consequently, we  should properly prepare the latest chapter of our negotiations.    [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to ask both Mr.  'Arafat and Mr. Peres whether they have made any headway during  their talks in Bucharest and what are the specific fields where  progress was made? And a second question -- what, in your  opinion, are the most difficult obstacles to overcome in  connection with the agreement signed in Washington?    [Peres] Well, we have the following problems. One has to do  with the present schedule for the withdrawal, since there will  be an overlapping period. We do not know exactly how to solve  these parallelisms. In the meantime, we will hand over the  administration and security to the Palestinian side and we are  trying to resolve this in the most pragmatic possible way. As  far as I am concerned, I have learned from Mr. 'Arafat about his  priorities and we will obviously take his feelings and  preferences into consideration and try to satisfy them.    [Unidentified correspondent] I have two questions for Mr.  Peres. The communist regime has made that today's Romania  should be the country of (?immigration) [words indistinct]. How  do you see the further evolution of the Jewish community in our  country? [words indistinct] The second question: What is the  Israeli Government's policy regarding the issue of the Jewish  assets confiscated by the (?communist) regime?    [Peres] Well, to answer the first question, each Jew has the  right to say where he wants to live, here or in Israel. We are  very glad that 400,000 Jews had the possibility to emigrate to  Israel. We are grateful to the Romanian people for enabling this  emigration and I told Romania's president that Romania has made  an investment of friendship in Israel, where there is a  sentiment of friendship toward Romania. Both the Romanian side  and we ourselves share the same sentiments. If there are still  some 60,000 Jews left in Romania, the majority of them are  elderly people and I am convinced that the Romanian Government  -- and I hope the Romanian people, too -- will consider them as  equal citizens, without antisemitic sentiments. On the issue of  compensations, I believe that the Jewish agency will negotiate  this matter and will solve it.    [Correspondent] JOURNAL DE GENEVE. Chairman 'Arafat, what  is stage of the installation of the PLO administration in the  respective territories and of the preparations for the  forthcoming arrival of individuals and authorities from the  Palestinian diaspora in Gaza and Jericho?    ['Arafat] It is very difficult to give an answer to this  question, because it a lot depends on Israel, in this respect.  When they withdraw, we will start the takeover process. Hence,  the need for this overlapping period of taking over and giving  up certain prerogatives, after which the police force will have  to intervene, in the presence of certain international bodies.  I hope, that if I have the opportunity, I will go there myself.    [Jaganaru] Ana Juganaru from the JURNAL NATIONAL. I have a  question for Chairman 'Arafat. Can a final agreement be reached  without the consultation of Syria and Jordan? I also have  another question for Foreign Minister Peres. Can the Israeli  Government return the territories without the approval of the  Knesset or a plebiscite?    ['Arafat] I see that you are worried about the approval of  our brothers, the Syrians. We have contacts with all our  brothers in the Arab world and they are present even here, at  this conference. We are coordinating all our actions with the  Arab League.    [Peres] As a matter of fact, Prime Minister Rabin submitted  these agreements to the Knesset and the Knesset approved them.  Therefore, we were empowered by the Knesset to continue our  efforts and implement these agreements. Therefore, you should  not be worried about this. The Knesset has already endorsed  them.    [Dumitrescu] Rodica Dumitrescu. Will Mr. 'Arafat leave  Romania this evening, tonight, or tomorrow morning?    ['Arafat] I see that you would like to know the exact date.  I am sorry, but I cannot give you the list of my appointments.  I like this friendly country and people and, for the sake of  his excellency, I would like to sojourn here as long as  possible, but then, as you probably know, I have a lot of other  things to do.    [Duma] Mircea Duma from CATAVENCU ACADEMY. I just want to  make an announcement. According to our information, Mr. 'Arafat  left the country last night. [laughter, applause]    [Ionescu] Victor Ionescu from Romanian Television. Mr.  Peres, Mr. 'Arafat, if you were the counselor of the other side  in the current stage of your negotiations, what advice would you  give to the other? If you were Mr. 'Arafat's counselor, for  instance, what advice would you give him? And the other way  round.    [Peres] Well, I would advise him to accept the Israeli  proposals. [laughter] Actually, we have to find the common  ground. I would like to give you a serious answer. There is an  Israeli opposition and a Palestinian opposition to this process  and our task is not to force the Palestinians to accept our  views or the Palestinians the oblige us to accept their views.  We are striving to find common ground that is acceptable to  both sides.    ['Arafat] The most important thing is to reach a conclusion  and an agreement between the two sides. To be an adviser of one  or the other side, well, I hope that in either case I would hope  that an urgent withdrawal takes place, as well as a quick  implementation of the already signed accords.    [Peres] As far as Israel is concern, we would like to leave  Gaza and never go back there again. We are extremely serious,  and I would like to express my hope and desire that this plan  becomes a successful reality and that Chairman 'Arafat can  accomplish that.    [Hudginson] Chris Hudginson from THE NEW YORK TIMES. I would  like to ask Chairman 'Arafat, now that the withdrawal has been  delayed so much, once the agreement is finalized, how long do  you think the Israelis will remain in Gaza and Jericho? [words  indistinct] What are the main points which are still hampering  the progress of the agreements?    ['Arafat] If there is a will, there is a way. This is the  most important thing. If there is an agreement, time will not  be an obstacle. We have many experiences from the past. Well,  it should not take longer than a few days. I was told this  clearly by the generals that accompanied Mr. Peres at the latest  meetings and talks in Davos, Oslo, and Cairo.    [Hudginson] Mr. Chairman, what do you find most frustrating?  You have said many times that you are ready, you are ready to  go in, but the talks were still delayed and people are talking  about another two weeks. What is most frustrating in the  negotiations with the Israelis?    ['Arafat] It is very difficult to give you such details when  we are in the middle of negotiations. I think that the actions  will speak for themselves.    [Text] [Martalogu] Victor Martalogu of ROMPRES. My  question is also directed to the two distinguished guests. Two  years ago, in 1991, at the time when the declaration of  principle was signed in Washington, the press in Romania and in  other countries referred to Romania as the major, unjustified  absentee. Now, at the Crans Montana Forum conference, a forum  that generally and primarily approaches economic issues in  democracies that are undergoing the process of transition, the  issue of Middle East comes up and the officials involved in it  are invited to Bucharest. Do you see or do you admit that there  is a connection between Romania's role of mediator -- which has  not always been recognized -- 5-6 years ago and the current  situation, and do you see the possibility that Romania will  receive a more active role in this process?    [Iliescu] I believe that any country that can (?relaunch)  contacts and negotiations is welcome to do so. We could also  see it in a more distant past. Even a small country with  limited potential such as Romania, but which has the advantage  to maintain normal and open relations with Arab countries and  with Israel, could at the respective time facilitate such  contacts. More recently, a country such as Norway offered to  host the negotiations and talks between the two sides, which  resulted in the Washington accord. Today's example, the  opportunity given by the Crans Montana Forum, shows that if it  is based on good will -- and this good will was shown by the  representatives of the two sides -- this opportunity can be used  to support the positive progress of contacts. Thus, Romania is  open to offer all kinds of such support for the continuation of  dialogue and the promotion of the peace process.    [Unidentified correspondent] Actually I am....[pauses]  Okay, I think I have the possibility of asking two questions.  My name is [words indistinct] and I am the editor of a  Palestinian newspaper published in Jerusalem. First I want to  ask President 'Arafat a question in connection with his recent  trip to Moscow and Eastern European countries. We are currently  noticing a new development in relations between Palestinians and  Eastern Europe. We hope that this new development will lead to  positive results both in the political and peace process and in  the economic relations that we hope to establish between Eastern  Europe and the future Palestinian state. We hope that  Romania... and this is a question for Romania's president, is  there going to be a development of economic relations as well as  commercial relations between Palestine and Romania? Now a  question for Mr. Peres: We are now seeing two important  economic conferences. There are high hopes of progress for the  implementation of the Oslo Agreement. These high hopes were  dashed at the Davos meeting. I would like to ask you which are  the problems that have been left for the last chapter, as you  call it, to be discussed and how long will it take until these  issues are solved? Then, there is the question of land and  territories. According to the peace process, a new check point  is being built at the moment between Jericho and the rest of the  West Bank. According to the time table, the Palestinian  authority will be established within six months in the rest of  the West Bank. Are we going to face the same problems or are we  going to move faster in the future?    [Peres] Both sides made very serious efforts for progress.  It is possible that we are going to conclude the negotiations  with a two to three week delay, but do not forget that we have  to take into account the complex nature of problems that we are  facing and certain unfortunate events. And I want to say, on  behalf of my government, that any victim on the Palestinian side  is considered by us with the same pain as any victim on our  side. An end should be put to this. Extremists should not stop  the peace process and I have the impression that we are very  close to the beginning of new relations. There are many issues,  but many of them are of a technical nature and some of them are  of issues of principle and, as Mr. 'Arafat said, we do not want  to hold negotiations in the open but behind closed doors and on  friendly terms. Thus, about the continuation of negotiations,  to answer your question, there will be two continuations. One,  the so-called early empowerment, namely turning the  responsibility in many areas over to the Palestinian authorities  in the Gaza strip. This will be done in the same framework in  which we negotiate the overall Gaza-Jericho arrangement.  Parallel, we will open negotiations soon, we hope, in  Washington to conclude this problem of authority. I believe  that the presidents who helped a great deal will also help in  accelerating the talks within these negotiations. Because it  has been very difficult for both sides to pave the way for  something Chairman 'Arafat said was unprecedented, and I know  that many of our Palestinian friends are concerned in their  hearts that we are delaying things. But it is not so. I want  to tell you that we know each other from Jerusalem and Israel,  and I would like to tell you very openly that our government is  determined to conclude the negotiations and to respect the  Palestinian decisions represented by Chairman 'Arafat, namely to  depart from declarations and confrontation and to proceed to the  world of reality. Thus I am indeed convinced that Chairman  'Arafat will be the first Palestinian leader who will bring home  not a declaration, not simply a gesture, but real peace,  authority, and solutions in geographic terms in all of the  Middle East. We are going to work together and I also  appreciate the expression Chairman 'Arafat made this afternoon,  which is normal, namely we said farewell to the use of guns,  terror, violence, and war and we are going to negotiate only for  the future, as we also convened in Oslo, through diplomatic  means.    ['Arafat] We should not forget that Russia is one of the  cosponsors of this accord. We have very good relations with  them. We have had a joint committee and a standing bureau since  we participated in the Madrid conference, and they are still  functioning now. We had very positive and constructive talks  with President Yeltsin two days ago. They promised to continue  their efforts aimed at giving an impetus to the peace process.  Regarding my visit here, you should not forget that I am an old  visitor to this country, this is not the first time I am here.  I have had a very long-standing relationship with the  president, from the times when we were both students, in 1956.  Can you imagine that? He was the boss. I was not the boss, he  was [as heard]. We have to thank His Excellency for his  coordination and cooperation, not only in bringing me and Mr.  Peres together for continuing our peace efforts, but also in  promoting multilateral ties among us at all levels. We have  very many students here. We are looking forward to further  developing our economic relations. We are hoping to receive  assistance in our country's reconstruction.    [Iliescu] In this respect, I would like to add that, in my  talks with Chairman 'Arafat, we tackled this issue of  reconstruction, the problem of infrastructure, and the  participation of Romanian companies in this process. Apropos  our cooperation, we also have very good ties with Israel, and  this joint cooperation can be a good example of joint  participation in the reconstruction efforts, to the benefit of  all sides.    [Unidentified correspondent] Israeli Radio-Television. I  would like to put a question to Mr. 'Arafat. Do you share Mr.  Peres' assessment that the negotiations will conclude in two to  three weeks? And a second question. Do you believe that the  latest news from Cairo is good and satisfactory? Do you have  anything positive to say in connection with the latest news from  Cairo and the developments of recent days? Would you say that  the situation is good, or rather bad?    ['Arafat] We hope, but I do not have concrete information  about what happened today in Cairo. What I was told is that the  talks were suspended this afternoon, to be resumed next Sunday.  We hope that we will have some concrete results in the  following week. Likewise, we can say that we hope to have a  final agreement. We hope so.    [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the news conference is  over.</p>

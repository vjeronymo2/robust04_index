			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Karamay, China's oldest  oilfield, which in the 1970s seemed to be declining, has found a  new lease of life.    In the past dozen years, many new oil deposits have been  discovered there and new oil-extraction techniques have been  developed, so that now the oilfield again radiates the vigor of  youth.    For several years running, the oilfield's annual crude oil  output has showed a yearly average increase of 300,000 tons.  Last year, the oilfield produced 7.6 million tons of crude oil.  For the past four years its output has been the fourth largest  in China.    Karamay oilfield was established at a deserted place -- with  no grass, water or even a bird -- in the north-west part of the  Junggar Basin in north-west China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region. Its first well started to produce crude oil on October  29, 1955.    The annual output of the oilfield reached 1.6 million tons  in  1960. But by the mid 1970s the oil output started to drop and  no new deposits had been found. The oilfield was thought to be  declining. The people in Karamay were worried about their  future.    When the Chinese Central Government started to adopt the  policy of reform and opening to the world in 1979, the people at  the Karamay oilfield were greatly encouraged. They launched a  drive to tap the potential of the old area of the oilfield and  open up new parts.    Karamay is rich in reserves of heavy oil. Since the oil seam  is close to the surface, the light elements and gases of the oil  had volatilized long ago. So the oil looks like asphalt and is  difficult to extract.    In the light of advanced foreign and domestic technology,  technical personnel at Karamay oilfield overcame a series of  difficulties and succeeded in extracting the oil by injecting  vapour into the oil below ground. As a result, the oilfield's  output of heavy oil increased greatly and has stabilized at 1.5  million tons annually for three consecutive years.    The technicians also used the latest technology to  re-analyze  the prospecting data of the old area of the oilfield,  discovering three layers of oil deposits in the strata above and  below the old oil- bearing stratum, thus paving the way for  increasing the oil output in the old area.    The oil experts and technicians, using advanced prospecting  technology and equipment, discovered and opened up several new  oil-bearing areas, including the Fengchen, Xiazejie, Dongpaizi,  Maozhuang and Huoshaoshan oilfields. The oil output of the new  oilfields has surpassed one million tons a year.    As its oil output increases, Karamay has also developed its  own oil-processing industries. The oilfield is now capable of  refining 5.45 million tons of crude oil per year and producing  over 190 oil products, 39 of which meet international standards.  More than 20 of them are exported to Japan, the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea and many countries and regions in  South-East Asia.    A plant to produce 140,000 tons of ethylene annually is now  being built, due to be completed next year. Experts noted that  with completion of the project, Karamay will again enter a  golden age, both in oil production and oil refining.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and DOE has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, DOE may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, DOE advances cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the recipient's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, DOE reimburses the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment will not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, DOE will not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or DOE reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States. Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before withholding any payment, DOE shall notify the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date, which shall ordinarily be no sooner than 30 days from the date of the notice, until the recipient corrects the noncompliance or pays the indebtedness to the Federal government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, DOE shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients are encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. The address is the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this Subpart, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF&hyph;270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF&hyph;271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) SF&hyph;271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF&hyph;271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF&hyph;270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> THUMBS-DOWN FOR LEFT HAND  </P> <P> Lefties are by far in a minority even before they are born, a study of  thumb-sucking by fetuses suggests.  </P> <P> Researchers using ultrasound examinations found that only 12 of 224 fetuses  preferred to suck their left thumb. The 212 others favored their right thumb.  </P> <P> The study found that the position of the fetus did not affect thumb preference.  Repeated observations of 17 fetuses found that preference for a particular  thumb continued through pregnancy, the researchers said.  </P> <P> The scientists, from Queen's University of Belfast in Northern Ireland,  reported their findings in a letter to the editor in Thursday's issue of the  British journal Nature.  </P></p>

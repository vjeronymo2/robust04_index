			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Observer: Democrats can spare a dime Out of all the lies and half-truths flying around Houston's Republican convention, one political myth can be laid to rest. The Republicans, not the Democrats, are the real poor folk. There are three Democrat millionaires for every Republican, according to a recent survey of senators' wealth in Washington's Roll Call newspaper. Even after adjusting for the Democrats' Senate majority, it is more than twice as likely that a Democrat senator will be a millionaire, than his Republican opponent. It is partly explained by the fact that some Democrats come from formidable political dynasties, such as the Kennedys and Rockefellers. Indeed, Chuck Robb - hubby of Lynda Bird Johnson (daughter of LBJ) - tops the millionaires' club with a Dollars 19.5m fortune. However, self-made men like defence guru Sam Nunn and Lloyd Bentsen, the former vice-presidential nominee, have made it into the Democrats' millionaires' club. Amongst the Republicans, former presidential contender Bob Dole is perhaps best-known. But amid all this conspicuous wealth - more than one in four senators is a millionaire - there are still some poor Democrats. Joe Biden, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, has a negative net worth of Dollars 170,000, and sank deeper into the red last year. No wonder he had to plagiarise Neil Kinnock. Obviously, he couldn't afford his own speech writer.</p>

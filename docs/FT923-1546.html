			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: YSL turns in sharp fall midway YVES Saint Laurent (YSL), one of the most famous Paris fashion houses, suffered a sharp fall in net profits from FFr41m in the first half of 1991 to FFr2.6m (Dollars 506,000) in the same period this year, reflecting the depressed state of the global luxury goods market. The company stressed that the first half was traditionally the slackest part of its year, given that the bulk of its perfume sales were made during the Christmas season. However YSL, like its rivals, had also been hit by the economic instability of Japan and North America, and by the slowdown in western Europe. Turnover rose by 6.8 per cent to FFr1.39bn during the interim period due to the contribution of the new YSL skin care range. However the cost of marketing the range - in an advertising campaign devised by Jean-Paul Mondino, a leading stylist - eroded operating profits, which fell from FFr130.6m to FFr94.9m. The skin care range is expected to make a positive contribution to profits from next year onwards. The group, plans in late 1993 to launch a new women's scent.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Foreign entrants to Italian retail market will need to seek partner Sir, Neil Buckley's article, 'Retailers' global shopping spree' (October 13), cited Italy as one of the 'tough three' markets. We can confirm that it is 'tough', especially for foreigners. It is changing rapidly, but 'a l'Italienne'. We have made four large studies of food retailing in Italy - the first in 1980 when the balance of power was firmly with producers and their problem was physical distribution costs in serving the large market. Those of 1987 and 1989 showed some increasing retailer toughness, but multinational producers still got 20-30 per cent higher prices for their grocery products in Italy than in France or Germany due to the semi-collusive relationship with retailers to maintain high prices. Our new study, just published, shows that, while pending legislative changes will probably allow the big to get bigger, the basic objective of large Italian retailers is to keep out any large foreign invasion (as in Spain) and ensure foreign entrants come in via a partner (for example, franchising) or on a joint venture basis. There are examples of acquisition by Carrefour and Tengelmann, but the candidates are small and individually give little position. Auchan has been trying to start from scratch in Italy and has hardly made any progress, mainly due to bureaucratic obstruction. Foreign discount chains with small units are making some progress because of the lower threat to local interests. The Coop is the largest retailer in Italy and voluntary chains and buying groups have a strong presence. The integrated 'five sisters' (Rinascentre, Standa, GS, Esselunga and Pam), plus the Coop, currently only hold 21 per cent of grocery food sales. We forecast, however, that the top five groups (all categories) will hold 40 per cent in 2000. Producers are meeting growing demands for discounts, longer delays in payments, increased publicity costs, and tougher logistics requirements, while private label is starting to gain momentum. While Italian retailing is concentrating, potential foreign retailer entrants, to be successful, will have to find a suitable Italian partner. It is not for nothing that in the cold-war days Italians boasted they would have converted invading Russian soldiers into Italians in 12 months.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 May (MENA)--The Swiss Government has  decided to write off 150 million Swiss francs--230 million  Egyptian pounds--of Egypt's debts to Switzerland.    Dr. Yusuf Butrus-Ghali, minister of state for international  cooperation, made this statement today after a meeting with Mr.  Kelin Berger, Swiss minister of state for foreign affairs [name  and title as received].    Dr. Butrus-Ghali said the terms of the agreement included  spending the equivalent of this amount on development projects  to create additional job opportunities, and to develop projects  that would contribute toward decreasing the burden of economic  reform on the low-income sector.</p>

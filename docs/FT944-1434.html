			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: IMI sells first phase of Holford estate IMI, the engineering group, is selling the completed first phase of its Holford industrial and warehousing estate in Birmingham to Rodamco, the Dutch group, for Pounds 25m. The Holford estate is on land owned by IMI near Spaghetti Junction on the M6 motorway. It has been producing rental income of Pounds 2.5m a year and was valued in the last accounts at Pounds 23m. IMI has extensive holdings of land which are no longer required for group operations. 'The Holford estate has never been a core part of IMI,' said Mr Alan Emson, finance director. 'The market place for this type of development has improved.' There has been a steady demand for distribution properties on sites near motorway junctions in the Midlands and numerous projects have emerged to compete with established developments like Holford. The phase being sold to Rodamco cost Pounds 16.5m to develop. Phase two of the estate thus far involves just one building  - an office block for Birmingham Cable.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Single telecoms regulator call Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications, will call tonight for a single EU telecommunications regulator in a move set to intensify the debate on the future role of Brussels in a liberalised telecoms industry. Acknowledging 'ideological' objections to an increase in EU regulatory powers, Sir Iain claims that it is nonetheless 'difficult to see' how any other regime could ensure fair telecoms competition across the EU. The call comes at a critical stage in the EU telecoms liberalisation process. The Corfu heads of government summit last month agreed to an acceleration in the pace of telecommunications liberalisation, in particular by opening infrastructure to competition, instead of services alone as previously agreed. In his speech to the European Policy Forum, Sir Iain says: 'a level playing field requires a pan-European regulatory regime, properly enforced by a well-balanced, pan-European regulator.' Sir Iain's remarks reflect BT's ambitions to compete with established national operators - still mostly monopolies - on the mainland. A year ago it forged a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.39bn) alliance with MCI of the US to offer one-stop services to multinationals, the first challenge to existing European operators in their own markets.</p>

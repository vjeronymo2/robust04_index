			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PLACE FOR BEETHOVEN  </P> <P> Almost 25 years ago when the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra moved to the  Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from its old hall at Fifth and Olive, it left behind  in the north end of adjacent Pershing Square the statue of Ludwig van  Beethoven.  </P> <P> Sculpted by A. Foerster and dedicated to William Andrews Clark Jr., founder of  the Los Angeles Philharmonic, it was erected by the personnel of the orchestra  and presented to the people of Los Angeles in 1932.  </P> <P> The statue of this most famous and respected composer deserves a place of  honor, not in a square named for a military general but rather at the Los  Angeles County Music Center.  </P> <P> Now the Philharmonic will move into the Walt Disney Hall, to be constructed in  the Music Center complex. Surely the Disney Hall committee will now seize the  opportunity to relocate the Beethoven statue to the grounds of the facility.  </P> <P> ROBIN RITCHIE, Downey  </P></p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / L'affaire Lindros puts Canada's language differences on the ice: The athlete who snubbed francophone Quebec ERIC LINDROS is one of North America's finest up-and-coming athletes. Named by the New York Times as the sportsman to watch in 1992, the lanky 18-year old Canadian ice-hockey player is already being compared to the legendary Wayne Gretzky, 12 years his senior. Unfortunately, Canadian politics and the peculiar way ice hockey does business have thrown a cloud over Lindros's career. Every hockey buff (and many others too) seems to have a view on whether Eric is a spoilt brat or an astute businessman, a small-town bigot or a normal teenager who just wants to feel at home in the place where he earns a living. In francophone Quebec, 'l'affaire Lindros' has little to do with No 88's skills on the ice. The refusal by an English-speaking Ontario boy to play for a team in French-speaking Quebec City has become a cause celebre reflecting the ethnic prejudice many of Quebec's 5m francophones detect in anglophone Canada. Feelings are running so high that several Quebec members of parliament want Lindros barred from Canada's team to the 1992 winter Olympics. Even prime minister Brian Mulroney has been drawn in, trying to smooth French-Canadian feathers by singing the praises of Quebec City. The Lindros affair has also put a spotlight on the cartel-like National Hockey League, in which team owners decide among themselves on the rules for selecting rising players. 'Everyone has the right to work where they want to work,' Lindros told a Canadian magazine recently. 'The old way has got to change.' Under NHL rules, the bottom team at the end of the season gets first choice in the following year's 'draft', where new players are distributed among the 22 teams. The system is designed to even out talent and prevent wealthy owners in cities such as New York and Montreal buying up all the best players. To no one's surprise, the laggards of the 1990/91 season, the Quebec Nordiques, pounced on Lindros at last June's draft. But Lindros and his ambitious parents had already made it clear that, if called, he would not serve. When the Nordiques' pick was announced in front of the TV cameras, Lindros pointedly turned his back on the tradition of donning a team jersey. At first, the reason the Lindroses gave was money. The deal Quebec offered, reportedly worth between CDollars 30m (Dollars 26.3m) and CDollars 50m over 10 years, was not generous enough. Playing for a mediocre team from a smallish city in French-speaking Quebec, the Lindroses reasoned, would limit Eric's income from advertising contracts and sponsorships. The fuss might have died down had the Lindroses then not made some indiscreet remarks about Quebec politics, and how difficult life would be in Quebec City for a monolingual teenager from Oshawa. 'He'd be living in a community that's an emotional time bomb,' Lindros senior told the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail recently, referring to the debate on Quebec separatism. Lindros and his supporters are urging the Nordiques to trade him to a team more to his liking. The Nordiques could probably pick up several first-rate players in exchange. But under NHL rules the team owns the rights to its draft choice for another two years. It initially took a hard line, hoping that Lindros might change his mind and help revive its flagging fortunes. Mr Jamie Wayne, a Toronto sportswriter, notes that 'he's the sort of asset any team waits a lifetime to get'. The Nordiques have, however, lately reconciled themselves to Lindros never putting on their jersey. In early January the team's general manager said he was willing to consider offers from other clubs for the young superstar-to-be. For the time being, Lindros remains with the Oshawa Generals, an amateur team from the gritty industrial city east of Toronto where General Motors' Canadian subsidiary has its head office. But he has already signed advertising contracts worth at least half a million dollars.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Democratic Party of the Left </F> Conference on Justice"]    [Text] Rome, 12 Feb (ANSA) -- The problems of the  administration of justice in Italy and the need for reform were  cited today as an essential premise for the political and  institutional renewal the nation so sorely needs in a message  sent to the conference, "Ideas for a Justice Program", by the  head of the Democratic Party of the Left, Achille Occhetto.    In his statement for the conference, sponsored by the  dominant party of the left, Occhetto said his party's platform  for the March 27 general elections includes a commitment to  "guarantee the independence" of the nation's judiciary and  individual magistrates and "the speedy and efficient working of  the justice administration."    Against the backdrop of the sweeping business and political  corruption investigations which toppled the old political order,  discussion here ranged over the latest developments in these  probes and the prospect of applying "a political solution" to  heal the myriad wounds opened by investigators and the courts  and on to the issue of magistrates as candidates for election.    Opening the assembly, Senator Massimo Brutti took up the  sensitive "political solution" issue and called for speeding up  procedures to bring these cases to trial. On the prospect of  extending the use of plea bargaining, the senator said a limit  would have to be set on the enlargement of this practice and  that plea bargaining should not lead to preferential treatment  for crimes committed against the public administration.    Taking a broader view of the justice administration, Brutti,  who heads the Democratic Party of the Left justice office,  proposed "innovative measures" to apply to the criminal justice  system in the near future: the establishment of "district  courts" to handle Mafia trials; allowing appeals court justices  to sit on the bench at lower court hearings; reducing the number  of judges hearing criminal cases from three to one, expect for  "district court" trials. This latter step, said the senator,  would immediately free from 600 to 700 judges to begin attacking  colossal backlogs.    Among the recent developments in Milan's Clean Hands  investigations under scrutiny here were the arrest yesterday of  businessman Paolo Berlusconi, the brother of entrepreneur Silvio  Berlusconi who is now a political powerhouse at the helm of his  Forza Italia (Go Italy) center-right movement, and the naming of  Massimo D'Alema, Occhetto's deputy at the Democratic Party of  the Left, as the alleged recipient of a kickback.    Senator Cesare Salvi, a member of the party leadership, said  on the Berlusconi case, "It would not be correct to comment if  one doesn't know the briefs." He went on to urge the political  parties, coalitions, movements and groupings heading into the  March vote to refrain from using the findings of investigators  in their campaigns and called on the magistrates "to be very  careful and cautious."    In comment on Tiziana Parenti, a Milan assistant public  prosecutor who broke with the Clean Hands team last year and is  now a Forza Italia candidate for parliament, Salvi noted that  she, "like all other citizens, has a right to run" but added the  caveat, "It is not right to use notoriety gained in  investigations and trials."    On the advisory warrant issued yesterday to inform Giovanni  De Piccoli, a member of the European Parliament for the  Democratic Party of the Left, that he is under investigation,  Brutti told reporters on the sidelines that he could not comment  because he had not been informed of the "text of the measure."  The senator also said he was skeptical about the allegation  levelled against D'Alema. He said he had "serious doubts" about  the entire affair because D'Alema is a front-rank political  figure who has never been close to the procedures cited. He  also dismissed the notion of "a faction led by Massimo D'Alema"  as pure fantasy. This faction, according to the jailed former  deputy chairman of a Fiat group construction company, Cogefar  Impresit's Antonio Mosconi, received an illegal political party  contribution.</p>

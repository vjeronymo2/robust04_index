			<p>BFN     [Text] The former speaker of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet,  Ivan Plyushch, has the biggest chance to win the 1994  presidential elections in the republic, the former prime  minister, leader of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms (IBR),  Leonid Kuchma, told a news conference in Kiev Tuesday. In his  opinion, Plyushch "is holding all power in Ukraine."    Asked about the possibility of the new parliament's  cancelling the presidential elections scheduled for June 26  1994, Kuchma noted: "It would be desirable if we started to  respect laws we have passed." In his opinion, the new  parliament should not start its work with cancelling decisions  made by its predecessor.    Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has been insisting on  cancelling the previous parliament's decision to hold the  presidential elections on June 26.    At the same time, Kuchma said he saw postponing the  elections  as no tragedy. The candidates should possess "a plan of  specific activities instead of the desire to prolong the agony  of the country's economy as a whole."    The former prime minister pointed out that it would be more  favorable for him as a candidate for the Ukrainian presidency,  if Kravchuk took part in the elections, which would considerably  reduce Plyushch's chances.    Kuchma pointed to the need to adopt tough measures to  surmount the economic crisis. In his opinion, Ukraine's economy  saw a state of emergency on the brink of a disaster.    The parliamentary faction of the IBR created at a party  meeting Tuesday consists of 21 deputies and is called  Interregional Deputies' Faction Center. Its first meeting was  scheduled for May 5.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BORED BY NORTH, SHE'S IN JURY POOL  </P> <P> The judge at Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra trial selected four more people as  prospective jurors today, including one who said she doesn't pay attention to  news because it's "depressing" and thinks the controversy over North is  "boring."  </P> <P> The woman, a secretary to a hospital director, said her mother, who lives with  her, pays such close attention to current events that "I call her 'news media.'  " When her mother approaches her about the news, "I always tell her to get out  of my room. I don't want to hear it," the woman said. U.S. District Judge  Gerhard A. Gesell qualified her for the jury pool.  </P> <P> Three people were rejected for the pool, including a businesswoman who said  North was involved in "money and arms . . . on an international scale." She  said she knew that North had "a boss named (John M.) Poindexter" and "he had a  blonde secretary," a reference to Fawn Hall.  </P></p>

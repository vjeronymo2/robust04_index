			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Zeneca Group of  Britain recently signed an agreement with China's Pharmaceutical  Import and Export Corporation (Sino-Pharm) to launch a  pharmaceutical consulting company in Beijing.    The group also reached another accord with the Chinese firm  to set up an agro-chemicals plant, with a total investment of 60  million U.S. dollars.    David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, which was listed in  1993, said in an interview with XINHUA that the establishment of  the pharmaceutical consulting company was Zeneca's first step to  expand its China business.    Zeneca expected to invest more than 100 million U.S. dollars  in various projects in China in the next five years, he said.    "Through the company, Zeneca will introduce its advanced  technology and products to China, and help the pharmaceutical  circles of China to increase exchanges and contacts with the  outside world," Barnes added.    Zeneca's turnover in China in 1993 reached 44 million  dollars, of which medicines and specially-made chemicals each  supplied a quarter, and agro-chemicals products 50 percent.    Barnes also said that the agrochemicals joint-venture, which  would go into operation in 1996, was the third largest  investment in China by an external agrochemicals producer for  the manufacture of an active ingredient of herbicide.    "The progress being made on these two projects demonstrates  our commitment to developing our business in China," Barnes  said. "We are confident that our business here can grow and  make an increasing contribution to the burgeoning economic  prosperity of the country."</p>

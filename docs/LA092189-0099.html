			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> BID TO UNSEAT BRYANT BEGINS  </P> <P> A group seeking to recall Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant has begun circulating  petitions, and will need the signatures of 8,304 registered voters by Jan. 12  to force an election.  </P> <P> Melody Peterson, co-chairman of the Bryant recall committee, said the group has  distributed 500 petitions to garner the signatures of the necessary 20% of the  city's registered voters.  </P> <P> The petitions accuse Bryant of distorting facts, using the council as a forum  for vicious personal attacks, and taking a "vindictive, intimidating and  contemptuous attitude toward this city, its citizens and employees."  </P> <P> In his official response, which is being circulated with the recall petitions,  Bryant attributes the recall to "a small, special interest group working with  (Mayor) Donna Smith to divide our city." He said the recall group "has tried to  undermine the only chance Pomona has for progress."  </P> <P> Smith has denied involvement in the recall.  </P></p>

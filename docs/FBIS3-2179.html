In the course of their talks, the two foreign ministers also  exchanged views on the situation in Afghanistan. Qian expressed  the hope that the Afghan groups will be able to overcome their  differences through negotiations and consultation. Velayati  particularly stressed that Afghanistan's neighboring countries  should play a role in solving Afghanistan's problems.    Referring to the international situation, Qian said that the  fact that the world is made up of countries that have different  political and social systems, pursue different ways of achieving  economic progress, and have different religious and cultural  traditions is tangible proof that the world is not homogeneous.  Different countries should respect each other, live in  tranquillity and peace, and refrain from imposing their social  systems and ideology on others.    Velayati said that Iran wants the states of the region to  enhance their cooperation, manage regional affairs by  themselves, and oppose hegemonist intervention and the policy of  coercion.</p>

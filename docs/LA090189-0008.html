			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BALTIC AND EASTERN EUROPE  </P> <P> I have been very pleased with your extensive coverage this year of the rapid  changes occurring in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union concerning both  domestic and foreign policy. Several times, however, I have been bothered by  historical inaccuracies in articles discussing the so-called Brezhnev Doctrine.  </P> <P> The idea of limited sovereignty (circumscribed by the U.S.S.R.) in Eastern  Europe does not stem solely from Brezhnev's justification of the Soviet  invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. In fact, limited sovereignty has been  implicit in communist relations since the Communist International (Comintern)  creation in 1919. Its definition of a socialist commonwealth presupposes that  the community's larger interests necessarily transcend those of its national  components. Centralization and subordination to a "strong guiding center" was  one of the organization's charter "Twenty-One Points" in 1920. The only thing  unique about Brezhnev and the 1968 invasion was that Brezhnev felt compelled by  improving relations with the West to explicitly codify a long-standing  principle. In contrast, Khrushchev, who in 1956 invaded Hungary, felt no  compunction whatsoever to justify his behavior.  </P> <P> One cannot really assert that Gorbachev has renounced the limited sovereignty  principle because one of its fundamentals has yet to be tested. While the  Communist Party's "leading role in society" is changing in Poland, and perhaps  soon in Hungary as well, neither nation has taken steps to leave the Warsaw  Pact. There are still strong economic, political, and symbolic ties that bind  Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's non-interference policy in  Eastern Europe does not constitute a renunciation of limited sovereignty.  </P> <P> Where does the Soviet Union's threshold of tolerance for diversity and reform  in Eastern Europe now lie? Historically, the answer has depended . . . on the  geostrategic importance of the particular Soviet ally in question (contrast the  Soviet reaction to the Romanian deviation with the Czechoslovakia invasion in  the same time period). The prevailing ideology among policy-makers in the  U.S.S.R. has played an equally strong role.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH NEWTON  </P> <P> Dept. of Political Science  </P> <P> and Soviet Studies  </P> <P> UC Berkeley  </P></p>

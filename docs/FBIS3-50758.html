A qualified Executive Branch source told BUSQUEDA: "It is  remarkable that they should speak of unemployment when the  unemployment rate is historically at its lowest (...), that they  should speak of a lack of investment when for the past two years  the investment levels have been at their highest for the past  two decades (...), that businessmen and union leaders should  sign a joint declaration that contains many demands which  contradict their own interests."    The CIU and PIT-CNT declaration states: "The industrial  sector in Uruguay is being considerably dismantled," with the  resultant "loss of dozens of jobs in the past few years," to the  point where "industrial participation in national production has  reached the levels of the 1940's."    Businessmen and union leaders questioned the government  trade  policy which seeks "a unilateral opening when protectionism and  incentives for internal production are increasing in the rest of  the world."    The government spokesmen stated: "The average unemployment  rate in Uruguay during 1993 is 8.4 percent, the lowest since  1981," adding: "The jobs lost in some sectors were replaced in  others."    As for the "lack of investment" mentioned in the  declaration,  the government says: "It is remarkable that the PIT-CNT -- which  is associated with the CIU -- should speak of a lack of  investment when on 13 December 1992 it contributed to frustrate  one of the largest investments that could have been made in  Uruguay."    The government considers the attitude of these two  organizations to be contradictory because "they speak of  improving the competitiveness, while some of the solutions they  propose will really reduce the purchasing power of the workers."    The Executive Branch spokesmen said: "It is also remarkable  that, just like on 13 December 1992, the workers oppose  transformations that would help to improve the efficiency of  public services, which could help to improve the competitiveness  of the productive sectors."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Vladimir </F> Popelka; place and date not given: "The Payments Agreement Needs  To Be Changed"]    [Text] [Popelka] According to some reports, you are  supposed to meet with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. Klaus,  however, sees no reason for such a meeting to take place. Do  you see a reason for it?    [Moravcik] I agree with the Czech prime minister on this  point. A meeting of the prime ministers becomes important when  experts, ministers, or deputy prime ministers are unable to  clarify contentious issues. Our meeting would have to concern a  wider range of issues. We are not in a situation where we would  feel that such a meeting is necessary.    [Popelka] Is the situation surrounding the so-called old  clearing account not a reason for such a meeting to take place,  as recently suggested by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita  Schmognerova?    [Moravcik] Not all possibilities of bilateral negotiations  have been exhausted in this case. Some new aspects have  surfaced. The problem is that the basic payments agreement was  disadvantageous for Slovakia. The agreement on payments for the  old clearing account provides for compensation for the  difference in the exchange rates [of the Czech and Slovak  korunas] from the state budget. This is a burden on the Slovak  state budget. While negotiating the agreement, the Slovak side  apparently did not calculate bilateral claims well enough and  did not realize that we are worse off than the Czechs. This is  why we came up with the idea of abolishing the old clearing  account. The true gist of the problem, in my opinion, is that  the payments agreement needs to be changed, but the Czechs are  not interested in this because the present state suits them.    [Popelka] The opposition has repeatedly referred to you in  connection with the club of the "Leninist spark." What kind of  a club is this, in fact?    [Moravcik] It was set up after we gained the impression that  the thinking represented by Mikhail Gorbachev was not applied in  Slovakia. The club's task was to bring together people who  realized the need for more radical changes. The name "Leninist  spark" was only a camouflage designed to hoodwink the StB [State  Security Corps]. The organizers are registered in StB files  because later they were rated as candidates for the criminal act  of sedition.</p>

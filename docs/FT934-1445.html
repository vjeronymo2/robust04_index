			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / A life of sex, food and fighting: Cock-fighting is legal, with a mass following in many places. Nicholas Woodsworth meets breeders and punters Bobby Fernandez, Rolly San Juan and I were sitting at the back of the Country Chicken Restaurant in Pasonanca, a suburb of Zamboanga City in the south Philippines. Bobby's wife owns the place, so we were doing pretty much as we pleased: telling stories, helping ourselves from a bottle of Johnny Walker sitting on the table, and working our way through huge plates of fried chicken. Rolly is a columnist for the Zamboanga Morning Times, and gets around. He is a keen political observer, an inveterate sports addict, a gambler, an admirer of women and a collector of anecdotes. He was telling us about the first time he had seen the infamous 'Henny' in action in a cock-fight in Cebu. A new breed of fighting cock imported from the US, the Henny had taken Filipino cock breeders, punters, and especially the cocks themselves, by surprise. 'The local champion struts into the pit, and what does he see?' said Rolly with a smile. 'Not the usual opponent with neck flexed and hackles bristling, but what appears to be a docile grey hen staring at him with lovestruck eyes.' 'Naturally he completely forgets that he is a total killing machine, strolls around behind the Henny, and prepares to do what cocks do best after fighting. And then - POW] - like lightning the Henny turns round, sidesteps him, and sinks three inches of steel into his ribcage. The champ keels over stone dead. The Henny is not a hen at all, but a cock bred by the Americans to look like a hen.' Bobby Fenandez laughed, but he and Rolly sat mulling over the story, a perfectly true one, with more than casual interest. It is not because his wife runs a chicken restaurant that Bobby will sit up night after night with friends discussing the finer points of man's feathered friend. Like Rolly, like thousands of inhabitants of Zamboanga, like millions of enthusiasts all over the Philippine archipelago, Bobby is a 'cocker' - a keeper, trainer and fighter of game cocks. Basketball may be the Philippines' national sport, but cock-fighting is its national passion. Many Filipinos, even those living in urban areas, keep a few fighting cocks simply for the pleasure of having them around. Rolly keeps a dozen, and fights them in a local Zamboanga cockpit on Sundays. But he spends a good deal of time with them every day, holding and stroking them, talking to them, admiring them - Filipinos, he assured me, are often more interested in their cocks than their wives. Bobby Fernandez is in a different category altogether. As we chatted in the restaurant late into the night, we were not alone; on the broad green lawns that surrounded us outside, more than 60 fine fighting cocks sat roosting on perches in the dark. On Bobby's breeding and training farm in La Paz, 3,000 feet up in rugged, jungly mountains behind Zamboanga, were 200 more. Fighting cocks are not just a consuming passion for Bobby, but a profitable living as well. In most parts of the world cock-fighting is regarded as a cruel and barbaric sport, and is banned. Although highly popular in England from medieval times, it was outlawed by Queen Victoria in 1849. In the western hemisphere today cock-fighting is legal only in Mexico, Panama, Ecuador, Guatamala and certain US states generally regarded by the liberal establishment as 'redneck' - Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and the like. Even there the sport is conducted behind closed doors and far from prying and critical eyes. Nor, juridically at least, is cock-fighting any better regarded in the East. Although illicitly practised in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and much of the rest of Asia, only in the Philippines does it have a legal, mass following. Here it is a thriving, multi-million dollar industry supported by enthusiasts ranging from rickshaw drivers to federal congressmen. In the Manila area alone there are more than 20 cock-pits, some of them seating 15,000 spectators, hosting more than 30,000 fights a year. Cock-fighting is actively supported by the government, at times even subsidised by it, for the simple reason that the state takes 10 per cent of the gate in tax. But cock-fighting is more than just a way of trying to cut back the budget deficit - its honourable and respected status on the islands is inevitably a reflection of Filipinos and their national character. All around the Philippines the half-dozen 'tiger' economies of east Asia are surging ahead at breakneck pace - for more than a decade now hard work, single-minded discipline and personal sacrifice have allowed places such as Singapore and Taiwan phenomenal rates of growth. The picture in the Philippines is different - merely to provide reliable energy for industrial production has so far proved an unconquerable challenge. There are scores of possible explanations. But, if allowed a little generalisation, I would put it down to cock-fighting. Filipinos do not like phrases such as 'single-minded discipline' and 'personal sacrifice'. Industriousness and determination are not ideas to which they are naturally given. Production is anathema to them. They like friends and talk, good times and excitement. Given a little money in their pockets, they like a bit of a flutter. They like cock-fighting. I say all this by way not of disparagement, but of compliment. I too 'enjoy' sitting round wasting time and talking about inconsequential things such as cocks that look like hens. It is an enormous relief from the rest of the Asian continent's obsessive and increasingly unbalanced concern with economic growth. In Singapore, for heaven's sake, gum chewing has become illegal because it is messy and unproductive. I am no more pro-bloodsports than I am pro-gum-chewing. But I would rather live under a government that permits cock-fighting than one that feels threatened by Juicy Fruit. And after you have met a cock or two, the moral questions that surround the sport seem to fade in significance. 'There are three things that cocks like more than anything in the world,' Bobby explained to me as we drove in his jeep across the jungle lowlands towards La Paz. 'They are food, sex, and fighting.' So far cocks sounded pretty much like human beings to me, and I said so. 'Yes, but the thing about the cock is that given the choice of the three, he will choose fighting every single time.' Perhaps there, I had to admit, was the difference with human beings - given the choice, a lot of us would spend a great deal of time dickering over the decision. But not the cock. 'It is territoriality, it is the protection of his hens,' Bobby said. 'The fighting instinct is so deep he cannot help himself. What we do at La Paz is provide the perfect environment of food and sex - it is the cock himself who develops his fighting form to perfection.' As training camps go, it sounded pretty good to me. And Bobby was not exaggerating. Two and a half hours later, after having climbed 3,000 feet over some of the steepest and roughest dirt roads I have ever seen, we arrived in what could only be described as cock heaven. Far below lay the heat and high humidity of the tropical lowlands, the stink, noise, and dirt of urban Zamboanga. Here, in the cool and misty uplands, was a hidden valley surrounded by tropical hardwood forests, stands of giant bamboo, groves of pine and banana trees. And as far as one could see up the valley itself, tethered to roosts spread evenly over a smooth undulating surface of meticulously kept lawns, were fighting cocks - not dozens, not hundreds, but thousands of cocks, each strutting, crowing, preening and thinking himself the finest cock in the world. Bobby, of course, was not the owner of all these acres and all these chickens. He is just one of 36 members of the Zamboanga Game Fowl Breeders Association, who in producing more than 6,000 top-rate cocks a year have put Zamboanga firmly on the Filipino cock-fighting map. Today the quality of La Paz cocks rivals that of Bacalod, the country's cock-fighting capital in the central Philippines, where 50,000 game birds are raised annually. The La Paz cockers have come to this isolated valley for its ideal climatic, breeding and training conditions, and also for its security. Surrounding La Paz are tall observation towers equipped with high-powered searchlights for night surveillance. At the entrance is a barricade manned by a guard toting an M-16 assault rifle. 'A necessary precaution,' sighed Bobby. 'We used to have a lot of losses. It's no wonder - not one of the cocks raised here is worth less than 5,000 pesos, more than Dollars 175 - that's more than six month's salary for many Filipino workers. The Zamboanga Whites bred here are each worth many times more than that.' But Bobby's big concern that day was his on-going conditioning programme for a fight just three weeks hence. It was a big fight, a seven-cock derby in Lapu-Lapu City with a top prize of 4.25m pesos, more than Dollars 150,000. 'You can't actually 'train' a cock to fight,' Bobby told me when I asked if he thought cocks had any intelligence. We were sitting beside a covered sparring ring watching assistants tie two sets of miniature gloves over the spurs of a pair of cocks. 'Game birds have more instinct than reason - some people would call them just plain stupid,' he added. 'If they had any brains they would take one look at the three-inch steel slashing blade attached to their opponent's left leg and run the other way. But no, they rush into what for one is certain death - few cocks survive more than two or three fights. Five- or six-time winners are exceptional.' 'What you can do, though,' he said, 'is prepare them for a fight, develop those qualities which make winners - fighting spirit, leg strength for cutting power, attacking speed, timing, body conformation.' We watched the cocks warily circle each other, side-stepping, feinting, then suddenly diving down on each other with legs slashing away in a blur of motion. 'It is just like boxing,' Bobby added, watching the cocks approvingly. A few days later, I witnessed the culmination of all this work. It was just an ordinary Sunday hackfight in a local Zamboanga cockpit with a minimum entrant's bet big enough to feed a whole family for a couple of months, but a small sum by today's fight standards. The atmosphere, though, was electric. Down by the ringside the town's wealthier bettors were instructing the pit's hordes of bookmakers on larger amounts for posted bets. High up in the cheaper bleachers the town's poor were making smaller side bets with each other. So noisy and jammed do the pits get that bettors and bookies rely on a system of hand signals - fingers pointing upwards to indicate tens of pesos, sideways for hundreds, down for thousands. Presenters with microphones, bright lights, referees in white shirts and bow-ties, punters bellowing and gesticulating - Bobby was right; it was a lot like boxing. But there are no bouts in this sport, no point scoring, no final-round re-evaluations, no technical victories. There is just one round, a single, quick, fatal encounter. A few feathers fly, a blade hits a vital organ, the crowd roars and a cock lies dead in the sand on the pit floor. It usually lasts no longer than 30 seconds. After so much care and preparation the whole thing, in fact, seemed to me rather anti-climactic. Certainly it is no more cruel than the fate met out daily in the world's abattoirs to millions of industrially-raised chickens. Give me La Paz any day, I would say, if I were a chicken. Enjoyable surroundings, plenty to eat, and stimulating company. I have just one proviso: when the big day comes, don't match me against a Henny.</p>

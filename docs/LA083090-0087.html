			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSSEIN SCOFFS AT U.S. MILITARY THREAT;  </P> <P> INTERVIEWS: IN RAMBLING ACCOUNTS TO ANCHORMEN, THE IRAQI LEADER SAID THE U.S.  WAS NOT "THE ANGEL OF DEATH" AND BERATED FRANCE FOR JOINING THE BLOCKADE.  </P> <P> In two television interviews Wednesday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein declared  that Kuwait will be part of his country forever and scoffed at the idea that  U.S. forces could kill him in an air attack, saying "the United States is not  the Angel of Death."  </P> <P> "In all of history, not one head of state has been killed in an attack from the  air," a smiling Hussein said in a rambling two-hour interview with a French  television anchorman. "Can you give me an example?"  </P> <P> In a 90-minute interview with CBS News anchorman Dan Rather, Hussein said no  one should "dismiss any possibility for new ideas," but insisted that he will  not negotiate a withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> "Kuwait is part of Iraq," he said through a translator.  </P> <P> Asked whether that meant forever, he replied, "We have said this, and the  legislative bodies in Iraq have issued a clear decree, a clear decision, saying  that Kuwait is an Iraqi province." Any negotiations, he suggested, would  involve the question of "withdrawal of the United States from our sacred  areas."  </P> <P> His inflexible and defiant public posture is significant, because Iraqi  withdrawal from Kuwait is likely to be the key issue in scheduled discussions  today in Jordan between U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and  Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz. Perez de Cuellar's initiative is seen as the  most important effort yet to solve the crisis diplomatically. "We know nothing  about the United Nations," Hussein told Rather. However, he added that if Perez  de Cuellar "submits any of these ideas, we will, of course, talk to him because  we respect Mr. (Perez) de Cuellar as he represents the United Nations."  </P> <P> The Iraqi president also denied reports that he had offered, through back  channels to the White House, a negotiated Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Newsday, the Long Island and New York newspaper, reported Wednesday that Iraq  told the White House it would allow foreigners to leave and pull its troops  from Kuwait if U.N. sanctions are lifted and Iraq is guaranteed access to the  Persian Gulf, as well as control of an oil field that crosses into Kuwait.  </P> <P> Several Bush Administration officials said Wednesday that they see no reason to  believe the report.  </P> <P> The French interviewer, Patrick Poivre d'Avor, asked Hussein if he constantly  moved his office or stayed in a bunker to avoid an air attack.  </P> <P> "Saddam Hussein has confronted the greatest dangers," the Iraqi leader said.  "You are surely aware of the history of Saddam Hussein. And the United States  is not the Angel of Death."  </P> <P> The statements seemed to reflect a preoccupation with the notion that the  United States is hoping to cripple the Iraqi government by removing Hussein,  either by assassination or a coup.  </P> <P> At another point in the French interview, Hussein said: "The big superpower is  gambling if they think they can win a war simply by getting rid of Saddam  Hussein.  </P> <P> "In any case, we are optimistic," he said. "The future belongs to us. For the  United States to win, they must prevail on three fronts: They must defeat the  Iraqi army; they must destroy the Iraqi economy, and they must bring down the  government. Only one of those things will not be enough."  </P> <P> In response to a question about the frequent comparison of Hussein with the  Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler, he said: "What about Algeria and what about  the people of Algeria? What do they think about Saddam Hussein? What about the  people of Tunisia? What about Jordan? What can we say about the Arabs of  Europe? Is Saddam Hussein there forcing them to have opinions or forcing them  to act the way they act? Do they say that I am Hitler or a dictator in those  places?"  </P> <P> The French interview began at a Baghdad center for international conferences  where the Iraqis had assembled more than a dozen civilian hostages, including  several from the United States. The hostages were shown being served by waiters  offering silver trays of iced fruit juice.  </P> <P> The interviews were said to be the first that Hussein has granted to individual  Western reporters since his invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Asked by Rather whether Iraq would use chemical weapons other than in response  to nuclear attack by the United States, Hussein avoided a direct answer. "In  any and all cases, never imagine that we are going to relinquish Iraq," he  said. " . . . Expect that Iraq is not going to be an easy bite to swallow."  </P> <P> The Iraqi president also warned that in a war with Iraq, "the harm caused to  the invaders who come here would be greater than whatever they suffered in  Vietnam. Iraq will come out victorious."  </P> <P> The White House declined to comment on the interview.  </P> <P> As in earlier appearances, Hussein reached out to touch the heads of the  children, several of whom flinched. But most of it took place as Hussein paced  back and forth in a marble reception hall, military aides at his side. He spoke  in Arabic, and his remarks were translated into French and English.  </P> <P> Hussein spoke of his disappointment that the French government had joined in  the international sanctions against Iraq, and of his belief in the ultimate  victory of his country over the United States.  </P> <P> Poivre d'Avor, broadcasting later from Amman, Jordan, said the videocassette of  the interview was confiscated immediately after the interview by Iraqi  officials, who kept it for eight hours before returning it. But he said that  only one question had been deleted.  </P> <P> He said he had asked Hussein, "How can a proud man like you hide behind women  and children?" Even though Hussein did not reply, he said, the question was  deleted from the tape.  </P> <P> Hussein appeared poised and confident, dressed in a gray suit of European cut  and a green tie. From time to time, he would turn to a military aide for  smiling, head-bobbing encouragement.  </P> <P> He reserved some of his harshest criticism for France. For the past 20 years,  since French President Charles de Gaulle embraced a Middle East policy with  Iraq as the pivot, France has been Iraq's best friend in the West. The French  government supported Hussein's revolutionary government in its struggle to  nationalize the British-controlled oil fields.  </P> <P> It stood by the Iraqi government in its costly war with Iran. France was second  only to the Soviet Union in supplying arms to Iraq, and Iraq still owes France  an estimated $4.5 billion, nearly a quarter of the Iraqi foreign debt.  </P> <P> Thus, Iraqi officials felt betrayed when the French government joined other  countries in supporting the sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> "The only blame we have is against France," Saddam said angrily. "We don't  directly blame the United States or Great Britain, because they were never  objective. They were never our friends."  </P> <P> Tumulty reported from Washington and Tempest from Paris.  </P></p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Manx Budget aims for growth THE ISLE of Man government yesterday announced a Budget for 1993-94 aimed at stimulating economic growth while amending the income tax structure to help those on lower incomes. Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx Treasury minister, said his main objectives were 'to strengthen the foundations for the island's future prosperity'. Net income for the year is estimated at Pounds 192.8m, an increase of 3.2 per cent, and net expenditure at Pounds 202m, the balance coming from funds brought forward from the previous year. Capital spending is estimated at Pounds 44.8m. The island's reserve fund will remain at Pounds 65.29m. Mr Gelling said the target was to increase this to half the government's annual expenditure. The Pounds 4.26m interest earned by the fund and by the island's currency account will be included in net income. The two-tiered system of personal income taxation remains at 15 per cent and 20 per cent. Corporate and non-resident's tax remains at 20 per cent. Personal income tax thresholds rise for the first time since 1989. A single person's allowance is increased to Pounds 6,200 from Pounds 6,000, with income tax at 15 per cent payable on the next Pounds 8,500 - an enlarging of the band by Pounds 500 - and thereafter at 20 per cent. A married couple's allowance is double that of a single person and is fully transferable between partners. The changes mean a single person earning Pounds 30,000 will pay income tax of Pounds 4,335, compared with Pounds 6,942 in Britain. Mr Gelling announced a review of residence rules relating to income-tax liability of individuals. Both non-resident and tax-exempt Manx companies face higher annual charges. These will be mitigated by removal of statutory audit requirements. Annual duty on non-resident companies will rise by Pounds 100 to Pounds 600 and annual fees for exempt companies by Pounds 50 to Pounds 300. The proposed category of international companies and international limited partnerships, due to be instituted later this year, will bear an annual tax charge of Pounds 300 and a fee of Pounds 600 respectively. The government also plans to amend pensions laws to attract international pension fund management companies.</p>

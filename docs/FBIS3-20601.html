			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Future Is All That Matters"] </F>   [Text] Now we know all about it. All the nitty-gritty of  17 rounds of Sino-British talks over eight months ending with  barriers lowered on 30 June, 1997. No more through train, no  smooth transition, perhaps no replacement airport until after  the transfer of sovereignty, no new container port, no new  highways into southern China, no recognition by the future  government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]  of any contracts or international loans going beyond 1997.    All the details contained in 36 pages entitled  Representative  Government in Hong Kong, otherwise known as the White Paper on  how the talks went.    A few points need to be stressed at the outset. Firstly,  this is a British version of the talks. As such it is intended  to serve British interests. Beijing has given notice that it  will respond by publishing its own version. No doubt it will  serve Chinese interests.    Secondly, by going public the British side has cast away the  key to a reopening of the negotiations. Of course, the blame  has been put on China: the People's Daily went public with a  detailed version of the 17 rounds last month. But, no doubt,  Beijing had read an equally authoritative blow-by-blow version  in London's Financial Times weeks earlier. So much for  confidentiality--both sides have been leaking like mad while  trying to keep Hong Kong people in the dark.    Thirdly, this document is not all that it is made out to be.  On the matter of functional constituencies, for instance, we  are told the British were prepared to compromise. But we are  not told what those initiatives were. That is just one example  of details the British regard as unimportant for Hong Kong  people.    Finally, how credible is this paper? The answer appears to  lie in omissions and in details which have been glossed over.    Before the negotiations began and at the outset of the talks  China had insisted on one condition: that there be no  unilateral action on political reforms if the talks broke down.  The whole world now knows that the original proposals are being  pushed through the Legislative Council and the contents of the  talks, at least the British side of it, are on display in this  dreary and repetitive document.    We know from the Chinese side that the British at one point  proposed a functional constituency for civil servants. This has  been omitted. What else is hidden from Hong Kong people? It  would also appear that the issue of appointed members to the  district boards and municipal councils was more crucial than was  made out to be [as published] by the British while the  negotiations were going on. It now appears to have been a major  obstacle.    That Britain also wanted a say in the affairs of the future  HKSAR government is irrefutable. What other construction is one  to put on the admission that Britain wanted China to accept an  agreed formula for the composition of the Election Committee as  "the same model for the future selection and election committees  for chief executives"? [sentence as published] China has long  maintained that Britain has been manoeuvring to retain its  influence, if not its power over Hong Kong after 1997. The  document now confirms this.    It does not serve the interests of Hong Kong and its people  to dwell on the past. The talks are over, there is no way to  reopen them.    What matters now is the future. As we move towards 1997 the  British will become more irrelevant with each passing day.    We must learn to take the long-term view and plan  accordingly.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / US Money and Credit: Gains are consolidated on back of economic data MANY analysts have been waiting for the US bond market to consolidate recent gains. Last week, their expectations were fulfilled. The release of the March unemployment figures on Friday caused the benchmark 30-year long bond to lose more than a point, and the yield on the issue to rise back above the 7 per cent mark. At 7.05 per cent, that was the highest closing yield since mid-February. In truth, the bond markets had been edging towards this denouement for most of the week. Bond prices rose on Monday, but this was largely in reaction to the previous Friday's sell-off, and thereafter the bond market paid little attention to a raft of economic data which might have been expected to send yields lower. For example, the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index fell to 53.4 in March, from 55.8 in February - an indication that manufacturing activity, although still growing, is doing so at slower rates. Consumer-confidence data was also weak. Undeterred, and with all eyes fixed on the March employment numbers, the long bond yield inched up steadily, from 6.89 per cent on Monday evening to 6.96 per cent by the end of trading on Thursday. At first sight, Friday's jobs figures appeared to give grounds for encouragement. While the unemployment rate remained steady at 7 per cent, the number of payroll jobs actually declined in March. This seemed to indicate a weakening in the economy, and mitigate against the inflation threat which had worried the bond market recently. But analysts pointed out that last month saw exceptionally bad weather - causing a shortening of the working week and some job losses. It was notable, for example, that construction employment fell by 59,000 workers in March. Moreover, buried amid the data, was 5 per cent rise in average hourly earnings - evidence that inflationary pressures may be creeping back. Finally, there were upward revisions to the already-substantial payroll gains seen in the previous two months. The bond market read the worst into the figures. The 30-year Treasury yield head back across the 7 per cent mark, and the yield curve steepened perceptibly with the yields spread between 10 and two-year issues widening some 10 basis points, to 218 basis points - a sure sign that the market scents an inflationary threat. Whether it is right to be worried may become clearer this week. The key numbers to watch for will be the producer price index figures on Thursday and the consumer price index data on Friday. Analysts are divided over the extent to which these will allay the market's fears. Salomon Brothers, for example, is forecasting that the PPI will show a 0.6 per cent advance in March, the largest monthly jump since October 1990. It suggests the increase will be 'broad-based', taking in food products, petrol and home heating oil, and some big tickets items, like motor vehicles. This, in turn, could translate into a 0.4 per cent rise in the 'core' PPI figure (excluding food and energy). The 'core' CPI figure, meanwhile, is forecast to have risen by a similar amount. 'If our predictions are correct, the headline wholesale and retail inflation measures posted their largest quarterly increases since the leap recorded in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,' says one analyst. But not everyone is so gloomy. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example, expects the data to 'slow the recent inflation scare'. Here, analysts are predicting that the PPI and CPI figures will show a rise of 0.3 per cent, inclusive and exclusive of the food and energy items. Who is right remains to be seen. But it is safe to assume that the bond market will remain edgy until the answer is known.</p>

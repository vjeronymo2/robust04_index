			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "French and German Manufacturers </F> Agree To Build New Armored Vehicle"]    [Text] A consortium comprising two French manufacturers,  Giat Industries and Panhard, and two German ones, Krauss Maffei  and Mercedes Benz, will establish a joint venture in June 1995  to produce a range of wheeled armored vehicles for the French  and German Armed Forces, representatives of the four companies  announced in Paris yesterday.    The project was presented one day before the opening of  Eurosatory '94 (Le Bourget's land-based weapons show). The  armored vehicles will be manufactured in two basic versions: a  six-wheel and an eight-wheel model. Production lines will start  running in 1998 and the vehicles are scheduled for delivery to  the Armed Forces in 2002.    By the year 2000, both the French and German Armies will  need  3,000 such vehicles, whose unit cost must not exceed 5 million  francs.    The future troop transporter will accommodate up to nine  soldiers with their equipment and weapons, in addition to a crew  of two. It will be able to carry various types of turrets such  as one fitted with a 45-mm gun, or even the 120-mm gun turret  which is being developed for the future French weapons system  carrier. It will also be able to operate as a command car or an  ambulance.  <H5>  Two Assembly Lines </H5>   Designed to blend the tactical mobility of a battle tank  with  the strategic mobility of a truck, the new armored vehicle will  feature a light and very strong body made of a special aluminum  alloy. Its maximum speed will be 120 km per hour, its maximum  range will exceed 750 kilometers, and it will be equipped with a  central system for inflating or deflating its tires while  running to ensure optimal adjustment to the terrain.    The formal timetable is as follows: The four members of the  consortium will sign the joint venture agreement in late 1994,  before establishing, in June 1995, a common subsidiary whose  ownership will be 50 percent French and 50 percent German.    Germany's Krauss Maffei and France's Giat Industries will  both operate an assembly line, while Panhard will manufacture  custom vehicles made to specific consumer requirements.</p>

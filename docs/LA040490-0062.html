			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROBERTS PLAYS WITH THE PAIN;  </P> <P> PADRES: A CHEWING OUT FROM TEAMMATE GARRY TEMPLETON HAS MOTIVATED THE YOUNG  THIRD BASEMAN TO PLAY WITH THE SMALL HURTS.  </P> <P> The pain sent shivers of concern up and down his body Tuesday, causing tears to  drip from his eyes.  </P> <P> Padre third baseman Bip Roberts bit his lower lip, put a bulky brace on his  right knee, wiped away the tears, and ran back onto the field.  </P> <P> Roberts, who developed swelling in his right knee that just won't seem to go  away, knew he probably shouldn't be going back onto the field. It's only spring  training. Why take a risk?  </P> <P> Maybe a year ago, Roberts mused, there would have been no doubt what he would  have done. He'd inform trainer Dick Dent that maybe it'd be best he sit this  one out. He'd tell Padre Manager Jack McKeon all about it.  </P> <P> And there he'd be, sitting on the bench with street clothes, watching his  teammates play without feeling the least bit of remorse.  </P> <P> But on this day, Roberts didn't say a word. Not to Dent. Not to McKeon. Not to  any of his teammates.  </P> <P> He came back on the field and took batting practice, just like everyone else.  </P> <P> He went out to the field and shagged balls, just like everyone else.  </P> <P> He came off the field, but before heading into the clubhouse like everyone  else, he was pulled aside by McKeon.  </P> <P> Roberts wasn't going to be playing  </P> <P> But this was McKeon's decision; not Roberts.  </P> <P> And, as Roberts will tell you, it makes all the difference in the world.  </P> <P> "People can give all the reasons they want about my turnaround last year, but  if you want to know the truth," Roberts said, "Tempy (Padre shortstop Garry  Templeton) is the one most responsible. He got me going because of an incident  in LA, and ever since that, I've had this drive and determination that I never  had before."  </P> <P> It was a game in late June at Dodger Stadium. Roberts' ribs were hurting, and  he was lying on the trainers' table icing a sore ankle when Templeton entered  the room. Templeton asked what was wrong, and Roberts told him, saying he  wouldn't be able to play that night.  </P> <P> Well, Roberts might as well have said that he bleeds Dodger Blue by the way  Templeton reacted. Templeton chewed him out, telling him that he plays with  pain every day of his life, and you don't see him bailing out of the lineup. If  Roberts wants to be somebody in this game, Templeton said, a commitment better  be made.  </P> <P> "I'll never forget that, he chewed me out but good," Roberts said. "I was  hurting pretty good, but he got me so upset, crying and everything, that I went  out there that night and didn't feel a thing. There was no pain.  </P> <P> "He turned on a switch for me, and I'll always be grateful to him for that."  </P> <P> It indeed was like a different player suddenly transformed out of the same  body. This was a guy who had made just 18 starts and was batting .278 at the  time of the incident. But after a few choice words by Templeton, Roberts batted  .307, starting 60 of the Padres' remaining 74 games.  </P> <P> "I really got on him," Templeton said, "and I know I got him pretty upset. I  told him the difference between the majors isn't that big, and if you want to  hang around here, you better play with some pain.  </P> <P> "Look at him now, from that moment on, he's been the best player on the team."  </P> <P> Roberts, who said he aggravated his knee by playing on the hard infield at  their spring-training complex in Yuma, is expected to be back in the lineup  today.  </P> <P> "We want him ready for opening day," McKeon said, "that's my concern. There's  no sense in taking any risks now."  </P> <P> Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn laughed when he first heard it. Then, he started  thinking about it. And he started getting worried.  </P> <P> "It's not so funny, any more."  </P> <P> The hottest rumor in New York has Gwynn being traded to the New York Mets for  third baseman Howard Johnson and pitcher Ron Darling.  </P> <P> No one knows how it started, or if it has the least bit of substance  considering it's been denied by the Mets and Padres, but it's out there  lurking.  </P> <P> "My brother heard it at Dodgertown," Gwynn said. "So he called my mother. My  mother called my wife. And she called me.  </P> <P> "When I first heard it, I just laughed. But then I drove around in my car, and  thought about it hard. I'm not counting anything out.  </P> <P> "Really, there's nothing I can do but just wait and see."  </P> <P> The Padres will open the 1990 season in just five days on Monday in Los  Angeles, but to many in the Padre clubhouse, the most important date on their  minds is Friday, April 13.  </P> <P> That is the day their former teammate, Dave Leiper, will undergo open heart  surgery.  </P> <P> "That's the most important thing right now," Padre catcher Mark Parent said.  "There's a lot of us worried about him in here. You realize there's more  important things in life than baseball."  </P> <P> Leiper, who spent 2 1/2 seasons with the Padres before being released in  December, suffered heart palpitations again three weeks ago while working out  in the Oakland Athletics' mini-camp. He was taken to a Phoenix hospital when it  was discovered, he said, what was described to him as an extra passageway to  his heart.  </P> <P> "They have to take that out," Leiper said. "They could zap it electrically, but  the surest thing is to open me up and get it. I'll be out of the hospital in  five or six days, but it'll take a while for the sternum to heal.  </P> <P> "I could probably get by if I keep taking medication, but later in life, they  said, something could happen.  </P> <P> "I'd just as soon get it over with now. They said the first available date was  Friday the 13th, and asked if I minded. I said, 'Nah, I'm not superstitious.  Just get me in there.' "  </P> <P> The Padres plan a visit to Leiper in the hospital the following day in Redwood  City, Calif. As fate would have it, they'll be in San Francisco that weekend  for a three-game series against the Giants.  </P> <P> "I told Leip we'll all be there," Parent said. "Nothing's going to keep us away  from seeing him."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Padre chief executive Jerry Kapstein came to Palm Springs Tuesday night to meet  with Manager Jack McKeon and Bill Beck, assistant to the vice  president/baseball operations. McKeon still has not talked with anyone in the  prospective ownership group. . . . Considering that 10 men will be owners of  the Padres if the sale should go through, the joke in the clubhouse was that  perhaps a bumper sticker should be made: "Honk, if you own the Padres." The  Padres (8-2) won their sixth consecutive game Tuesday, defeating the Angels,  11-3. The Padres, who also overcame a deficit for the sixth consecutive time,  were led by rookie outfielder Jerald Clark, who went three for four with a  two-run homer. . . . Ed Whitson was the winning pitcher, yielding five hits and  two runs in five innings. "I love pitching here," Whitson said, "because they  use that red clay on the mound. I told our people a couple of years ago that if  they'd order that clay, I'd pay for it. But I'm still waiting."  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hams beef up burger bars - Planet Hollywood, London's latest gourmet attraction NO-ONE ever lost money underestimating the good taste of a burger eater, so there is some reason for Mr Robert Earl's quiet confidence that the London branch of his latest Planet Hollywood theme restaurant, which opened yesterday, will outstrip the success of the Hard Rock Cafe chain he helped build. The four Planet Hollywood outlets sell burgers against a backdrop of movie clips, loud theme tunes, and other memorabilia including Charlie Chaplin's cane, Rocky's motorcycle and Judy Garland's dress from the Wizard of Oz. The Hard Rock Cafes feature rock memorabilia. Mr Earl, 41, and partner Mr Keith Barish, the film producer, have put up most of the Dollars 40m cash behind the Planet Hollywood chain. Mr Sylvester Stallone, Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mr Bruce Willis, the actors, are minority backers. This, with the recent injection of Mr Earl's four other London restaurants into the Pelican Group and his seat on its board, marks his return to British business after five years in the US. Theme food has become popular as punters drink less and must be tempted to eat more. Mr Earl expects the London Planet Hollywood, the fourth in the chain, will gross Pounds 15m a year. This he says would be about Pounds 3m more than the outfits he sees as his main competition - the Hard Rock Cafe, TGI Friday's and Terence Conran's Quaglino's. He is considering flotation: 'I miss the Stock Exchange. I like having institutional shareholders. I like having the ability to create new businesses through public funds - and success can be measured openly.' It looks like another chapter in the Earl success story. There is, however, a bit of gristle in the burger. Mr Peter Morton, co-founder of the Hard Rock chain and owner of all the Cafes in the western half of the US, is bringing Dollars 400m legal actions against Mr Earl and the Rank Organisation, which owns the eastern Hard Rocks. Mr Morton argues that Rank and Mr Earl allowed Planet Hollywood to copy the Hard Rock motif illegally, and stole trade secrets when they both had duties to the jointly-owned Hard Rock licensing corporation which markets the lucrative trade mark. Mr Morton declines to comment, but Mr Earl says that some of his claims have been thrown out: 'He has successfully taken up a lot of my time, but these are basically bullshit allegations, and he hasn't produced any evidence.' Mr Earl has made a fortune selling hamburgers and hype. No doubt the burgers are 100 per cent meat, but Mr Earl no longer lives up to his nasty personal myth. The native North Londoner who now lives in Orlando, Florida, is not the laugh-a-minute, name dropping, braggart, full of wild claims who cannot sit still. He thinks carefully before he speaks, and even his shirt is subdued: 'You think this is loud? I think Paul Smith would be very upset to hear that.' He believes jealousy is behind the press jibes: 'The more successful one is, you have to recognise I am going to get more and more unfavourable press - that is the nature of England.' The hype surrounding his business acumen is harder to assess. He has made millions. Earl watchers talk about a combination of luck, creativity, energy and an autocratic style. He says: 'I think I am pretty good at inspiring people. I can mix with anyone from royalty down to the kitchen porter. I also work about 14 or 15 hours a day. But I am lucky. Most people would not consider it work because of the excitement, the celebrity involvement.' Detractors prefer to remain nameless, but say there's a jackall behind the hype: 'He often deals from behind a fax machine and usually his faxes are one-liners, very pointed, very abrasive. He cultivates the friend-to-celebrities image. You don't hear about the ruthless way he treats people.' One anonymous friend concedes: 'Of course he doesn't always deliver. How can you possibly? But he's succeeded more often than most. The difference between him and the rest of us is that he picks up his luck and runs with it.' He certainly ran with his first company, President Entertainments, which floated in 1984 valued at Pounds 5.2m, and was the vehicle for theme restaurants in Britain and the US. If, in common with many other companies in the 1980s it grew rapidly (from six to 65 restaurants) through acquisitions funded by rights issues, placings and paper deals, if earnings increased little more than half against quadrupled pre-tax profits, and if aspects of the balance sheet look a little adventurous from the perspective of the 1990s, well, in 1987 he sold it to Pleasurama, the casino and hotel operator for Pounds 63m. Mr Earl agreed to run a new US subsidiary for Pleasurama and negotiated a contract which expired last year, reputedly yielding him a Pounds 30m profit-linked bonus. Rank inherited Mr Earl and Hard Rock International through its 1990 takeover of Mecca (which had bought Pleasurama in 1988). It must now cough up the cash while Mr Earl and Mr Barish, who bought Rank out of Planet Hollywood, develop the rival. Last night, at the lift-off party, Mr Robert Earl mixed with Hollywood royalty and perhaps the odd kitchen porter. He will be wishing on these earthbound stars to draw customers. See Observer</p>

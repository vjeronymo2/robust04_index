			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Man fined for selling duty-free goods MR ASHOK Patel was yesterday fined Pounds 1,200 for selling duty-free goods bought on a cross-Channel trip to France, in the first case of its kind in Britain, Philip Rawstorne writes. Mr Patel, a Bristol shopkeeper, bought 960 cans of lager, 2.75 litres of wine and 200 cigarettes in Calais. He admitted at the city's magistrates court one offence of knowingly dealing in duty-free goods. The court heard that Customs and Excise officers visited his shop in Southmead Road within weeks of his crossing from Dover to Calais on January 28. They spotted continental-sized 500ml cans of lager for sale. Mr Patel later admitted he had made the trip in his van to buy goods for his store.</p>

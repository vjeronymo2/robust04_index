			<p>SUMMARY                               The opening days of the State Duma brought new signs of the  weakness of reformers and strength of anti-reform parties,  especially the Agrarians and Communists, in the election of a  speaker and the registration of party factions.  The Agrarian  Party's candidate, Communist Party (CPRF) Deputy Chairman Ivan  Rybkin, was elected speaker of the Duma almost by default, as  reform parties were unable to work together and failed to get a  candidate onto the final ballot.  The formal registration of  party factions revealed that the Agrarian Party has considerably  expanded its expected membership since the election, while the  Russia's Choice faction appeared smaller than its leaders had  expected and now is showing signs of splitting.                            END SUMMARY     The selection of a Duma speaker, carried out mainly in secret  talks among factions, turned into a fiasco for the disunited  reformers.  Instead of working with other reform parties and  independents to agree on a single candidate to put up against the  communists and other hardliners, Russia's Choice entered into  long and ultimately fruitless talks with the three other biggest  parties--the anti-reform CPRF, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal-  Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and the Agrarians--trying to  agree on a package dividing up the posts of speaker, deputy  speakers, and committee chairmanships.  However, the three anti-  reform parties worked together against Russia's Choice and  presented such tough demands that Russia's Choice eventually  broke off talks, accusing the other three of making unreasonable  demands (Interfax, 7, 8 January).     Russia's Choice's negotiations with the other big blocs appeared  to alienate some potential allies among the other reformers, and  each of the three reformist blocs ended up supporting its own  candidate.  Russia's Choice backed Sergey Kovalev, while Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy's bloc pushed Vladimir Lukin, and Sergey Shakhray's  Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) pushed Shakhray (ITAR-  TASS, 12 January).  Shakhray assailed the big four parties for  conducting talks excluding smaller parties (Segodnya, Krasnaya  Zvezda, 5 January).  He appeared to look to independents and  regional deputies for allies, rather than to Russia's Choice.  When Shakhray finally gave up on his own hopes for the speaker's  post, he threw his support behind Vladimir Medvedev, nominee of a  newly created "New Regional Policy" group of independents (ITAR-  TASS, 13 January).     While reformers were in disarray, the CPRF, LDPR, and Agrarians  appeared able to work together closely.  Although they apparently  did not finally settle on one candidate until the opening of the  Duma, in late December Russia's Choice leader Arkadiy Murashev  already claimed that the three parties had secretly decided to  back the Agrarian Party's Rybkin for speaker (Nezavisimaya  Gazeta, 30 December). (See Note 1)  Segodnya on 5 January  concluded that Zhirinovskiy's party had decided to back Agrarian-  Communist candidate Rybkin--although Zhirinovskiy himself later  briefly sought the post, according to ITAR-TASS on 12 January.  Rybkin personifies the clear connection between the CPRF and  Agrarians since he is simultaneously an Agrarian Party leader and  deputy chairman of the CPRF.  In the old parliament he was leader  of the "Communists of Russia" faction.     (Note 1)  Selskaya Zhizn on 15 January asserted that Nikolay  Travkin's Democratic Party of Russia also joined in a coalition  with the Agrarians and CPRF, and Segodnya on 15 January wrote  that Travkin was allied with the Agrarians and CPRF in backing  Rybkin.     When the voting for speaker began on 12 January, it appeared that  even the anti-reform deal had broken down, as each individual  party nominated its own favorite candidate or candidates--ten in  all (Selskaya Zhizn, 15 January).  Four--Zhirinovskiy, Shakhray,  Anatoliy Lukyanov, and Valentin Kovalev--withdrew before the  voting (Izvestiya, 15 January).  Kovalev, a nonparty candidate  backed by the CPRF, withdrew in favor of Rybkin, while  Zhirinovskiy withdrew and the LDPR's secretary ordered its  deputies to back Yuriy Vlasov, candidate of the nationalist  Russian Way group (Izvestiya, 15 January).     The anti-reform parties apparently pushed through a proposal to  hold a preliminary vote to narrow the field of six remaining  candidates. Russia's Choice, now apparently courting the small  parties and independents, objected that this would be unfair to  small factions and independents (Interfax, 13 January).  In the  preliminary vote, deputies were able to vote for more than one  candidate (Izvestiya, 15 January), and two communist-conservative  candidates came out on top--Rybkin with 233 and Vlasov with 2OO  (ITAR-TASS, 13 january; Izvestiya, 15 January).  Russia's Choice  candidate Sergey Kovalev came out next to last with 138 votes  (Izvestiya, 15 january).  CPRF Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov, noting  the "democratic blocs' failure in the preliminary ballot,"  claimed that Russia's Choice had already begun to disintegrate  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 January).     When the formal secret balloting was held on 14 January, deputies  had a choice only between two anti-Yeltsin and anti-reform  candidates (See Box One).  Moreover, even that choice was largely  ended when Vlasov (who had worked with the CPRF leaders in the  recent past) announced before the vote that he would support  Rybkin (ITAR-TASS, 14 January).  Rybkin won with 223 votes (Radio  Mayak, 14 January), a bare majority of the 444 deputies but far  more than the strength of the combined CPRF-LDPR-Agrarian  factions (163), indicating he won the votes of many independents  and perhaps even some reformers.  It appears, however, that many  reformers did not vote at all:  Rybkin's vote was 223 for and 101  against, totalling only 324 of the 444 deputies, and only 334 (23  for, 311 against) voted on Vlasov (Radio Mayak, 14 January),  indicating that at least 110 deputies did not vote.  Yavlinskiy  and Shakhray announced that their factions had voted against both  candidates (Segodnya, 15 January).     Registration of Factions     The reformers' weakness and their foes' strength was also evident  in the registration of party factions at the opening of the Duma.  The official membership figures for each faction announced on 13  January indicate that Russia's Choice has considerably fewer  formal adherents than its leaders had previously claimed, while  the Agrarian faction ended up with many more than previous  figures had suggested.  Perhaps indicating a fluid boundary  between the Agrarian and CPRF factions, the CPRF faction has  shrunk, registering fewer members than ran under its banner in  the election.  Meanwhile, a newly.formed faction of  centrist  independents has displaced Zhirinovskiy's party as the second  largest in the Duma (See Box Two).     Reform Factions     The failure of the expected number of deputies to formally enroll  in the Russia's Choice faction suggests that the bloc--a hastily  formed coalition of reformist organizations--is already  fragmenting.  The first meeting of the Russia's Choice faction on  27 December had claimed 94 members, although only 65 attended  (Interfax, 28 December), and Gaydar on 9 January again claimed 94  (ITAR-TASS, 10 January).  Russia's Choice faction Secretary  Sergey Yushenkov on 18 January reported that the faction had  grown from 76 to 78 (Interfax, 18 january).     Although splintering into small factions is to a certain extent  discouraged by the Duma's decision to not allow the formation of  any faction smaller than 35 (See Box Three), some prominent  members of Russia's Choice have already declared their intention  to split off.  Finance Minister Boris Fedorov and lawyer Andrey  Makarov announced they were leaving Russia's Choice to join a new  faction--" the Union of 12 December"--being formed by Irina  Khakamada of the Economic Freedom Party and Moscow Deputy Premier  Aleksandr Braginskiy of the Russian Movement of Democratic  Reforms (Interfax, 18 January).  Fedorov indicated he was angry  that Gaydar decided to resign as first deputy premier without  consulting his cabinet colleagues, according to the 19 january  Segodnya, which also stated that many of the new Khakamada  faction had come from Russia's Choice.  Giving further indication  of dissention within Russia's Choice, Segodnya reported that some  Russia's Choice members had revolted against Gaydar at a meeting  just before the Duma opened, proposing to elect Gennadiy Burbulis  as faction head.     Members of the component groups of Russia's Choice appear to  behave as members of independent organizations making their own  policies.  Democratic Russia leaders Lev Ponomarev and Gleb  Yakunin recently threatened to withdraw support for Yeltsin and  the cabinet if he did not drop agriculture chief Aleksandr  Zaveryukha as deputy premier.  Complaining that the impending  reorganization of the cabinet may drop some reformist deputy  premiers while leaving Zaveryukha, who represents the Agrarian  Party "which consistently opposes reform policy and the  presidential decree on land," the DemRossiya leaders said their  party "will be forced to revise its course of supporting  presidential and government policy" if reformers are dropped and  Zaveryukha retained (Interfax, 12 January; Nezavisimaya Gazeta,  13 January).     Despite the fact that some Duma rules work against small  factions, Russia's Choice has been debating whether to split into  two big pseudo-independent factions for tactical reasons--to take  advantage of the privileges granted to factions by the new Duma  rules.  Each faction gets a vote in the Duma's presidium, and by  splitting Russia's Choice can have two votes (Segodnya, 18  January).  Russia's Choice Secretary Yushenkov explicitly  referred to such a strategy on 16 January (Interfax, 16 January).     While Russia's Choice has appeared to fragment and shrink,  Shakhray's reformist PRES registered a larger number of members  than included in the published lists of candidates and winners or  previous estimates.  This apparently reflects the recent decision  of a group of 20 "financial and industrial" independents led by  St. Petersburg entrepreneur Mark Goryachev, who was elected with  the support of the Civic Union, to join PRES, raising the  faction's size to 40 (ITAR-TASS, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 January;  Segodnya, 13 January).  Even with the addition, however, PRES has  officially registered only 30 members.     Anti-Reform Factions     The relatively large gain in registered members for the Agrarian  Party suggests that a number of rural officials--chiefs of local  agricultural administrations, farm managers, etc.--who did not  run as Agrarian Party candidates in the election have now joined  the faction to lobby for rural interests.  The size of the  Agrarian faction puts pressure on Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin to  retain Agrarian Party leader Zaveryukha, who has fought reformers  over agricultural subsidies, as a deputy premier.     The failure of all deputies elected as CPRF adherents to register  with their party faction suggests that the Communists, who have  heretofor appeared more disciplined than the looser blocs, may be  having some problems of factionalism or that they may be allowing  some members to form satellite factions.  The CPRF faction  registered only 45, even though 48 had been identified with the  CPRF in the list of winners.  One of the straying communists was  Anatoliy Lukyanov, who, even though running on the CPRF party  list, apparently did not join its faction, as the 12 january  Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported him trying to form a separate  conservative "Russian Way" faction.  Segodnya on 13 january  asserted that the CPRF had specifically sent Lukyanov and a group  of its members to help Vlasov form the "Russian Way" faction.     The LDPR's 63 fell slightly short of the number identified in the  list of winners and of party leaders' claims.  The list of  winners in the 28 December Rossiyskaya Gazeta identified 64 LDPR  members, while Zhirinovskiy had claimed 59 party list deputies  and 5 district deputies at the first meeting of the LDPR faction  on 10 january (ITAR-TASS, 10 january), and LDPR cochairman  Aleksandr Vengerovskiy on 11 january claimed his faction would  consist of the 59 party list deputies plus 6 district deputies,  totalling 65 (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 January).  In view of  Stankevich's statement that some deputies may still join  factions, stray LDPR deputies may simply be slow in joining their  party's faction.     Independents     In a move that may herald a resurrection of centrism in the Duma,  a mixed group of centrist industrialists and officials managed to  form the second largest faction, the "New Regional Policy"  faction.  Izvestiya on 14 January said that "judging by the  group's declaration," it wants to occupy the center ground  formerly held by the Civic Union, which failed to win the minimum  5 percent in the election.  The core of the faction, according to  Izvestiya, is the leaders of big enterprises, and it includes  almost all army generals elected to the Duma and varied members  ranging from representatives of republics headed by former CPSU  Secretary Aleksandr Dzasokhov (from North Ossetia) to  controversial millionaire businessman Artem Tarasov (from Moscow  city).  Izvestiya also saw a connection with Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin, since the premier's assistant Vladimir Kvasov  (Moscow Oblast), leader of the cabinet's apparat and recently  promoted to ministerial rank (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January),  joined the new faction.  So, according to Izvestiya, "the talk in  the Duma corridors is that the new association enjoys the  sympathy of the premier."     Implications     The reformist parties in the Duma appear to be compounding their  poor showing in the December elections through their inability to  cooperate to further common interests, and the main reformist  bloc--Russia's Choice--appears to be in danger of disintegrating.  In contrast, the anti-reform parties' ability to work together  (aided by partially overlapping leadership of the Agrarians and  Communists) thus far has allowed them to control key decisions  even though they do not actually have a majority of the Duma  within their own ranks.  This state of affairs bodes ill for  prospects for cooperation between President Yeltsin and the Duma,  but fortunately for Yeltsin, the new constitution allows him to  avoid an immediate potential confrontation by giving him the  power to appoint new members of the cabinet without seeking Duma  confirmation.     Box 1     Choice Between Two Anti-Yeltsin Candidates     The two candidates for Duma speaker--Ivan Rybkin from the  Agrarians and Communists and Yuriy Vlasov from the nationalist  "Russian Way" (ITAR-TASS, 13 January)--both appear anti-Yeltsin  and anti-reform, with Vlasov perhaps even more hostile to  reformers than Rybkin.     Rybkin is a somewhat reformist communist, who after the August  1991 putsch praised Aleksandr Yakovlev, Eduard Shevardnadze, and  Mikhail Gorbachev as the "intellectual nucleus" of the communist  party (Interfax, 10 September 1991).  But he also later defended  the CPSU against Yeltsin, joining with nationalist Sergey Baburin  and others to ask the Constitutional Court to review the  constitutionality of Yeltsin's ban on the CPSU (ITAR-TASS, 7 May  1992).  Long a prominent communist official, he had been second  secretary of the Volgograd CPSU Obkom, then coordinator of the  "Communists of Russia" faction in the old Russian parliament,  then head of the Russian Communist Party's Central Committee  Department for Ties with Soviets (Interfax, 10 September 1991).  In October 1991 he helped dissident communist Roy Medvedev  organize the "Socialist Workers Party" (Izvestiya, 11 October  1991; Interfax, 26 October 1991).  At the February 1993 congress  of the CPRF that elected Zyuganov chairman, Rybkin and present  Agrarian Party Chairman Mikhail Lapshin were elected deputy  chairmen (ITAR-TASS, 15 February 1993).  He, like Lapshin,  migrated to the new Agrarian Party later in 1993.  He opposed  Yeltsin's 21 September dissolution of parliament and worked in  the parliament during Yeltsin's September-October siege  (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 15 January).  After being elected speaker,  however, Rybkin pledged to cooperate with Yeltsin, to work for  consensus, and to "rise above his party allegiance" (ITAR-TASS,  14 January).  Segodnya on 15 January quoted one Russia's Choice  deputy characterizing Rybkin as an enlightened communst--someone  who rose "on the late Gorbachev wave" and "not some sort of  Zyuganov."     Vlasov, who won 200 votes in the first round of balloting,  initially had the reputation of a reformer but later emerged as a  radical nationalist and conservative.  A former champion weight  lifter who was elected to the USSR Congress of People's Deputies  in 1989, he won celebrity on 31 May 1989 by openly and harshly  denouncing the KGB at one of the first sessions of the congress  (Pravda, 2 June 1989), creating a sensation and helping to set a  new tone of outspokenness for the Soviet parliament, which for  the first time had been elected from among multiple candidates.  Since then, however, he has repeatedly worked with  ultranationalists and communists, for example, joining with Gen.  Albert Makashov, Aleksandr Nezvorov, Sazhi Umalatova, CPRF  Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov, and Zhirinovskiy at a mid-1992  "Russian National Convention" (ITAR-TASS, 12 June 1992; Radio  Rossii, 15 June 1992), and in October 1993 becoming the No. 1  candidate for conservative Viktor Aksyuchits's Christian  Democratic Movement (Izvestiya, 19 October 1993), which, however,  failed to get enough signatures to get on the December ballot.  Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported on 12 January 1994 that he was  working with communist leader Anatoliy Lukyanov, Baburin, and  Nezvorov to get enough members to register a nationalist "Russian  Way" faction in the Duma.  In his speech as a candidate for  speaker at the Duma session, Vlasov bluntly told Russia's Choice  that "I have opposed you and will continue to do so" (Izvestiya,  15 January).     End Box 1     Box 2     Size of Factions     Chairman of the State Duma's temporary secretariat Sergey  Stankevich announced on 13 January that nine factions have been  registered and gave the size of each faction.  He cautioned that  "these figures were not final because deputies were continuing to  apply for membership" in the factions (Interfax, 13 January).  In  addition to the eight parties apparently automatically entitled  to faction status for clearing the 5 percent barrier in the  election, a group of independents--the New Regional Policy group-  -registered as a faction.  The figures given by Stankevich add up  to 386 of the 444 elected deputies, indicating that 58 are still  unassociated with any faction.

This has been the highest count for all parties except  Yavlinskiy's to appear anywhere.  Candidates from the Civic  Union, the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, Dignity and  Charity, and Future of Russia also won some district seats (see  the Trends of 5 January 1994, page 15, 18), but these factions  had too few deputies to form a faction.     ****Stankevich said 75, according to the 13 january Interfax, but  the 14 January Izvestiya and Trud accounts said 76.     End Box 2     Box 3     Minimum Size for Factions     The Duma after much wrangling decided on 11 january that factions  must have at least 35 members (ITAR-TASS, 11 January; Segodnya,  12 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Krasnaya Zvezda, 13 January).  Although some groups have responded to this minimum requirement  by joining other factions and abandoning ambitions to go it  alone, others persist in efforts to attract enough members to  constitute a separate faction.  According to the 14 january  Izvestiya, an "industrial and financial" group failed to gather  enough members to form a faction, apparently prompting it to join  PRES (ITAR-TASS, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 january).  Izvestiya on  14 January said that a "patriotic" group led by former CPSU  Politburo member Lukyanov was still trying to form a faction,  while Nezavisimaya Gazeta on 12 January said that nationalist  Baburin was forming a "Russian Way" group with Lukyanov,  extremist television commentator Nezvorov, and Vlasov, but still  had not reached 35.  Segodnya on 13 January asserted that Vlasov  had asked the CPRF to send some of its members to join his group  to make it big enough to be a faction and that a group of  communists led by Lukyanov had responded.  Izvestiya reported  that Economic Freedom Party leader Khakamada had failed to form a  faction and had joined Russia's Choice, but later reports  indicated Khakamada's "Union of 12 December" group was growing  and may reach 35.  Interfax reported on 16 january that  Khakamada's faction had already gathered 23 members and Segodnya  on 19 january reported it had 22 members and "verbal assurances"  of joining from 8 others.     The 35-member minimum did not disbar the parties that made it  over the 5 percent threshold in the party list voting but  received fewer than 35 seats--PRES with 30, the Yavlinskiy bloc  with 25, Women of Russia with 23, Democratic Party of Russia  (DPR) with 15--from being officially recognized as factions.

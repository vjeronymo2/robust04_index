In the course of this meeting, the esteemed leader offered  congratulations to the world Muslims and the proud nation of  Iran on the eve of mission of the last of the prophets, Muhammad  son of 'Abdallah, may God's peace and salutations be upon him  and his scion.    His eminence referred to events of 19 Dey 1356 [9 January  1978] as the beginning of a great development, which led to the  destruction of the monarchy in Iran, shook America and the  reactionary regimes, and established an Islamic government.    Ayatollah Khamene'i described each event of the Islamic  revolution's 15-year history as a great lesson for the Muslim  nation of Iran and said: The independent and liberated Iranian  nation is fully aware and is armed with ample valuable  experience gained during the war and the life of the Islamic  Republic of Iran; thanks to this experience, no power and no  government would dare enter the arena of a military conflict  against the iron-clenched fist of our nation.    The leader of the Islamic revolution drew attention of the  Iranian nation to the conspiracy hatched by the enemies of Islam  to create discord, to undermine the people's solidarity and  unity, and to promote suspicion among the people vis-a-vis the  state authorities and the Islamic regime, and added: Today any  speech or written words, and any move, which might create doubt  among the Iranian nation about its last proud 15 years, the era  of his eminence Imam [Khomeyni] -- may God be satisfied with his  deeds -- about the performance of the authorities, and about the  stances and the course of the revolution, would serve the  particular interests of the enemy. Every individual must  vigilantly watch for the enemy's conspiracies and enticements.    Referring to the pressure exerted on the European  governments  by America to win their support in the confrontation against  Iran, the esteemed leader said: As the ringleader of arrogance,  America has pleaded with the European governments to refrain  from commercial transactions with Iran and from the sale of  commodities, which the Iranian nation needs to rebuild the  country, but the big European governments, which enjoy common  sense and realize the importance of Iran and its regime, have  rejected U.S. demands and ignored its enticement.    Referring to the claim that the faith, the sincere  sentiments, and the revolutionary fervor of the Iranian nation  have subsided, Ayatollah Khamene'i termed the claim as a vague  imagination and added: The Iranian nation is a revolutionary  nation and will never sever its ties with the revolution. Thanks  to divine assistance, this revolution will bring such prosperity  to this nation's life and after-life, that it will become an  example to other nations. However, the realization of this  important matter requires our endeavor, patience, cooperation,  solidarity, sympathy, and our ability to recognize the enemy.    Ayatollah Khamene'i described the magnification of Iran's  internal difficulties as a propaganda ploy employed by the enemy  with the objective of creating despondency and despair among the  people.    In conclusion, stressing the need for confronting the  enemy's  enticement of doom and gloom, Ayatollah Khamene'i called upon  every level of the people to perform their duties properly and  sincerely in whatever job they are doing.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Treasury expands defences to insider dealing charges NEW LEGAL defences against the charge of insider dealing have been drawn up by the Treasury to ease City fears that legislation would interfere with the normal workings of the financial markets. However, there will be no changes to the legislation following the conviction of Mr Thorold Mackie, the Scottish analyst found guilty of insider dealing in March. The case prompted fears among other analysts that they were open to conviction for passing on information given them by company directors in the normal course of their jobs. The proposed new legislation, prompted by the EC's Insider Dealing Directive, is due to enter committee stage in the House of Commons within two weeks. Earlier drafts met with widespread criticism in the City, prompting the Treasury to rewrite the proposals at least once. The latest draft, due to be sent to trade associations and others in the City yesterday afternoon, expands the range of defences in the bill. It is intended to offer greater protection to City professionals whose normal activities would have fallen foul of what was previously a widely-drawn bill. Underwriters in particular feared they could be open to prosecution. Parts of the legislation have been reworded to make it clearer, and more detail has been included to define more precisely what would constitute insider dealing. Financial institutions had been concerned about when information had been 'made public', taking it outside the scope of inside information. An official said the Treasury had scrapped its plan to publish guidance on what 'made public' meant, and had decided instead to include a definition in the act. In future, it will include all announcements made to the financial markets in compliance with an exchange's rules, as well as information which is 'readily accessible to investors.' Referring to the position of brokers' analysts, the official said: 'This legislation is substantially identical to our current law. In private meetings, you should not give out price sensitive information. If you're in any doubt the prudent thing to do is to ask.' See Lex</p>

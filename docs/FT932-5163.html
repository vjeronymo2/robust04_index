			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Poland to press on with privatisation THE POLISH government will press on with its mass privatisation programme, despite a parliamentary elections set for September 19, Ms Hanna Suchocka, prime minister, has confirmed, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The programme was approved by the now-dissolved Polish parliament and the government hopes to have it in operation by the beginning of next year, as planned. Meanwhile, the government is seeking to limit delays to implementation of its mass privatisation plan. A crucial element is the selection of 20 investment funds (NFIs), run by foreign and domestic managers, which will own up to 600 state sector enterprises. Shares in the NFIs funds are to sold early next year for a nominal sum to all adult Poles who apply. Western commercial bankers in the London Club have asked for a postponement, till the end of this month, of a meeting planned for next Wednesday in Paris to negotiate a cut in Poland's Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 7.8bn) bank debt. Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, Poland's chief debt negotiator, said yesterday that the delay was to give the banks time to digest the results of a report commissioned by them on the condition of Poland's economy. The request for the delay was 'a good sign' that the next round of talks would be well prepared, he added.</p>

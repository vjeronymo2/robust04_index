			<p>CSO     [Text] "Szocske" (Grasshopper) the fantastically baptized  all-terrain light military vehicle has been developed, based on  the similar American vehicle's success in the Gulf War, at the  private company of Laszlo Jeno, a former department chief within  the military industry establishment. A component of the MP's  (Hungarian Army's) long range planning, the development will go  into series production not earlier than 1995. MH approved the  plans--selected through bidding--in 1991. The 40-employee Gepfet  company built the first prototype at a time when Laszlo Jeno was  still state secretary in the defense ministry. "Presently",  Laszlo Jeno informed us," the firm is building three more  prototypes equipped with diverse options." Then he added: "in my  estimation this all-terrain vehicle with a Volkswagen engine,  fit also for civilian use, would cost at today's prices from  2-to-3 million forints." According to Army experts, development  of the prototype had cost 6 million, while Laszlo Jeno estimates  all development expenses to be around 30 million forints; 40  percent contributed by his own company, 20 percent each by Raba,  Malev and Technoimpex, the owners of Gepfet, and the rest from  credits.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Moscow ecologist wins the David Thomas prize THE 1992 David Thomas Prize has been awarded to Dr Olga Speranskaya, aged 29, an ecologist from Moscow. She received the Pounds 2,000 prize from Ms Jenny Rossiter, who chaired the trustees, at a ceremony at the Financial Times headquarters in London last night. The prize has been established in memory of David Thomas, the FT Resources Editor, who died last April with Alan Harper, an FT photographer, in an accident in Kuwait. Candidates had to write on the topic 'What will the collapse of Communism do to the Environment?', and submit a proposal on how they would use the award to explore the theme further. Dr Speranskaya, whose visit to London is her first trip outside the former Soviet Union, intends to use her prize to travel to the Lake Baikal region to study the extent of the environmental and ecological problems. Dr Speranskaya - a graduate of Moscow State University - is the Moscow representative at the International Baikal Region's Ecological Security Centre but has never been able to visit the area. Lake Baikal, in Siberia, is the deepest fresh-water lake in the world. It is roughly the size of Belgium and is heavily polluted from pulp and paper mills.</p>

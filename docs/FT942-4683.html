			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (5): The faces to watch, as the country moves to proportional representation JIM BOLGER: prime minister and leader of the conservative National party, which narrowly retained power in the November 1993 election. A practising Catholic and North Island farmer, Bolger has never been a charismatic figure to the electorate. But he won plaudits for a statesmanlike performance on election night, and has demonstrated a speedy grasp of consensus politics. His recent decision to raise the 'republic' issue has been more puzzling: opinion polls indicate that the majority of New Zealanders don't favour the introduction an elected 'presidential' head of state to replace the Governor-General, appointed by the Queen. HELEN CLARK: leader of the main opposition Labour party, who took over from Mike Moore shortly after November's election. A former lecturer in politics at Auckland University, she has the difficult task of articulating a centre-left policy which distinguishes Labour from National, yet eschews the more radical changes promised by the Alliance. Internal party warfare with her predecessor and his supporters does not make the job any easier. Her low popularity ratings have led to talk of further leadership changes - although such gossip has been strongly denied to date. MIKE MOORE: The one-time builders' labourer was a member of the Lange government which initiated New Zealand's reforms in the mid-1980s. He became leader of the ruling Labour party in 1990 shortly before the October election, but his popularity failed to save Labour's fortunes then, or in 1993. Moore performed poorly amid November's election night uncertainties, and was soon ousted by Helen Clark. Since then, he has hinted at the formation of a new centre-left party but, for the moment, remains within the Labour party. A passionate speaker, Moore still commands substantial loyalty among the electorate and within his party. JIM ANDERTON: A former Labour party president who broke away to form the New Labour party in 1989, and then forged the Alliance, a coalition of five left-leaning minor parties, in 1991. The Alliance won more than 18 per cent of the popular vote in November, but only two seats. The grouping sometimes looks shaky, but Anderton has strong personal support. He has also handled a number of recent issues - such as the collapse of Fortex meat business, a major NZ employer - adroitly. The Alliance, which derives support from traditional Labour voters dissatisfied with the party's centerist leanings, looks likely to be the clear winner from the move to MMP. WINSTON PETERS: A former National party cabinet minister, Peters split to become an independent MP and then formed New Zealand First in July last year. Its policies going into the 1993 election were not well-detailed, but it is generally pro-business and has a slightly xenophobic tinge - witness Peters' recent urgings for a tougher immigration policy. Often viewed as a maverick but charismatic politician, he has a reputation for revealing alleged scandals under parliamentary privilege. Earlier this year, his attention focused on financial abuses supposedly occuring in the Cook Islands and involving NZ businessmen and international figures. SIR ROGER DOUGLAS: The former finance minister set New Zealand on the path to economic reform, but resigned after differences with the then-prime minister, David Lange. Sir Roger has now left the Labour party and is widely expected to turn his Association of Consumers and Taxpayers, a free-market ginger group, into a political party. The ACT has support from the business community, and is generally in favour of a minimalist approach by government. Douglas recently published Unfinished Business, a 300-page dissertation on New Zealand's economic and political situation, suggesting that the reform process has further to go.</p>

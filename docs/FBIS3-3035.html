			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yang Zhenwu (2799 2182 2976) and </F> XINHUA reporters He Ping (0149 1627) and Xu Jiangshan (1776 3068  0810)]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, CPC  Central Committee general secretary and state president, called  on the Fujian delegation to the second plenary session of the  Eighth National People's Congress this morning. He also  participated in discussions held by the Qinghai and Liaoning  delegations. Jiang Zemin emphasized: Now that the guiding  principles and major policies have been decided, the key to  achieving success is to get down to work in a concerted way.  Nationwide, we should always pay priority attention to two  major issues. One is the rural economy; and the other is large  and medium-sized state enterprises. When agriculture is truly  enhanced as the foundation of the national economy, when  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are truly  invigorated, when the worker-peasant alliance under the new  situation is truly enhanced, and when, as a result, work in all  other areas is advanced and the unity of all nationalities is  consolidated, China's reform, development, and stability will be  reliably guaranteed.    At the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People, Jiang  Zemin told the Fujian deputies: Fujian and Taiwan -- China's  precious island -- face each other across the Strait. Fujian's  development has a special meaning and impact. It is necessary  to deepen reform, opening up wider, improve the investment  environment, attract investment by Taiwan compatriots and  overseas Chinese, promote Cross-Strait economic cooperation and  trade, and develop Cross- Strait exchanges so as to make still  greater contributions to the peaceful reunification of the  motherland.    "Zha xi de le!" [preceding words in Tibetan] As Jiang Zemin  arrived at the Qinghai Hall, the deputies, who were warmly  discussing the government work report, happily greeted him in a  style unique to Tibetans. Applause and laughter interweaved as  they presented the general secretary a hada [a piece of silk  used as a greeting gift among Tibetans] and a cup of liquor made  of highland barley.    After hearing the speeches by Wang Hanmin, Qinghai executive  vice governor, and Dajie, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefectural  Government head, Jiang Zemin said: Qinghai is a province where  people of minority nationalities live in compact communities.  In the socialist big family, we should promote the  inter-ethnic relations of harmony, equality, mutual assistance,  unity and cooperation, and steer a course toward common  prosperity. This represents an essential guarantee for the  success of our causes and it also represents the common wishes  of people of all nationalities.    Jiang Zemin expressed the hope that people of all  nationalities in Qinghai will further enhance ethnic unity,  fully and correctly implement the policy concerning religion,  maintain social stability, and bring about smooth progress in  reform and opening up amid stability. He emphasized that  economic development of ethnic regions must be firmly based on  local conditions and full utilization of local advantages. The  key is to develop resources. They should boldly introduce  foreign investment and undertake joint development. Meanwhile,  the state must also do its best to help them. Other regions --  the developed coastal regions in particular -- should actively  help them so that all ethnic groups and all regions will develop  side by side toward common prosperity.    In the Liaoning Hall, Jiang Zemin discussed ways to deepen  reform and quickly invigorate state-owned enterprises with  delegates from Liaoning, a province with a concentration of  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises.    After hearing a speech by Liaoning Governor Yue Qifeng on  strengthening agriculture and invigorating state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises, Jiang Zemin said happily: Liaoning is  a major industrial province. After years of hard work, it is  now self sufficient in meat, eggs, poultry, and vegetables.  This is inspiring news. It represents a historic change for  Liaoning Province. He continued: Liaoning has many large and  medium-sized enterprises. If these enterprises are invigorated  in an all-round way, it will have a big impact on the  rejuvenation of Liaoning and the country as a whole. You have  upheld a policy of "emphasizing less on new projects and more on  technical innovations." You have devoted major efforts to  invigorate such enterprises mainly by way of technology  upgrading. This policy is absolutely correct. It is very good  news. It is hoped that Liaoning will create more good  experience in invigorating state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises.    To accelerate the establishment of a socialist market  economic system and to improve macroeconomic regulation,  control, and management, Jiang Zemin once again called on the  leading cadres to study harder. He pointed out: Many party and  government officials used to work in the fields of natural  sciences and engineering. Today, however, they are taking the  reins of economic development at central and local levels. They  need to make up their missed lessons. They should learn more  about basic Marxist economic theories, especially Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's economic thinking, and general knowledge about the  market economy. This is an urgent task. They should learn on  the job and put into practice what they have learned so that  they will quickly improve their leadership skills in developing  China's socialist economy.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Russia ploughs a new furrow down on farm MR YEVGENY Mikheyev, director of the Niva farm near Nizhny Novogorod, flung open the door of a cowshed and declared: 'We need reform to make this farm work] We have to get rid of the layabouts and the drunks]' It is a sentiment that could prove important, not just around Nizhny Novogorod, but across Russia. Yesterday in Moscow, Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, together with the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm, unveiled an agricultural reform programme designed to break up Russia's vast state system. And as Niva is one of six farms to pilot the scheme, the fate of its reforms is likely to be a crucial test, as Russia tackles the sector of its economy most resistant to change. Mr Gaidar said a policy to redistribute agricultural land should be introduced across Russia, supported by a decree - expected to be signed this week by President Boris Yeltsin - revoking an effective ban on the sale of land, paving the way for mortgages, leasing and trading. The moratorium on sales or leases has been a key factor blocking real change. The Russian government has introduced some reforms in the past two years, creating a new class of 'private' farmers, and forcing the state farms to register as independent 'companies', but the impact has been limited. Private farmers still control less than 4 per cent of registered farm land and the 'reorganisation' of the state farms, which control more than 90 per cent of land, has largely been theoretical. But though the need for market reforms is clear, the strong collective traditions of the Russian farmers have left the reformers facing a serious logistical problem: how do you break up huge farms in a manner that seems equitable, without creating unworkably small plots of land? The solution that the IFC and Nizhny Novogorod leaders proposed to the villagers in Niva last weekend is based around two key concepts. The first is a land and property certificate, an elegant piece of paper awarding each member of the farm a share of the land and property. Although the land is divided equally the property shares are graded by job and age. The second key concept is an 'auction', which determines which farmers get which pieces of land. Although the IFC hopes that in most cases this will be decided by mutual agreement, competing demands will be decided by an auction, using the property certificates to 'bid' for disputed pieces of land. Mr Viktor Khlystun, agriculture minister, stressed yesterday that there would be some limits on the sales. Outsiders - and by implication, foreigners - would not be allowed to buy land at the expense of local villagers, since 'it would be wrong for a citizen to acquire land to hire labour', he said. The type of farm which will emerge from this scheme is deliberately left unclear. The crucial aspect is that the scheme allows farmers to trade, sell or lease their certificates. Thus they can farm alone, join together in a collective, or even 'sell' their land to a individual in the village. As Mr Boris Nemtsov, reformist governor of Nizhny Novogorod, explains: 'The essence of this is choice.' Whether the villagers themselves want it is unclear. At the meeting in Niva to hand out certificates, opinions varied sharply. Although Mr Mikheyev is enthusiastic and some villagers are vowing to go it alone, others angrily supported the old system; many more seemed simply confused. Ultimately, the scheme's success will depend on how many other farm directors like Mr Mikheyev can be found, and how far they can persuade the rest of the farmers to follow them.</p>

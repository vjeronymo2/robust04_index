"The governing coalition's management of parliamentary  affairs and its political stance are extremely autocratic and  authoritarian, and it is undeniable that it is moving in the  direction of fascist politics," the group said in a statement.    "This is a crisis of democracy, and it is now an urgent  political task to launch an antifascism and prodemocracy  movement," it said.    The group led by House of Representatives member Yoshinobu  Shimamura issued the appeal after a meeting that brought  together 32 LDP legislators, one former LDP lawmaker and 31  proxies of politicians.    It also sought advance enactment of anticorruption measures  without changing the electoral system for the lower house.    The lower house election system should be amended along with  the systems for House of Councillors and local government polls  after ruling and opposition parties reach a consensus, the group  said.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political  fate on enactment of a reform package featuring electoral  changes and stricter controls on campaign funding before the  current extraordinary Diet session ends on January 29.</p>

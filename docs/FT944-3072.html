It wants them to shoulder the cost of any excess claims at the end of the 10-year period. Texas said yesterday: 'The trust fund was based on a calculation by actuaries of the number of people likely to come back in 2002 and ask for their money back. But the insurance against excess claims turns out to have been placed with a lesser-rated insurance company.' The DIY retailer could not provide figures for the number of customers who had taken up the special offer - although the then chairman Mr Ron Trenter said at the time that kitchen sales had tripled. Texas said yesterday the amount of money involved was 'not material as far as the company is concerned'.

It added: 'This was effectively just another deep discount offer.'</p>

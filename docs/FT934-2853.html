			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Apportioning pension blame (1) Sir, Tom Shucksmith makes an important point in his letter ('SIB tackling pensions transfer problem from wrong end', December 7) and one which must be of concern to all actuaries. But the bottom line surely is that anyone who holds himself out as a financial adviser should know that in all probability a cash equivalent is not equivalent to the deferred benefits given up and should advise accordingly. It is that end of the problem which is being tackled - and rightly so. K M R Price, actuary, NFU Mutual &amp; Avon Group, Tiddington Road, Stratford-upon-Avon CV 37 7BJ</p>

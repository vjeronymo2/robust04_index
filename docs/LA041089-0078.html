			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW VOICE MAIL WORKS  </P> <P> When Contel of California pioneered residential "voice mail" in the high desert  area surrounding Victorville last year, the phone company discovered a problem:  Potential customers didn't know what it was. Many still don't, apparently.  </P> <P> "We've found that they don't understand what voice mail is and they don't know  what 'voice mailbox' means," said Alice Camuti, Contel marketing coordinator.  "One big obstacle is this low level of awareness."  </P> <P> Still, "voice mail" is a relatively simple concept. It is basically a way of  getting messages through your phone system at work or at home without  installing additional equipment, such as a telephone answering machine, or  hiring an answering service.  </P> <P> The technology is built into the telephone network -- a software program hooked  up to the phone company's switch serving a community (such as San Pedro, where  Pacific Bell began offering the service this month). All the customer needs is  a push-button phone that emits tones enabling it to communicate with computers.  </P> <P> Voice mail allows customers to have their phones "answered" automatically in  their absence or even while on another call. Calls are routed automatically to  an electronic "mailbox" or "message center."  </P> <P> On reaching the center, the caller hears the customer's own recorded greeting,  or a generic one provided by the system, followed by an invitation to leave a  message. Customers know that a message has been left when they get a stuttering  dial tone upon lifting the receiver.  </P> <P> If both callers are in the same community and both have voice mail, they can  also send messages to each other through the system. The messaging capability  lets a user send the same message to a number of people all with one call.  Someone in charge of a car pool, for instance, might call in a message to the  voice mail system and then have it transmitted to everyone involved in the  pool. Or if inspiration strikes at midnight, you can record a message then and  have it sent out during business hours.  </P> <P> In its two test markets -- the other being Milpitas in Silicon Valley --  Pacific Bell is inviting its customers to open a "message box" to receive  messages at no charge as an inducement to build a broadly based community  messaging network. For a modest monthly charge, additional boxes can be  assigned to other members of a household, offering private message storage not  available on a single answering machine.  </P> <P> For those who want to be able to send messages as well -- in other words, to  have more than just an answering machine -- the charge is $6 a month for  residential customers and $12 for small businesses. (This month only, the  company is waiving a one-time installation fee of $7 for residential customers  and $15 for small businesses.)  </P> <P> Residential and small-business customers alike pay 25 cents for each message  that they send to another message box in their community. If one message is  sent to more than one party, the additional, automatically routed transmissions  cost 15 cents each.  </P> <P> There's one thing that voice mail doesn't have, however, that answering  machines feature: the ability to screen calls, listening to incoming messages  without picking up the phone.

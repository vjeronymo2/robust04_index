			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Parkfield to go into voluntary liquidation THE ADMINISTRATION of Parkfield Group, the entertainments and engineering group that collapsed last year with liabilities of more than Pounds 300m, is to be ended and the company put into creditors' voluntary liquidation. In the High Court yesterday the administrators - three partners in Cork Gully - applied to discharge the administration order, made by the court last July. Their counsel, Mr Robin Dicker, said they would be putting Pounds 2.64m  - the maximum claimed by outstanding preferential creditors of the company - into a trust account. Any balance left would be remitted to the company. A resolution for winding-up would be put to a members' meeting next Tuesday. It was envisaged that the administrators would become the company's liquidators, Mr Dicker said. Deputy judge John Weeks, QC, said that discharge of the administration order would be conditional upon the winding-up resolution being passed. The administrators would be released 21 days after they had filed their final accounts, on condition that there was no objection from any creditor or third party before then. After yesterday's hearing, the administrators' lawyers said the purpose of the administration, a more advantageous realisation of Parkfield's assets thanwould have been possible in a compulsory liquidation, had been achieved. Most of the parts of the business capable of being sold had been sold and most of the assets realised. The sooner a liquidation began, the sooner there could be a distribution to creditors.</p>

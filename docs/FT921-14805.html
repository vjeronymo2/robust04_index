			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US auto makers seek urgent talks with Japanese THE chairmen of the big three US car makers are seeking an urgent meeting next month in the US with Japanese auto industry leaders to continue pressure on Japan to reduce its trade surplus with the US following last week's visit by President Bush to Tokyo. Mr Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, the world's largest car maker which is currently running up record losses, insisted that the visit by President Bush with an American business delegation had been 'a historic trip'. The visit had strengthened ties between US government and US business. The Department of Commerce had become 'pro-American business and activist', he said. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democrat chairman of the Senate finance committee, has repeated claims that the Dollars 41bn (Pounds 23bn) trade deficit with Japan had cost 800,000 American jobs. The US auto industry is disappointed by the small concessions made by the big five Japanese car makers towards reducing the trade deficit. It is eager to exploit mounting protectionist sentiments in the US in order to put renewed pressure on Japanese car makers to take voluntary actions to curb the deficit. General Motors, which last month announced a programme to close 21 plants and cut its workforce by 74,000 in the next four years, has felt itself forced reluctantly to join the mounting campaign against Japan by qualifying its previously staunch support for free trade. 'I like free trade, but I want fair trade,' said Mr Stempel. 'It is a subtle difference, but it is a difference. 'That was why we could go united to Tokyo.' It was this change that enabled Mr Stempel to share a platform last week in Japan with Mr Lee Iacocca, the strongly protectionist chairman of Chrysler, who launched a vitriolic attack against Japan last Friday on his return from Tokyo accusing Japan of 'predatory' trade practices. Mr Stempel claimed that the Japanese car industry was the only one not to cut its stock levels in America at the beginning of last year in the face of the deepening US recession.</p>

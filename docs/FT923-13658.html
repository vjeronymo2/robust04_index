			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Letter: Unworthy contention Sir, I write in response to Mr Dominic Lawson's column ('Blood on their cheque books', July 4) to put the record straight on a number of points he raised about pictures published in the Sunday Times Magazine. Colorific represents the New York news and feature agency Black Star, which distributed Bruce Haley's photographs from Burma of the killing performed by a member of the Karen National Liberation Army. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the motives of the editor of The Sunday Times Magazine in publishing the photographs, but I should make it clear that Bruce Haley, like countless news photographers before him, had to make the choice whether to document the events happening before him or to do nothing. Certainly he had no indication of what was about to happen, and to have attempted to prevent the killing would probably have resulted in more bloodshed. To imply, as Mr Lawson does, that the events were staged for him is to impute to Haley motives totally uncharacteristic of this photographer. Haley chose to take the photographs, and I know he feels that their publication (and they have been published in America) might highlight the full horror of such senseless acts of savagery. It is highly arguable whether Haley's presence exacerbated the situation, and I find Mr. Lawson's contention that Haley choreographed the execution unworthy of a journalist of his standing.

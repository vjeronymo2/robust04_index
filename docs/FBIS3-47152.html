			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Dubious U.S.-North Korean Nuclear Negotiations"] </F>   [Text] It can only be desirable that because North Korea  has decided to receive nuclear inspections of the seven nuclear  facilities in Yongbyon and begins negotiations for inspections  with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], a clue to  the solution of North Korea's nuclear issue could be found. It  has been learned that the United States and North Korea have  reached an agreement that if the IAEA begins inspections of  North Korea's nuclear facilities, the discontinuation of the  Team Spirit exercise should be announced and the third round of  U.S.-North Korean talks should begin. Because the third round  of U.S.-North Korean talks is expected to discuss the issue of  improving U.S.-North Korean relations and economic cooperation  and is expected to greatly change and develop North Korean-U.S.  and North Korea-Japanese relations, attention is focused on the  sincerity of North Korea, which is to receive inspections.    However, as we watch the solution of North Korea's nuclear  issue, we have mixed feelings and are rather displeased because  there are not just one or two dubious things about the  U.S.-North Korean negotiations. First, even though it is said  that North Korea's nuclear issue is "nearly settled," the United  States and North Korea have not revealed the contents of the  agreements they have reached. That is, they have not revealed  what procedure and which method will be used to resolve North  Korea's nuclear issue. We cannot know whether there is a tacit  understanding with the ROK or the issue of persuading the ROK  has not been completed. Second, the opinions of the United  States and North Korea over the method of inspecting the seven  facilities are incongruous. We are bewildered because North  Korea says that it will receive the IAEA's nuclear inspection  just once; the United States stresses that the continuity of  nuclear safeguards accord should be maintained. Third, when on  earth can the North-South dialogue be resumed in the wake of the  "settlement" and what will become of mutual nuclear inspections?  This question is as obscure as ever. We cannot but doubt about  why our government keeps silent even though it has stressed  close cooperation with the United States.    We should never overlook the "just one inspection" if it is  true, as claimed by North Korea. The fact that just in order to  reinspect the seven facilities, a year after the IAEA already  inspected them as many as six times in 1992, and in order to  replace the monitoring films and batteries, the United States  has been strained for nearly 10 months over the North Korea's  nuclear commotions and that it will offer diplomatic relations  and economic cooperation to North Korea cannot be anything but  nonsense.    When the main U.S. press pointed out that the one time  inspection is a great concession, the U.S. Government, saying  "inspecting seven facilities is a great advance," stressed the  continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. The United States  may think that North Korea will be forced to constantly receive  inspections in exchange for economic cooperation. However, it  is doubtful whether North Korea will truly and easily respond to  receiving inspections.    Regarding the issue of resuming North-South dialogue and  mutual inspections, after the summit talks with President  Clinton last November, President Kim Yong-sam stressed that the  solution of North Korea's nuclear issue involves "a thorough and  broad-scale approach method." Speaking at the New Year's press  conference, President Kim Yong-sam said "dialogue and mutual  inspections cannot be absolutely excluded" in resolving North  Korea's nuclear issue and "it is the firm position of the United  States and the ROK that the IAEA inspections and mutual  inspections should be conducted at the same time." However, the  U.S. side still has not announced a clear schedule, nor has it  declared its promise to put into practice mutual inspections.    In fact, if North Korea's nuclear transparency could be  completely ensured through any organization or method, we would  not need to insist on mutual inspections. The IAEA can inspect  the facilities that North Korea reported to the IAEA. On the  other hand, mutual inspections means that each party can  mutually inspect all facilities, including the facilities that  are not reported. Thus, mutual inspections should be realized  without fail. Of course, U.S.-North Korean negotiations have  not been completed yet and we will have to watch the first step  taken by the U.S. and North Korea, that is, the IAEA-North  Korean inspection negotiations. However, all suspicions should  be cleared up without fail. The government should explain the  process of nuclear negotiations and the direction the solution  of the nuclear issue is taking.</p>

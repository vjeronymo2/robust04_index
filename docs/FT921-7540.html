			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Satellite communication licences awarded TWO companies were licensed yesterday to provide international satellite communications services. British Aerospace Communications and Alpha Lyracom, the US private satellite operator, plan to provide a range of voice and data services by installing satellite dishes on office roofs. They are expected to provide a new form of competition to the international services run by BT and Mercury Communications. The government has awarded the licences as part of its policy of liberalising the telecommunications market following last year's review of the BT/Mercury duopoly. The market for satellite communications has developed quickly in the US where there are nearly 70,000 dishes in use, according to Comsys, a specialist UK market research company. In Europe, however, the market has been slow to develop because of tight regulations which are now being relaxed. Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, claimed the UK had 'gone further than any other country in liberalising satellite networks'. He said other applications to provide similar services would be considered on their merits. BAe already has similar satellite licences in France and Germany. It is also part of a multinational consortium that plans to build and launch the Dollars 500m (Pounds 284m) Orion satellite system in 1995. Alpha Lyracom has satellite licences in France, Germany and the US. Its first Pan American Satellite has been in operation for several years and several more are planned to be launched over the next few years. The new licences are unrestricted for data services but have one important restriction if they are used for voice services. They will only be allowed to connect with the public telephone network in either the UK or a foreign country but not with both at the same time. The government yesterday also awarded four radio-based data communications licences. The operators, which have already been providing data services under a more strict regime, are: Cognito, Hutchinson Mobile Data, Paknet and Ram. Mr Lilley said the Department of Trade and Industry had received 20 other firm applications for telecommunications licences since the market was liberalised last year, and 30 indications of strong interest from companies. The DTI said there would be a 'rolling programme' under which perhaps one new licence would be awarded every month. The DTI also confirmed it was close to licensing a new type of international operator to lease telecommunications capacity in bulk from BT and Mercury and re-sell it.

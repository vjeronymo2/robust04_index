			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally eases as Bank plans issue UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied further yesterday as the cash market rose by up to half a point and caught up with the gains made by gilts futures on Tuesday. However, news that the Bank of England is issuing a further Pounds 1bn of stock helped erode some of the gains later in the day. The Bank is issuing a Pounds 1bn tranche of 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock due 1998, with a further Pounds 100m of the bonds issued to the National Debt Commissioners. This will increase the total size of the issue to Pounds 2.1bn. The bonds, which are partly paid, are being offered at 25 29/32 . US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as professional traders took profits after Tuesday's advance and were light buyers of shorter-term securities. In the last full trading session of 1992 many dealers were on the sidelines, with traders willing to wait until the new year to set new positions. At mid-afternoon the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  1/4 lower at 102 29/32 , yielding 7.377 per cent. Among shorter-dated maturities, the two-year note rose  3/32 to yield 4.526 per cent. The Federal funds rate dipped to 2 1/2 per cent, with the Fed refraining from market intervention. Two-year notes took mild support from news that US new home sales in November fell 8.3 per cent. The weakness in the housing sector was unexpected, and was contrary to forecasts of a 0.4 per cent advance. SPANISH government bonds ended lower after the Treasury allocated a larger-than-expected amount of paper at yesterday's bond auction. Yields on three, five and 10-year paper were slightly higher than those last set at the October 29 auction. The October auction was the first for medium and long-term paper at which bids had been accepted since last May due to the turmoil caused by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty. GERMAN government bonds drifted lower in thin trade with most attention focusing on yesterday's auction of Federal bonds. The DTB March future on long bunds slipped to 92.00 by late afternoon against Tuesday's close of 92.12. Dealers were surprised by the large amount raised at the auction. A total of DM12bn of bonds was issued, whereas dealers had expected only DM10bn. Bids of 99.71 and above were accepted at the auction. Elsewhere in Europe, French government bonds fell due to the weakness of the franc against the D-Mark. JAPANESE government bonds rallied strongly yesterday, prompted by a sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market which reignited hopes that the Bank of Japan would lower interest rates. The futures contract rose to a high of 108.39 before ending the half-day of trading at 108.35.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lucas completes strategic review Lucas Industries yesterday said Mr George Simpson, its new chief executive, had completed a five-month strategic review aimed at refocusing the aerospace and automotive components manufacturer. The company, however, played down weekend reports that the plans would lead inevitably to plant closures, redundancies and the disposal of non-core businesses. Under the proposals, the group will focus on six products areas - aerospace, electronics, brakes, diesel systems, electrical systems and automotive aftermarket - but the board has yet to decide on the form of any restructuring. Mr Simpson, the former Rover Group chairman, first outlined his vision last month at a meeting of senior managers, at which he voiced concern at Lucas's 'inadequate' financial performance and stressed the need for better customer relations. He told them that to achieve long-term growth the group had to concentrate on added-value products such as aerospace equipment and electronics rather than low cost components. The group's full year results are due on October 10.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Instigation and Incipient Betrayal"] </F>   [Text] A group of ministers -- some say they represent a  majority of Rabin's government -- has launched an inflammatory  campaign against the Jewish settlers in the heart of Hebron and  against dozens of Jewish settlements throughout Judaea, Samaria,  and Gaza. They are demanding that the Jewish settlers be  evacuated at once because their presence supposedly fans the  flames of hatred between Jews and Arabs and hurts the peace  process.    This unbridled incitement against the Jewish settlers, who  are being portrayed as an obstacle to peace, totally contradicts  the remarks the prime minister made as he signed the agreement  with the PLO -- namely, that not a single settlement would be  evacuated as a result of the implementation of that agreement.    We do not know how much power that ministerial group -- the  group comprising the Meretz ministers and the left-wing sector  of Labor -- wields, and we have as yet to hear the prime  minister's reaction to the adverse counsel given by these  ministers at such a time.    The public pronouncements of that group of ministers are not  only uncomplimentary to the prime minister, but they also prove  that Yitzhaq Rabin's position within his government has been  seriously impaired. He no longer leads; others are trying to  lead him toward steps that are utterly discordant with the  Zionist doctrine and the political and security needs of the  State of Israel.    The initiative of that group of ministers both harms the  State of Israel and encourages the PLO and its cohorts to  increase the pressure on the Israeli Government to disband the  Jewish settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza and to deploy an  armed international force in those areas to protect Arab  residents whose lives are being threatened by Jewish  "terrorists."    Not only is the conduct of these ministers unwise, it  indicates an incipient betrayal of the special interests of the  entire Israeli nation.    The Jewish settlements throughout Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza,  including the Jewish presence in the city of Hebron, were  established on the basis of incontestable resolutions made by  Israeli Governments which acknowledged the right of every single  Jew to build his home in any part of Eretz Yisra'el.    Proposing the evacuation of Jewish settlements from Judaea,  Samaria, and Gaza is tantamount to proposing a Jewish surrender  to Arab terror or, perhaps, to offering the PLO the keys to an  independent, 'Arafat-led Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria,  and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on a  silver platter.    Ministers doing the PLO's work have no place in the  Government of Israel. If the prime minister lacks the power to  curb them, he should disband the government and replace it with  a government loyal to the people of Israel and to Eretz Yisra'el.    The people of Israel need a government capable of  representing its political and security interests with national  dignity. It is natural, therefore, that so many people are  opposed to the left-wing government, whose acts are more than  unwelcome, whose acts jeopardize the well-being and security of  the State of Israel.</p>

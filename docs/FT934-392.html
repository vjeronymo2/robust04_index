			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Tax rises will help sustain recovery, says government The government yesterday claimed that its Budget tax increases would help to sustain Britain's economic recovery by damping consumer demand and preventing an inflationary boom. Speaking as shoppers flocked to post-Christmas sales, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said planned tax increases - which will be equivalent to 7 pence on income tax in three years' time - will slow growth. But he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme there was 'no reason to believe' the changes coming 'this year or in 1994 and 1995 will have any serious adverse affect on the recovery'. 'What we have seen, quarter by quarter, is a recovery that has taken root and been sustained - and the likelihood is that this will continue,' Mr Dorrell said. Without this year's two Budgets, people would have lacked confidence that the UK economy had a sound financial base, he said. 'Because difficult decisions have been taken, we can have reasonable confidence that the recovery will continue on the path set now for over 18 months.' Mr Dorrell's view that the Budget will lead to steady growth is given some support today by the latest bimonthly survey of business opinion from the Institute of Directors and Halifax Building Society's end-of-year review of the housing market. Although the IoD reported only a slight increase in overall business confidence in the two months between October and December, it found that the November 30 Budget appears to have boosted optimism among directors about prospects for their own businesses in 1994 and may encourage them to take on more staff. Halifax predicts a steady recovery in the housing market next year, with a 15 per cent increase in the number of people moving house and a 5 per cent rise in house prices, but with no return to 'boom-and-bust' conditions. While retailers yesterday reported their best winter sales figures since the late 1980s, Mr Dorrell made it clear that the government was not interested in stoking a consumer-led boom. 'What we do not want is a consumer recovery which gets out of control, which leads to inflationary boom and balance of payments difficulties of the kind we have seen in the past,' he said. Mr Dorrell stressed that the government had acted to minimise the disincentive impact of tax increases by not raising marginal rates of income tax. 'We think it is important that people have a good reward when they go to work and when they do well,' he said. However, his upbeat view of the Budget was challenged by Mr Andrew Smith, a Labour Treasury spokesman. 'When, come April, people have their pay slip in one hand and a fuel bill in the other, they will see for themselves just how hard the government is hitting them on taxation,' he said. Mr Smith said the typical UK family faced extra taxes of Pounds 10 a week in 1994. House sales 'to rise 15%', Page 5 Gloom starts to lift, Page 10 Recovery hopes grow in US and Germany, Page 12</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge plans to cut debts with NZDollars 3.5bn asset sale FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand conglomerate, yesterday unveiled an ambitious programme to reduce its debt, including a further sale of NZDollars 3.5bn (USDollars 1.88bn) worth of assets. The move follows the announcement of a loss of NZDollars 157.5m in the year to June 30, compared with a profit of NZDollars 481.9m last time. Assets targeted for sale include the Rural Bank and FCL's NZDollars 500m property portfolio in New Zealand. It was also considering the partial sale of the Natural Gas Corporation and floating its Chilean forest products division. The methanol division, the largest in the world following last year's purchase of Cape Horn Methanol in Chile, was also being reviewed. Turnover during the period was NZDollars 10.02bn against NZDollars 10.48bn. The total dividend is down to 14 cents, compared with 27 cents. Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said the group was expecting a recovery in earnings this financial year, with a profit of around NZDollars 300m, excluding abnormal items. He said this forecast was based on a slow recovery in the world economy and given the nature of commodity forecasts the result could 'end up NZDollars 100m either way'. In the year to June 30, FCL earned NZDollars 305.1m, excluding abnormal items, compared with a profit of NZDollars 493.9m last year. Abnormal losses were NZDollars 472.8m, against NZDollars 154.7m, producing a net loss of NZDollars 157.5m. The abnormal losses included the provision of NZDollars 400m for potential property write-downs, mostly relating to problems in the group's Australian subsidiary, Jennings. The primary division had a good year reflecting better prices for New Zealand's agricultural commodities. Energy was the star performer, contributing 60 per cent of the earnings of NZDollars 540m before interest and tax. Last year the division earned NZDollars 436m.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (8): Facelift for an anniversary / A look at preparations for Expo '98 Portugal has every right to be proud of its illustrious past, and the manner in which it recalls events in its history that the rest of the world ignores is nothing short of endearing. Few outside Portugal, for example, are aware that 1991 was the 500th anniversary of the first Portuguese mission to the kingdom of the Congo, or that 2000 will mark the the 500th anniversary of the colonisation of Brazil, or that this year celebrates the 600th anniversary of the birth of Prince Henry the Navigator whose intellectual stimulus and deep pockets made such milestones possible. The world outside Portugal may, however, become aware of the significance of 1998 as the year marking 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's voyage to India. If it does it will be because of Lisbon's Expo '98, an international exposition which hopes to attract 115 participants, countries, multinational companies and international organisations, and 10m visitors. Expo '98, has chosen an attractive theme: under the title The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future, it will focus on conserving the oceans and also on realising the sustainable assets that the two thirds of planet earth represented by the oceans can provide. The question is whether it can deliver this appealing package. Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, a former EC commissioner and now commissioner for Expo '98, brushes the doubters aside. The world fair will happen as planned because much more than being an occasion to wave the Vasco da Gama flag, more even than providing a platform for ecological correctness, Expo '98 is the excuse for a significant urban facelift that Lisbon can no longer delay. Already the state-owned Expo '98 consortium is beginning to decontaminate and to level a 300-hectare industrial garbage area on Lisbon's eastern suburbs, upriver and alongside the river Tagus estuary, that was formerly occupied by a succession of petroleum refineries and factories. It is an undertaking comparable to the renewal of London's Docklands or to Barcelona's decision to uproot a similar rust belt to construct an Olympic village. Mr Cardoso believes that Lisbon is not only 'fit to meet' such an undertaking but 'desperately needs to do so'. The stimulus is all-important. 'If the objectives are not foolish, if they are reasonable, then societies need this sort of psychological challenge,' says Expo '98's commissioner and his views echo those of Barcelona mayor Pascual Maragall in the run up to the 1992 summer games. Expo '98 will not, however, be a repeat of the Expo '92 jamboree in Seville that marked the 500 years of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the New World. That was a 'universal' exposition, a higher rank than the 'international' exposition accolade awarded to Lisbon by the BIE, the Paris-based organisation which monitors world fairs. With hindsight, Lisbon perceives Expo '92 as having been too costly, too ambitious and, ultimately, too wasteful. 'One of our main concerns is not to be Seville mark two,' says Mr Cardoso. The Lisbon event will be shorter - four months, June to September, instead of Seville's six - the exhibition space will be much smaller and, hopefully, it will pay for itself by selling off its real estate to the private sector. If all goes as Expo '98 plans it, Lisbon will be making a giant leap forward over the next three years. It will acquire: A second fixed link over the Tagus, a 15-kilometre six-lane highway thrown across the estuary that will relieve pressure on the saturated existing suspension bridge, down river, which dates from 1966. A transport interchange centre serving buses, the city's metro system and the main national railway traffic moving north-south and east towards the Spanish border. A big exhibition centre, a large multi-purpose indoor sports and music stadium and the biggest oceanarium in Europe. A new residential, office and commercial area, housing some 25,000 and, scenically situated by the Tagus estuary's bulge, reminiscent in its location of lakeside Chicago. 'Everybody has got his feelings at least a little mixed about such ambitions,' says a Lisbon property developer. 'Clearing all that needs to be cleared (the Expo '98 site extends along 5km of river front) and then building all the complex things that are planned in under four years seems a bit far-fetched.' The doubters point to the fact that Budapest has only recently scrapped its own plans to have an Expo '96 because of time and financing difficulties. Mr Cardoso appears untroubled and he harks back to Vasco da Gama who was 'not a navigator' but a clear-sighted businessman. Getting to India was a 'trade-driven act' and by the same token the world fair on the 500th anniversary of that voyage is a sound commercial venture moulded to the city's requirements. Indeed, Mr Cardoso seems intent on leaving nothing to chance as he preaches the need to be 'hard, demanding and accurate' in the Expo '98 quest. He has a poster of Murphy's Law - If things can go wrong they will - framed in his office and he says that he has it hanging there to remind him and his staff that 'everything has to be covered'.</p>

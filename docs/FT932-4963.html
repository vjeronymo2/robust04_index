			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / 96% of accountants fail to satisfy regulators JUST 4 per cent of the chartered accountants registered to conduct investment business in England and Wales and visited by regulators last year were given a completely clean bill of health. Some 140 - or 11 per cent - of the 1,287 reports on practices visited by regulators during 1992 highlighted serious breaches, according to figures to be presented on Wednesday to the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. A further 433 firms breached important regulations or a large number of regulations, and 628 breached minor regulations. Only 55 were judged to have shown no breaches. The institute received 63 complaints during the year. Three firms have so far had their authorisation suspended, while another 49 have been told to make improvements as a result of reports submitted during the year. The details come in the annual report from the practice regulation directorate of the institute, the self-regulating arm which is responsible for accountants conducting auditing, insolvency and financial services. Mr Cliff Bygrave, chairman of the institute's Financial Services Authorisation Committee, said: 'We are never really happy while we have (significant regulatory breaches). But we have asked (the regulators) to be stricter and stronger in their visits. Next year is going to be tougher.' He stressed that many of the breaches were on technical grounds such as inadequate documentation as a result of 'very heavy regulation' imposed by the 1988 Financial Services Act. He said that most did not indicate misappropriation of money or poor financial advice, but where they did the institute was taking 'the necessary action'. At the end of last year, there were 5,556 firms authorised to undertake investment business, down from 5,851 a year earlier. All but 8 per cent were registered for 'Category 1' business, which is to provide investment advice. Just 6 per cent were registered for 'Category 2', allowing them to hold client money. Only 2 per cent - or 111 firms - were 'Category 3', allowing discretionary management of funds within certain limits, and a single firm was registered as 'Category 4', with higher limits on management. The report from the audit registration committee shows there have been 236 complaints between October 1991 and December 1992. Last year, there were 392 complaints to the insolvency licensing committee.</p>

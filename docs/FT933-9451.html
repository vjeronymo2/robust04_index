			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Back on the rollercoaster  -Charles Batchelor answers questions arising from the ERM's downfall British and Italian companies have had 10 months to become used to more widely fluctuating currencies since their countries' enforced departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. The effective dismantling of the ERM on August 2 has meant companies throughout Europe must now cope with greater currency volatility. What action should I take to minimise foreign currency risks? You must take more care in managing your income and expenditure from activities in the ERM countries. Previously companies could be relaxed about surpluses or deficits emerging in their cash flows within Europe. The narrow fluctuation bands between the different currencies meant companies could usually ignore any exposure which occurred between them. But now that most of the European currencies can fluctuate quite widely against others, companies must consider hedging their exposures in individual currencies. A surplus in D-Marks can no longer be offset by a deficit in French francs. The D-Mark and the Dutch guilder are retaining their narrow bands but these are the only two currencies which you can now set off against each other. Similarly, if you borrowed D-Marks, for example, to finance export business on the assumption that the German currency would not fluctuate much against the other currencies, you must now take into account the risk of greater volatility. Is that all? No. If you are an exporter to, say, Germany or the Netherlands and you have competitors based in, for example, France, a decline of the French franc will give them an advantage in the German or Dutch markets. You may need to think about marketing and pricing issues. You must also take into account the effect of possible interest rate cuts in continental Europe. If countries which were previously obliged to maintain high interest rates to keep their currencies within the tight ERM bands start cutting their rates, your competitors will have access to cheaper finance. You could switch your borrowings into the same currency but this may not always be convenient. Since I am not involved in exports, can I ignore the possibility of larger currency movements? It is a common misconception that dealing only in your domestic market means you are not exposed to foreign currency risk. You may be exposed to currency-related developments elsewhere. If a competitor who sells into your home market buys his raw materials from suppliers in a country with a currency which has weakened against your currency then that competitor will enjoy a cost advantage. I do not believe that even the experts can forecast foreign exchange market fluctuations, so hedging is a complete waste of time. I might as well let the pluses and the minuses even themselves out. Is this true? No. Just because swings in exchange rates are large and unpredictable, that does not mean you should ignore them in the hope that they will cancel each other out. To hedge currency flows may not result in higher profits overall, but it does at least cut down on uncertainty. In the very long term, movements in exchange rates may follow the real economy, although the timing and the extent of the movements are so uncertain that companies punt on exchange rate fluctuations at their peril. I both sell my products and buy raw materials throughout Europe. Does the ERM break-up mean I must increase my hedging and, as a result, my financing costs? Not necessarily. You may have a natural hedge if you have assets and liabilities in the same currency which can be matched. You may be able to match overseas borrowings with revenue flows or set raw materials purchases against sales in the same country. The advantage of a natural hedge is that it is cost-free and simple to manage. Does this mean that I should take out cover for every transaction which does not have a natural hedge? Again, not necessarily. You must consider if the exposure is sufficient to warrant taking out cover. Sensible companies hedge selectively. Hedging everything in sight can sometimes be a disadvantage. If, for example, a British company bought foreign currency forward to hedge the value of a shipment from, say, France and the franc fell against sterling you would be locked into the earlier, disadvantageous exchange rate. Competitors who had not hedged could take advantage of the lower rate. This emphasises the need for a selective approach to currency hedging. I find foreign exchange market jargon confusing. I have heard of currency forward contacts, swaps and options. What is the difference? A forward contract allows a company to 'fix' an exchange rate until payment is made months or even two or more years later. A drawback is that you will have to accept or supply the currency involved when the contract matures, even if the delivery did not go ahead. Option forward contracts are similar but allow a range of settlement dates rather than a single date. This gives flexibility but does cost more. Currency swaps allow a company to swap its debts through a bank with another company so that both sides obtain a debt in their desired currency. The swap arrangement sets the rate at which the currencies will be exchanged at a date in the future. Currency options give you the right to buy or sell the agreed amount of currency at a future date. But unlike forward contracts there is no obligation to complete the deal and if a sale falls through or the currencies do not move as expected you can simply let the option lapse.</p>

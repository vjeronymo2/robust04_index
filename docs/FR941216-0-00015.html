Part 172 is amended by adding subpart B to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=72 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_Private Sector Involvement Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 172.21&blank;Purpose and applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 172.23&blank;Evaluation and selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 172.25&blank;Funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;172.21&blank;Purpose and applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The purpose of this subpart is to implement a program to encourage States to contract for engineering and design services with the private sector whenever such contracts would be cost effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) This subpart applies to all engineering and design services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts financed with Federal-aid highway funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;172.23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation and selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) When funds are appropriated for this program, the FHWA will invite States to submit applications to participate in the program. The FHWA will use the applications to make the program allocations under the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The FHWA will make a comparison of the applicants based on the amount of Federal-aid highway funds each State has expended on contracts for engineering and design services. In assessing the amount of funds a State spent in procuring engineering and design services, the FHWA will also consider the amounts expended by States on 100 percent State-funded engineering and design services contracts involving projects to be constructed with Federal-aid highway funds to the extent the State provides such information with its application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The FHWA will select not less than three States each fiscal year to receive funds under this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Selection of the States to receive funding under this program will be made by determining which States were the most effective in increasing the percentage of funds expended on engineering and design services contracts in the year preceding the fiscal year in which funds are to be allocated. In the selection process, the FHWA will evaluate each State's program of contracting for engineering and design services. The evaluation will primarily consider such information as the amount and percentage of Federal-aid highway funds and State funds expended on engineering and design services contracts, the number of contracts awarded for such services, the relative size of the State's Federal-aid highway program and the increases in use of private sector firms during the preceding year and the preceding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Upon the FHWA's request for applications, each State interested in being considered should submit its application through its appropriate FHWA Division Office. The application may be in letter form and should include current information on the extent of the State's use of consultants for engineering and design on Federal-aid highway projects. In addition, the State may provide data on the amount of 100 percent State-funded engineering and design services contracts involving projects to be built with Federal-aid highway funds and any other information demonstrating the State's effectiveness in increasing the percentage of funds expended on engineering and design services contracts in the past five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;172.25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Funds received by a State under this program may only be used for awarding engineering and design services contracts with the private sector. These contracts shall carry out services and activities eligible for Federal-aid funding under title 23, United States Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Federal share of any project obligated with funds allocated under this program shall be the same as the Federal share applicable to the type of work or project being developed or the system on which the project is located. Funds allocated under this program shall remain available until expended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Funds will be allocated to the States each fiscal year from 1995 through 1997 to the extent funds are appropriated.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30964 Filed 12&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

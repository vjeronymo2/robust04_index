			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico plans its first New York issue in 10 years THE Mexican government is preparing to re-enter the New York bond market for the first time since it triggered the onset of the debt crisis 10 years ago with its announcement that it could not meet its foreign debt payments. Mr Angel Gurria, undersecretary for international financial affairs in the Mexican Ministry of Finance, said an issue was being planned in the name of the United Mexican States for around Dollars 200m. It would be the first government issue of a so-called Yankee bond since 1980-81. He said that, as the government was running a budget surplus, it had no urgent need for the money and so the issue would only go ahead if market conditions were right. The government was aiming to establish a benchmark from which other Mexican borrowers could price their bond issues. It also wanted to re-establish its name in the New York market, and hoped to use the issue to lengthen further the average maturity of Mexico's debt. Mr Gurria, in an interview in Madrid, said Mexico was already tapping the commercial paper markets in the US and in Europe, where it was able to borrow at 150 basis points (1.5 percentage points) over US Treasury bill rates. It had also issued 10-year bonds in the Eurobond market at 195 basis points over US Treasuries. Mexico does not at this time have an investment grade rating from the main US rating agencies, but Mr Gurria believes a rating might be possible within months. Mexico's return to the New York market and its promotion as an investment grade credit would mark its final reacceptance in the international capital markets. Helped by a 1990 agreement to reduce its debt, the Mexican government now devotes 4.2 per cent of its gross domestic product and 16 per cent of its budget to interest payments, compared with 18 per cent and 42 per cent respectively as recently as 1986.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / BR to revive old routes to London BRITISH RAIL is working on plans for a package of new rail services linking the south and west Midlands with London from May next year. One proposal is likely to put the expanding town of Kidderminster in Hereford and Worcester on the InterCity map for the first time. Another will see the re-introduction of direct passenger services between London and Birmingham on the old Great Western Railway line through High Wycombe and Banbury. The plan to give Kidderminster an InterCity link with London is unexpected because it comes when other InterCity services, such as those to Shrewsbury, Cleethorpes and Blackpool, are being cut. BR is understood to be planning one InterCity 125 service early each morning from Kidderminster to London Paddington via Worcester and Oxford with a return service each evening. In addition, Regional Railways and Network SouthEast plan to run one of BR's new Networker Turbo express trains from Birmingham Snow Hill to Kidderminster, Worcester, Oxford and London Paddington each morning, with a return trip in the afternoon. Kidderminster's InterCity service will be at the expense of one of the two daily InterCity services running each way between Hereford and London. In its place, Hereford passengers will be provided with a Sprinter train connecting with the Kidderminster service at Worcester. BR also plans to increase direct links between Hereford and London by introducing some of its new Networker Turbo express trains to the route. Regional Railways said of BR's other big innovation - reviving through services on the former Great Western line - that it expected the services to make money in spite of the recession. 'We are in the business of starting services up, not closing them down.' The line fell into disuse for through services after the electrification of the alternative route running from London Euston to Birmingham New Street through Rugby and Coventry. Now, Regional Railways and Network SouthEast plan to introduce four trains a day each way between Birmingham Snow Hill and London Marylebone using Networker Turbo express trains.</p>

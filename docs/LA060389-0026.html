			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PORTRAIT OF CHET BAKER  </P> <P> We would like to respond to film critic Sheila Benson and jazz writer Leonard  Feather's dual attack on Bruce Weber's documentary movie "Let's Get Lost,"  about the late trumpeter Chet Baker (May 25).  </P> <P> It doesn't seem like sound policy for The Times to run two damning reviews of  any film. The criticisms were imbued with a petty viciousness that does a  disservice to Los Angeles film audiences.  </P> <P> We've come to expect better from Benson and Feather.  </P> <P> NANCY GERSTMAN  </P> <P> EMILY RUSSO  </P> <P> Zeitgeist Films, distributors  </P> <P> of "Let's Get Lost"  </P> <P> New York  </P></p>

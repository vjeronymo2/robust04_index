			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 PALESTINIANS DIE; JEWISH SETTLERS PATROL IN HEBRON  </P> <P> Arabs rioted in the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday after Jewish settlers  began an armed patrol, Israel Radio and Arab reports said. Israeli soldiers  reportedly killed two Palestinians and wounded 18 in separate clashes.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, assailants believed to be Jewish militants smashed a monument to  fallen Arab soldiers.  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers killed a 15-year-old Palestinian during a clash at the  Dahaisha refugee camp near Bethlehem, doctors said. They said a bullet hit  Nabil Mohammed abu Laban in the shoulder and then pierced his heart.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Youths Hurl Stones  </P> <P> An Arab reporter said the youth was shot when dozens of Arab youths hurled  stones at troops, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and, finally,  live ammunition. Laban died at a Bethlehem hospital.  </P> <P> The army said it was checking the report. Israel Radio confirmed the death and  said another youth was wounded in the clash.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, a 15-year-old Arab died of wounds received in a clash with  Israeli troops the day before, officials at Mukassed Hospital in Arab East  Jerusalem said.  </P> <P> They said Mohammed Yaqub Shalhoub was shot in the head during a confrontation  in the Nusseirat refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> An army spokesman confirmed the death and said the boy was shot when troops who  pursued stone-throwers found themselves in a dangerous situation. He did not  elaborate.  </P> <P> Armed Jewish settlers patrolled the streets of Hebron, saying they wanted to  prevent stone-throwing attacks on their cars, Israel Radio said.  </P> <P> Arab youths hurled rocks at the patrol, and the settlers opened fire in the  air, the radio and Arab reports said. The action sparked a riot by Arabs in the  city's casbah, a maze of narrow streets serving as an open-air market, they  said.  </P> <P> An Arab reporter in the city said dozens of youths who left the main Ibrahim  Mosque began throwing stones at soldiers, who opened fire with live ammunition,  wounding a 20-year-old in the stomach and a 22-year-old in the leg.  </P> <P> The army spokesman confirmed the injuries but said he was unaware of the  settlers' patrol.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arab Monument Smashed  </P> <P> In East Jerusalem, assailants partially smashed a stone monument to soldiers of  the Arab Legion near the Rockefeller Museum, a police spokesman said. He said  police had no suspects.  </P> <P> The Arab Legion was the Jordanian force that tried to prevent the establishment  of Israel in 1948.  </P> <P> An anonymous caller told Israel Army Radio that the monument was damaged by  "lovers of the land of Israel and the Jewish people."  </P> <P> He said the attack was to protest the dismantling by troops two days ago of a  monument erected by Jewish settlers in honor of an Israeli taxi driver slain in  the West Bank. Settlers have vowed to erect additional monuments to Jews killed  in the occupied lands in defiance of an army ban.  </P> <P> Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek condemned the desecration of the monument.  </P> <P> "Several idiots came from some place in the West Bank to damage the monument,"  Kollek said.  </P></p>

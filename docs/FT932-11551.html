			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Bad news for Clinton in Texas primary REPUBLICAN party prospects of picking up an additional US senator were enhanced by results of the weekend primary for the seat vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, now treasury secretary. The all-party primary was narrowly won by Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Republican state treasurer, who beat Mr Bob Krueger, the interim Democratic incumbent, by 593,479 votes to 592,982. Both won 29 per cent of the vote and face each other in a run-off a month from now. Democratic concern stems from the fact that the Republican share of the primary vote - Mrs Hutchison's plus that won by the two Republican congressmen who finished third and fourth - comfortably exceeded 50 per cent. Mr Richard Fisher, a nominal Democrat whose views and style resemble those of Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate, scored just 8 per cent, most of which may also be added to the Republican camp in the run-off. This is potentially bad news for President Bill Clinton, and for the Democrats, whose 57-43 lead in the Senate has proved insufficient to break opposition filibusters. A further test comes today in Wisconsin in the election to fill the House of Representatives seat of Mr Les Aspin, now defence secretary.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Republic has applied for membership in the  Interparliamentary Union. It is not ruled out that this request  will be satisfied in the near future, and as early as September,  a Belarusian delegation will be able to participate as a full  member in the Second Conference of the Interparliamentary Union.  This was announced today by Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw  Hryb during a news conference devoted to the results of the work  of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's delegation at the First  Conference of the Interparliamentary Union in Paris. He pointed  out that the joining of the world's oldest interparliamentary  organization by Belarus will be very beneficial in a political  aspect, because of the possibility to draw more global attention  to the problems of our Republic, including those connected with  dealings with the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster.  Answering a question as to whether he discussed in Paris with  Vladimir Shumeyko any possible scenarios for uniting monetary  systems [with Russia], Mechyslaw Hryb answered in the negative.  According to him, talks [on this topic] are in the competence  of the Executive Branch -- namely, the Governments of Belarus  and Russia.</p>

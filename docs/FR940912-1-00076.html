The specifications would be used to calculate fees to be paid by participants in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish fishery, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area groundfish fishery, BSAI area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off Alaska (Research Plan fisheries) to fund an observer program to promote management, conservation, and scientific understanding of groundfish, halibut, and crab resources off Alaska. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by October 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be sent to, and additional information can be obtained from, Ronald J.

On September 6, 1994, NMFS published a final rule at 59 FR 46126 to implement the Research Plan. This rule requires that observers be stationed on certain fishing vessels and at U.S. fish processors participating in Research Plan fisheries, including extending these requirements to the halibut fishery off Alaska. Observers will be deployed for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of fisheries under the Council's authority. The Research Plan also establishes a system of fees to pay for the costs of implementing the Research Plan, beginning January 1, 1995. The fees are based on the exvessel value of retained catch from Research Plan fisheries. Additional background and rationale for measures implemented under the Research Plan are contained in the preamble of the proposed rule published May 6, 1994, and the final rule, and are not repeated here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS is publishing these proposed specifications prior to the effective date of the final rule implementing the Research Plan. This is necessary because of the requirement for public comment on proposed specifications for the fee collection program, and because the specifications must be in place before the calendar year for which they apply. It also allows affected members of the industry to be notified and for the fee collection systems to be put in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Annual Research Plan Specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 677.11 of the Research Plan regulations requires NMFS, after consulting with the Council, and, in the case of observer coverage levels in the crab fisheries, the State of Alaska, to publish certain proposed specifications for the upcoming calendar year in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and to invite public comments. These proposed specifications include standard exvessel prices, total exvessel value, fee percentage, levels of observer coverage for Research Plan fisheries, and embarkment/disembarkment ports for observers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS prepared a report, ``Establishing the Fee Percentage and Standard Ex-vessel Prices for 1995,'' for the Council's consideration at its June 1994 meeting. The report contains details of the derivation of these proposed specifications, including sources of information and assumptions that are not repeated here. In response to comments received from the Council and its advisory committees, the report was subsequently revised to provide a greater breakdown of exvessel prices and to reflect a revised first-year program. Copies of the revised report are available (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed specifications for calendar year 1995 are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standard exvessel prices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Standard exvessel prices are used to determine the annual fee percentage for the calendar year and are the basis for calculating bimonthly fee assessments. Standard exvessel prices for species harvested in Research Plan fisheries are based on:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Exvessel price information by applicable season, area, gear, and processing sector for the most recent 12-month period for which data are available;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Factors that are expected to change exvessel prices in the upcoming calendar year; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Any other relevant information that may affect expected exvessel prices during the calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For 1995, proposed standard exvessel prices of species from Research Plan fisheries, based on best available information, are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

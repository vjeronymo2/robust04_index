The relays are checked each shift for visible indication of failure. Failure of the relay could cause premature closure of the breaker upon receipt of an automatic start signal due to or coincident with a loss of offsite power. The cause of these failures was subsequently attributed to undersized current-limiting resistors that were installed in the relays by the vendor. These resistors were replaced with appropriately sized resistors and testing has been performed to ensure operability. The relay is normally tested only during the 18-month shutdown test that assures proper functioning of the EDG and associated equipment upon receipt of a loss-of-offsite power test signal. Weekly testing, as required by TS Table 4.8.1.1.2&hyph;1, allows for manual loading which bypasses the CV&hyph;2 relay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The valid failure of the Division 1 EDG on June 7, 1994, brought the number of failures in the last 100 valid tests up to seven. In addition, the valid failure of July 12, 1994, was the second failure in the last 20 tests. In accordance with TS Table 4.8.1.1.2&hyph;1, the frequency of testing increases from monthly to weekly until at least seven consecutive successful tests are performed and there is a maximum of only one failure in the last 20 tests. Weekly testing, which began following the failure of June 7, 1994, must now continue until at least the first week of October 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter dated August 5, 1994, the licensee requested an exigent technical specification change to modify TS Table 4.8.1.1.2&hyph;1 to exclude these three valid failures from contributing to accelerated testing of the Division 1 diesel generator. The licensee's basis for this request included the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Additional weekly testing is inappropriate because the increased surveillance testing does not test the relay that failed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The undersized current-limiting resistors found in the CV&hyph;2 relays have been replaced which should eliminate similar failures in the future; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Plant operators, who identified the previous three failures, will continue to tour the equipment once per shift and check for targets that may have dropped; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Testing of the EDG at the Clinton power Station involve paralleling the diesel generators to the grid. NRC Information Notice 84&hyph;69 warns against operating diesel generators connected to offsite power unnecessarily as disturbances in the offsite power system can adversely affect availability of the EDG; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Excessive or unnecessary testing of diesel generators can cause unnecessary wear or degradation and thus contribute to their reduced reliability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approval of the proposed TS change will eliminate unnecessary testing of the diesel generator and will permit the licensee to resume a monthly test frequency. Prompt action by the staff is necessary to eliminate unnecessary testing and precludes the time available to permit the customary public notices in advance of this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

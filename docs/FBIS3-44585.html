He made the remark at a meeting here this afternoon with the  ambassadors of the three countries to China: German Ambassador  Armin Freitag, Swiss Ambassador Dr. Erwin Schurtenberger and  Austrian Ambassador Dr. Dietrich Bukowski.    Qiao is scheduled to pay an official goodwill visit to the  three countries from January 16 to 30 at the invitation of the  Presidium of the Bundestag of Germany, President Gert Haller of  the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland and  President Heinz Fischer of the National Council of Austria.    During the meeting, Qiao said he felt very pleased to have  the chance to visit these three countries, adding, "though the  visit will be paid in the winter season, I will go to the three  countries full of enthusiasm. I am sure that I will be accorded  a warm and friendly reception."    He said China and the three West European countries enjoy  sound relationships in political, economic and other fields.  "It is my aspiration that through the visits the mutual  understanding and friendship will be further enhanced, and the  relations between China and these three countries developed on  the existing basis."    Qiao asked the ambassadors to convey his greetings and good  wishes to the parliamentary and government leaders of the  respective countries.    The three ambassadors shared the view that the relationship  between China's NPC and the parliaments of the three countries  is very good. Qiao's visit is bound to further promote this  relationship and make a decisive contribution to state-to-state  ties, they said.    Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee,  and  Jiang Enzhu, vice minister of foreign affairs, took part in the  meeting.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> D'ARBY SHOWCASES POWERFUL VOICE  </P> <P> The amps had hardly heated up at the Park Plaza Hotel on Friday when Terence  Trent D'Arby and his band executed a heart-stopping drop-down, from the  martial-tempo storm warning of "Rain" to the elongated lament of Smokey  Robinson's ballad "Who's Lovin' You." In that one bravado stroke, the  London-based American staked out the breadth of his emotional and musical  spread and forged a firm link with his audience.  </P> <P> There was one problem though: Rather than riding a triumphant crest, the man  with the million-dollar voice is battling to keep his head above water. Radio  isn't playing his new album "Neither Fish nor Flesh," people aren't buying it,  and instead of moving up from the Palladium to amphitheaters or forums, he  presided over a handful -- fewer than 1,000 -- in the ersatz Egyptian splendor  of a ballroom at the old hotel.  </P> <P> That could be demoralizing for someone as insistent on his own importance as  D'Arby, but he responded with a charged, intensely personal performance. It was  like a leader and his loyal troops huddled in there against the puzzling  indifference outside, and it yielded a different kind of triumph.  </P> <P> The concert took its main cues from the spirit of the old soul revue: playful,  split-second stops and starts, gospel-derived pressure and release, volcanic  ballads. Throw in James Brown splits, a David Lee Roth toe-touching leap, and a  rubber-legged brand of dancing that's calculated enough to be sharp but  instinctive enough to be loose.  </P> <P> Decked out like a rock 'n' roll privateer, D'Arby was sweet and playful, and  imperial without being arrogant -- he seemed to take true joy in spanning the  front of the stage, crouching down and clasping hands with the fans.  </P> <P> Mainly, though, there's that voice, from raspy roar to piercing wail to agile  scatting. It's a wonder of nature and a sacred trust not to be used lightly.  The vision thing will either come together or it won't, but as long as he can  sing like that, you have to listen.

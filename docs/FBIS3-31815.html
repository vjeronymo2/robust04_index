			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Jozef Moravcik granted an  interview to TA SR. He noted that after the prime minister's  proposal to dismiss him, presented to the president, and in view  of the current political situation as well as the foreign  political interests of the Slovak Republic, he considered it  necessary to solve the personnel question of the minister of  foreign affairs. At the same time, he did not assume that his  departure would change Slovak foreign policy in principle  because a change in political course would not be supported by  parliament.</p>

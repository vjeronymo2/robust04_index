			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK fights ban on dumping BRITAIN is to oppose a new move to introduce a permanent international ban on dumping radioactive waste at sea. The government's stance follows its successful attempts in September to persuade the Paris Convention governing dumping in the north-east Atlantic to reject a permanent ban on radioactive waste dumping in favour of a 15-year moratorium. Signatories to the London Dumping Convention, a world-wide dumping treaty, are meeting in London this week. The LDC, which has a wider jurisdiction, could override the provisions of the Paris Convention. The London convention, which opens today, will report next year on the effects of radioactive waste dumping in the sea. The UK wants any decision to wait for the results of the study.</p>

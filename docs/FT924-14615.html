			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Lamont opts for curbing inflation: Chancellor's future remains in doubt after muted reception at party conference MR NORMAN LAMONT yester-day sought to plug the gap in his economic policy left by sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism by setting a formal target of between 1 and 4 per cent for Britain's inflation rate. In a speech which won him a respectful but less than ecstatic reception from the Conservative party conference and London's financial markets, the chancellor ruled out the sharp cuts in interest rates demanded by many Tories. On BBC television last night he said the recent one-point cut and sterling's depreciation was a 'very considerable loosening of policy'. The instant judgment of his ministerial colleagues was that Mr Lamont's long-term future at the Treasury remained uncertain. His speech will be followed this morning by a determined attempt by Mr John Major to reassert his authority over the party and to close the deep rifts over Europe which have emerged at this week's conference. After a day in which party activists tempered their affection for Lady Thatcher with a rebuke for her vehement attacks on her successor's European policy, Mr Major will underline his determination to ratify Maastricht. In a statement for MPs accompanying his speech, Mr Lamont said the centrepiece of his economic strategy outside the ERM would be a long-term inflation objective of 2 per cent per year. That would mean an immediate target range of 1 to 4 per cent for underlying price rises. By the end of the current parliament in 1997, he expected inflation to be in the lower end of that range. Until now, the government has eschewed a formal target for prices, setting out instead the goal of stable prices or consistently low inflation. But without the anchor of the D-Mark, Mr Lamont was concerned to re-establish the government's credibility with financial markets. In August the underlying annual rate - retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments - stood at 4.2 per cent but it may drop into Mr Lamont's new range when the figures for September are published today. The chancellor, foreshadowing the sharp reductions in many Whitehall budgets in this year's spending negotiations, said that public sector pay awards would bear much of the squeeze. He said that the exchange rate - measured by its index against a basket of currencies - would remain a significant factor in interest rates decisions. But he stressed that there would be no specific target for the rate against individual currencies. The chancellor said that the conditions for ERM re-entry - an end to the turbulence on foreign exchange markets, changes to the operation of the system and closer realignment of the economic cycles in Germany and Britain  -'are unlikely to be satisfied soon'. In the interim, the Treasury would look at indicators including M0 and M4, the narrow and broad money supply measures, and movements in the prices of assets such as houses. Mr Lamont said inflation might on occasion burst out of the prescribed range but pledged that, in those circumstances, the government 'would have a duty to explain' why it had happened and how it would be rectified. On interest rates, Mr Lamont said the one-point cut to 9 per cent in the wake of sterling's departure from the ERM had been justified by the inflation outlook. But he did not exclude a further reduction: 'In the months ahead I must continue to fight the battle against inflation and take no risks.' Mr Lamont left the platform uncertain whether he had restored his authority. After calls from party activists for reductions in interest rates, colleagues were reluctant to rule out a reshuffle which would see Mr Lamont leave the Treasury in the first half of next year.

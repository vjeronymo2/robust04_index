			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FORMER ENVOY TO CHINA BLASTS BUSH INITIATIVE  </P> <P> Winston Lord, a career diplomat who served as President Ronald Reagan's  ambassador to China, today denounced President Bush's decision to send  emissaries to Beijing as a "severely misguided" step that will make the United  States appear weak to China's leaders.  </P> <P> "One does not shore up the long-term foundations for Sino-American relations by  appearing weak to China's leaders and callous to the Chinese and American  people," Lord said in a signed column in today's Washington Post.  </P> <P> "One does not earn respect abroad by reversing field within months and  practicing double standards," he said.  </P> <P> Lord's piece was written before the White House's disclosure Monday that Brent  Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the  deputy secretary of state, secretly visited Beijing on Bush's orders in July.  </P> <P> Scowcroft and Eagleburger also visited China earlier this month. The White  House announced that visit after they arrived in Beijing.  </P> <P> Lord said in seeking improved ties with China the Administration forfeited the  right to censure it on moral grounds. "But even on its own terms the Scowcroft  mission was severely misguided," he said, arguing it undermined China's "closet  moderates."  </P> <P> "Far from strengthening their hand, the Administration has robbed them of the  argument that Chinese repression and xenophobia entail costs," he wrote.  "Japan, Europe and others will feel free to follow the Scowcroft trail."  </P> <P> The former ambassador said that while censure might not influence China's  hard-line leaders, "international acquiescence" in the Tian An Men Square  shootings "surely reinforces their view that crushing their populace elicits  only fleeting outcries, no lasting repercussions."  </P></p>

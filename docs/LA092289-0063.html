			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Rod Graham, the indicted sheriff of Yolo County, agreed to retire Oct. 1 at  half pay, plus $40,000 in cash. The deal with Graham was approved by a 3-2 vote  of the Board of Supervisors and announced by County Counsel Charles Mack, who  described the settlement as a matter of economics. Graham, 48, was named in a  federal indictment, charging him with extortion, bribery and conspiracy. He was  accused in January of taking $3,600 in contributions to his 1986 reelection  campaign from a developer with plans for a major commercial and residential  project in West Sacramento. The indictment was an outgrowth of a three-year FBI  sting aimed at state legislators.  </P></p>

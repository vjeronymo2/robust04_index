			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTA FE TO SUE ENCINITAS OVER ROAD ISSUE  </P> <P> Charging that the recently adopted Encinitas General Plan does nothing to  alleviate Rancho Santa Fe's traffic problems, the elite community's governing  association has decided to sue its neighboring city for failing to deal with  the region's increasing traffic congestion.  </P> <P> The Rancho Santa Fe Assn., which serves as the unincorporated area's governing  body, decided Thursday to execute their longstanding plans to file a lawsuit  against the city of Encinitas, said Gene Freeland, an association board member.  </P> <P> The association had been mounting a futile campaign to persuade Encinitas to  include proposed county highway 680 in its General Plan, which was adopted  March 29. The legal action is a direct result of Encinitas' decision to abandon  the highway, which would have helped alleviate traffic congestion in Rancho  Santa Fe, Freeland said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Made Every Effort  </P> <P> "We made every effort through discussion and by correspondence to have  Encinitas reconsider," Freeland said. "But, if they refused, we were prepared  to begin litigation. Encinitas has declined to address our concern."  </P> <P> "The basic thrust of the litigation is a result of the removal of highway 680,"  he said. "The Encinitas General Plan (without the highway) fails to consider  what kind of environmental impact it will have on Rancho Santa Fe and the  region." The lawsuit will be filed by the end of the month, he said.  </P> <P> Under state law, a city's general plan -- a blueprint for land use and future  growth -- must take into account its impact on surrounding communities and  provide solutions to mitigate that impact.  </P> <P> </P> <P> East-West Link  </P> <P> The proposed four-lane highway, which would cross Escondido Creek and link  Interstate 15 and Leucadia Boulevard, was abandoned after concerned neighbors  said it would leave an ugly scar through residential areas of Encinitas.  </P> <P> Encinitas council members also said other road expansions included in the  General Plan would eliminate the need for highway 680.  </P> <P> But the Rancho Santa Fe Assn. had hoped the highway proposal would remain  intact, because its creation would divert traffic away from the rural  community's winding, two lane roads.  </P> <P> "They've threatened to sue us for the last several months," said Encinitas City  Atty. Roger Krauel. "But, so far, we haven't received any lawsuit.  </P> <P> The city, the staff and the council made every effort to address their  concerns."  </P> <P> Encinitas Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines said the city has done more than its  share to address regional traffic concerns.  </P> <P> "We have done our job," Gaines said. "We spent 2 1/2 years developing our  General Plan and paid particular attention to traffic. Now, if the Ranch feels  that we haven't done that, well then, that's their choice (to sue us). We will  address that at that time.  </P> <P> "We have made that decision (not to include route 680) based on evidence that  the road was not necessary."  </P> <P> The Rancho Santa Fe Assn., however, disagrees.  </P> <P> "Encinitas has some creative ways of looking at traffic volumes," said Walt  Ekard, the association's general manager. "The bottom line is that we have a  problem with their analysis."  </P> <P> "The deletion of highway 680 is a tremendous concern to us," Ekard said. "What  that means is that there will be significant traffic increase on Ranch roads,  that quite simply, are not designed for and cannot handle such traffic."  </P> <P> Although highway 680 was discarded, Gaines said the newly adopted General Plan  calls for adding roads and widening others.  </P> <P> Plans include the construction of a direct link between Leucadia Boulevard and  El Camino Real, and the addition of lanes to Manchester Avenue, Gaines said.  </P> <P> "The link between Leucadia and El Camino Real was bitterly opposed (by  residents), and it was a very difficult decision for us," Gaines said. "But we  did it as part of our responsibility to accommodate future growth."  </P> <P> Countering the association's lawsuit, Gaines said Rancho Santa Fe has done  little to help solve traffic problems.  </P> <P> "The Ranch has these two-way roads, but they haven't tried to add any lanes or  make plans to augment their roads," Gaines said. "Many of us do not like the  idea that we are growing rapidly, but we all have to take some share of that  burden. The Ranch is only willing to take a very small share."  </P></p>

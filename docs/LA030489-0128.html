			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGES;  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL STATE TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> L.A. VALLEY UPSETS NO. 1 FULLERTON, 70-69  </P> <P> Los Angeles Valley College defeated Fullerton, 70-69, Friday night in a  semifinal game of the state community college women's basketball tournament at  Los Angeles Valley College.  </P> <P> Fullerton (27-2), which was ranked No. 1 in the state, had its winning streak  stopped at 19 games.  </P> <P> "I think we lost it in the first 8 minutes of the second half," Fullerton Coach  Colleen Riley said. "We went cold."  </P> <P> Fullerton's fortunes can best be demonstrated by the fortunes of its sophomore  guard, Debbie Wagner.  </P> <P> In the first half, Wagner hit five of six three-point shots to lead Fullerton  to a 39-33 halftime advantage.  </P> <P> In the second half, Wagner managed only a free throw and missed all five of her  field goal attempts.  </P> <P> Fullerton's Kelli Johnson, the Orange Empire Conference player of the year,  scored 14 second-half points to keep Fullerton in the game, but she received  little support.  </P> <P> L.A. Valley, which got hot the same time Fullerton turned cold, scored the  first eight points of the second half to take a 41-39 lead.  </P> <P> Ruth Aguilar, who scored the first four points of the half on strong spin moves  inside the key, scored 10 of her 14 points in the second half.  </P> <P> L.A. Valley's Christine Rumfola had a game-high 22 points, and Sandrine Rocher  added 20.  </P> <P> "We weathered the storm in the second half," L.A. Valley Coach Doug Michelson  said. "We were satisfied to be down only by six at the half with how poorly we  played."  </P> <P> Although Lisa Crosskey's pair of free throws for Fullerton with no time left on  the clock accounted for the final score, L.A. Valley had the game -- or at  least a tie -- in hand with 32 seconds left.  </P> <P> Shagarro Lattin's layup gave the Monarchs a three-point lead with 32 seconds  remaining, and L.A. Valley's defense never allowed Fullerton to get off a good  closing shot. Heidi Shikuma missed a hurried three-pointer and Crosskey was  fouled on her three-point attempt.  </P> <P> In the other semifinal, American River College defeated the College of the  Sequoias, 53-51.  </P></p>

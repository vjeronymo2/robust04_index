			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right support Sir, Having recently assisted my wife through a natural birth, it seems to me Nigel Spivey ('No place for pregnant fathers', January 22/23) exposes his own fears about attending his child's birth rather than expounding an argument for general male absence at birth. He says: 'The natural state of affairs is for women to assist women.' If he were to shoo away the 'semi-official sisterhood' gathered around his wife, he will eventually realise the process of natural birth may require actual physical support; in which case one patient, dedicated husband with stamina can be a better bet than a multitude of gender sharers.

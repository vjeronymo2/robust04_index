			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal 'Isam al-Din: "Arms Mandate Renewed"] </F>   [Text] With 11 deputies objecting, the People's Assembly  decided on Sunday to give President Husni Mubarak unrestricted  powers for the next three fiscal years to make financial  allocations for armament and other military purposes. The  decision meant that Mubarak is authorised to conclude military  purchases from foreign countries without necessarily making them  public.    The president of the republic was first given this mandate  in  1972 and it has been renewed periodically since then. With a  majority of 380 deputies, the Assembly approved the latest  extension on Sunday, authorising Mubarak to "issue law decrees  concerning armament allocations and other allocations for the  armed forces... [ellipsis as published] until the end of fiscal  year 1996/7".    The objecting deputies, mainly leftists and independents,  argued that a further extension was unwarranted because secrecy  was no longer possible in today's world. They stressed that  their objection should not be misconstrued as objection to  Mubarak's person.    Speaking for the government, Kamal al-Shadhili, minister of  state for the People's Assembly affairs, said the extension is  necessary in order to keep the armed forces strong in peace as  well as in war. He argued that secrecy was essential for  concluding military purchases, noting that the extension of the  law comes at a time when the region is rife with military  confrontations. "Yesterday, there was fighting in Yemen and  earlier there were hostilities in the Gulf," he said.    Jamal al-Sayyid, a former minister of military production,  also defended the extension as necessary. He said it came at a  time of an international embargo on the purchase of some weapons  and military equipment, making secrecy a prerequisite of any  military transaction. "We all know that Mubarak is an honest  man and worthy of trust," he said.    From the opposing camp, Lutfi Wakid, one of the 1952  revolution's "free officers" and deputy chairman of the  left-wing Tagammu Party, said his objection should not be  interpreted as an indication of disrespect for the president or  for the armed forces. He said the law was necessary before the  1973 October War because military purchases had to be kept a  closely guarded secret. But now, he said, the world has changed  and secrecy is no longer possible.    "The world's largest military supplier, the United States,  now reveals its military deals in Congress and so do Britain and  France, and most deals are published by specialised magazines."  Wakid said it was more honourable for the government and the  armed forces to publicise their military deals, instead of  allowing opponents to cast doubts on their actions.    The strongest criticism was made by independent Fikri  al-Jazzar who said the extension amounted to a "rape of  legislative authority". Although al-Jazzar said his objection  did not mean that he questioned the president's integrity, he  recalled that Article 108 of the Constitution states that the  president should be vested with this authority only in  exceptional cases. Moreover, he said, the article calls on the  president to submit to the Assembly reports on the types of  deals, decisions and agreements he concluded in this respect.  "Has the Assembly received any reports of this kind?" al-  Jazzar asked, adding that for the purpose of secrecy a committee  should be formed and entrusted with informing the Assembly of  these matters.    Al-Jazzar argued that the current armed confrontations in  the  Arab world have nothing to do with Egypt and should not be cited  to justify the extension. "We did nothing to [stop] the  fighting in Yemen, for example, and consequently this extension  is not well-justified," he said. A report by the Assembly's  defence and national security committee said that vesting the  president with this authority was "for the purpose of dealing  with the circumstances through which the Arab region is passing."    The report said, "Egypt carries the burden of those events  which influence the security and stability of the entire region  and which reflect on Egypt's own security and national  interests. This may prompt Egypt to conclude agreements with  the aim of acquiring weapons and military equipment and aid.  There is no doubt that these agreements need quick  ratification. The allocations for armament and other  allocations necessary for the armed forces also require quick  decisions, in view of their secret nature and their importance  to national security and also in view of their linkage to the  political relations between states..."

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Insurance on the crest - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT Third-quarter profits from Commercial Union and Royal Insurance demonstrate that the UK insurance sector is still riding on the crest of a cyclical wave. But, from here on, it is likely to be a gentle slide to the next earnings trough. The magnitude of the bounce in profits merely serves to highlight the sector's incorrigible cyclicality. The niceties of insurance accounting ensure that the slowdown in earnings from current levels will be gradual. However, rates in the key domestic motor and household markets - which account for nearly the lion's share of Royal's underwriting profits - have already slipped. They will slip further as the onslaught from low-cost 'direct' insurers continues. Also set to deteriorate is the ratio of claims paid to premium income: the recent improvement does not look sustainable. There are plus points. For example, insurers seem willing to forgo market share in motors rather than pursue new business at uneconomic rates. They are also maintaining pressure on costs, as highlighted by Royal's plans to cut its UK workforce by 10 per cent over the next three years. But, overall, the medium-term outlook for the UK industry is far from bright. The outlook for the shares is, however, less dependent on the UK insurance cycle - or the management's effort to diversify out of it - than the state of world financial markets. Insurers' investment income is highly geared to the market, and a reversal of the recent sharp underperformance of the sector is likely to come only with a pronounced equity market rally.</p>

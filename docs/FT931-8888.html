			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Merry Hill centre sale realises Pounds 128m RECEIVERS OF Mountleigh, the property company that failed last May, have agreed to sell Merry Hill, a Midlands shopping centre and the group's largest UK asset, for Pounds 128m to Chelsfield, the property company headed by Mr Elliot Bernerd. Chelsfield, which is acting in partnership with one of its associated shareholders, expects to complete the deal in about 10 weeks time. The price includes some tax benefits that stem from enterprise zone allowances. Mr Stephen James of KPMG Peat Marwick, the joint receiver, said he was 'extremely satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations.' Before Mountleigh went into receivership, it had failed in an attempt to sell the shopping centre for Pounds 115m, he said. 'We were in no hurry to sell,' he said. 'This proves that a distressed seller is someone seeking to avoid going into receivership, not one that has gone into receivership.' The deal attracted interest from half a dozen potential buyers, including O'Connor Group, the US fund which came close to buying the shopping centre a year ago. Mr Bernerd said he was a 'cautious enthusiast' about UK property. He drew encouragement from the surge in overseas investment in good quality property that followed the devaluation of sterling last September. Mr James said it would be over-optimistic to claim that the market was recovering, although more buyers were emerging. 'We are seeing a greater ability to sell things, but not prices moving up,' The receivers described Merry Hill as one of the most successful shopping centres in the UK. The centre, which has more than 260 shops and is served by a monorail transport system, is 98 per cent let. The centre was built by Don and Roy Richardson, the Dudley-based property entrepreneurs. The sale of Merry Hill was complicated by concern that the centre, which is built on a former steel works, would be placed on the contaminated land register that is planned by the government. The receivers responded to these concerns by commissioning a study which showed that no remedial action would be needed to comply with current or likely environment legislation. Mountleigh's receivers have realised about Pounds 200m from the sale of 20 of its 83 properties.</p>

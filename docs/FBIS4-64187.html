			<p>BFN     [Text] Charges have been brought against two high-ranking  officials of the Federal Intelligence Service [BND]. The State  Prosecutor's Office in Hamburg today confirmed a report on the  ARD news magazine "Panorama," which will be broadcast after this  news bulletin.    The charge is violation of the law controlling the export of  war weapons. The two allegedly attempted in 1991 to ship two  antiaircraft tanks of the NVA [former GDR's National People's  Army] to Israel declaring them as agricultural machinery.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> If I were running in the Los Angeles Marathon Sunday -- and I am not because my  best long distance is 385 yards, not 26 miles and 385 yards -- I would love to  finish the race inside the Coliseum just like they do in the Olympic Games. . .  .  </P> <P> It would be better for the spectators, too, if they were able to cheer home  their favorites from the stadium seats instead of standing-room-only on the  street. . . .  </P> <P> Put 60,000 or 70,000 fans into the Coliseum and the Boston and New York  marathons would seem bush league by comparison. . . .  </P> <P> Pray for rain on Saturday and Bayakoa on Sunday in the Santa Anita Handicap. .  . .  </P> <P> The Dodger organization will miss Sandy Koufax, a man of few words and much  wisdom. . . .  </P> <P> Remember when Orel Hershiser's contract was the envy of every other pitcher in  the major leagues? . . .  </P> <P> The University of Iowa has requested permission from the Big Ten not to fly  into Champaign, Ill., until the morning of Sunday's game against Illinois. And  Bruce Pearl, the Iowa assistant who taped the conversation with recruit Deon  Thomas, reportedly will stay at home. . . .  </P> <P> A point-shaving scandal is just what college basketball needs with all the  other problems it has. . . .  </P> <P> The beatings Oklahoma handed No. 1 Missouri and No. 1 Kansas within three days  at Norman tell you something about home-court advantage. . . .  </P> <P> Not that the rankings mean much. Who remembers that Arizona was the AP and UPI  poll champion in 1989, Temple in 1988 and Nevada Las Vegas in 1987? . . .  </P> <P> From Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs: "I'm tired of Jack Nicholson making a living  off my voice."  </P> <P> .. .  </P> <P> The University of Kentucky is better off with Rick Pitino, and the New York  Knicks are better off without him. . . .  </P> <P> Three first-year players -- guards Harold Miner of USC and Terrell Brandon of  Oregon and center Brian Hendrick of California -- should make the 10-man  all-Pac-10 team. . . .  </P> <P> You could start a pretty decent NBA franchise with three unsuccessful  candidates for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team -- Charles Barkley, Karl Malone and  John Stockton. . . .  </P> <P> Expansion has been a blessing for journeymen such as Jerry Sichting, who is  playing in his 10th pro season because the talent pool is so diluted. . . .  </P> <P> It turns out that the Minnesota Timberwolves didn't make a mistake when they  made UCLA guard Pooh Richardson their first draft choice. . . .  </P> <P> Thumbs up to Forum public address announcer Lawrence Tanter for informing the  crowd before the Lakers-Utah game Sunday that Mychal Thompson wouldn't be able  to play because of an injury. . . .  </P> <P> It's not so much that Larry Bird's shooting touch is still a little bit off,  but that he can't get open for the same shots that he used to. . . .  </P> <P> The Artesia High basketball team, featuring Ed O'Bannon, is taller than half  the teams in the Pac-10. . . .  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington has been on his best behavior since  offering to donate $1,000 to charity if he drew another technical foul. "That  $1,000 would pay for a lot of greens fees," the six-handicap golfer says. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Gartner probably will be traded by the Minnesota North Stars, who are  going nowhere except possibly to Oakland. . . .  </P> <P> The trade of Doug Smith to his fifth NHL team, Pittsburgh, is another reminder  of the weakness of the Kings' scouting system over the years. Smith was the  second overall pick in the 1981 draft. . . .  </P> <P> O.J. Simpson, Marcus Allen, Steve Duchesne and Bruce McNall were among those  joining the U.S. World Cup soccer team in recording a rap song the other night  at A&amp;M Records. . . .  </P> <P> Vic Holchak, a sportscaster who recently spent a month in East Germany  reporting for National Public Radio and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., firmly  believes there will be a unified German team in the 1992 Olympic Games. "West  German money will support East German sports," he said. . . .  </P> <P> Wonder if the NFL has anything in the works for Plan C free agents. . . .  </P> <P> Homer Smith is back on the job as UCLA offensive coordinator, looking at films  of last season's games. . . .  </P> <P> Finest new running track in Southern California is the one at Birmingham High,  which was donated by Michael Milken. The former junk bond king and actress  Sally Field were cheerleaders at the school in the San Fernando Valley. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Smrek, meet Kent Hrbek.  </P></p>

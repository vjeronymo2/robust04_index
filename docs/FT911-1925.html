			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Swedes boost attack on US steel duties SWEDEN has stepped up its attack on US anti-dumping duties on steel imports, after Washington this week declined for the fourth time to implement a ruling by a Gatt disputes panel. The Swedes opened a new case by complaining to Gatt's anti-dumping committee on Tuesday that the US was refusing to review anti-dumping duties imposed almost 20 years ago on imports of stainless steel plate from Sweden. Also, the Swedes charged the US was 'blatantly ignoring' Gatt's anti-dumping code in pursuing a case against imports of anti-friction bearings from SKF, the big Swedish roller bearings group. This case also involves German, French and British exporters. The message from Washington was that Gatt's rules for settling trade disputes did not apply to the US, unless it wanted them to, a Swedish Foreign Ministry official said. A disputes panel ruled last September that the US had not followed Gatt anti-dumping rules when imposing duties on imports of seamless stainless steel products from the Swedish company Sandvik. The US administration had acted at the request of only a few companies and had not satisfied itself the request had been filed on behalf of the domestic industry affected. The panel told the US to revoke the duty and reimburse the company for more than Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.7m) it had already paid. The US administration has contested some of the panel's arguments, challenged the panel's right to prescribe a specific remedy, and claims US law prevents it complying with the panel's ruling. Sweden asked for bilateral consultations - the first step to raising a dispute in Gatt - with the US on the new dumping case. Avesta, one of the biggest US domestic producers, had exhausted all the means available, including the US Court of Appeals, to obtain a review of the anti-dumping duties imposed in 1973, the Swedish official said. Imports of hot rolled stainless steel plate from Sweden represented 0.2 per cent of US consumption. In justifying the dumping charge in 1973, the US contended the Swedes had maintained their exports to the US market during a decline in demand for stainless steel plate in western Europe, their biggest market. Swedish exports to the EC grew 266 per cent between 1971 and 1985. Yet the US authorities continued to argue that the information presented by Avesta was insufficient to warrant a review of the dumping duties, the Swedish official said. The US accepted the Swedish demand for consultations.</p>

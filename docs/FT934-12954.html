			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Victims who want to soldier on: Melanie McDonogh meets a formidable brigade of men in Bosnia THE WAR in Bosnia has become so complicated that most of us have given up trying to understand it. But the majority of people have one abiding impression: that the Moslems are the main victims, the people who have suffered more than anyone else. That is why the Seventeenth Brigade is remarkable. It is the brigade of victims turned soldiers. Nearly all the men in it are Moslems who were expelled by the Serbs from Northern Bosnia. Most have spent time in brutal Serbian detention camps such as Omarska where, they say, they were treated inhumanely. They came to Travnik 18 months ago, and there they formed a brigade to fight their oppressors. That is where they first entered the public eye. When the fighting started a few months ago between the Bosnian army and their former allies, the Croats, the Seventeenth Brigade and the Bosnian army won. One result of their victory was the exodus of most of the Croatians from Travnik, where they had made up more than 40 per cent of the population. The other was the establishment of the brigade's reputation as a formidable fighting force. I met the general who commands this brigade in a field of crocuses overlooking the plain where his soldiers were fighting the Croats around Zenica. It is an idyllic place - or would be if it was not for the sound of shells exploding behind us. Getting to him was an arduous, roundabout business. First, I had been with the Croatian army in Gornji Vakuf, then I had gone to Vitez. From there I had walked across the front, from the Croatian side to the Bosnian army, where the soldiers took me to Travnik. From Travnik there had been a bumpy trip at breakneck speed - 'we have to drive fast to avoid snipers' - in the military police commander's precious VW Golf, through steep little villages, behind flocks of sheep, across fields where you would normally hesitate to take a Land Rover, to the general, sitting in a tranquil meadow. The general's name is Mehmet Agic - Aga to his men - and he is a former dancing master in a military academy. 'It was such a good way to meet girls,' he said. We sat on a wooden bench, he gave me a cigarette and a soldier brought us cups of warm milk. Aga is a commanding presence and a tremendous flirt. He does not talk the language of compromise. I asked why it was that the brigade, made up of men who had been dispossessed by the Serbs, were now fighting the Croats. 'We are the army of Bosnia-Hercegovina,' he said simply. 'The legal army. We fight wherever the fascists - the Chetniks (Serbs) and Utasha (Croats) - try to kill Moslems. Every weapon of theirs is a weapon to kill Moslem people.' The brigade has remarkable morale - it is so short of petrol that the soldiers have to walk to the front, but one of them bragged that because of this they had 'the best legs in the Bosnian army'. If the Geneva peace-dealers are hoping that hunger and desperation will cause the Bosnian army to compromise, an encounter with the brigade would fill them with gloom. 'We have nothing,' said Aga cheerfully. 'Just morale and a hard bite. But we can live without French chocolates. We don't want to live in another country. We want to live here. And if necessary, we will eat the flowers in the field before we give in.' He took me to see the terrain stretched out below. One of the soldiers gave me an apple; another, a handful of walnuts. I had expected before I came that the soldiers in this unit might have been brutalised by what they had been through. But to a stranger, they could not have been kinder. The dehumanising experience of the camps and dispossession has left its mark, however, even though the commander insists that he does not want revenge. One officer in another unit in Travnik said bluntly of the men in the brigade who had been in Omarska: 'They are full of hate.' I met some of them. A soldier who had been in the detention camp for 70 days recalled that they were beaten every day. 'Every day we would get the Serbian massage,' he said, tapping his shoulders behind the neck. 'And every day the lorries would come and take away the dead. But I'm getting my own back now. 'But,' I said, 'you are not fighting the Serbs here.' 'We will,' he said. 'The Serbs are afraid of the Seventeenth Brigade.' For all that this brigade has little hope of attacking the Serbs, who are for the most part solidly entrenched and well-armed in what is now the Serbian Republic, many are homesick for the towns from which they have been expelled. I told them I had been in the region a little while ago. They crowded round me asking questions. What was it like in Banja Luka? Was the town much damaged? Were there any mosques left? The answer to that last question was 'no'. I cannot say that most of the men I met were fundamentalist Moslems; especially on the subject of drink, veiled women and mosque attendance. Most, if asked, estimate the number of fundamentalists in the army at around 10 or 20 per cent. There are a few Croats and Serbs in the brigade, and the odd foreign volunteer. One Moslem, aged 17, introduced me enthusiastically to his colleague, a Serb. 'The best,' he said, clapping him on the shoulder. 'Are you an Orthodox?' I asked him. 'No, a Moslem,' he said ironically. 'He's lying]' they chorused. The losers around Travnik, obviously, have been the Croats. I passed through several villages on the way to the commander where the houses had been gutted. 'Croatian houses?,' I asked the young soldier with me. He shook his head. 'HVO houses,' he said, referring to the Croatian army, which presumably had tried to defend them. For the Croatian community, however, the distinction cannot have been that obvious. But, to the credit of the Bosnia army, the Roman Catholic churches in those villages are still intact. The fighting in which the brigade has taken part has been ugly, fought with ferocity that you only get between old allies. I told a couple of soldiers about the stories I had heard on the Croatian side about finding the mutilated bodies of their comrades. 'Listen,' one of them said. 'I've seen the bodies of our men with their eyes gouged out and their arms hacked off. I found one soldier on the other side with his pockets full of ears.' None of the brigade gets paid. The men get just their uniforms, food and four packets of cigarettes a month, bought from the Serbian troops on the mountains nearby. 'All we have got is big hearts,' one said. 'If we had weapons as well, nothing would stop us.'</p>

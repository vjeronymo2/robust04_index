			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS;  </P> <P> PRIVATE FIRM TO RUN BOOKSTORE  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita Community College District Board of Trustees this week  approved a three-year contract that will allow a private firm to operate and  manage the College of the Canyons bookstore.  </P> <P> Trustees voted Wednesday night to award Follette College Stores a contract to  take over the campus store Nov. 1.  </P> <P> The contract guarantees the district $75,000 a year or 7.2% of sales between $1  million and $1.5 million and 7.6% of sales above $1.5 million.  </P> <P> Under the new management, students will receive reduced book prices. More used  books, updated technology, additional staff, extended operating hours, internal  improvements and special promotions also are included in the new contract.  </P> <P> A major concern of college officials was the continued employment of its own  full-time employees at the bookstore. The company agreed to place the COC  employees under contract and to offer them full benefits.  </P> <P> "They will pay the entire cost of our benefits," said Dianne Van Hook, district  superintendent-president. "That is an added bonus for us."  </P> <P> A committee of faculty members and students investigated reports of high prices  at the college-run store for the last year.  </P> <P> Trustees selected Follette College Stores over three competitors.  </P> <P> Lower book prices will not be immediately evident because of inflation, said  Trustee Linda Cubbage.

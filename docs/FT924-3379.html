			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Design problems plague Qantas sell-off - The factors shaping the privatisation of Australia's 'flying rat' THE long and increasingly convoluted privatisation of Qantas, the Australian airline, reaches a crucial stage tomorrow when three foreign carriers are expected to deliver detailed bids. The bids - from British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand - will lay the groundwork for the sale of up to 49 per cent of Qantas to corporate and institutional investors. If all goes according to plan, the government will float the balance on the Australian Stock Exchange. The two-stage process should return about ADollars 1bn (USDollars 690m) to the Treasury. However, after more than a year of uncertainty, it is unclear whether the privatisation can be completed on schedule in March. BA has not troubled to hide its irritation with the erratic behaviour of the federal Labor government, which has changed its mind about the sale several times. Initial privatisation plans, announced in 1991, envisaged the separate sale of 49 per cent of Qantas and 100 per cent of Australian Airlines, one of the two main domestic carriers. In June, Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, persuaded Labor to accept the merger of the two airlines, at a cost of ADollars 400m to Qantas, followed by 100 per cent privatisation. Last month, the government changed the rules again, reducing the maximum shareholding of any one foreign airline from 35 per cent to 25 per cent, with a 35 per cent ceiling on aggregate foreign ownership. The latest announcement was badly received in London, where Sir Colin Marshall, BA chief executive, said BA was 'uncertain' whether it remained interested in Qantas. Some of the uncertainty was removed at a subsequent meeting in New York between Sir Colin and Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's finance minister, who is in charge of the sale. But analysts say the government may have over-estimated Qantas' attraction. In this case, it could be forced into a risky flotation of up to 100 per cent of the airline next year. Qantas has a great deal going for it. It has an excellent safety record and it owns one of the newest fleets in the world. Its white kangaroo logo, known in the aviation business as the flying rat, is one of the world's best-known brands, especially in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific area. Moves towards a common aviation market with New Zealand, due by 1994, have increased Qantas' potential domestic base from about 17m people to 21m. The merger with Australian Airlines also allows Qantas to feed domestic customers more effectively into its international operations. But the big attraction is Qantas' strong network in the Asia-Pacific region. Qantas would be a very good fit with BA, which offers increased access to Europe and North America in return for a stronger Pacific presence. Such a scenario is in line with Sir Colin's view that global aviation will be controlled over the next decade by half a dozen big airlines. BA has given private assurances that it would use its shareholding to reach mutually beneficial agreements with Qantas, rather than to dominate the airline. But Qantas managers believe that effective control would inevitably pass to London unless BA's influence was countered by an equally strong shareholding in the hands of another airline. BA is thought unlikely to agree to such an arrangement, and is believed to be structuring its bid to allow for a 24 per cent initial shareholding in Qantas by Australian institutions. Qantas managers, notably Mr John Ward, managing director, would prefer a deal in which the available foreign shareholding was split between Singapore Airlines and Air NZ. Such a deal, sometimes called the 'tricycle option', would build on the existing links between the three players: Qantas owns 19 per cent of Air NZ; while Temasek Holdings, SIA's parent company, owns about 6 per cent of Brierley Investments, the biggest shareholder in Air NZ. The tricycle option makes strategic sense in the context of a common Australasian market, and might give Qantas greater access to Singapore's Changi Airport - one of Asia's two hubs. But, before any deal can be done the government must reach agreement with the airlines on Qantas' value. In addition to ADollars 1bn of shareholders' funds, the price must cover the ADollars 400m cost of acquiring Australian Airlines, and Qantas' recapitalisation to ease the balance sheet burden of its ADollars 3bn debt. Mr Kim Beazley, the minister who initiated the privatisation, put the recapitalisation requirements of the two airlines at ADollars 1bn, implying a ADollars 2.4bn price for the merged airline. But Qantas management is pushing for a larger recapitalisation to reduce its ratio of debt to shareholders' funds from the present 75:25 to nearer 50:50. According to Mr Ward, that would increase the sale price to as much as ADollars 3bn. This means the airlines' bids will have to reflect their judgments of Qantas' recapitalisation requirements, which may differ from those of the government and Qantas management. If the trade sale goes ahead, it will dictate the price of shares in the subsequent flotation. That could make the issue difficult to sell unless the Australian market rallies between now and then. If the trade sale flounders, or if less than 49 per cent of the airline is sold, the government will have to expand the planned flotation. But there is another complication. The government must hold a federal election by June, but Mr Keating has left open the option of an early election between March and May. The uncertainty makes it difficult to ensure that the flotation would not clash with the five-week campaign, suggesting that it may have to be delayed. 'There are so many variables involved with this deal that it is impossible to know what is going to happen,' says one of the half-dozen stockbrokers advising the government. 'The airline is definitely saleable, but how and at what price it is impossible to say.'</p>

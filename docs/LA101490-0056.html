			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' CHOICES  </P> <P> Compiled by Lynne Heffley. Send listings to Stage Listings, Calendar, Los  Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053. Accessibility and  facilities for the handicapped are indicated by the wheelchair symbol  </P> <P> The selections are those of Times reviewers. Long-running plays are reviewed  periodically.  </P> <P> A Shayna Maidel (Tiffany Theatre, 8532 W. Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (213)  289-2999). A family, divided by events in Nazi Germany, is reunited after 20  years. "Heart-on-sleeve theater, with a big heart and an ample sleeve.  Remarkably affecting" (Don Shirley). Thur.-Sat., 8 p.m.; Sun., 3 and 7:30 p.m.  Indefinitely. $20.50-$24.50.  </P> <P> American Splendor (Theatre Theater, 1713 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, (213)  466-1767). Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson on "The Simpsons,"  portrays underground comic book writer Harvey Pekar in a work based on Pekar's  stories. "A superbly droll theatricalizing of Pekar's world, with no set and  several terrific actors. Unromantic and noncynical, director Vince Waldron's  adaptation shows people losing at life while almost always retaining their  sanity." (Robert Koehler). Sat., 10:30 p.m. Ends Nov. 24. $10.  </P> <P> The Beggar's Opera (Pacific Theatre Ensemble, 705 Venice Blvd., Venice, (213)  466-1767). John Gay's satire of 18th-Century England's corrupt administration  under its first prime minister. "If we needed evidence of this show's lasting  relevance and of the wisdom of reviving it, this staging abundantly provides  it. Gay's rough and ribald send-up is mounted in every nook and cranny -- floor  to rafters -- of the ensemble's 17 x 45-foot storefront. It's brilliant use of  non-available space" (Sylvie Drake). Thur.-Sun., 8 p.m. Ends Nov. 18.  $15-$17.50.  </P> <P> The Good Woman of Setzuan (Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd.,  West L.A., (213) 477-2055). The Actors' Gang presents Bertolt Brecht's parable  of good and evil. Tim Robbins directs. "Brecht's Theatre of Alienation -- of  which 'Good Woman' may be the masterpiece -- was always about the alienation  Out There and humanizing the audience In Here. Robbins and The Actors' Gang  have served the playwright's purpose as brilliantly as any company can. This is  Brecht as he wished it: for the masses" (Robert Koehler). Tue.-Fri., 8 p.m.  Ends Fri. $10-$12.  </P> <P> Honey, I'm Home (Stages Theatre Center, 1540 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood,  (213) 466-1767). Satiric portraits of society, by and with Don Victor. "A  humorist is rare in this era of jingly stand-up comedy and Don Victor is  exactly that, a humorist" (T. H. McCulloh). Sun., 7 p.m. Ends Oct. 28. $10.  </P> <P> Hope of the Heart (Mark Taper Forum, 135 N. Grand Ave., (213) 410-1062, (714)  634-1300, (213) 972-7231, TDD (213) 680-4017). The writings of Robert Penn  Warren -- Chapter IV of "All the King's Men" and "Brother to Dragons" --  adapted for stage by Adrian Hall, who directs. "Hall delivers an astonishing  assault of ideas, images, language and a cappella choruses 'mediated' by  turbulent emotion. It is how he has matched and theatricalized these stories,  more than the stories themselves, that makes them stunning" (Sylvie Drake).  Tue.-Sat., 8 p.m.; Sun., 7:30 p.m.; mat., Sat.-Sun., 2:30 p.m. Ends Nov. 11.  $24-$30.  </P> <P> Our Father (Gorky's Cafe and Russian Brewery, 1716 N. Cahuenga Blvd.,  Hollywood, (213) 463-6480). Comedy about six Irish brothers gathered at the  wake of their deceased father. "Michael Stephens' writing is eccentric, vivid,  poetic and highly theatrical, and director Ted J. Tobin caresses its rhythms,  alternately gentle and harsh and unexpected" (T. H. McCulloh). Thur., 10 p.m.;  Fri., 7:30 p.m. Indefinitely. $10.  </P> <P> The Pelican (2nd Stage, 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 466-1767).  Salome Jens heads the cast in August Strindberg's Gothic comedy. Directed by  Jules Aaron. "Salome Jens gives a haunting performance as a woman who destroys  her family, in a fascinating revival of Strindberg's chamber play" (T. H.  McCulloh). Today, Thur.-Sat., 8 p.m.; next Sun., 3 and 8 p.m. Ends next Sun.  $12.  </P> <P> Long-running shows also recommended: "Family Secrets," "Kvetch," "Meat Dreams,"  "Personality," "Tamara."

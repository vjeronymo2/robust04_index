			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Japanese make 22% of car output JAPANESE carmakers accounted for more than a fifth of UK car production in the first three months of the year, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. Nissan, which began producing cars at its Pounds 900m Sunderland plant in 1986, overtook Vauxhall for the first time to claim third place behind Rover and Ford. The three Japanese carmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda, which have all located their first European car plants in the UK, produced 80,065 cars in Britain in the first quarter of the year, or 22 per cent of total UK car output. Overall UK car production in the first three months increased by 6.2 per cent to 364,509 from 343,318 in the same period a year ago, as rising output from the Japanese producers more than compensated for lower production from the traditional volume carmakers in the UK, Rover, Ford of the US, Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, and Peugeot. Nissan, which plans to raise production at its Sunderland plant by 51 per cent this year to 270,000 from 179,000 last year, increased output year-on-year in the first quarter by 88 per cent to 70,058. Honda, which began output at its Swindon plant last October, produced 5,199 cars in the first quarter and plans to produce 32,000 cars in the whole of this year. Toyota output at its plant at Burnaston near Derby, which was opened in December, totalled 4,808 in the first three months and is expected to reach 36,000 in the full year. Rover, Ford and Vauxhall all produced fewer cars in the first quarter than in the same period a year ago, with Ford car output falling by 17 per cent to 75,561. The traditional volume carmakers in Britain are all feeling the impact of the sharp decline in new car sales in continental Europe, although the impact is being cushioned in part by the greatly improved competitiveness of the UK as a production source for the pan-European carmakers. According to GM the two Vauxhall assembly plants in the UK are now its lowest-cost plants in west Europe. Commercial vehicle production fell by 11.4 per cent in the first three months. Output has been hit in part by the collapse into receivership of Leyland Daf in early February. Output continued at both the Leyland Daf van plant at Birmingham and at the truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, but at a much lower level than a year ago. Leyland Daf Vans, which has been taken out of receivership by a management buy-out, produced 2,755 vans in the first quarter, a 49.6 per cent fall from the same period a year ago. The Leyland Daf truck plant, which is still in receivership, suffered a 45 per cent drop in output. Negotiations on a rescue of the plant are expected to be completed in the next two weeks.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        UK VEHICLE PRODUCTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   1993        1992       1993/92                                  Jan-Mar     Jan-Mar    % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                            364,509     343,318      +6.2 Rover (British Aerospace)        100,256     104,283      -3.9  -cars****                        87,558      94,937      -7.8  -Range Rover/Discovery           12,698       9,346     +35.9 Ford (excl.

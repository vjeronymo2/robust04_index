			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 15 (XINHUA) -- A peacekeeping force of  the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), consisting mainly  of Russian troops, will move into the security zone between  Georgia and the breakaway region of Abkhazia by the end of may,  INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported today.    Under a Russia-brokered agreement on cease-fire and  disengagement of the two sides' forces, both Georgian government  troops and armed Abkhazian separatists are to be pulled back 12  kilometers from the Ingur River to create a 24-km-wide buffer  zone where the Russian peacekeepers will be deployed.    The security zone will help prevent the conflict in the  region from erupting again and create conditions for refugees to  return home, the Russian Government said after the signing of  the agreement yesterday in Moscow by representatives of the  Georgian Government and the rebels after talks through the  mediation of Moscow.    They will resume negotiations in Geneva next month on the  status of Abkhazia.    Formerly an autonomous republic in Western Georgia on the  Black Sea coast, Abkhazia in July 1992 declared independence  from Georgia, a move bitterly denounced by the Tbilisi  government.    Government troops moved into Sukhumi, capital of Abkhazia,  the next month, and war flared up. Last year, Abkhazian  separatists drove the Georgian troops out of the region and  Tbilisi asked Moscow to intervene in the conflict.    Georgia's economy has suffered a lot in the 22-month-old  conflict which is still going on despite the mediation of Moscow.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle Investors who piled into Tate late last year, on the back of its much-vaunted value-added promise, are now discovering that the company is a good old commodity business after all. Just when a 14-year unbroken profits record was beginning to suggest otherwise, along come terrible weather and US overcapacity in high-fructose corn syrup to ram home the point. Sensitivity to the external environment explains why Tate's rating as measured by its forward earnings multiple is below the market average. What size of discount is appropriate depends on the strength of this year's bounce back. The positive impact of a weaker pound could well be substantial  -as much as Pounds 30m according to one outside estimate. Dwarfing everything else in importance, though, is the extent of the turnround at Staley. Tate is clearly chipper about the prospects, having appointed a new man to do the job. But the shares are unlikely to advance much further until there is evidence that prices are not suffering in the battle to recapture market share. Depending on the outcome, profits in 1992-93 could be anywhere between Pounds 220m and Pounds 240m. For all the short-term uncertainties Tate's earnings per share record from 1988 to 1992 will probably be better than the likes of Cadbury and Unilever. There may be nothing wrong with commodity businesses, especially if they have quasi-monopolistic positions and are good at exploiting them.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE WARNS CITY TO MOVE ON HOUSING FOR  ELDERLY  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge sternly warned the city of Hidden Hills on  Thursday that it must proceed with a court-ordered lower-cost housing plan for  senior citizens, but stopped short of holding the city in contempt of court.  </P> <P> Judge R. William Schoettler, Jr. said he is prepared to order City Council  members into court and keep them there "eight hours a day, five days a week"  until they approve the housing plan.  </P> <P> Schoettler did not hold the city in contempt but left open the possibility,  saying he would enforce a Feb. 5, 1992, deadline for construction to start.  </P> <P> The city was plunged into controversy last year when the City Council supported  a plan for 46 units of senior housing on land annexed from the county. The  project was part of a court order issued by Schoettler last July, when the city  agreed to settle a lawsuit by the county and a private attorney over the city's  formation of a redevelopment agency to fund a flood-control project.  </P></p>

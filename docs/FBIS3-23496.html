Go ahead Ubaldo.    Diaz: This afternoon at 1908 Luis Donaldo Colosio,  presidential candidate for the ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI], was the target of an attack. He  apparently sustained two bullet wounds -- one in the head and  one in the chest. The political rally was being held in the  Lomas de Tijuana neighborhood, better known as Lomas Taurinas.  Colosio was leading a political rally here for 3,000 persons.  At the end of the rally, as he was leaving the podium, two  individuals, a young person and an older one, approached him  with pistols and managed to shoot the PRI candidate. [passage  omitted]</p>

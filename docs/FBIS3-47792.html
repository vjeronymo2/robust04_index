			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Japanese investment in  Europe dwindled by 24.7 percent to 7.06 billion dollars between  June 1992 and July 1993 and Europe's share of overall Japanese  overseas investment has slipped, too, according to a study  released Monday [17 January].    The report by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in  Japan said that while 22.5 percent of Japanese overseas  investment in the previous survey period, which covered 14  months, went to Europe -- including Turkey and the successor  states to the former Soviet Union -- Europe's share this time  shrank to 20.7 percent. Europe will remain an important  investment market, however, the survey forecasts.    "The drop in investments is not caused by a declining  interest (in Europe) or lesser competitive pressure among  Japanese enterprises, but reflects a certain investment  saturation and the current economic slump," it said.    As in previous years, Britain received the lion's share of  Japan's European investment, some 2.95 billion dollars, followed  by the Netherlands with 1.45 billion dollars, Germany with 769  million dollars, and France with 456 million dollars.    Of a total of 538 investments, some 378 or 70.8 percent were  in the manufacturing industry. Car production ranked top with  92 investments, followed by the electronics industry with 89  projects, and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries with 54.    Japanese companies concentrate their investment activities  on  those sectors where the Europeans hold a substantial market  share, such as environmental technology, chemicals and  pharmaceuticals as well as car manufacturing, the survey says.    In response to an increasing international pressure on Japan  to cut its trade surplus, the high yen and stricter regulations  on local content, Japan's internationalization will continue,  the survey predicts.    "Taking into account that a relatively low 7 percent of  Japan's production occurs abroad compared with 25 percent for  the United States, another investment offensive might just be a  matter of time," it said.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / BR compensation likely to be limited COMMUTERS on British Rail's Network SouthEast services are likely to find that only one - if any - of the network's 15 routes will have performed badly enough by the end of the year to trigger compensation under the Passenger's Charter in the form of discounts for season tickets. The results are likely to bring criticisms that the performance targets, which vary from one Network SouthEast route to another according to the investment they have received, are too easy. The only route likely to make a pay-out this year is the Kent Coast line which is failing to get the required 82 per cent of peak-hour trains to their destination within five minutes of the scheduled time. So far this year it has managed only 78.5 per cent. Network SouthEast said reasons for the route's poor performance included preparations for the Channel tunnel as well as train failures and leaves on the line. If its performance fails to improve, commuters using the route will get a 5 per cent discount on the renewal price of their season tickets. But if the line can bring punctuality to within 3 percentage points of the target in the last few weeks of the year, it will still avoid having to pay compensation. Network SouthEast said the purpose of the targets was to improve the performance of the railway, not to hand out cash. The fact that season-ticket discounts were unlikely to be triggered indicated that the targets were achieving their objective. The government points to the performance of lines such as the rundown route between London and Tilbury and Southend in Essex, which, although it has a punctuality target of only 80 per cent, is actually achieving 90.3 per cent. Ministers say this supports the belief that performance is as much a matter of organisation and management as of investment. They are therefore likely to set much tougher targets for all lines next year including the under-invested ones. Five of the 24 Regional Railways routes will give discounts to season ticket holders if their performance does not improve by the end of the year. They are Cross Country; East Midlands and Lincs; West Midlands; Cardiff Valleys; and North East services.</p>

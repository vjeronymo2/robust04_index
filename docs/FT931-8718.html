			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / US housing starts at lowest for six months US HOUSING starts fell 7.2 per cent in January to the lowest level in six months, the government said yesterday, AP reports from Washington. Analysts attributed the decline in part to bad weather, but most agreed that housing growth was likely to slow from last year's pace. Construction advanced 18.4 per cent in 1992. Starts rose only in the south in January. The Commerce Department said construction of new single-family homes and apartments totalled 1.19m at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in January, down from 1.29m a month earlier.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Travel: Hard ride on the world's highest road - Andrew Anderson climbs the Khyber Pass and travels across northern Pakistan in search of Shangri-La IT WAS all too perfect. The moon hung heavy over the governor's mansion. Peacocks strutted on verdant lawns. The elite of the Khyber Rifles Regiment brought down the flag. The Last Post echoed mournfully. And the governor's servants, dressed in sculpted turbans resembling upturned candelabra, served us sandwiches with the crusts cut off. The governor of the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan bore a startling resemblance to Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. His pyjama suit was beautifully cut, his moustache doubly so, and although the scene seemed quintessential British Empire he looked proud of his new country and prouder still of its past. This was the centre of the ancient Buddhist kingdom of Gandhara. It was overrun by the Kushans in the first century AD, brought under Moslem control in the 11th century, then later governed - but never really conquered - by the Moghul emperors, the Durranis of Afghanistan, the Sikhs of Lahore, and, from 1849 to 1947, the British. The latter, fearing a Russian invasion, tried to manipulate the feud-obsessed Pathans by playing the myriad tribes off against one another. They tried bribery, threats, taking hostages: the Pathans largely did their own thing - mainly fighting among themselves and anyone else who got in their way, often with murderous success. It was in this guerrilla-friendly wilderness that the British swopped their bright red uniforms for inconspicuous khaki, from the local word kakhi, meaning dusty. Today Pathans still stroll through Peshawar, capital of the NWFP and home of the governor, with rifles slung under their cloaks. The Russians have fled neighbouring Afghanistan, but the Tribal Areas - backing on to the Afghan border - are still full of tribal Mujahideen, now largely engaged in smuggling and gun-running, still exchanging 'a blow for a pinch' in their innumerable family feuds. Peshawar is a town with a split personality: a modern university and a Pearl Continental hotel, the serenity of the (British-built) Mall, and, in the Old City, a mass of choked streets, rickety shops and wild-eyed Pathans. In the Khyber Bazaar billboards depicting gory extractions point the way to the street of dentists; brass and copper merchants beat a timpani of welcome off Qissa Khawani Street; the money changers squat amid piles of filthy notes in Chowk Yadgar, the central square, pocket calculators poised. If the Pearl Continental is too bland, Dean's Hotel, on Islamia Road, offers basic rooms with a touch of colonial nostalgia, plus the boast that 'Winston Churchill slept here'. (He probably needed extra blankets). Salatin's, on Cinema Road, offers first-class Pathan fare - meat kebabs, chicken shashlik: vegetarians face a lean time in most of Pakistan. Twenty kilometres from Peshawar, towards Afghanistan, lies the Khyber Pass. Although officially off-limits, permits can be obtained through the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in Peshawar. An armed escort is required, and the Pakistan Tourist Development Corporation can help. The road winds first past choked camps of Afghan refugees, outcasts from their war-torn country and a terrible drain on Pakistan's economy. The refugees have built their own areas of commerce, mainly smuggled goods bearing western brand-names - there is even a Khyber Pass branch of 'Marks and Spencers'. The Pass starts at Jamrud Fort and climbs into the Tribal Area, nominally under Pakistan control but a place that lives by its own laws. From the plain great crags of jagged rock rise up to tear at the sky, the rocks splintered by the heat and cold of furious seasons; nothing moves, nothing appears to grow, or seems capable of survival in this awful wilderness. Daubed on the rocks are regimental badges and mottoes of British regiments which served there. One cannot imagine what the khaki'd youths from Devon or Cheshire made of it all, alternately shivering and boiling in their rock-hewn lookouts, waiting for the cold blade of a Pathan. The graves of the victims (of cholera, mostly) dot the landscape. The pass is now guarded by the Khyber Rifles, whose HQ is close to the top of the pass. An eyrie of a border post overlooking a few miles of no-man's land before the Afghan border marks the limit of lawfulness. Beyond this, the tribespeople and Mujahideen come and go as they please, riding shotgun in Japanese flatbed trucks, smuggling drugs and goods of every description to the bazaar of Landi Kotal hard by the border post, where hashish is sold by the bucketful and tourists' armed escorts nervously stick flowers in their rifle barrels to show they come in peace. There is peace aplenty further north than the NWFP: pincered between India and the Chinese border, the Himalayas on one side and the Karakorams on the other, lies the gorgeously rugged Northern Territory. One of the world's most exciting commercial flights takes you - weather permitting - from Islamabad to Skardu, flying towards K2 and past the looming bulk of Nanga Parbat, before barrelling down a narrow valley, turning on a sixpence and landing on a flood plain of the young River Indus, 2,300m above sea level, at Skardu, capital of Baltistan. The (heavily subsidised) fare of Rs300 (Pounds 7) is a bargain. Skardu is the gateway to some of the world's finest trekking and mountaineering areas. The town is little more than a collection of shacks, but the setting is spectacular: the great oval sand-basin of the Indus floodplain, ringed by mountains on all sides, the bluest of skies. All sense of perspective is lost amid the dizzying peaks. Some 30km from Skardu, on the road to Gilgit, is the Shangri-La Tourist Resort, an up-market hotel built in a style best described as mock-dodgy Chinese, but in a gorgeous setting around icy Katchura Lake. Rooms start from around Rs850; for a little more you can bed down in a converted Dakota aircraft that crash-landed on the Indus sands in the 1970s and was hauled by man-power to its present site. Further north, pointing its pot-holed finger all the way to China and beyond, lies the 1,000-km-long Karakoram Highway, acclaimed by Pakistan as (yet another) Eighth Wonder of the World. This one almost deserves the accolade: built over 20 years at a cost of hundreds of lives, it defies countless earth tremors to provide a trade artery along a route that dates further back than the Silk Road. Driving up the KKH is a heart-stopping experience. The 'road' from Skardu to Gilgit, which joins the KKH at the Alam Bridge, is a useful primer. It hugs the Indus gorge all the way, carved or blasted out of the rock walls that tower above it, with the river silently sweeping or raging and roaring hundreds of metres below. Huge, gaily-painted lorries groan along its length for days on end; meeting one requires the most delicate of passing manoeuvres. Those wishing merely to be frightened should sit on the right of the bus. Those wishing to be terrified should sit on the left. Most travellers stop to de-jangle their nerves in the frontier town of Gilgit before steeling themselves for the next leg of the KKH through Hunza and on to the the snowbound Khunjerab Pass, at 5,275 metres the world's highest metalled road. Gilgit has an interesting market, to which wiry mountain men walk for days to sell their goats; a good modern hotel in the Serena Lodge; and can be reached by a spectacular small-aircraft flight (Rs245) from Islamabad, although this again often falls victim to bad weather. Like Skardu, the setting is wonderful: the town is held hostage by towering peaks. Beyond Gilgit, the KKH is shadowed on the opposite bank of the Hunza River by part of the original Silk Road, a dizzying goat track hacked into the mountainsides and punctuated by now-rotten footbridges. Much of it has disappeared, crumbled by earth tremors that strike this area of colliding geological plates every three minutes. The KKH, too, is often blocked, but quickly cleared by bulldozer. In one area hundreds of tiny garnets lie scattered amid the debris in the road. You can gather handfuls, though it will not make you rich: a polished string can be shop-bought for a few pounds. Past Rakaposhi (7,788 metres) the KKH wends into the wrenchingly-lovely Hunza Valley, inspiration for Shangri-La in James Hilton's novel Lost Horizon. After the desolation of the past hundred kilometres the valley opens up like a dreamscape: tiny, terraced fields rippling down the mountainsides, bordered by dry stone walls; graceful, slender poplar trees slashing vertical accents in the crystal air; the peaks of Rakaposhi, Ultar and Distaghil standing sentinel over all. In autumn, the valley is splashed with red, ochre, burnt umber and orange; in spring, wild flowers grow in profusion. No wonder the people - Ismaili Muslims mostly, although the practice of fairy worship clings on in some valleys - look content, though their lives must be harsh. They may not live hundreds of years, as Hilton wrote and many believed, but their diet - largely apricots - seems ambrosial enough. In Karimabad, the local capital, the (now-abandoned) old palace of the Mir, head of the family that has ruled the area since the 11th century, gazes over an enchanted arena of soaring peaks, green terraces and thriving orchards, roofed under an eggshell sky. Apparently there is no word for 'stress' in the local dialect.

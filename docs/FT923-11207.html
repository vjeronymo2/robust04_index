			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Banks at odds in Bombay scandal A WRANGLE broke out yesterday between Citibank and Standard Chartered in the latest twist in Bombay's Rs35bn (Pounds 625m) financial scandal. Standard Chartered has sent a written demand through its solicitors to Citibank in Bombay, claiming that the American bank owes it more than Rs900m over two securities transactions. Informal talks between the two banks have failed to resolve the issue. Citibank claimed yesterday it 'did not owe Standard Chartered anything' and was not the only bank to have received such letters from Standard Chartered. A Citibank vice-president in Bombay said it had proof that it had cleared all dues pertaining to the two transactions cited in the letter  - one relating to the sale of bonds issued by the government-owned Indian Railway Finance Corporation, the other to government bonds. A Standard Chartered spokesman said 'there were numerous grey areas' between the banks. However, he insisted 'there has been a warm sense of co-operation between the foreign banks' since the financial scandal broke, and said that 'no court case had yet been initiated' on any transaction. The scandal, which emanated from the market for bankers' receipts, has proved a serious embarrassment to the Indian government. India's leading foreign banks were thrust to the forefront of the affair earlier this month when a central bank report claimed that controversial securities market trading had been concentrated in their hands and in those of four brokers now under arrest. The central bank ordered a special audit of Citibank, Standard Chartered, Bank of America and ANZ Grindlays.</p>

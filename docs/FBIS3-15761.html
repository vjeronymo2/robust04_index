The two presidents will  meet at the end of the month. Most subjects to be discussed at  the meeting have already been carefully prepared.    In Kazakhstan itself, votes in the republic's first  parliamentary elections are still being counted. According to  provisional figures, about 75 percent of the electorate took  part in the elections, which were for the Supreme Kenges and  local councils. The organizers of the polls had certain worries  about the northern part of the republic, where the  Russian-speaking community predominates. However, there was no  boycott, although foreign observers are saying that the  elections were not completely free and fair. According to Radio  France Internationale, Andranik Migranyan, an adviser to the  Russian president, who went to Almaty to monitor the elections,  said that an attempt was made to ensure that the new parliament  is dominated by Kazakh deputies rather than by representatives  of other ethnic groups.    Kazakhstan's Central Electoral Commission naturally rejects  the allegations that there have been numerous contraventions of  voting procedures. The commission's chairman, Karatay Turysov,  described them as being clearly exaggerated. The complaints  which have already been received are being painstakingly  checked, Turysov said, and the necessary conclusions will be  drawn from each of them.</p>

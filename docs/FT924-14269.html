			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Payment in kind I RETIRED from the board of a company some two years ago and, since then, an offshoot has been paying my BUPA subscription voluntarily. Is the subscription taxable as a payment in kind? On the bare facts outlined, the answer is that the amount paid to BUPA on your behalf is assessable under Schedule E. It might well be that the paying company will not get any corporation tax relief in respect of the amount in question, since it does not appear to have made the payment for the purposes of its trade. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

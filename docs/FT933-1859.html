			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: 'Fair' trade motion referred DELEGATES responded to appeals by the party leadership not to press for a recasting of trade policy to ensure a bigger market for the exports of under-developed countries. Mr Malcolm Bruce, MP for Gordon and trade spokesman in the Commons, said a motion aimed at securing 'fair' rather than free trade would undermine the party's position on the Genaral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Conference voted to refer the motion to the federal policy committee.</p>

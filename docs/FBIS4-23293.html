			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare June 1 SAPA -- Fourteen African presidents,  including Mr Nelson Mandela on his first trip outside South  Africa as president, have begun gathering in Harare, Zimbabwe,  for a two-day meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa [GCA],  an international lobby for support for the continent. The  meeting starts on Thursday [2 June].    On Friday, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will host what  is expected to be the final meeting of the Frontline states, the  regional alliance of southern African nations which opposed  apartheid. Officials said leaders of the seven-nation grouping  would discuss a new organisation to replace it.    Already in Harare is Benin leader Nicephore Soglo who hosted  the previous GCA meeting in June last year. Due to arrive on  Wednesday are the heads of state of Angola, Namibia, Mozambique,  Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mali, Eritrea, Ivory Coast  and Botswana, and former World Bank head Robert MacNamara and  former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.    Founded with World Bank finance and based in Washington, the  GCA was established as an alliance of African nations and  Western donor nations with close ties to the continent. It was  part of a bid to counter a shift of Western financial support  from Africa after the fall of the Communist bloc. Backers  describe it as dedicated to "keeping alive the good news in  Africa".    Frontline heads of state are expected to support moves to  keep the body alive in spite of the transition to democracy in  South Africa. However, the group is expected to change its  "confrontational" name and adopt a new direction, working for  peace and political stability in the region and to provide a  forum for conflict mediation.</p>

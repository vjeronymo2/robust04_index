			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's ship export  contracts in fiscal 1993 totaled 197 vessels of 7,471,018 gross  tons, the second highest in 10 years and 2.8 times more than the  previous year, the Japan Ship Exporters Association said  Wednesday [20 April]. The association said the highest figure  in the 10-year period was 8.04 million tons in fiscal 1989.    The increase for fiscal 1993, which ended March 31, 1994,  was  chiefly due to more orders for bulk ships, which recovered to a  3.3 percent growth from fiscal 1991 levels after a sharp drop in  orders in fiscal 1992 because of the world recession, an  association official said.    The contracts included 125 bulk ships of 3.75 million tons  and 21 tankers of 2.11 million tons, it said.</p>

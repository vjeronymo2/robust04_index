			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: FETZER MOVES FORWARD WITH POP-PREMIUM WINES  </P> <P> Family-owned and operated Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino County not only is one  of the savviest wineries in the business, but it's always coming up with  something new and exciting.  </P> <P> The latest wrinkle is a major move forward with its line of wines in the  Pop-Premium category -- wines intended to sell for $5 or less. That move is a  strong commitment to the state of Washington.  </P> <P> Pop-Premium wines are cork-finished varietal wines that include Chardonnay and  White Zinfandel (or some other "blush" wine), made to sell for between $3-$7  for a 750-milliliter bottle. Most wineries also offer a Cabernet Sauvignon and  a Sauvignon Blanc in that price range.  </P> <P> Fetzer has all four wines in a line once called Bel Arbres and wine maker Paul  Dolan makes them all very well. The changes in the Bel Arbres line are not in  wine quality, but they are important to consumers looking for value wines.  </P> <P> The first and most obvious change is that the name of the line has been  changed. It is now called Bel Arbors.  </P> <P> "People couldn't pronounce Arbres," said Dolan, noting that the second word is  properly pronounced "arbz."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Talk of the Town  </P> <P> "We got everything from 'ar-bray' to 'arb' and people were talking more about  how to pronounce it than about the wine," he said.  </P> <P> So the name was changed, but the name of the Redwood Valley country lane on  which the original Fetzer winery is located, Bel Arbres, will stay the same.  </P> <P> The next change is with the appellation on three of the four wines. A year ago,  Fetzer announced it was testing Washington State grapes, partly because of the  difficulty of getting top-quality California grapes at prices that would permit  the Pop-Premium wines to maintain their prices.  </P> <P> A rule of thumb in the wine industry says that the price of a ton of grapes  equates to the price of a bottle of wine from those grapes in a ratio of a  dollar to a penny. That is, if a winery pays $1,200 for a ton of Cabernet  grapes, the resulting wine should sell for $12 a bottle.  </P> <P> With Chardonnay grapes costing in the neighborhood of $1,500 a ton these days,  a bottle of Chardonnay should cost approximately $15, and for Pop-Premium  producers to keep their prices at $5 means they have to use a great number of  tricks.  </P> <P> One is to blend. A lot of wineries making Pop-Premium Chardonnay blend in the  maximum legal limit of 25% other varieties (Riesling is popular because of its  floral nature and its relatively low price). This, of course, makes a  Chardonnay with an aroma not totally typical of Chardonnay, and a lot of  Americans are now becoming convinced that this floral "Riesling-like"  characteristic is what Chardonnay is supposed to taste like.  </P> <P> About two years ago, Fetzer and a number of other wineries went to Washington  for Chardonnay grapes because of a bumper crop and not enough takers. Fetzer  bought Washington State wine in 1987 and released Bel Arbres wine that was from  Washington.  </P> <P> A problem existed, however, with the law. The California Department of Health  and Welfare ruled that the appellation "California and Washington" could not  appear on the label because California's name cannot appear as a designated  region unless every grape in the bottle came from California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Inappropriate Name  </P> <P> And the federal government ruled that "Washington" was inappropriate as an  appellation (even though it would have been entirely truthful) because  Washington doesn't adjoin California. Thus the appellation had to be American.  And with an American appellation came another confusing law: Fetzer was  prohibited from using a vintage date of any sort on the label, even though that  wine came entirely from the 1987 vintage.  </P> <P> Still, the first Bel Arbors American-designated, non-vintage wines were  excellent. Now the first Bel Arbors wines are out, and they are better.  </P> <P> But there is another change. The appellation now says American-Grown, turning  the appellation line on the wine label from a mere geographic designation to a  descriptive phrase -- the first time the federal government has ever permitted  such a term.  </P> <P> The new line is still hamstrung, however. There is no vintage date on three of  the four wines, even though all are from single vintages. The White Zinfandel,  with a California appellation, has the 1988 vintage listed. The two white  wines, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, are from 1988 and the Cabernet is from  1987.  </P> <P> Although the winery is prohibited from telling you the vintage, it is  attempting to work out a sophisticated way to tell consumers which vintage they  are buying, so next year there may be another change in the packaging, however  slight. (It also has hired a person in Washington to assist in getting the law,  which dates to before Prohibition, changed.)  </P> <P> Fetzer wasn't the first winery to investigate the use of grapes from  Washington. Others who did so include Belvedere Winery in Sonoma County, Round  Hill in Napa, and J. Lohr in Monterey.  </P> <P> However, Fetzer remains the only major winery still strongly committed to  Washington, and Dolan notes, "We're interested greatly in the grapes of Oregon  and Washington, the entire Pacific Northwest. They're good grapes and the  prices are fair."  </P> <P> With its new, strong commitment to wine from Washington, Fetzer will use the  new Bel Arbors line to leap into the race with the leaders in the Pop-Premium  segment of the market, a segment now dominated by Sebastiani and Glen Ellen,  both of Sonoma County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Substantial Increase  </P> <P> The Bel Arbors line of wines, which was 270,000 cases in 1988, will be 500,000  cases this year, Dolan said, as the Fetzer family takes full advantage of a  huge, ultra-modern wine making facility just completed at Hopland, south of  where the old winery is located.  </P> <P> That 500,000 case total doesn't put Fetzer into direct competition with the  likes of Sebastiani, Glen Ellen or Gallo, but then look at the other wines  Fetzer made in 1988: Sundial Chardonnay, 340,000 cases; Lake County Cabernet  Sauvignon, 200,000 cases, Gewurztraminer, 150,000 cases, not to mention a large  amount of White Zinfandel.  </P> <P> And the amazing thing is that Fetzer's quality for these wines remains among  the highest in the industry.  </P> <P> Of the four new Bel Arbors wines, I preferred the Cabernet and the Sauvignon  Blanc to the others. The Cabernet has lovely cedar and herbal notes with good  cherry-like fruit and excellent balance. The attractive Sauvignon Blanc offers  typical new mown hay and melon aromas and the wine, though totally dry, is soft  and appealing in the finish.  </P> <P> The Chardonnay, another good one, is peachy and has a creaminess that makes it  intriguing, but I find the Fetzer Sundial wine, for about $2 more, far better  and a better value.  </P> <P> Wine of the Week: 1986 Fenestra Merlot ($11) -- A stunning example of superb  grapes and brilliant wine making. The natural leafy and olivey elements of the  Merlot grapes come through a rich, slightly toasty, almost chocolatey  undertone. The taste, though not lush, is classically rich, but the finish is  tart enough to indicate this wine will age beautifully. This wine was the  sweepstakes winner at the recent Alameda County Fair.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pop-Premium Industry Leaders  </P> <P> Statewide leaders in Pop-Premium Varietal wines, cork-finished wines made to  sell in the $3 to $7 price range. These case figures are estimates from various  wine industry sources.  </P> <P> Sebastiani (Country wines) 3 million cases  </P> <P> Sutter Home 2.8 million  </P> <P> Gallo 2.6 million  </P> <P> Glen Ellen 2.2 million  </P> <P> Robert Mondavi 1.4 million  </P> <P> Fetzer (Sundial, Bel Arbors) 1.3 million  </P> <P> Napa Ridge (Beringer) 600,000  </P> <P> Blossom Hill (Heublein) 400,000  </P> <P> Belvedere (Discovery) 280,000  </P> <P> Domaine St. George 250,000  </P> <P> Delicato 250,000  </P> <P> Round Hill (House line) 225,000  </P></p>

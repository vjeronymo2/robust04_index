			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index braced to challenge its peak - Market Report Britain's first unified Budget was warmly received on the London stock market yesterday. Share prices moved ahead sharply during the speech from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and traders predicted that the FT-SE 100 Index will challenge its all-time peak of 3,199 when trading commences this morning. Lower than anticipated tax increases and a hard line on public spending provided 'the best possible combination for both equities and government bonds', commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. The stock market was particularly pleased that there was no sign of the feared attack on the pension funds, in the shape of changes in advance corporation tax or foreign dividends, and the brewing, publishing and book retailing sectors were jubilant at favourable VAT and excise duty references in the Budget speech. Optimism in the equity market was boosted by a strong rise in government bond prices, which had been fairly quiet until the chancellor began to speak. Among the few less happy areas were airline and overseas tourist stocks, which suffered from the chancellor's tax moves. Share quotations for both British Airways and BAA fell briefly into confusion as the Budget speech appeared on the trading screens. Non-life insurance stocks were restrained by the imposition of 3 per cent duty on general insurance premiums, but analysts were wary of tracking individual companies until the picture becomes more clear. At the official close, the FT-SE Index was 31.1 up at 3,166.9, with Mr Clarke still speaking in the House of Commons. There was no further official trading in equities last night but the December contract on the Footsie reached 3,190, indicating that the FT-SE Index itself would open 15-20 points higher this morning. The stock market was moving ahead from the opening of business yesterday morning and showed a gain of 25.4 on the Footsie at mid-session. Profit-takers then moved in ahead of the Budget speech, trimming the Footsie gain to 11.7 points before Mr Clarke rose to his feet. The recovery came quickly, with the Footsie putting on around ten points in the first ten minutes of the chancellor's speech. At best, the Footsie was up by 32.9 points, with most of the best news coming too late for share trading. Traders expect a strong opening today in brewery shares, with Bass at the head, and in paper and book retailers such as WH Smith. Stores and consumer issues are also likely to open stronger after firmness in sterling following the Budget speech appeared to confirm expectations that base rates can be cut again before Christmas. There were also gains among the stocks of quoted marketmaking firms, which benefit from high levels of interest and turnover in the stock market. Several leading marketmakers were believed to be taking strongly bullish stances last night. Throughout the session, merchant bank issues continued to forge ahead as analysts weighed the implications for sector profitability of the continued strength and activity in financial securities markets. Seaq trading volume, curtailed by the pause ahead of the chancellor's speech, fell to 576.4m shares from the 687.8m of the previous session. Retail or customer business on Monday was worth Pounds 1.53bn, maintaining the prolonged run of highly profitable levels of trading in UK equities.</p>

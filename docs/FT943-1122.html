			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Economics without crystal gazing The most hard-nosed financial commentators should have sat up and taken notice when Prof David Currie, head of the London Business School forecasting unit, recently suggested a policy objective for nominal GDP as an improvement on the present UK policy framework, which supposedly targets inflation and nothing else. Prof Currie has, in the past, been a Labour adviser whose name has been mentioned in relation to top official advisory jobs. Of course he is not the only influence on Labour policy; and the new Labour leader, Tony Blair, is far from a sure shot for the next election. But it is still surely worthwhile to take note of Currie's suggestion, as well as of what the bond market is supposed to 'think'. In fact, the arguments for a nominal GDP framework speak for themselves, irrespective of politics; and the governor of the Banque de France, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently used the concept in discussing economic developments in his own country. Prof Currie argues that a nominal GDP objective would be a good compromise between an output objective and one for inflation alone. There are many other arguments and nuances (some of which were given in my Economic Viewpoint of September 8). The one that is most relevant now is that it makes policy a little less dependent on being able to project the course of the economy for several years ahead than the present Treasury and Bank of England framework does. It will be a sign that nominal GDP is taken seriously when analysts go beyond debating the concept and start looking at the numbers. The Central Statistical Office gives two versions of nominal GDP - at market prices and at factor costs. (The latter excludes indirect taxes and subsidies.) The market price measure shows an increase of 5.8 per cent over a year ago; the factor cost one of 5.7 per cent - identical for practical purposes. The more fundamental factor cost estimate breaks down into a 3.8 per cent real rise in output and a 1.8 per cent increase in prices, as measured by the GDP deflator. Is a 5 1/2 to 6 per cent annual rate of increase of GDP in cash terms too fast or too slow? If the policy were starting with output on its trend line and with minimum inflation, a 5 per cent objective would be appropriate. There would be room for 2 1/2 per cent output growth and 2 1/2 per cent measured inflation. (The latter would reflect hidden quality adjustments as well as acknowledging the difficulty of achieving literally zero inflation at short notice). But when an economy is still emerging from a severe recession an annual nominal growth of up to 6 per cent per annum is surely not too fast. Unfortunately analysis cannot end here. For the growth of GDP - both nominal and real - has been swollen by a bulge in the erratically moving output of the North Sea sector. Indeed, when it suited its book, the Treasury was very keen to emphasise non-oil GDP. We know from the CSO estimates that real GDP, excluding oil, rose in real terms not by 3.8 per cent but by 3.2 per cent in the year to the second quarter of 1994. The CSO does not publish estimates for nominal GDP excluding oil; do-it-yourself arithmetic suggests that it rose by just over 5 per cent  - which surely will be slow enough to satisfy the cautious school. Even now we are not yet in clear water. The true best objective for a nominal policy framework is not nominal GDP itself, but a related measure called domestic expenditure. This is only available at market prices and includes oil. It has risen less than the GDP measure because it excludes net exports (that is exports minus imports) which have been on an improving trend. Indeed, the main reason for focusing on domestic expenditure is that it leaves room for a balance of payments improvement without making that improvement an objective of policy. Thus the more national income figures are examined the more the economy seems to be on a steady-as-she-goes-path. But it would be far too mechanical an application of a way of thinking, intended for broad policy guidelines, to go from here to denounce the recent half per cent rise in base rates. Looking at the whole world economy, including commodity prices and exchange rates, the balance of risks favoured a modest increase. If we look at the CBI monthly trends survey, this shows that, despite the small temporary blip in September, the rise in output is expected to accelerate and that the efforts of firms to increase prices are also slightly stronger. Both forces make a modest acceleration in aggregate spending seem more likely than a deceleration. In addition, future revisions of GDP growth rates are more likely to be upwards than downwards. If the Bank of England wants to avoid excessive reliance on futurology, it will pause before pressing for further base rate increasses. Instead, it might try its hand at producing rough trend lines for nominal GDP and related variables in more timely fashion than the official national income figures.</p>

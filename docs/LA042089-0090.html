			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 22 LOSE JOBS AT PORT AUTO PREP FIRMS  </P> <P> Twenty-two Teamsters Union workers who prepared foreign cars for shipment to  dealerships on the West Coast were laid off this week after the sale of three  Terminal Island auto processing firms where they worked.  </P> <P> The layoffs reduced by 10% the work force at Crown Auto Body, Overseas  Processing Co. and Terminal Island Processing Co., which have been purchased by  T &amp; T Auto Transport Co.  </P> <P> T &amp; T, the American subsidiary of an Australian transportation  conglomerate, completed the purchase of the three firms last Friday and  announced the layoffs Monday, said Steve Sayer, a company vice president.  </P> <P> A representative of the Teamsters Automotive, Industrial and Allied Workers  Local 495 plans to meet this week with T &amp; T officials to discuss the  layoffs.  </P> <P> "There is concern, obviously," said George Park, a business representative for  the local. "We are trying to see now if there is anything we can do to get them  reinstated."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Remove Nicks, Scrapes  </P> <P> The employees were among about 200 at the Terminal Island firms who remove  nicks and scrapes from cars shipped to Los Angeles from overseas. They also  install stereos and other accessories, wash cars and load them onto trucks and  railroad cars for shipment.  </P> <P> Sayer said the workers were laid off because the Terminal Island auto  processors will have 17% fewer cars to work on this year than last. He declined  to give specific numbers but said the loss of business was caused by three  luxury car makers moving to other ports.  </P> <P> In the last two years, BMW and Jaguar stopped importing through Crown Auto Body  at the Port of Los Angeles. Both companies now send their cars through Port  Hueneme in Ventura County, where they have built their own car processing  plants. In addition, Saab this year terminated its contract with Crown Auto  Body and began shipping its cars through the Port of Long Beach.  </P> <P> The Port of Los Angeles estimated that 480,000 imported cars passed over its  docks in the 1985-86 fiscal year, and port officials said they eventually hoped  to handle 600,000 cars a year.  </P> <P> But the move of some car makers to other ports, as well as a general slump in  imports because of the weakness of the U.S. dollar, has reduced shipments  through Los Angeles. The port took in 447,000 cars in the 1987-88 fiscal year,  the most recent figures available, said Jeff Leong, a spokesman for the port.  </P> <P> T &amp; T hopes to prevent further slippage by improving the quality of its  operation, Sayer said. "That's a concern we have," he said. "We are going to  watch it closely."  </P> <P> Workers at Crown Auto Body, Overseas Processing Co. and Terminal Island  Processing Co. met with T &amp; T management last Friday and learned about the  possible layoffs. The company interviewed all non-management employees over the  weekend and announced the layoffs Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson's hard choices The issue of Dollars 1.25bn-worth of medium-term debt in the US domestic market clearly shows that Hanson is still keen to borrow from a wide variety of sources. It also helps cement into the company's balance sheet a long-term structure with substantial dollar borrowings and even larger sterling deposits. Running the company this way offers Hanson a number of advantages. With US interest rates below those in the UK, sterling income far outweighs the dollar debt costs. Holding sterling deposits outside the UK also helps defer tax liabilities. But there are also risks, not least that with the US arm more heavily borrowed than the UK, Hanson's overall gearing will rise as the dollar appreciates against sterling. Yet the reasons for the financial structure may go beyond short-term financial gains. One way of looking at Hanson is to view the US business as a group of highly-geared companies which is sweated hard to service debt. Indeed, interest payments eat up about 30 per cent of US profits. By contrast, the sterling cash pile comes in large part from the disposal of assets and is available to finance acquisitions. Keeping the money on deposit may have made sense through the recession, but as short-term interest rates fall and recovery nears, real assets may offer better returns. Hefty write-offs in the past, however, may have left the company with something of a problem. A cash acquisition accompanied by provisions or a goodwill write-off would raise gearing sharply. So Hanson must either avoid paying over book, or find more targets such as Beazer, Cavenham and Peabody whose balance sheets are too modest about their assets.</p>

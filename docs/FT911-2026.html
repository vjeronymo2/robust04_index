			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: MFI reschedules Pounds 15m of its debt repayment MFI, the furniture manufacturer and retailer, is delaying the repayment of Pounds 15m of its debt for a year because of the continuing difficult trading conditions on the high street. The company, which staged a Pounds 718m leveraged buy-out in 1987, agreed with its bankers that it would be more appropriate to preserve funds within the business in view of the economic climate. MFI has also extended its working capital facilities of Pounds 30m by a year to November 1993 but will continue to pay in full all the interest costs on its bank loans. Mr John Randall, finance director, said yesterday: 'We could afford to make the payment out of cash flow but we and our bankers did not think the climate was right. It is not prudent to do so until we know that trading has turned.' The decision nevertheless raised some eyebrows in the City since the company had stated that it had no need of additional funds when it announced its interim results in February. Mr Paul Smiddy, retailing analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'We were not expecting MFI to do a rescheduling so it is a slight surprise but we do not have any worries about the durability of the company.' In total, MFI still has Pounds 475m in debts still outstanding. The company is now due to repay Pounds 15m of debt in April 1992, a further Pounds 25m in October of that year, and Pounds 30m in April 1993. The vast bulk of the debt will not be paid off until the company is refloated on the stock market, a prospect that recedes further into the distance as long as the difficult trading conditions persist. Mr Randall said he thought any flotation would be at least three years away. MFI said that results for the year to April 27 would show a substantial operating profit, although they would be below last year's Pounds 55m. Trading conditions in the second half of the year had been poor, but the company said it still faced the new financial year confidently. The rescheduling of the debt will lead to a slight increase in the company's financing charges.</p>

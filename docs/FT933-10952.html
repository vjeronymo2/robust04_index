			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax is more than income ABOUT FIVE years ago, my mother-in-law sold her house and moved into a residential home. She was advised to invest the proceeds from the sale in a National Savings income bond. The interest from this is paid monthly without deduction of income tax and is her main source of income. In assessing her liability, the Inland Revenue has advised that untaxed interest is assessed on a current year basis for the first and second year of the income received. The third year can be taxed either on a current year basis or a previous year, whichever is beneficial to my mother-in-law. After that, the interest is taxed on a previous year basis until the penultimate year. Then, it is taxed on the current year basis or the previous year basis ,whichever is more favourable to the Revenue. In the final year, it is assessed on a current year basis. If my mother-in-law was to sell her income bond this year, the amount assessable for tax would be significantly greater than the income actually received. Has the Revenue interpreted the tax legislation correctly? If so, what should my mother-in-law do to minimise her liability? Yes, what the tax office told your mother-in-law is an accurate paraphrase of the relevant parts of sections 64, 66 and 67 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Although we have mentioned these capricious rules in our columns from time to time over the years (because the 1988 Act merely re-enacted long-standing legislation on this point), they do still unfortunately come as a shock to some of our readers. As you say that your mother-in-law 'was advised' to buy a National Savings income bond, perhaps she has grounds for a formal complaint against her adviser for not warning her that she would be taxed on more interest than she would actually get if interest rates fell over the life of the bond. If she read the National Savings Department's advertisements and/or descriptive leaflet before deciding to act on the adviser's recommendation, she might wish to submit a formal complaint to the department or to the Advertising Standards Authority if she considers that the potential tax charge on non-existent interest was not made sufficiently clear by the department's literature. She might also wish to complain to the Board of Inland Revenue about its decision not to produce an explanatory leaflet on the odd rules for the taxation of untaxed interest. Finally, she might wish to send copies of her letters of complaint to her MP although, unfortunately, the House will shortly be rising for its exceedingly long recess. The address of the Board of Inland Revenue is Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R 1LB. The House of Commons' post code is SW1A 0AA. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

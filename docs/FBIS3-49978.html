Stanojevic: "In Favor of Full Equality"] </F>   [Excerpts] Vranje -- For those who are not so familiar with  events in the extreme south of Serbia, the success of the  coalition of two predominantly Albanian parties could be a  surprise. The Party for Democratic Activity (PDD), and the  Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), both based in Presevo,  certainly made a wise move during the pre-election period by  forming a coalition. In this way they prevented a further  fragmentation of the Albanian electorate in the southern Serbian  communes of Presevo, Bujanovac, and Medvedja, where these two  parties are active.    Having won almost 30,000 votes, this coalition has secured  two seats in the future Serbian parliament. The candidates were  Beljulj Jusufi and Tahir Dalipi.    Who in fact are these two parties?    The Party for Democratic Activity is headed by Riza Halimi,  president of the Presevo commune. He was born in 1947 and  graduated at the Scientific Mathematical Faculty. During the  ideological and political purge of 1989 he was suspended from  education. He later worked in the Dzevdet Doda Grammar School  in Pristina. He had been a leading member of the party before  he was elected president.    The head of the Democratic Party of Albanians is Zecir  Fazliu, biology teacher in the 15 May Grammar School in Presevo.  He was born in the village of Zujnice in the Presevo commune in  1940. He left the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1969.  He had been the director of the school in which he is now  working, but was replaced before the end of his term of office.    According to Halimi, the Party for Democratic Activity  strives for a multi-party democratic system in which all  citizens, as legal and political subjects, should be equal  regardless of their nationality and confession, and in which the  freedom and rights of people would be guaranteed by the  Constitution and laws. [passage omitted]    The program of the Democratic Party of Albanians promotes  the  full, true, and actual equality of Albanians in spheres of life  where they live and work. At the same time, the party will work  for the emancipation of women, the equality of man and women,  the freedom of religion and worshiping, the promotion of one's  own culture, national history, literature, folklore, and  historical traditions.

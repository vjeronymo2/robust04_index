In this document the candidates  reaffirm their condemnation of the use of violence as a  political weapon and urge their followers to behave peacefully.    Signing the declaration were Armando Calderon Sol of Arena  [Nationalist Republican Alliance], Rhina Escalante de Rey  Prendes of MAC [Authentic Christian Movement], Edgardo Rodriguez  of Solidarity, Roberto Marchesini on behalf of Roberto Escobar  Garcia of the PCN [National Conciliation Party], Jorge Martinez  of the Unity Movement, Fidel Chavez Mena of the Christian  Democratic Party, and Ruben Zamora of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front].    The "Presidential Candidates Declaration," reads:    1. "We reiterate our firm condemnation of the use of  violence, chiefly as a political weapon, and urge our supporters  to behave peacefully and calmly during the few days remaining in  the campaign.    2. "We reiterate our faith in democracy and, therefore,  respect the sovereign decision of citizens freely expressed at  the polls.    3. "We pledge to respect and enforce all the Peace  Agreements, since they constitute a solid base for the future  progress of our nation.    4. "We urge all Salvadoran citizens to participate in the  20 March elections by going to the polls and casting their  ballots freely for the candidates of their choice.    5. "We ask for strict compliance with the commitments  signed in El Salvador's 14 departments among the political  parties' representatives to conduct a lofty and respectful  campaign. We reaffirm our joint declaration of 5 November 1993.    Afterward, Onusal chief Augusto Ramirez Ocampo said the  latest incidents in the electoral campaign "are a normal thing  as the electoral temperature rises." He urged the supporters of  the different parties to remain calm.    Arena candidate Calderon Sol hoped all the candidates who  signed the pact would abide by it out of respect for the  Salvadoran people. He indicated his party has kept all the other  agreements they signed, although others have not respected them.  "I commend Mr. Ramirez Ocampo's initiative, and we are prepared  to abide by them, although it is unfortunate that the  traditional parties do not abide by what they signed," Rodriguez  indicated.    Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora of the leftist coalition said he  supported the pact. He also noted the campaign has been handled  rather well, although he criticized some parties for conducting  "a two-faced ad campaign, saying things they should not."</p>

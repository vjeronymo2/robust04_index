			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COPTERS DOUSE 15-ACRE FIRE ABOVE CHATSWORTH  </P> <P> About 15 acres of grass and brush were burned Sunday in a fire above Chatsworth  that was quickly doused by helicopters dropping water, the Los Angeles Fire  Department reported.  </P> <P> The fire apparently broke out in the ruins of an abandoned house about half a  mile north of Topanga Canyon Boulevard and the Simi Valley Freeway, Battalion  Chief Melvin Lydecker said.  </P> <P> Investigators had not determined the cause. No other structures were  threatened, he said, and there were no injuries.  </P> <P> The fire was reported about 9:40 a.m. and was contained in 30 minutes, Lydecker  said. Four helicopters were used because the steep terrain is inaccessible to  fire engines, Lydecker said. More than 100 firefighters from the Los Angeles  city and county fire departments assisted, he said.  </P></p>

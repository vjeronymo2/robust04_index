			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa received Amadou  Toure, International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium  [INTELSAT] regional director for Africa, in his office today.  Their discussions centered on the payment of Zaire's arrears to  the organization. Muako Alibaba has the details:    [Alibaba] INTELSAT might cut its telephone and television  services to Zaire at the national and international levels, for  failure to honor its financial obligations. This situation was  at the center of the discussions that the prime minister held  with Mr. Toure at his office today in the presence of (Philippe  Gelezi Tutua Kabanzili), minister of posts, telephones, and  telecommunications. After the discussions, the INTELSAT regional  director for Africa had this to say:    [Begin recording] [Toure] In my capacity as INTELSAT  regional  director for Africa, I paid a courtesy call on the prime  minister who agreed to receive me. In general, we discussed  African issues such as the important project known as the  regional African satellite system and other problems concerning  Zaire in particular. Among these problems are the present  delayed payment of Zaire's contributions, and in view of the  recent decisions made by INTELSAT board of governors, Zaire's  national and international telephone and television traffic  might be cut. This is why I deemed it advisable to come here to  discuss the situation with the authorities to avoid such a cut,  as it would adversely affect the African group within the board  of governors.    I first discussed the problem with the minister of  telecommunications and with the National Telecommunications  Corporation. We succeeded in drawing up a number of measures  which I believe, once implemented, could help solve the problem  soon. We also discussed other problems that may crop up in  future and ways of preventing Zaire from facing a similar  situation. We hope that our cooperation will be fruitful.    [Unidentified correspondent] What was the prime minister's  reaction in the face of all these problems?    [Toure] First, I was very satisfied with the reactions of  the  minister of telecommunications and the prime minister who  received me immediately after my arrival in view of the urgent  situation. I was very satisfied with the measures taken before  my arrival, because this problem is a longstanding one. The  Ministry of Telecommunications has already started taking a  number of steps, and I was very satisfied to note them here  myself. We received some promises and support from the prime  minister to help solve the problem. We believe that before the  deadline -- we only have one month left, that is 27 February --  the problem will be solved, taking into account the prime  minister's reactions.    [Correspondent] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

About two pounds of the drug were found in his  girlfriend's purse on May 13.  </P> <P> Sentencing for the girlfriend, Kathleen Pirelli, 21, also of Lakeside, was  delayed until Thursday. She pleaded guilty to using a phone during a drug  transaction. Her attorney said he would call Castiglione as a witness at her  sentencing.  </P> <P> Before imposing the sentence, U.S. District Judge John Rhoades said to  Castiglione, "What do you have to say about mending your ways? You have a  terrible record."  </P> <P> "I don't have anything to say," Castiglione replied.  </P> <P> Castiglione was convicted of racketeering in connection with the 1977 shooting  deaths of three members of the rival Mongols motorcycle gang. He also has a  previous drug conviction.  </P></p>

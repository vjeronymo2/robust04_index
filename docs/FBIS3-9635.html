The agreement, which on the U.S. part was signed  by Defense Secretary William Perry, provides for regular  meetings at the level of chiefs of staff and of military  delegations, the possibility of the Polish military  participating in U.S. training sessions, and U.S. support for  modernization of the Polish Armed Forces. The agreement also  provides for assistance to Poland in preparing our Army for  cooperation with the Armed Forces of the NATO countries.    After signing the declaration on cooperation, Minister  Kolodziejczyk stated that the declaration expresses a full  openness to cooperation and a new approach to Poland's role and  place. From among the visit's specific results, Piotr  Kolodziejczyk mentioned the establishment of a Polish-U.S.  technical commission, whose goal is to assist with the Polish  Army's modernization and also with restructuring the Polish  defense industry. Defense Secretary William Perry accepted an  invitation to pay a visit to Poland. No specific date for joint  Polish-U.S. military exercises has been set, but General John  Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with whom  Kolodziejczyk had a meeting at the end of his U.S. visit, agreed  to the minister's suggestion that they take place before the end  of the year and that some U.S. troops participate in the Polish  Army's maneuvers that had been planned earlier.    Minister Kolodziejczyk's talks on Capitol Hill have already  resulted in first reactions. During a Senate debate, Senator  Mitch McConnell spoke in favor of making more specific the  criteria for participation by countries of the East in the  "Partnership for Peace" program. McConnell also submitted a  proposal for an amendment to a draft of a Senate bill concerning  the appropriation of resources for military goals. The  amendment contains the following passage: "The Unites States  shall oppose, by applying the appropriate means, any attempts by  the Russian Federation aimed at intimidation, using military  force or economic blackmail, with the goal of restitution of  spheres of influence on the territory of the former Soviet  Republics, in the Baltic states, and in Central and East Europe."    When asked about his Washington meetings, Minister  Kolodziejczyk replied that he is so optimistic that he is  "afraid to push my luck." Concerning the sale of Polish  helicopters to Burma, which was reported by news agencies in the  morning, he said only that the matter has been cleared up.  Poland was reported to have sold helicopters to Burma, where  human rights are violated.    --Of the 13 countries that signed the so-called framework  agreement with NATO concerning "Partnership for Peace," Poland  was the first to initiate consultations with NATO regarding the  program's specific contents. There are predictions that  consultations concerning the so-called document of presentation  will last several weeks.</p>

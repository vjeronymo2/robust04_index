Rodriguez gave a special address  to a packed room at the Convention Center where the Computing-94  International Fair and Conference were inaugurated. This event  is of great interest to a large number of specialists.    Rodriguez said that 1994 should not experience further drops  in production and that the national economy will perform better,  even if it is not marked by recovery. Following the hour-long  address, Rodriguez answered participants' questions. He added  that every adjustment process is painful but that Cuba is trying  to make things as fair as possible and is particularly ensuring  that it has as much support as possible. Rodriguez added that  this explains the workers assemblies being conducted by the  Cuban Workers Federation and its unions.    Rodriguez reported that as of 1993, there were 112 foreign  investment agreements, one-fifth of which are joint enterprises,  particularly in tourism and basic industry.</p>

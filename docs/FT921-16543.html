			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / International Company News in Brief: Bond fails to win stay of order MR Alan Bond, the former Australian tycoon fighting to avoid bankruptcy, has failed to obtain the stay of an order that he pay Dollars 194m to banks, Reuter reports from Sydney. The New South Wales Court of Appeal rejected his attempt to stay the order that he honour a personal guarantee to the banks. Justice Michael Kirby said the consequences of the ruling were potentially serious for Mr Bond. On Monday Mr Bond was served with a notice requiring him to pay the money within 28 days. The judge said Mr Bond could now request a stay from the High Court, Australia's top court, or seek an extension of the payment order in Federal Court. ***** Playmates International Holdings, the Hong Kong maker of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle toys, is to sell its traditional dolls and pre-school toys business to Unimax Toys, another toy company based in the colony, for a 49 per cent stake in Unimax, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. The value of the transaction was not disclosed. Mr Thomas Chan, Playmates managing director, said the partnership with Unimax would allow his company to focus its resources and effort on promotional toys  - toys linked to other media such as films, music and television programmes and which are generating increasing revenues for the group. ***** The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is to introduce consecutive monthly expirations for its Eurodollar futures-options starting January 13 1992, Reuter reports from Chicago.

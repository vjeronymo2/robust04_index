			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (4): Cinderella is off to the ball - Mobile radio MOBILE RADIO seems to some to be the Cinderella of mobile communications. Where cellular enjoyed a ball in the boom years of the mid-1980s, mobile radio sat quietly at home. The conventional Private Mobile Radio (PMR) market showed steady, but not spectacular, growth. However, developments were in the offing. 1988 saw the launch in the UK of a new kind of mobile radio service called Public Access Mobile Radio. PAMR has since spread into Europe and mobile radio is set to benefit like other mobile communications technologies from digitalisation. The idea of PAMR is to save users money. Whereas users of private mobile radio systems have to buy and maintain their own radio transmitters as well as base-stations, users of PAMR can use radio transmitters maintained by a network operator. They have only to buy or lease their handsets and pay a subscription charge. Since 1988, when PAMR was launched in the UK, it has been introduced on the same standard (MPT 1327/43) in France, Germany, Holland and Switzerland. Spanish operator Telefonica has been running networks for the Olympic Games in Barcelona and for the Universal Exhibition in Seville. Italy is interested. Belgium is believed to be considering launching too. Performance in the UK has not been so good, says Ms Juliet Hale of market research company Systems Dynamics. The merger in April this year of national PAMR operators GEC National One and Band Three Radio could appear to prove her right. But Mr Richard Sellers, chairman of the UK's Regional Band III (PAMR band) Operators Committee, disagrees. He says difficulties with MPT 1327/43 and disputes over the intellectual property rights involved meant original licensees were late to market, by which time the UK was dipping into recession. There was a shortage of PAMR handsets for users and the UK was already a very mature mobile radio market. This meant cellular took away from PAMR before it could get onto the starting blocks. When cellular started in 1985, it was the only wide area scheme available at the time, say some industry sources, and it attacked a market niche that trunked mobile radio would have addressed. That could be about to be put right. Large customers such as county councils and utilities which may have bought cellular in 1985 are now finding their systems coming up for replacement. With public mobile radio operators not charging for airtime and charging monthly subscriptions of between Pounds 10 and Pounds 50 - comparable at the low end with cellular - many are reported to be choosing mobile radio which Mr Sellers claims can be '10-20 times more cost-effective than cellular telephony'. Added to which, he says, 'the cost of terminals has come down and the number of features has gone up. The appeal of PAMR across the board has become much greater.' In fact, the MPT 1327/43 standard has provision for a large number of features which are only now coming on stream, such as call diversion and data facilities. Mr Sellers puts the total UK mobile radio market at between 550,000 and 600,000 terminals in service. He estimates that there are 29,000 National Band Three customers and at least 11,000 users of regional PAMR networks. Between 35,000 and 40,000 customers use public access systems with more localised customers. His total market figure excludes terminals in use by emergency services, taxi companies and government departments. Those user numbers could be boosted if, as some predict, mobile data customers choose mobile radio operators instead of dedicated mobile data network operators for service. The mobile data market has had a shock recently with the demise of one UK operator, Dowty-backed Cognito. Although not a direct comment on the viability of mobile data networks as such - Dowty's buyer, TI, never intended to keep it - mobile radio operators are quick to point out that here is a market opportunity for them. 'There is a lot of hype on with the mobile data networks,' says Mr Andrew Barrett, technical director of Key Radio Systems, a maker and distributor of two-way radio systems based in Aldermaston, Berkshire. 'But my impression is that the market does not just want data. It wants speech and data.' This, he says, is something mobile radio can very well offer. 'There has always been a data facility on band three (the PAMR band). It is hardly ever used. People are starting to ask for that more and more.' Lower costs could underline the case for sending data over mobile radio and not over mobile data networks, Mr Barrett says. He notes that some mobile radio networks offer lower tariffs for users wanting to transmit data. They use the network for less time. And mobile radio networks can handle messages of between 100 and 200 characters. In this war on cellular and mobile data, the arrival of digital mobile radio systems can only help the mobile radio cause. 'Digital offers certain benefits in itself,' says Mr John McKendry, manager, regulatory affairs of Cambridge-based Philips Telecom Private Mobile Radio, the UK equipment maker. 'Quality is better than analogue and you can mix voice and data together in one bit stream. Digital streams are easy to encrypt and can be interfaced with the public switched telephone network.' But it also offers other possibilities for mobile radio, as Mr Andrew Dean, marketing manager, private mobile radio for Motorola in the UK, explains. In a recent presentation to the UK's Communications in Public Safety Conference, Mr Dean said digital mobile radio systems could offer vehicle location, facsimile, still picture and slow video transmission. Three manufacturers, Sweden's Ericsson, Chicago-based Motorola and France's Matra have their own digital systems. Meanwhile, ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) is developing a standard digital mobile radio system called Tetra (Trans European Trunked Radio). However, not all commentators are optimistic about the chances for digital mobile radio. According to some, Tetra could experience problems. Systems Dynamics' Ms Hale thinks it could be difficult to sell Tetra systems when they start appearing - it is hoped from the middle of the decade - because of the presence of Motorola's, Ericsson's and Matra's home-grown systems. Overall, she says, demand for digital systems will not start to take off until 1995 and then only in the trunked (shared channel) and PAMR sector. About 10 per cent of European users will want digital systems then, she says, with the number rising to 98 per cent by the year 2000. In the conventional single channel PMR sector, only 25 per cent of European users will want digital systems by the turn of the century. While they wait for digital systems to come on stream, UK operators and manufacturers have steady growth to look forward to, says Mr Sellers. Regional PAMR systems are showing steady net growth in spite of the recession. And there is going to be a lot of replacement business for older conventional systems. Motorola's Mr Dean takes an equally optimistic view. The UK installed base of terminals is growing at about 5 per cent a year, he says. Other industry sources say the number of licences issued a year in the UK is growing by 13 to 15 per cent. Their feeling is that growth in the number of mobiles taking up those licences is similar. As if to underline the sector's cautious optimism, the UK's Department of Trade and Industry only last month decided to allow 13 regional PAMR operators to provide their own fixed links in their networks and service to fixed terminals. Mr Sellers hails this as a great move forward. Operators should now be able to offer speech and data communications between two fixed points and not just links between a base and a mobile. And being allowed to provide their own fixed links will save mobile radio operators from having to lease them from Mercury Communications and British Telecom. Another way of saving money; another weapon in the war on cellular.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pentium sales help push Intel to third-term record Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, reported record sales and earnings for the third quarter, with revenues up sharply as sales of its high-performance Pentium microprocessors, used in the latest personal computers, doubled. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.86bn, up from Dollars 2.24bn a year ago. Net income rose 14 per cent to Dollars 659m, or Dollars 1.52 a share, against Dollars 584m, or Dollars 1.33, for the same quarter last year. The PC industry is rapidly moving to a new performance standard, based on Pentium microprocessors, said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive. 'The PC industry is moulting, shedding its past in a way that hasn't happened for a decade. Just one year ago, the standard was a PC featuring an Intel 486 microprocessor. Today, a PC at the same price point has a Pentium processor. 'This is the fastest and smoothest processor generation changeover we have ever experienced,' said Mr Grove. Intel said it expected to meet its goal of increasing Pentium sales to 25 per cent of its fourth-quarter microprocessor unit sales. A second goal was to ship 6m-7m Pentium chips this year. The company said it expected to be within a few weeks of meeting this goal by the end of the year. Intel recently began an unprecedented Dollars 80m advertising campaign, to last through the end of the year, for Pentium PCs. The company is pushing Pentium sales in a bid to beat competitors. Although Intel dominates the market for microprocessors used in PCs, with about 90 per cent of the world market, several competitors are nipping at its heels. Advanced Micro Devices is expected this week to announce a new chip called the 'K86', which it says will be compatible with Intel's Pentium, but faster. IBM, Nexgen and Cyrix are also offering their own versions of Intel-compatible microprocessors. For the nine-month period, Intel revenues were Dollars 8.29bn, up 30 per cent from Dollars 6.39bn in the same period last year. Net income of Dollars 1.92bn represents a 13 per cent increase from Dollars 1.7bn for the first three quarters of 1993. Earnings per share grew to Dollars 4.37 from Dollars 3.86 for the same period last year.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Commercial realities nibble into UB's global ambitions TWO-and-a-half years after a cadre of youthful managers took command at United Biscuits with bold plans to build an international biscuits and snacks empire, harsh commercial realities are starting to define the limits of their global ambitions. Since 1990 a string of acquisitions in continental Europe and Australasia have substantially widened the geographic spread of the previously UK-centred group and lifted overseas sales to more than half its total turnover. However, while these additions have so far performed well, contributing more than a third of first-half group operating profit, UB faces an even tougher struggle than it bargained for in solving the problems at Keebler, its troubled US subsidiary. Indeed, Keebler's stuttering recovery from the ravages of last year's 'cookie wars' - despite much top management attention - appears to be trying UB's patience and raising questions about the strength of its long-term commitment to the US market, which provides a third of group sales. At the same time, the position of the group's British biscuits and snacks businesses - on which it has relied to fund much of its foreign expansion - is starting to look less impregnable. Squeezed by keen price competition and a sharp rise in raw material costs, McVitie's UK operating profits fell nine per cent in the first half, while the KP snacks division achieved only a two per cent increase. While some of the pain reflects the short-term impact of recession and sterling's devaluation, UB is reconciled to a possibly permanent reduction in its historically high UK margins in order to maintain its dominant market share. Across the Atlantic, UB is pursuing the reverse strategy. After insisting a year ago that Keebler's immediate priority was to re-build its battered market share, the group now says it aims to slim the US company's business back to a profitable base.</p>

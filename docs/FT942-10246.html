			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Top securities man quits Republic post Mr Peter Cohen, the former Shearson Lehman chairman who joined Republic New York 18 months ago to run its new securities brokerage business, is resigning from the banking group to set up his own investment management and securities firm. Mr Cohen's resignation comes two weeks after Republic decided its securities operation should concentrate on servicing the bank's client base of institutions and wealthy individuals, and not on developing a market-making and underwriting franchise to compete with big Wall Street securities houses. Mr Cohen said yesterday he was leaving to pursue businesses, particularly specialised securities financing and investment management. These would be better developed by a firm that was independent of Republic, he said. His new firm will include the operations of the Palladin Group, an investment management company with Dollars 200m of clients' assets specialising in non-merger arbitrage in domestic and foreign securities. Mr Cohen is not completely severing his ties with Republic, which is 30 per cent-owned by the Geneva-based financier Mr Edmond Safra. He will continue to work as a consultant to the bank, which will become a minority investor in Mr Cohen's new firm. Mr Cohen joined Republic in November 1992, almost three years after he was ousted as chairman of Shearson Lehman.</p>

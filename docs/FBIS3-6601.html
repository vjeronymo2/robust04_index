The freighter Yanlong No. 4 departed from Pusan carrying 30  containers on March 14 and arrived in Chongjin, a northeastern  port in North Korea, on March 16. The containers were unloaded  there and then transported to Yanbian, in the northeast of  China, by North Korean railroad.    The Yanlong No. 4 belongs to Yanbian Shipping Co., Ltd.    Rice was transported from Pusan to Nampo, North Korea, in  1990, marking the first time that a ship had sailed directly  from South to North Korea without making a detour. The Yanlong  No. 4 was thus the second vessel to sail directly from South  Korea to the North.    Moreover, this was the first time that containers have been  transported from South Korea to China via North Korean railroad.    "It is unusual that North Korea allowed the containers to  move from South Korea to China on its soil, which Pyongyong had  previously rejected. I think it does not mean that Pyongyang  has changed its policy, but rather it is an exceptional measure  considering the strong ties between North Korea and China," a  MAPA official said.    On March 25, Yanbian Shipping Company plans to transport  products from Yanbian to Pusan that were manufactured by South  Korean businesses' locally incorporated companies there, and it  also intends to operate a ship between Pusan and Chongjin once a  week in June.    The MAPA will consult with the National Unification Board  this week to discuss opening a sea route between South and North  Korea.</p>

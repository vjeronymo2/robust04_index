			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Europol treaty delayed The treaty granting legal recognition to Europol, the embryonic European police force, has been delayed by disagreement among European Union members, Netherlands' justice minister Winnie Sorgdrager told the Dutch parliament yesterday. Europol was set up in February to share information between EU police forces in their fight against drug trafficking and organised crime. It went into action without a formal legal basis, and the treaty supporting it was scheduled for signing next week. But questions over the treaty's compatibility with laws in member states have put this target beyond reach, the minister said.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 3-A;  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR TAKES IT TO THE BANK WITH FREE THROWS  </P> <P> There's nothing like banking a free throw to take some of the pressure off when  you're trying to win a game in the final seconds of overtime.  </P> <P> Weston Johnson, Corona del Mar High School reserve guard, provided the light  moment with 22 seconds remaining and then got serious a few seconds later by  making another free throw that gave Corona del Mar a 57-56 victory over  Morningside in the Southern Section 3-A division boys' basketball semifinals  Friday night in Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> "I was having a nervous breakdown, but even if you win by banking a shot, it's  OK," Johnson said. "Their crowd was yelling stuff at me, but when I banked in  the free throw, it sort of relaxed me. I knew I was OK after that."  </P> <P> Johnson's aim certainaly improved. He swished a free throw with 3 seconds  remaining in the extra 3-minute period to move unseeded and unranked Corona del  Mar (19-9) into the championship game, where the Sea Kings will meet Trabuco  Hills.  </P> <P> Johnson figured he had attempted all of five free throws all season, but he  made three of four attempts in overtime as Corona del Mar scored yet another  playoff upset. Corona del Mar, which finished third in the Sea View League, has  surprised El Dorado, Rolling Hills and now Morningside to reach the finals.  </P> <P> It appeared that mediocre free-throw shooting was going to be Corona del Mar's  downfall. The Sea Kings had struggled to make 26 of 40 attempts going into  overtime, but they found the mark and made five of six attempts down the  stretch.  </P> <P> Of course, Morningside (23-5) played a big part in the unlikely victory. The  Monarchs committed 30 fouls and had three players foul out. The biggest blunder  of the game came with 3 seconds remaining in overtime, when Morningside's Ken  Jones was caught reaching in on Johnson in the Sea Kings' backcourt with the  score tied, 56-56.  </P> <P> "Our scouting report and the comments I got from everyone I talked to said that  you're never out of the game . . . they'll help you all they can in a  ballgame," said Paul Orris, Corona del Mar coach.  </P> <P> Morningside, seeded fourth, was more than helpful twice during the game. The  Monarchs went 4 minutes without scoring in the third quarter and saw a 36-26  lead disappear. Corona del Mar center Brian Spratt scored eight of his  game-high 21 points in the quarter as the Sea Kings opened a 38-36 lead.  </P> <P> Morningside still looked like a winner with less than 2 minutes remaining and  holding a 49-45 lead. But Corona del Mar's Jeff Jackson made a free throw and  then teammate Matt Cwiertnia stole a pass, scored, was fouled and added a free  throw to tie the score, 49-49.  </P> <P> Johnson's twin brother, Warren, had an opportunity to win the game with 9  seconds remaining in regulation play. Warren went to the foul line with his  team trailing, 50-49, but made only one free throw, leaving the heroics to  brother Weston.  </P> <P> Afterward, Orris reflected upon his team's remarkable run through the playoffs  to next week's championship game.  </P> <P> "I still don't think this team is anywhere near the most talented team we've  had at Corona del Mar," Orris said. "But they play together well, and they  never give up. We got a little more confidence as we went along tonight and  finally made some free throws when it counted most."  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A life of champagne or Valium - The thrills and dangers of large share deals Share traders say the most nerve-wracking moment of a 'bought deal' is the five minutes before the first bite from buyers. After weeks of research and negotiations, the brokerage house has bought a multi-million pound block of a company's shares from one investor and then has to find other investors to take them off its books. For the short time between making offers to institutions and the buy orders flooding in, dealers cannot be sure whether they will be cracking open champagne or Valium. Bought deals are one of the bigger adrenalin rushes of the stock market. They place reputations of senior salesmen and heads of marketmaking under intense pressure as they put the capital of their companies at risk. Last week, Smith New Court, the securities house with one of the most aggressive trading reputations in the UK, paid Pounds 162m for 46m shares in Prudential, the UK's biggest insurance company. It is the second time in two weeks that the securities house has taken on risky share sales. Three weeks earlier it traded 13m shares in Great Universal Stores. If the market had fallen heavily between the time Smith agreed the Prudential deal and the time it started to offer shares for sale there would have been ways of protecting against huge losses. The broker could have hedged against any falls using the derivatives market, for example by buying call options which give the right to sell stock at a pre-set price and time. However, once word leaked into the market that Smith had a large amount of stock for sale the result depended purely on the appetite of the stock market and the broker's ability to place the shares quickly. Smith has analysts dedicated to identifying potential clients interested in buying or selling large stakes. The Prudential deal began weeks ago when Smith approached an investment fund, believed to be Baring Securities, which appeared willing to sell its Pru stake. Mr Michael Marks, Smith's chief executive, and Mr David Marks (no relation), head of its UK marketmaking, discussed the deal with half a dozen senior colleagues. They met in the 'goldfish bowl', the glass office above the trading room where significant decisions are made, and agreed they would be interested in taking on the stake, representing almost 2.5 per cent of Prudential's equity. Subsequently, senior sales traders from the securities house rang financial institutions to gauge what level of discount they would need to persuade them to buy large blocks of shares. Early last week, the stock market was hitting new highs and Prudential shares were available at about 370p. Smith found that fund managers were prepared to pay 354p and decided they could pick up the stake at 350p. With that 'turn' Smith stood to make a profit of Pounds 1.8m. However, it is more likely that the broker would have reckoned on about half the shares being sold at that price and the rest being offloaded on a sliding scale. That would probably still leave Smith Pounds 1m to the good, according to rival analysts' estimates. The traders had 'pre-placed' many of the shares by getting orders from their best clients. Smith did not buy the shares until shortly before the sales desk had to face the test of the market last Thursday afternoon. If the discount was not sufficiently generous rival marketmakers would have cut the price at which they were offering Prudential shares forcing Smith to slash its potential profits in order to get the shares away.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government  expressed regret Tuesday at Washington's placing of Seoul on the  priority watch list for intellectual property protection  violations.    "We regret that the United States one-sidedly evaluated the  intellectual property protection situation of its trade partner  according to its domestic laws, despite international efforts to  resolve all disputes at the multilateral level before the  launching of the World Trade Organization (WTO)," Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement.    The U.S. Trade Representative placed South Korea on the  priority watch list on Monday, claiming that Seoul had failed to  improve its laws on protection of intellectual property rights  [IPR].    "We want to clarify our government position that we will  continue to implement the agreements, both bilateral and  multilateral, on IPR protection," the statement said.</p>

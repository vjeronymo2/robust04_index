			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/6/1994 -- Romania's Foreign  Affairs Ministry issued a memorandum providing its viewpoint  with regard to the memorandum submitted to the Council of Europe  [CE] by rapporteurs Gunnar Jansson and Friedrich Koenig on the  honoring of the commitments entered into by Romania on its  accession to the Council of Europe.    The Romanian Foreign Ministry said it had taken notice of  the  conclusion in Paragraph 35 of the rapporteurs' memorandum  reading as follows: "The discussions with the representatives  of the political parties and of the press showed us that Romania  is a pluralistic democracy and that the basis for development in  many respects is present."    According to the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the  Jansson-Koenig memorandum "contains a number of information  already obsolete due to the recent developments in the Romanian  society, as well as some other inaccurate or biased ones, the  latter due at times to the unilateral sources of information on  which the conclusions of the memorandum were based."    The Romanian Foreign Ministry sought to bring some  additional  clarification through its memorandum. Following are excerpts of  this memorandum:    "On 17 May 1994, the president of Romania, Mr. Ion Iliescu,  promulgated the Law on the Ratification of the European  Convention on Human Rights and the additional protocols thereto"  which "fully accounts for Romania's determination and readiness  to honor the obligations deriving from the most relevant  instrument of the Council of Europe."    "The ratification procedures of the General Agreement on  Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe and the  protocol thereto are high on the Parliament's agenda.  Preliminaries for the signing of the European Charter on Local  Self-Government and of the European Convention of Trans-Frontier  Cooperation are well under way."    "On 4 November 1993 Romania signed the Convention and the  two  protocols which are now at the parliament pending ratification."    "The reference made to the prefect of Cluj, Mr. Grigore  Zanc,  is not sustained by facts. The prefect has taken no measure at  all that may be considered as discriminatory towards Romanian  citizens of Hungarian origin."    "The specialized commissions of the parliament are examining  two draft laws on minorities, one submitted by the UDMR  (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania) and the other by the  parliamentary group of the national minorities in the Chamber of  Deputies."    "The draft law on education is also included on the  parliament's agenda for examination. This draft law was drawn  up in keeping with the provisions in the Constitution  guaranteeing the right of the persons belonging to national  minorities to be taught in their mother tongue and the right to  education in their maternal language."    "This draft law goes well beyond the current standards of  the  Council of Europe in what regards education and training in the  languages of national minorities."    "The setting up and preserving of bilingual signs pertains  solely to the competence of the local authorities."    "The Government of Romania undertook no action whatsoever to  remove bilingual signs across the country."    "Medical and vocational training, as well as the teaching of  history and geography have always been held in Romanian, the  national language of the country. Therefore it is not a matter  of imposing restrictions on the education for the minorities."    ``Issues, such as the opening of new border crossings  between  Romania and Hungary, the potential inauguration of a Hungarian  consulate in Cluj, or the elimination of taxes for border area  inhabitants are considered within the normal context of  bilateral Romanian-Hungarian relations. Such issues are in no  way related to the commitments entered into by Romania on its  accession to the Council of Europe.    "All persons of Hungarian origin granted pardon by the  president were released."    "As concerns Mr. Pal Cseresnyes, he does not belong to the  group of eight ethnic Hungarians pardoned by the president."    "At the time the pardon decree was issued, none of the  members of the former [Romanian Communist Party] Central  Committee were imprisoned, all of them being released on medical  grounds and the carrying out of their sentences temporarily  halted."    "The former president of the Bucharest Court of Justice  [Cornel Turianu] was dismissed by the minister of justice from  his administrative office as court president and not from his  position as magistrate."    "The minister of justice, in a letter addressed to the head  of the Legal Affairs Division, has requested the expertise of  the Council of Europe with reference to Article 19 of the law on  the organization of the judiciary in Romania."    "The draft law on the ombudsman was forwarded to the  parliament, where it will be discussed soon."    "The statement that, with the exception of the prosecutor  general and his deputy, `all other prosecutors are army men,' is  not based on truth. Actually, the overwhelming majority of  prosecutors are civilians."    "The Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Romanian  Police adopted by the parliament during the month of April, the  current year, comprises entirely new juridical standards as  compared to the previous regulations, rules allowing for the  transformation of this body into one of the basic institutions  of the state of law."    ``As to the previous law stipulating that the police  personnel consists of military staff and civilian personnel, the  recent law of the Romanian Police stipulates that 'the personnel  of the police consists of policemen and civilian personnel.'  Actually, the institutional-organizational structures of the  police are entirely distinct from the typically military ones.    "Concerning the allegations on 'telephone tapping,' the  situations involving interception of communications concern  strictly such actions infringing upon the national security of  Romania. According to the law, it is the specially appointed  prosecutor who is sole and only authority entitled to allow the  interception of communications."    "The activities of control of the Romanian Information  [Intelligence] Service (SRI) exerted by the Romanian Parliament  are ruled by a clearly specified and efficient frame aiming to  protect the service against any political interference and to  prevent any trespassing as to the prerogatives it was granted by  law."    "With reference to the subject of nationalized property  (buildings,) a juridical solution is under study, by means of  which, while postulating the rights of the former house owners  and of their heirs, the effects of such a solution on the  hundreds of thousands of persons affected by the restitution,  should be taken care of."    "As to land property, the matter is solved according to the  Law on Land Property, which was passed by the parliament in  1991."    "The draft law related to the profession of lawyer, passed  by  the Senate in 1993, is on the agenda of the Chamber of Deputies  and will be discussed depending on the break-down of priorities  faced by the chamber."    "The process of revision of Article 200 in the Romanian  Criminal Code related to homosexuality is practically completed,  the Romanian legislation allowing thus the jurisprudence of the  European Court of Human Rights in the matter."    "The reason of the temporary suspension of the accreditation  [to the presidential headquarters] of the journalists of the  daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI is determined by the fact that they have  repeatedly and blatantly spread misleading news concerning the  activity of the presidential institution and have systematically  avoided to publish the due denials when confronted with the  proof of their bad faith."    "Immediately after the conclusion of each press conference  of  the president or of his spokesman, all media have unrestricted  access to the full transcription of the recording of the  respective conference."    "The decision according to which printed matter can be  mailed  abroad only from one post office has been revoked."    "The rapporteurs of the [Council of Europe] Parliamentary  Assembly were erroneously informed as to the so-called  nationalization of the SOTI television channel. In order to be  nationalized, the second channel of the Romanian television (on  which SOTI is currently broadcasting) should have previously  been a privately-owned channel. Channel 2 has never been  private, it has always been a public service channel. SOTI  station has obtained the frequency channel 57 by public bidding."    ``Freedom of faith is fully granted in Romania. The issue of  the restitution of the ecclesiastical property was constantly  approached during talks between the different established  religions in the country and also during talks with the  government authorities. The scarcity of financial means with  which the confessional education is confronted does not spare  the education system in general during this difficult period of  transition and economic restructuring.    ``The memorandum includes the summary of a document directly  handed over to the rapporteurs by the trade unions. The  statements, which were not previously checked, such as the one  according to which trade union members risk losing their jobs if  there is evidence that they act as leaders in their trade union.  [sentence as received]    ``The statement that 'the parliamentary majority hinders the  implementation of the reforms' should be reconsidered taking  into account the fact that in a state based on the rule of law,  such as Romania, the parliament itself is an essential source of  the legitimacy of the reform, and it is precisely this majority  [sentence as received].</p>

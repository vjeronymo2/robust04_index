			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Herve Laumont: "France Declares War on Dirty </F> Money"    [Excerpts] An interministerial committee is scheduled  today to examine a new anticorruption program based on proposals  by Judge Jean-Pierre, who was assigned last December to devise  uniform procedures for and step up the fight against dirty  money.    [Passage omitted] Thierry Jean-Pierre's report develops  several proposals for effectively combatting the mafia  organizations that have moved into France from all over the  world.    Existing agencies are plagued by a number of problems,  including lack of information and coordination among  investigatory and preventative agencies, the slowness of  proceedings and international rogatory commissions, and poor  cooperation from banks. This inadequate organization has  severely hampered their efforts. Moreover, no fewer than six  separate bodies, with little or no liaison between them, have  been expected to fight crime that has become increasingly  organized.    How can investigators flush out a front company hidden in  one  of the world's 20 tax havens, or expose a customer who is  laundering several hundreds of thousands of dollars through the  foreign subsidiary of a French bank, when the laws of that  country do not require the bank to report suspicious deposits?  Not to mention the fact that Italian, Russian, Asian, and now  East European mafias have established a foothold in France.    Judge Jean-Pierre's proposals, which today's  interministerial  meeting is expected to ratify, attack just such problems. They  are part of a sweeping plan to revamp the judiciary that calls  for creating specialized economic and financial jurisdictions in  each big region of France by the end of the year. Right now,  makeshift versions of such units exist only in Paris,  Marseilles, and Lyon.    The judges who will preside over these jurisdictions will  receive specific training and will be backed by intervention  forces composed of police officers, gendarmes (police militia),  and tax and customs agents. They will also have access to a  central documentation agency--called DESC, for Specialized Crime  Research Department--that will serve as a national clearinghouse  for all information on dubious financial channels, phony  bankruptcies, and individuals to monitor. This new organization  to combat organized financial crime is actually the first step  toward the medium-term goal of creating a European agency.  Already, occasional operations involving European collaboration  have paid off.    The Russian Interior Ministry has just forwarded the first  official request for judicial cooperation to the Chancellery via  Interpol and French diplomatic agencies. The request concerns a  Russian businessman living in the 17th District of Paris and  suspected of receiving sizable sums from Russia via the  English-Norman islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Man, for  transfer to Switzerland and Monaco. Some of the money was  reportedly used to purchase a restaurant in Lille Street.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Bardin report under the "Finance Ministry Assesses </F> Presidential Edicts" rubric: "Financiers Sign Up for the  Opposition"]    [Text] The six presidential edicts that supplied Viktor  Chernomyrdin with the opportunity to announce the birth of a  Russian economic model remain in the focus of universal  attention. The State Duma has taken a failed attempt to  pronounce them unconstitutional from the outset. Russian  Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said that "many  provisions of the edicts run counter to the current legislation,  and some of them are simply astonishing." The Finance Ministry,  while refraining from issuing any statements, yesterday  presented its calculations to the State Duma showing that the  room for tax maneuver is not so large as the edicts' authors  thought.    The essence of the package of presidential edicts, as  KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported Wednesday, boils down to budget  maneuvering with the view to easing tax pressure on enterprises,  a measure which, according to the drafters, must finally bring  about economic recovery. Naturally, at a time of a budget  deficit taxes can be cut only if the resulting decrease in the  budget revenues is offset by something else. This is the reason  why the edict "On Lifting Quotas and Licenses for the Export  Deliveries of Goods and Services" should not only liberalize a  certain sector of the economy, but also give a boost to the  federal budget's hard-currency revenues. The lifting of tariff  benefits serves to achieve this objective. It is the abolition  of benefits together with the tightening of tax and payment  discipline (to which other edicts in the May package are  devoted) that should help painlessly to cut taxes.    In a letter to Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the State Duma  Committee on the Budget, Finances, and Banks, the Finance  Ministry has dissipated these hopes. The ministry is proceeding  from the assumption that hard-currency losses from scrapping  state quotas on oil, oil products, non-ferrous metals, and  natural gas, estimated in the draft federal budget at $2.6  billion, will not be offset by the expected earnings from export  customs duties ($2.47 billion). At the same time, the ministry  has already taken into account the new export duty rates that  have been significantly reduced under the upcoming draft  government decree (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 21 May). So, the  budget will not benefit from that in real terms.    (Customs duties have not been levied on exports to meet  state  requirements, but virtually all hard-currency earnings have been  transferred to the budget. According to the logic of the  edicts' authors, the abolition of state quotas and customs duty  benefits is designed to replace budget revenues from state  exports with earnings from export customs duties.)    The Finance Ministry's general conclusion is clear: the  edict "On Lifting Quotas and Licenses for the Export Deliveries  of Goods and Services" will not help increase the budget  revenues. Hence, what is left at the government's disposal is  in effect only administrative measures to combat persistent tax  evaders. This does not inspire any particular confidence,  however, that the promises to slash profit and added-value tax  rates by 10 to 20 percentage points will be fulfilled.  <H5>  Federal budget hard-currency export revenues in 1994 </H5>   As of 1 May, $738 million has been received.    Revenues according to the draft federal budget    -- total -- $2.6 billion    -- from oil, oil products, and non-ferrous metals exports  -- $1.4 billion    -- from natural gas exports -- $1.2 billion    Revenues after changes introduced by the presidential edicts  (Finance Ministry's estimate) -- $2.47 billion</p>

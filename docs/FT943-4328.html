			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Arts: Carving out a drama in the courtroom - Sore about its treatment by the UK government, the Getty is determined to win possession of the Three Graces Today the never-ending saga of the Three Graces moves into the courtroom. A judge will decide whether the complaint by the Getty Museum of Malibu, California, that the British Government has broken its own rules on the export of works of art, has substance. It is amazing it has come to this. The Getty, the most generously endowed museum in the world, with a Dollars 4bn bequest from oil billionaire J. Paul Getty to administer, has always prided itself on playing fair, on not using its financial muscle to rampage through the treasure troves of nations. It expects governments to play fair too. But having waited since 1989 to take possession of Canova's statue, which it bought for Pounds 7.6m, and confident that the August deadline postponing its export from the UK would be the last, the Getty is up in arms at the unexpected delay. This enabled Timothy Clifford of the National Galleries of Scotland to ride belatedly to the rescue and unearth two rich friends of the UK, John Paul Getty II and Baron Thyssen, who have promised Pounds 1m and Pounds 800,000 respectively to save the Three Graces for the UK. No wonder the Getty's mild mannered director John Walsh is roused. 'We have been treated shabbily,' he said. 'The government has changed its own rules and ignored its own deadlines whenever it was convenient. What's at issue is not just the Three Graces: it is the fair administration of the export review system in Britain.' Few objects of art more suit the Getty than the Three Graces. Getty loved antiquity. His museum is fashioned after a Roman villa which disappeared on the eruption of Vesuvius. Canova's fantasy of the daughters of Jove embracing in marble harks directly back to classical times. A visit to the Getty on its hillside perch confirms that the Three Graces would fit beautifully into an airy alcove there, alongside statues, framed by the fountains, shrubs and frescoes of the museum and with the Pacific Ocean in the distance. The likely loss of the statue has put iron into Walsh's soul. It is not the first time the Getty has been pipped at the post. A Duccio painting and a Bernini bust were also retained in the UK thanks to the Clifford-Getty II partnership. Despite an annual expenditure budget in excess of Dollars 200m, the Getty Trust, which administers the museum, has traditionally behaved prudently. 'We have not used our cheque book to pay over the odds, nor have we hidden behind false identities,' says Walsh. The trust has played the game, respecting the national heritages of the European countries which mainly hold the objects of art it seeks. 'We only succeed in acquiring about one object in every four or five that we would like,' says Walsh. In the future this restraint in spending the Dollars 60m or so a year the museum sets aside for acquisitions may be loosened. Apart from the increasingly restrictive export policies for antiques operated by European Union nations, the Getty imposes its own checks on acquisitions. It respects the passions of its founder, who mainly bought antiquities, Renaissance and Baroque paintings and European decorative arts. Its collection does not contain anything made after 1900, its painting display culminating in a selection of dramatic works by Ensor, Munch and, most notably, Van Gogh - a version of 'Irises' which at more than Dollars 40m was the Getty's most expensive single acquisition. The 1900 time limit is unlikely to change, though Walsh has cast off some of the self-imposed limitations: there is little point having so much potential buying power if you do not try to form the finest collections in the world in certain fields. So the Getty has focused on photography. Its collection of more than 60,000 images, from Fox Talbot to American 20th-century greats such as Weston - Walsh says a photography archive stopping at 1900 is a nonsense - is considered the ultimate. Selective collections of drawings and manuscripts have also been assembled. But to the visitor the eye catchers are in the traditional areas: the antiquities, purged of the rogue fake; the paintings, from Rembrandt to David and including the most expensive Old Master ever acquired at auction - Pontormo's portrait of Cosimo de Medici, which cost Dollars 35m in 1989; and the panelled rooms displaying an ornate procession of French design, from Regence through Rococo to Neo-Classical. By 1997 a new museum, built atop a nearby hill with views across Los Angeles, will open. Called the Getty Center, it will cost Dollars 700m and be four times larger than the villa, which will remain the home of the antiquities. The rest of the collection, including many objects currently warehoused, will move into a museum campus designed by Richard Meier. It is the construction of the new museum which is absorbing most of the Getty's invested revenues, though there are still millions to spare each year for conservation projects and scholarship. Although running two museums plus satellite activities will increase the operating costs of the Getty Trust, the completion of the Center will leave more money to spend. The Getty will want some fine objects to fill its new galleries but it is finding it ever harder to acquire them. Walsh admits this is a growing problem. Most of the pre-1900 masterpieces are safely ensconced in museums worldwide. The Getty can, however, make private deals: it recently acquired a very fine Tiepolo through Switzerland. In spite of Walsh's protestations it certainly pays top prices. Perhaps Turner's dramatic seascape 'Von Tromp doing the will of his Master' is just about worth the Dollars 17m the Getty paid, but other recent payouts, such as Pounds 4.95m for a Goya bull fighting scene and Dollars 11m for a Sebastiano portrait of Pope Clement VII, look on the high side. These paintings were bought openly. The worry is that, affronted by the delays and the dubious justifications of the UK government over the Three Graces, the Getty will be inclined to go behind backs and negotiate privately with British aristocrats, German princes, and French counts. At the moment the art market is still suffering from post-recession blues and little of unquestionable brilliance is coming forward. In a year or two the Getty, with its bulging pockets, will be ready to power the market's revival, while at the same time showing less sensitivity to national pride.</p>

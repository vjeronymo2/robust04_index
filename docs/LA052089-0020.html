			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARTS AND LAURELS TO THOSE INVOLVED WITH 'ROE VS. WADE'  </P> <P> Kudos to NBC President Robert C. Wright for publicly asking advertisers to  support "Roe vs. Wade" and to NBC for saying it would broadcast the movie even  if no commercials could be sold.  </P> <P> As a citizen in a free society, I have a right to see a re-enactment of this  piece of history, whether or not I agree with the Supreme Court's ruling in the  1973 Roe vs. Wade case. NBC was not trying to rewrite history, only to retell  it. It's called freedom of speech.  </P> <P> NANCY MATTHEWS  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Freeing its hand to shop around Whitbread's restructuring frees it from its past as a family brewer and gives it flexibility to pursue its strategic development in retailing and leisure. The move had been widely expected since Sir Michael Angus took over as chairman last year from Mr Samuel Whitbread, whose ancestor founded the business at the Goat Brewhouse in London in 1742. The family, with 10.8 per cent of the voting rights, had long ago ceded control. But the dual share structure and the cross-holdings in Whitbread Investment Company continued to put a brake on expansion. The share structure had been devised in 1948 as a safeguard against takeover threats, but was out of tune with contemporary thinking on shareholders' rights, restricting Whitbread's ability to raise funds in the market. The Whitbread Investment Company had also outlived its usefulness. It was set up in 1956 when a number of regional brewers turned to Whitbread for help in resisting takeover bids, notably from an acquisitive Bass. Whitbread bought minority stakes, usually in deals which included an agreement to stock its beers. Several of the regional brewers concerned - including Flowers, Fremlins and Castle Eden - became part of the Whitbread group in the 1960s. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the brewing industry in 1989 changed the competitive climate. Because of its association with WIC, Whitbread was forced to reduce its stakes in regional brewers and pub-owners, or free more of its own pubs from tied beer supplies. For Whitbread's shareholders, its near 50 per cent stake in WIC began to appear anomalous. It became increasingly obvious that the complex and confusing structures were a drag on the group's development. Mr John Spicer, analyst at Warburg Securities, says this helps to explain 'Whitbread's slippage in size behind other leading companies in the drinks sector over the past 10 years. Some opportunities for sizeable acquisitions may have been missed.' Losing to Scottish &amp; Newcastle in the bidding for GrandMet's Chef &amp; Brewer chain of pubs last month was a blow - though Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said 'the price GrandMet was looking for and our valuation were never in the same ball park'. With the completion of the reforms, Whitbread will not only gain readier access to funds through equity issues, but also instant access to WIC's investment portfolio. That includes - apart from nearly Pounds 200m of shares in Whitbread which will be cancelled - Pounds 250m of shares in more than a score of companies. Much of this portfolio could be sold to raise cash, though stakes are likely to be kept in regional brewers and pub operators to underpin Whitbread's trading links. Though speculation continues about Whitbread's eventual exit from brewing, Mr Jarvis said that he was 'comfortable' with its present performance. His prime objective, however, is likely to be the continuing reinforcement of Whitbread's position as one of the UK's leading retailers. The group's eyes are now clearly on Forte's Harvester chain. 'We are very interested,' Mr Jarvis said. As the country's second largest operator in the eating-out market, Whitbread aims to continue the growth achieved in its Beefeater chain with the acquisition of Berni, and the development of Pizza Hut. It also plans to expand its Travel Inn budget hotels and the Thresher chain of off-licences.</p>

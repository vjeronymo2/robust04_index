			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Science receives a small increase - Technology Science has emerged with a small spending increase. The government's new Office of Science and Technology will have Pounds 1,082m to spend on research in 1994-95, mainly in universities compared with Pounds 1,038m in 1993-94. Next year's science budget is Pounds 7m more generous than the planning figure announced a year ago. The OST has been protected from cuts by the government's determination to push forward the changes in science policy outlined in a white paper six months ago. 'It's a very good settlement compared to what might have been,' said Sir David Phillips, outgoing chairman of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils, who has not been afraid to criticise science budgets. However, OST officials concede that there is likely to be a small decline in research and development spending by other government departments - as foreseen a year ago.</p>

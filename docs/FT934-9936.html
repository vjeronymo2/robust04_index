			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (6): Push-button services - Wider role emerges for new-style cash machines IN the UK, the Trustee Savings Bank communicates with 70-80 per cent of customers through automated teller machines (ATMs) and Barclays says 200m cash withdrawals - worth Pounds 10m in total - were made from its network of machines last year. Most ATMs only dispense cash, but they are starting to be put to new uses and combined with emerging technologies, such as multimedia. Since early October, Vienna-based customers of Creditanstalt Bankverein have had access to five self-service machines from Digital Equipment which enable them to: Make giro payments. Set up or update standing orders. Get information on stock exchange rates. Make deposit or account-balance enquiries. Find information on other banking services. The design of the terminal incorporates the latest multimedia technology. For example, video clips describe the different services and when the machine is used for payments or other transactions, a combination of video, text and graphics guides the user through the system. The user responds using touch-screen commands and a keyboard. Norbert Cizek, retail banking manager for Digital Equipment in Austria, says: 'In Austria, a money transfer usually costs the banks DM3; using the machine it only costs DM1, because the customer is carrying out the transfer.' If, after a six-month pilot, the multimedia terminals prove popular with customers, they will be used in the rest of Creditanstalt's 200 Austrian branches. At the Co-operative Bank in the UK, self-service machines are being used on a pilot basis to encourage customers to open new accounts. At five of the Bank's branches, customers can use IBM's Personal Financial Assistant (a walk-in booth complete with self-service terminal) to open a current account, savings account or credit-card account, or take out a personal loan. A telephone beside the terminal links them with a member of the bank's Armchair Banking staff (in Skelmersdale) who can give them any additional information they need. An application form can then be printed out in the booth for the customer to sign. At 12 branches of Barclays, NCR Touchbank machines are being used to allow customers to pay bills, transfer money between accounts or find out about loans and mortgages. Similar services are being offered on self-service machines used in the TSB Bank's Tyneside banking pilot. Machines at 13 out of 18 Tyneside branches use graphics and animation (eg a magpie to represent savings) to increase useability. The National Westminster Bank is also testing self-service technology. At its Surbiton branch, PC-based machines with touch screens give customers details of travel, home contents, health insurance and mortgages. Other uses for self-service machines include: STATEMENT PRINTING In Germany, dedicated statement printing machines are common, partly because of regulatory requirements for customers to keep records of banking transactions. The machines are also popular in Austria. At the TSB, over a million statements a month are requested via ATMs This has reduced the bank's administrative workload because most customers no longer ask for monthly statements to be sent to them. DEPOSIT-TAKING Some ATMs allow customers to deposit money or cheques. But customers are often reluctant to use them. Organisations such as the Abbey National and the TSB encourage customers to make deposits by producing instant receipts. The TSB has carried out customer training in the Tyneside area on how to make deposits via a machine. ATMs are also available from IBM and NCR which display an image of cheques fed into them. ADVERTISING Martin Hess, head of self-service banking at IBM UK, believes that UK ATMs could one day be viewed as an advertising medium by large retailers. This is already happening in the US, where some ATMs, typically those in shopping malls, dispense money-off coupons along with cash. So-called 'merchant couponing' has already begun in the UK. Customers of the Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society get a message on their ATM receipts entitling them to a discount at Burger King or, in some cases, a free hamburger. Martin Hess says such schemes could turn ATMs into a valuable asset for banks. LIMITATIONS OF AUTOMATION Paul Swainbank, director of channel marketing at TSB, believes that in certain locations unmanned automated branches will replace the traditional branch. But he does not believe they could be applied across the board, although they are cheaper to run. This is partly because many customers still want to be able to talk to bank staff face to face. Jerry Whitmarsh, head of technology planning for NatWest's branch network, says: 'Our feeling is that people do prefer face-to-face discussions when they are thinking about a major item of expenditure, such as a mortgage or a pension. But a machine that produces quotes is a good starting point.' Substitutes for face-to-face communication, such as video- conferencing links to bank staff, have not proved themselves yet. The Co-operative Bank plans to add video-conferencing to its PFA system and the TSB is testing a couple of NCR machines with built-in video-conferencing in Watford and Newcastle. The customer is given a choice between pressing one key for a quotation or another for an interview. If they press the 'interview' button, they see a live video image of a bank employee. Paul Swainbank says: 'Some of our customers were rather startled and, to be honest, some of our staff were, too.' Today, however, non-cash uses of ATMs are still limited in the UK and it is notable that many of the banks' pilot schemes have been extended without any definite decisions being made about when the technology will be rolled out to more locations.

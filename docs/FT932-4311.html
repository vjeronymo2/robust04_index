			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Gonzalez back into battle - with his own party PRIME MINISTER Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, fresh from his triumph in Sunday's general election, is being thrown quickly back into a battle for control of his Socialist party, the outcome of which could make or break his fourth term in office. The row, buried during the election campaign, has resurfaced as Mr Gonzalez prepares sweeping cabinet changes and tries to decide with which parties his minority government will make policy arrangements solid enough to allow him to govern for a full term. The infighting, which became public two days after the election, is between supporters of Mr Gonzalez, politically centrist or liberal, and the left-wing party machine, suspicious of the conservative drift of government policies and led by Mr Alfonso Guerra, party vice president and former deputy prime minister. Mr Gonzalez inclines towards making a four-year pact with the conservative Catalan CiU while the Guerristas, fearful that Catalan fiscal rectitude might damage their influence over the budget, prefer rolling pacts, with the government siding with different parties on different issues. Mr Gonzalez has to solve this. He is head of both the government and the party but was unable earlier this year to force party administrators to accept responsibility for a scandal over illicit party financing. The ensuing row, during which Mr Guerra and his associates attacked the liberals for calling themselves 'renovators who are renovators of nothing', threatened to split the party and forced Mr Gonzalez to call the election. While Mr Gonzalez was taking a post-election break in Andalucia on Tuesday, Mr Guerra said on television that while much of the credit was due to Mr Gonzalez for the Socialists' surprisingly strong performance on Sunday - in which they lost their parliamentary majority but ended well ahead of the conservative People's party - the party took a great deal of credit, too. By that, he meant himself. He and his supporters point out that the big Socialist vote was concentrated in the left-wing strongholds of Andalucia and Extremadura and that he produced a huge Socialist vote in his own constituency, Seville. The Socialists also increased their vote in the Basque country, which strengthens Mr Guerra's close party aide, Mr Jose Maria Benegas, who heads the Basque Socialists Most analysts agree that if Mr Gonzalez does not manage to redesign the party executive - perhaps at a party congress to be held next January at the latest - he will find it difficult to implement the austere fiscal policies necessary to help Spain survive its current recession. He also needs to address the party financing scandal much sooner, before it gets to the courts. Any credible way out involves finding new positions for Mr Guerra and Mr Benegas, both of whom would resist fiercely any pressure to leave their posts. To get their hands off the party levers, Mr Gonzalez may even try to bring one or both of them into his next government. But the big public test of strength between Mr Gonzalez and Mr Guerra will come in about three weeks when the parties select their parliamentary spokesmen. The current pro-Guerra Socialist incumbent is likely to be removed and there is speculation that Mr Gonzalez wants to replace him with Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, who is deeply resented by the left.</p>

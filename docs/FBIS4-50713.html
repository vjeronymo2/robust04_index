			<p>BFN     [Text] Song Ping, former member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of  the China Family Planning Association, stressed: In carrying  out family planning work, we should make unreserved efforts to  improve work style and work methods, step up family planning  propaganda and education, and provide the broad masses of the  people with better services relating to production, livelihood,  and child birth with a view to creating better conditions for  family planning work. This, Song Ping stressed, is where the  unifying force of the China Family Planning Association lies.    Song Ping made the above remarks at a recently concluded  family planning forum in Guilin, which was attended by the  chairmen of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region family  planning associations.    In his speech delivered at the Guilin forum, Song Ping  stated: At present, there are two prevailing views regarding  China's family planning work, both of which are at once  incommensurate with the realities of China and detrimental to  China's family planning work. The first view is: Once China's  economy is developed, China's population growth rate will drop  as a result. Song Ping said: We should firmly bear in mind the  per capita concept while pushing forward the country's economic  growth. Should we fail to place population growth under  control, we will definitely find it impossible to achieve faster  economic growth. The second view is: Now that China has started  building a market economy, population growth should also be  regulated by the market. Song Ping said: China's basic national  conditions have made family planning an inevitable choice for  the Chinese people. Thus, governments at all levels across the  country are duty-bound to regulate and control population  growth. Any attempt to place population growth under market  regulation would undoubtedly make it impossible for China to  fulfill its population control targets. Under no circumstances  should we slacken family planning efforts.    Song Ping stated: As it takes years to transform ordinary  people's population concepts, it is necessary to carry on family  planning propaganda and education for years to come. Though  family planning is considered beneficial to the country and the  people, some citizens still harbor misconceptions about family  planning and have yet to recognize the great significance of  family planning work. In view of this situation, first and  foremost, we should carry on patient, meticulous, and convincing  family planning propaganda and education, integrate propaganda  on the basic national policy of family planning with universal  education on state laws, and energetically publicize the PRC  Constitution and the PRC Marriage Law, as well as various  locally promulgated family planning regulations in order that  the broad masses of citizens will gradually take family planning  as their unshirkable duty. Second, we should integrate  propaganda on family planning with the popularization of  knowledge of birth control and eugenic techniques with an eye on  protecting the health of both mothers and infants and further  improving population quality. Third, we should integrate  propaganda on family planning with efforts to shake off poverty  and achieve a comparatively well-off livelihood. At the moment,  Song Ping noted, what the rural populace is most concerned with  is finding effective ways and means of eradicating poverty and  achieving a comparatively well-off livelihood. Family planning  associations at all levels across China should take full account  of this situation and actively try to provide the rural populace  with better family planning services, thereby helping them  further develop production and achieve prosperity. Family  planning, Song Ping stressed, is a project about the human brain  and body and about each and every aspect of a human family.  This project comprehensively reflects a country's population  culture. Family planning associations at all levels in China  should therefore try to provide the broad masses of the people  with comprehensive and varied services in terms of population  growth control, population quality improvement, health  protection for mothers and infants, civilized family building,  living environment improvement, and so on.    Song Ping stated: While family planning is being carried on,  China will inevitably confront a series of problems caused by an  increasingly aging population. In view of this situation,  family planning associations at all levels in China should try  to show more concern for senior citizens, actively advocate and  implement an old-age pension system by joining hands with the  departments concerned, help senior citizens tackle actual  problems, and provide senior citizens with necessary financial  assistance.    Song Ping called for organically integrating family  planning management with family planning education among the  people; conducting down-to-earth family planning work; steadily  pushing ahead with nationwide propaganda, education, and  services relating to family planning work; and gradually  regularizing and systematizing family planning work so that the  broad masses of the people will more consciously carry out  family planning in society.    The forum was held under the auspices of China Family  Planning Association and was attended by the chairmen of 11  provincial, municipal, and autonomous region family planning  associations.    Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous  Region  CPC Committee, attended and delivered a speech at the forum in  which he said: The fact that the forum is being held in Guangxi  has given a powerful impetus to Guangxi's family planning work.  Comrade Song Ping's speech to the forum has greatly enlightened  Guangxi's family planning workers. After this forum, we will  make every possible endeavor to implement and carry out the  spirit of the forum.    Liu Mingzu, deputy secretary of the regional party  committee,  chairman of the people's congress standing committee, and  chairman of the family planning association, also delivered a  speech at the forum in which he briefed participants on the work  achievements of the Guangxi Family Planning Association.    Participants in the forum also visited Tonghua village,  Linchun County, Guangxi, a model family planning village  commended by the Guangxi Family Planning Association.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, January 29 (XINHUA) -- Japan's Diet finally  approved the government-proposed package of political reform  bills today following a stand-up vote by both houses of the  parliament.    The approval saved led Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa a  deep political crisis -- the resignation of the entire cabinet  or a dissolution of parliament for a snap election. [sentence  as received]    Hosokawa himself had indicated earlier he would quit if he  failed to get the reform measures passed during the current  parliamentary session which ended today.    The package was a compromise version of the original reform  bills. The deal was struck last night at a meeting between  Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP).    But no date is set for the implementation of the adopted  bills. Under the compromise deal, the revision of these bills  will be deliberated in the next regular Diet session which is  scheduled to open Monday [31 January].    According to the new version of the package, members of the  lower house will be elected through a combination of 300  single-seat districts and 200 seats of proportional  representation based on 11 blocs across the country. The ruling  coalition had proposed a 274-226 split.    On anti-corruption measures, the compromise plan permits  corporations or organizations to offer limited donations to  local legislators instead of Diet members.    The version also promises that such corporate donations will  be completely banned in five years. The original bills stood  for a blanket ban on such donations with immediate effect.    The political reforms, which are aimed at eliminating "money  politics" and enhancing political openness, have been debated in  Japan for years.    Unlike his predecessors, Hosokawa has promised to make the  political reforms his top priority since he took office last  August and hinted he would resign if reform legislation failed.    His original reform bills received a nod from the lower  house  of the parliament last November, but was rejected by the upper  house last week because of the rebellion of 20 deputies of the  socialists, the biggest partner within the coalition government.    The passage of the reform bills leaves the Hosokawa  government free to concentrate on mapping out measures to pull  the economy out of a persistent recession.    Hosokawa also must turn his attention to working out the  1994  fiscal budget and solving the trade dispute with the United  States.    However, the government still faces the uphill task of  pushing ahead with the reforms, as many socialist lawmakers have  publicly said "no" to the part of the government plan which  allows individual politicians to accept limited donations.</p>

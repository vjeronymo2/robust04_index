Shortly before the meeting, U.S. President Bill Clinton sent  a "personal letter" to Kim Yong-sam the puppet, "reaffirming the  United States' commitment to defending South Korea" and its  determination "to strengthen the joint U.S.-South Korean defense  posture."    NODONG SINMUN today brands the puppets' fuss at "Chongwadae"  as a reckless act to deliberately bring the situation to the  phase of war after breaking up the working-level contact for the  exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South.    The news analyst says:    The Kim Yong-sam clique declared they would resume the Team  Spirit joint military maneuvers against the fellow countrymen in  the North and introduce Patriot missiles in a short time. This  clearly shows they are a group of despicable traitors who seek a  way out in harming fellow countrymen in collusion with outside  forces.    As we have declared time and again, we are fully prepared to  answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war.    We are not afraid even if the South Korean puppets resume  the  Team Spirit joint military maneuvers and deploy in a short time  Patriot missiles and anything more sophisticated.    We do not like an empty talk.    Our people and People's Army will severely punish the  traitors attempting to stifle fellow countrymen in conspiracy  with outside forces, and will resolutely defend our socialist  motherland and the security of the nation.    The United States had better know that there is nothing to  gain and nothing good for it even if it instigates and gives a  shot in the arm to such a fool as Kim Yong-sam who is  floundering in the mud as a target of overthrow, forsaken by the  nation.</p>

Subject of the interview is  the newly operating agency of the Russian Council on Security]    [Text] Life without danger is practically impossible.  However, mankind must reduce the ecological risk to a minimum if  it does not want to perish.    Correspondent: Aleksey Vladimirovich, what are the  basic tasks and functions of the MVK--the Interdepartmental  Commission on Ecological Security of the Russian Council on  Security?    Yablokov: The statute on the commission, ratified  by the Presidential Edict of 13 July of this year, defines its  three main tasks: Appraisal of the ecological threats and  sources of ecological security for the individual, society and  the state; Analysis of the information on functioning of systems  of ecological security provision and aid in coordinating the  activity of the federal agencies in this sphere, and preparation  of predictions on the status of the ecological security of  Russia.    Based on its analytical work, the MVK must prepare proposals  for review by the Council on Security, as well as drafts of its  appropriate decisions and drafts of normative statutes on  ecological security. And it must also submit materials for the  ``White Book''--the annual report on national security presented  by the President of Russia. Of course, as relates to questions  of ecological security.    The principles for a normative base are present: The Russian  Federation law, ``On Security,'' a number of decrees by the  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, edicts by the president,  decrees and orders by the Russian government, and the  recommendational legislative statute, ``On Principles of  Ecological Security in the Commonwealth States.'' Currently in  the stage of review are draft laws on ecological security, on  the protection of the population against natural disasters, on  the transport of special cargo, on especially dangerous toxic  substances, on the protection of the territory of Russia against  the import and spread of especially dangerous infections and  toxic substances, and an entire series of others.    There are several special federal structures which are  directly related to the provision of ecological security. Among  them are Minpriroda [Ministry on Nature] (with an administration  on ecological security), the State Committee on Emergency  Situations (GKChS), Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight], Gosatomnadzor [State  Committee on Nuclear Oversight], Gostekhnadzor [State Committee  on Technical Oversight], KOPRON [not further identified] and the  Committee on Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological  Weapons--specialized federal structures which are also  associated with ecological security. The powerful structures  which maintain and ensure the informational block of ecological  security are: Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on  Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control], Roskomzem [Russian  Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management],  Roskomvod [Russian Federation Committee on Water Resources and  Water Management], GoskomChernobyl [Russian Federation State  Committee on Social Protection of Civilians and Rehabilitation  of Territories Suffering from Chernobyl and Other Radiation  Catastrophes], GoskomSever [RF Committee on the Socioeconomic  Development of the North], and Goskomnats [RF Committee on  Nationalities]. The Foreign Intelligence Service and the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in recent times also the  Ministry of Defense, have given serious attention to questions  of ecological security. And within the government there are  several specialized commissions operating which are associated  with questions of ecological security.    Correspondent: And so, there is a branched system  of state structures associated with the resolution of problems  of ecological security. An extensive normative base has been  created, yet the problems of the country's ecological security  are multiplying... How can we explain this?    Yablokov: By three main reasons. First of all--by  the transitional character of our society, with its political,  and this means also its administrative, instability.  Secondly--by the economic chaos. These reasons determine the  inadequate attention to the problem of ecological security. And  thirdly--by the inadequate development of the theoretical and  applied aspects of the problem of ecological security in Russia.  About 10 years ago, the President of the Academy of Sciences  could, for example, publicly announce the absolute safety of  nuclear power production, and even offer to build a  Chernobyl-type reactor in Red Square...    Within the memory of our generation, great ecological  catastrophes of a global scale were consciously planned (!) in  our country. One of them--the destruction of the Aral Sea--was  almost fully implemented. Others, like the famous turning of the  northern and Siberian rivers, were blocked, fortunately.  Ignoring the problems of ecological security led to the creation  and accumulation of nuclear missile and chemical weapons without  development of plans for their utilization, as well as to the  creation of gigantic nuclear power plants without development of  plans for their operational de-commission, despite the fact that  the service life of an AES [nuclear power plant] is rather  short--30-40 years.    All this testifies to the fact that in the very recent past  the country had no conception of ecological security.    Correspondent: Evidently today, after the  Chernobyl catastrophe, theoretical and practical developments in  the sphere of ecological security are being conducted  intensively and principally in Russia?    Yablokov: They are in the stages of inception as  compared with what has been done abroad over the last 15-20  years. The pivotal point of the conception of ecological  security in the world has been recognized to be the theory of  ecological risk, and its applied part--determination of the  level of acceptable risk. This risk, naturally, is largely  defined by the effects on human health.    Take a look at this figure (Fig. 1), which presents the  results of one such development for the USA. And take note:  Nothing of the sort has yet been done for the conditions in  Russia! And the sooner we attain the world level of theoretical  and practical developments in this sphere, the more successful  we will be in solving the problem of ensuring the country's  national ecological security. Only in November of 1991, within  the framework of the State Council of Russia, were the basic  conceptions of ecological security developed in our country, and  a year later the Minpriroda of Russia developed the basics for a  conception of a federal program, ``Ecological Security of  Russia.'' Only at the beginning of the current year was the  ``Conception for Ecological Security of Russia'' reviewed and  adopted.       In March, the Russian Federation Council on Security  reviewed  the question of the state of health of Russia's population,  including also in connection with the country's ecological  status. Huge losses in the vital and labor potential of the  population became apparent, primarily a reduction of the life  expectancy, conditioned by ecological dangers.    There is currently a growing understanding of the importance  of including the components of ecological security in the  structure of national security. A confirmation of this fact is  the activity of the State Committee on Emergency Situations, of  federal inspections, of a number of other federal agencies of  executive power, as well as of the Supreme Soviet. Graphically,  the variant of isolating the component of ecological security  within the overall structure of security of the individual,  society and the state appears as follows, as you see in this  figure (Fig. 2).       Correspondent: Thus, the ecological security of  the country is not ensured to the proper degree? Then--your  arguments.    Yablokov: The zones of ecological disaster and  unfavorability are expanding. Today they occupy around 15  percent of the entire territory of Russia. The decline in the  average life expectancy is continuing. The illness rate  associated with the effect of ecological factors is increasing.  Biological diversity is decreasing, the soil covering is  deteriorating, and the quality of surface and underground waters  is declining. Technologically caused accidents and catastrophes  which have negative ecological consequences are becoming more  frequent. And this is far from the complete picture of negative  tendencies in the state of health of the population and the  quality of the environment in many regions of Russia.    Correspondent: The most varied ministries and  departments must submit their proposals to the MVK on problems  of ecological security. So, will it deal with everything at  once? That is unrealistic... What problems does the MVK intend  to review first of all?    Yablokov: The emphasis must be placed on solving  two continuous problems. On a comparative evaluation of all (in  the country as a whole as well as for the major  economic-geographical regions) significant ecological risks, and  on a definition of the mechanism of management of each specific  ecological risk for the purpose of its reduction to an  acceptable level.    Correspondent: Which of the problems of ecological  security are most promising for review in your commission?    Yablokov: The ecological risk of industrial  accidents and catastrophes and the development of traditional,  nuclear and other forms of power production. The risk in the  basic sectors of industry, in transport and in agriculture. This  is the ecological risk associated with radioactive contamination  of the environment--including from RAO [not further identified]  and AES [nuclear power plants]; With the formation, transport  and burial of various waste products, including hazardous  industrial waste; With the pollution of drinking water, the  surface and underground waters; With conversion of the defense   <FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-004C-48A>           Figure 1. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-004C-49A>           Figure 2. Structure of National Security </FIG>  sectors of industry and military activity--including also with  the destruction of chemical and nuclear weapons and missiles, as  well as the destruction of a significant portion of the almost 2  million tonnes of conventional ammunition, some of which has  been stored since the time of World War I; With the adoption of  large-scale projects of natural resource utilization--for  example, the assimilation of new oil and gas deposits on land  and sea; With large-scale transport construction, including of  the major seaport in Luzhskaya Inlet and a high-speed train from  Moscow to Siberia. And finally, this is a question of reducing  the level of ecological danger in the zones of ecological  disaster and unfavorability.    Aside from these ecological dangers which are mentioned and  discussed with relative frequency, it is very important for us  to evaluate also an entire series of other, nontraditional,  ones. Among them are: The ecological risk of depletion and  plunder of plant and animal natural resources; The loss of  wetlands, including swamps, and the effect of super-low doses of  pollutants. Moreover, we must also evaluate the ecological risks  associated with the large-scale development of space, foreign  economic activity, privatization and the development of nonstate  forms of ownership, the loss of soil fertility, the decline in  recrational capacity of the territories, etc.    Correspondent: The MVK deals primarily with our,  Russian, problems. Yet ecological catastrophes know no  boundaries...    Yablokov: We are also entering onto the global  level. We need an objective evaluation of the ecological risk to  Russia associated with the global change in climate, the  depletion of the ozone layer, and the loss of biological  diversity.    Correspondent: Tell us about the MVK's plans of  work for the near future... You said that you would like to and  are planning to review one major problematic and one more  specific question at monthly meetings of the MVK...    Yablokov: Since the review of major problems  requires serious preparation, at the first regular meeting we  are proposing to introduce the question of ecological  consequences of accidents and catastrophes, which has already  been worked out in detail. Many of the commission members  participated in the review of this question by the Council on  Ecological Policy under the President of Russia. At that time,  after analysis of numerous departmental materials, it was  decided that this question deserves review by the Council on  Security.    There are also plans to review in the MVK such major  problems  as the threat to national security posed by radioactive  contamination of Russia and the threat to national security  associated with the loss of soil fertility, which is  catastrophic in its scope.    Correspondent: Who will prepare these questions  for discussion in the MVK?    Yablokov: The second of these two questions will  be prepared by Roskomzem. The foundation for serious review of  the first has long ago been laid by the draft of the State  Program for Radioactive Waste Management.    Before the end of the year, the MVK intends to analyze the  situation with the sunken nuclear submarine  ``Komsomolets''--based on data collected in August by a special  expedition. And also to review the course of preparation of the  section on ecological security in the report on national  security presented by the President of Russia.    Correspondent: The MVK is in a period of  formulation, and, like any new formation, it probably has its  difficulties. What are they? Or is the MVK an exception to the  rule in today's Russian reality, since both extra-class  specialists and those who previously worked together on many  problems have gathered here?    Yablokov: There are, of course, several  organizational problems which demand urgent solution. And the  first of these is obtaining current day-to-day and analytical  information on ecological security. This problem may be solved  with the aid of the available systems of information existing  within the State Committee on Emergency Situations, Rosgidromet,  Gossanepidnadzor, Gosgortekhnadzor [Russian Federal Mining and  Industrial Oversight], Gosatomnadzor and a number of other  departments and ministries.    The GKChS already today presents daily summaries to the  agencies of state administration, while Rosgidromet issues  monthly and quarterly reports. And if all the inspections and  Rosgidromet began presenting brief ecological summaries to the  MVK on a weekly basis, Minpriroda and the MBR [Russian  Federation Ministry of Security]--on a monthly basis, and the  Ministry of Defense, the Foreign Intelligence Service and the  MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] and the territorial  administrations--on a quarterly basis, then using these  materials and an analysis of the reports of the mass media, the  MVK associates could present brief monthly reports to the  Council on Security Secretariat and to all the members of the  MVK. And they could also formulate a section on ecological  security for the president's annual report on national security.    With the organizational help of the Council on Security  Secretariat, it will be possible to obtain a thorough analysis  of the reports issued by the mass media. Perhaps we should make  use of the appropriate experience of analytical services in the  USA--and ask the CIA about this directly...    Correspondent: It is very important to inform the  community in a timely manner about the work of your commission.  According to the law, all ecological information must be  accessible to the public.    Yablokov: But, on the other hand, this situation  enters into some contradiction with certain limitations stemming  from the demands of work by the Council on Security, as well as  of national security in general. Perhaps the discussion of some  questions will be open, and of some--closed. In any case, we  will strive to give the press the maximum amount of information.  Of course, it is necessary for the mass media workers themselves  to understand the vital importance of ecological questions.  Unfortunately, for the time being, with rare exceptions, this  topic is put in last place.    As for internal organizational problems, they do exist, but  we are effectively resolving them.    In general, we would like the MVK to work with maximal  productivity, so that as a result of each meeting, drafts of  Council on Security decisions, edicts and directives of the  President of Russia, and recommendations to the federal and  regional agencies of state administration would emerge.</p>

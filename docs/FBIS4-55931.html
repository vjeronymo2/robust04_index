			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 20 -- Deputy Defence minister  responsible for parliamentary affairs Danuta Waniek said in an  exclusive interview for PAP on Friday that she plans to give a  "new shape" to the relations between the ministry and the Sejm  and Senate.    She is going to establish a parliamentary office within the  ministry that will draft laws necessary for the restructuring of  the Polish Army. Waniek said she had already submitted her  conception which is now being examined by the general staff.    Asked about the possibility to increase the role of women in  the army, Waniek expressed the opinion that as soon as the  Polish defence is built on professional army, the army will open  to women in line with the constitutional principle of equal  rights, "like in the United States," she said.    Referring to the question of civilian control over the army,  Mrs. Waniek said that the control is in the hand of "the one who  decides about the money," that is, the Sejm. Waniek also  stressed that she did not suspend her membership in the Social  Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP). "Let the people  know whom they have to do with" she said.</p>

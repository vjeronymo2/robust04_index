			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "US must adjust to new realities in Asia"] </F>   [Text] On the heels of Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's quietly humiliating trip to Peking, the United  States was dealt another blow to its prestige when assistant  secretary of state Robin Raphel spent several days in New Delhi  late last month. The political dynamics of that visit bear  study and shed light on emerging new realities in Asia.    On Mr Christopher's fiasco of diplomatic mission to assert  US  might on behalf of jailed Chinese dissidents, Paula R. Newberg  of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace put it perhaps  the most kindly: "The China debacle exemplifies the difficulties  of discussing rights issues with rights violators," she wrote.  Ms Raphel's visit to Delhi was characterised by much forced  jocularity on her part, and a field day fo India's lively,  nationalistic Press. Kanchan Gupta of THE PIONEER newspaper  chided Home Minister S.B. Chavan for "warmly greeting" Raphel,  thereby "mortgaging our foreign policy to the quirks of  political novices like Ms Raphel who would have been pushing  files in anonymous offices had it not been for Mr Bill Clinton  coming to power in the US."    The state of relations was well illustrated by a brief  incident caught by the camera of THE ASIAN AGE, whose photo  caption read: "Joint secretary Hardeep Puri, in best diplomatic  demeanour, welcomes a cheery Robin Raphel at his office in South  Block on Wednesday morning. Keen observers noted that he  quickly camouflaged a wince as Ms Raphel took her fellow  bureaucrat by the arm."    The matter of Kashmir -- the main topic on Ms Raphel's  agenda  -- is complex, and India is far from blameless. But the Indian  Government has shown itself healthily disdainful of US  protestations and machinations in the now-hackneyed "wake of the  Cold War". The US must learn -- surely is learning, and quickly  -- that it can no longer follow the dictum of former president  Theodore Roosevelt by speaking softly and carrying a big stick.  That reality is an ugly one: The US has been an important force  for human rights as well as a major political and economic  player in the world for some decades now. As long as America  was a leading factor in the world economy, governments with  which it has done business have had at least to pay lip service  to democracy and human rights.    This is amply evident in the Clinton administration's  diplomatic soft-shoe over Most Favoured Nation trading status  for China. But with the Cold War yielding to multipolar entropy  and the impending economic rise of Asia (especially China), this  too will change. The failure of Soviet communism and the  apparent decline in America's ability to live by its founding  ideals have left the moral foundation of global politics  dangerously weak. Brute power is becoming more decisive than  ever both inside and among countries.    Much concern has lately been expressed over alleged human  rights abuses by Indian armed forces in Kashmir. No doubt there  is some, perhaps much, truth in the allegations made. Yet  analyst Ajit Bhattacharjea in the India newspaper THE PIONEER  makes a very good and welcome point when he writes: "The lesson  to be learnt is that foreign pressure enables the Government to  justify its policies, not to modify them. In the last analysis,  the human rights of Kashmiris, as of every one else in this  country, can be secured only by ourselves."    Mr Bhattacharjea's point is mature beyond almost anything  else written or said by journalists or politicians anywhere.  His extremely apt point is that if we, the citizens of a  country -- say, Thailand -- believe human rights are important,  then we, the citizens must insist on them. We must hold our  government and our elected leaders accountable, constantly and  rigorously. "The fact is," writes Mr Bhattacharjea "that civil  rights, in this country or in China, or anywhere else, cannot be  sustained by Washington. but only by the pressure of domestic  opinion."    The question then becomes: Do we want civil rights? Do we  want a democratic, accountable government? Do we want to know  what is happening to our water supply, and the traffic on our  city streets, and our villages, and our rivers? If so, we must  rely on ourselves, as individuals and as organised groups of  citizens. We cannot rely on the US. To quote Mr Bhattacharjea  yet again: "There is much in the US record ... to show that  human rights have been regarded as negotiable in exchange for  strategic and economic facilities." In any case, in today's  world the US doesn't seem to be the "superpower with clout" it  used to be. Just ask Warren Christopher or Robin Raphel.</p>

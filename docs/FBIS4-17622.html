			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrei Petrovsky, Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] The leader of the Tajik opposition Akbar Turajonzoda  believes that the government of Tajikistan is unable to remain  in power without Russian military or economic support for even  three days. In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX he stressed  that if Russia wished, the civil war in Tajikistan could be  stopped in a month.    He did not rule out the possibility that the opposition  might  exert military pressure on Dushanbe to speed up the inter-Tajik  talks. According to Turajonzoda, this was told to the Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Albert Chernyshev.    He said Moscow on which the future of the country largely  depends underestimates the opposition. "We do not want war or  bloodshed, though we are quite strong even in Dushanbe," he said.    In the opinion of Turajonzoda to prevent the inter-Tajik  dialogue from following the pattern of the Georgian-Abkhaz talks  the Kulyab clan that controls all key posts in the cabinet  should be invited to it.    He said Tajikistan should be a democratic secular state with  the church separated from the state. According to Turajonzoda,  the opposition does not intend to build an Islamic state because  "we shall soon be entering the 21st century." He thinks Muslim  traditions can be revived only with public will through  referendums. "Even if we come to power through elections, we are  not going to change fundamental constitutional norms, such as  the freedom of the press and the functioning of parties," he  said.    The chief of the information department of the Tajik Foreign  Ministry Zafar Saidov told INTERFAX that Dushanbe is aware of  "plans of hostile actions" made by the irreconcilable wing of  the armed opposition in the border zone. "Their purpose is to  destabilize the situation in the country by escalating armed  confrontation on the frontier," he said.    Quoting reliable sources Saidov claimed that military  advisors and instructors from several foreign countries have  come to border areas of Afghanistan to help the Tajik armed  opposition.    The Tajik Foreign Ministry is also aware of the  concentration  of armed groups of the Islamic Renaissance Party in the  immediate vicinity of the border across the Pyandzh section.  According to Saidov, the ministry has reliable information  about Afghan military commanders helping Tajik opposition groups  carry out their hostile plans.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: GWR jumps to Pounds 930,000 GWR, now the UK's second largest commercial radio group, is pressing for the abolition of the present limit on the number of licences an operator can hold. The company - which yesterday announced a big jump in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 317,000 to Pounds 930,000 - already holds 20 licences - the maximum permitted. Under existing rules a radio company can no longer expand if it has more than 15 per cent of commercial radio as defined by a points system or more than 20 licences. The Radio Authority, the industry regulatory body, has also told the government that it wants to see the licence ceiling abandoned. Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said after the current government review of cross-media ownership rules was completed and the recommendations published it 'should enable the group to continue expanding its portfolio of wholly owned stations in the UK.' GWR has now added radio stations in East Anglia to its main base in the south of England and the Midlands stations acquired in January. The USM-quoted group is raising the interim dividend to 5.5p (4p). The result primarily reflects a good performance by GWR South where both national and local advertising revenues showed growth of 31 per cent. Group turnover expanded from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 7.8m with the Midlands stations contributing Pounds 2.2m. Earnings per share were 14.1p (6.8p).</p>

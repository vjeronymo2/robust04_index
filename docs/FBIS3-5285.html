			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 7 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata warned of stern countermeasures Sunday if North  Korea refuses further nuclear inspections or tries to abuse its  nuclear bargaining card.    He said he had heard of various ways that North Koreans in  Japan were funneling cash into North Korea, but to forcibly cut  off such channels could raise the issue of human rights  violations and thus required prudent consideration, he said.    Hata described various suspicions regarding Pyongyang's  nuclear program in an appearance on Fuji TV, including  speculation that it is manufacturing weapons or has already done  so and that it possesses the same type of atomic bomb that was  dropped on Hiroshima by the United States.    Japan is ready to make its own assessment of North Korea's  nuclear development based on inspections conducted by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and information  obtained from the United States, South Korea and China, he said.    North Korea still has two facilities that haven't been  inspected, the foreign minister reminded. Depending on its  future attitude, U.N. sanctions could be imposed, he said.    On reports that money sent by Chochongnyon [General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan], an organization of  ethnic North Koreans and sympathizers, is being poured into  Pyongyang's nuclear program, Hata said he had heard figures  ranging from tens of million Japanese yen to hundreds of million  yen.    The money is reportedly carried personally by people  returning to North Korea, aboard freight vessels or through Hong  Kong and China, said Hata.    But such funds are being sent by those who were born in  North  Korea and think of it as their motherland, he pointed out.    Forcibly cutting off the flow, therefore, could raise the  problem of human rights violations, he said.</p>

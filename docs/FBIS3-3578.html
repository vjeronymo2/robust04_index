The  meeting called on CPPCC members and organizations, all  democratic parties, mass organizations, and people of all  nationalities across the province to unite closely around the  Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, seize  the opportunity, unite as one in all sincerity, share weal and  woe, brace up, exert efforts to reinvigorate Yunnan and fulfill  the historical tasks in the new historical period full of  confidence under the leadership of the provincial party  committee! [passage omitted]    Provincial CPPCC Chairman Liu Fusheng presided over the  closing ceremonies. [passage omitted]    Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu delivered an  important speech at the meeting. He said: The current meeting  has been most successful. CPPCC members have given play to  democracy, pooled their wisdom, and offered many good opinions  and proposals that have a bearing on the overall situation.  This shows the province's CPPCC members have made progress in  grasping and discussing state affairs and doing substantial  work, and democratic parties, mass organizations, and CPPCC  members have played an increasingly important role in the  scientific and democratic decisionmaking of the provincial party  committee and government.    Pu Chaozhu said: Facts show that Yunnan's CPPCC work has  realized pleasing conversion in three aspects, namely: In  participating in government and discussing state affairs, CPPCC  members have changed from grasping directly perceived and  partial issues to grasping major events and state affairs; they  have changed from giving play to the individual's role in  participating in government and discussing state affairs to  giving play to the collective roles of democratic parties; and  changed from their proposals being loosely connected with  practical work to direct, good, proposals.    Pu Chaozhu dealt with understanding in the current  situation,  readjustment of the industrial setup, Yunnan's economic  development, further giving play to the roles of the CPPCC and  united front, and further augmenting and improving party  leadership in CPPCC work.

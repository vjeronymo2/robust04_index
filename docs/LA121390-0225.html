			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFITS UP BUT LAYOFFS SEEN AT AIRCRAFT FIRMS  </P> <P> Aerospace industry sales, profits and exports were at record levels in 1990,  paced by a strong commercial aircraft sector, the Aerospace Industries Assn.  reported Wednesday. But the sales of $131 billion represented a drop of 3.6% on  an inflation-adjusted basis.  </P> <P> Employment dropped 5% to 1.27 million in 1990 and is expected to drop an  additional 2% next year, the trade group said. Separately, McDonnell Douglas  said Wednesday that it may cut another 2,000 jobs at its Douglas Aircraft unit  in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Aerospace industry exports have surged this year to $37 billion, a 14% increase  over last year. Imports were up to a record $11 billion, but the overall trade  surplus in aerospace reached a milestone $26 billion in 1990.  </P> <P> The outlook for 1991 is for total sales of $133 billion, marking another 3.6%  decline in inflation-adjusted sales. Although commercial aircraft shipments  will rise, sales of missiles and military aircraft will slump.  </P> <P> Employment will drop another 2%, according to the industry, a decline of 25,000  nationally.  </P> <P> Douglas Aircraft President Robert Hood said Wednesday that the company is  currently laying out a business plan for 1991 and may elect to cut another  2,000 jobs, though such plans have not been finalized yet.  </P> <P> If the firm does eliminate those jobs, the cuts would be handled through  attrition and not layoffs, Hood said. Attrition runs about 6% of its work  force, Hood said, meaning the company would expect about 2,400 of its 40,000  employees to voluntarily leave next year.  </P></p>

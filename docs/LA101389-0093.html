			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW A MERE HUMANIST WON THE WORLD SERIES POOL  </P> <P> Last year I, a mere humanist, won the World Series pool at the Center for  Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford. Since the World Series  once again approaches, I thought I would share the reflections behind my  stunning accuracy in picking the Dodgers to win the series, and then predicting  within three the total number of runs scored. (I said 35. The actual total was  32.)  </P> <P> My reasoning went something like this. It was obvious that Oakland should win  last year -- so obvious, in fact, that everyone was likely to pick Oakland.  Given this, the winner of the pool would be the person who came closest to  predicting the total number of runs scored.  </P> <P> Since I had no better idea how many runs would be scored than anyone else, the  chances of my winning with such a strategy seemed slim. So even if I had little  chance of winning by picking the Dodgers, I decided that I had a better chance  of winning by picking them instead of the almost-certain winner, the Athletics.  </P> <P> This was the first stage of my reflections. I then realized that I was  surrounded by very intelligent colleagues, many of whom knew neat things about  probability theory, statistical analysis, meta-theoretic strategies for  decision under uncertainty and heaven knows what else.  </P> <P> These very intelligent colleagues would obviously reason just as I did, with  the result that everyone would pick the Dodgers.  </P> <P> I decided to fool them by picking Oakland after all.  </P> <P> Then I realized that my very intelligent colleagues would see this, too,  reverse their positions, and everyone would go back to betting on Oakland.  Could I fool them by reversing my position one further time and betting on the  Dodgers? Not a chance.  </P> <P> I came to the conclusion that there was no rational way to pick which team to  bet on. The deciding factor was that I grew up near New York City and was a  Brooklyn Dodger fan as a kid.  </P> <P> Now, about the aggregate number of runs: Having chosen the Dodgers, it seemed  to me that they could win onlyin a low-scoring series. So I staked out the  bottom end of the scale with a ridiculously low number. As it turned out, it  was not as ridiculous as the actual number.  </P> <P> After making my bet, I saw that my reasoning was deeply dumb. Even if the  Dodgers won four low-scoring games, there was a good chance the Athletics could  win up to three high-scoring games.  </P> <P> What I should have done was look up the total runs scored in the Dodgers/Mets  playoffs and then tack on a few extra runs because the Athletics are a somewhat  better-scoring team than the Mets. Those few at the center who picked the  Dodgers in the pool seemed to have adopted this plausible strategy -- with the  result that they lost and I won.  </P> <P> I won the World Series pool the way the Dodgers won the World Series: for no  apparent reason.  </P> <P> For those who are about to place a wager in a Giants-Athletics World Series  pool, I suggest that you follow your instincts and put your faith in Pascal's  thought: "The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of."  </P></p>

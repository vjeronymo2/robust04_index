			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>   [Excerpt] Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino would  like to visit Israel soon in order to settle matters in the wake  of the appointment of three neofascist ministers to Silvio  Berlusconi's new government. The new government has yet to  receive Israel's blessing. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin  is demanding that Israel cool its ties with Italy in the wake of  the appointments. Italy's Jewish community is opposed to such a  move. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports on  the controversy:    [Begin recording] [Rosen] Today the world should hear  Israel loud and clear, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said.  He suggests taking resolute steps toward chillier relations  with Italy following the appointment of neofascist ministers to  the Berlusconi cabinet.    Israel did not applaud Italy's political upheaval, and Rabin  has deliberately refrained from congratulating the new prime  minister. Beilin has already ordered a freeze on the departure  of a delegation to a cultural conference.    [Beilin] Obviously, we cannot take a light view of this. It  is the first time a party with neofascist elements is  participating in a European government.    [Rosen] Beilin's adamant position is opposed by many Italian  Jews, as well as members of the professional Foreign Ministry  echelons who believe Israel should wait and judge the neofascist  ministers on the basis of their actions and pronouncements as of  now.

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi criticised by South African President de Klerk Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi (above) was yesterday criticised by South African President F W de Klerk for his plan to create a multi-racial autonomous state in Natal province, Patti Waldmeir writes from Johannesburg. Mr de Klerk said the plan would exacerbate township violence and impede the resumption of multi-party democracy talks. On Tuesday Chief Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, said he would hold a referendum to test popular support for merging the Zulu homeland he heads with white-run Natal province. His insistence that he would go ahead with the plan even without multi-party approval was seen as a veiled threat to declare unilateral independence from Pretoria unless Natal is granted autonomy within a federal South Africa.</p>

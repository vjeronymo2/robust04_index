			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weak yen and slide in New York push Nikkei lower SHARE prices declined in low volume yesterday, as sentiment was depressed by Friday's drop on Wall Street and the yen's weakness against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 181.09 lower at 26,093.20 after a day's high of 26,338.49 and a low of 26,092.22. Volume shrank to 230m shares from Friday's 340m. Activity has remained under 400m shares for 15 consecutive sessions, while the Nikkei has traded around 26,000 for 35 trading days in a row. Falls outnumbered rises by 658 to 279, with 177 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 13.37 to 1,977.78, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 2.62 to 1,474.57. Rumours that the Ministry of Finance had warned a leading Japanese brokerage concern that it was trading too heavily in the over-the-counter market depressed sentiment on the smaller sections. The second section index lost 23.32 to 3,400.13 and the OTC index fell 106.12 to 3,126.13. Traders said institutions were likely to remain on the sidelines as long as the Nikkei stayed around 26,000, and ahead of some company results to be announced in the next few weeks. The electrical sector weakened on reports that Pioneer Electronic had revised its earnings projections downward and now expected a 21 per cent profits fall. Pioneer dropped Y630 to Y4,370, Sony Y180 to Y6,080 and TDK Y140 to Y5,520. The real estate sector fell 0.8 per cent on news of weak condominium sales announced over the weekend. Mitsubishi Estate shed Y20 to Y1,500. Contractors were also weak, Taisei slipping Y24 to Y975 and Haseko Y14 to Y906. Daifuku, an industrial machinery maker, rose initially on recommendations by Japanese brokerages based on strong sales of the company's automated warehouses and storage systems. The issue touched a 1991 high, but later receded on profit-taking to end a net Y10 off at Y2,850. Investment trusts sold drug issues. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, which expects its pre-tax profits to rise only 2 per cent, retreated Y60 to Y2,730. Tosoh, a chemical group, rose Y27 to Y646. The company expects pre-tax profits to rise 57 per cent to Y11bn thanks to strong earnings at Shin-Daikyowa Petrochemical, which Tosoh acquired last October. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 167.54 to 29,062.87 on volume of 23.2m shares. Osaka Sanso Kogyo, an industrial gas maker, declined Y10 to Y665 on weak earnings for the current year due to rising labour and distribution costs. Yamato International, a fashion wear wholesaler, rose Y20 to Y1,200. Strong earnings are expected this year. Roundup ALTHOUGH Hong Kong rose on domestic considerations, most markets in the region fell in sympathy with the Wall Street slide last Friday. AUSTRALIA in addition showed nervousness ahead of tomorrow's inflation report for the March quarter, and results from Westpac and National Australia Bank due on Thursday. The All Ordinaries index weakened 25.2 to 1,523.1 but turnover expanded from ADollars 231m to ADollars 270m. BHP, Australia's biggest company, went ex a 21-cent dividend and fell a net 29 cents to ADollars 12.15 in heavy volume. CRA closed 25 cents lower at ADollars 12.90 after lifting its takeover offer for Coal and Allied Industries from ADollars 7.85 to ADollars 8.50 a share. The latter put on 4 cents to ADollars 8.60. NEW ZEALAND broke its winning streak as the Barclays index relinquished 35.53 or 2.3 per cent to 1,538.21 as turnover climbed from NZDollars 19.1m to NZDollars 27.7m. Fletcher Challenge fell 24 cents to NZDollars 3.90 on 1.5m shares traded, in line with the issue price for 50m shares placed over the weekend with international institutions. A further 25m new shares might be issued, to raise a total of NZDollars 292.5m. BNZ went against the trend, firming a cent to 76 cents after Mr Jim Bolger, New Zealand's prime minister, rejected repeated speculation that the government is planning to sell its 58.2 per cent stake in the bank. Fay, Richwhite, which owns 26.2 per cent of BNZ, closed steady at 72 cents. SINGAPORE lost almost 1 per cent, the Straits Times Industrial index closing 14.93 off at 1,517.39 in thin trade. TAIWAN's weighted index fell 106.39 or 1.7 per cent to 6,102.09 on news that Fuh Hwa Securities Finance was tightening its margin lending to stock market players. Traders said some 30 per cent of daily turnover came from Fuh Hwa's margin lending. BANGKOK complained of lack of drive, and money being drawn out of the market to subscribe for planned new issues. The SET index finished 17.72 or 2.1 per cent lower at 828.16 after thin turnover worth 2.85bn baht. The four new highly priced issues which made their debut last Friday were heavily sold for a second day. Siam Chemicals fell 14 baht to 134 baht and Eastern Wire, a construction wire producer, declined 11 to 106 baht. HONG KONG rose on weekend news that Sino-British talks on the large-scale local airport project will resume this weekend. The Hang Seng index put on 17.43 to 3,767.63, although turnover fell from HKDollars 1.31bn to HKDollars 1.06bn.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Channel rail link contract Sir, I am writing to set the record straight over the article 'German bid invited for Channel rail link contract' (August 11). The Department of Transport has not invited Hochtief, or indeed anyone else, to form a consortium or to bid for such a contract. We sent a copy of our consultation paper to Hochtief and a great many other organisations, mainly in the UK but also a few abroad, in view of the scale of the project; but that is all. Ministers are now considering the results of the consultation exercise. Initial independent advice came from Samuel Montagu, and Hill Samuel will provide further advice before any decisions are taken. We shall announce in due course our consultations; only after that will there be any question of inviting bids for the project. Caithness, minister for aviation and shipping, Department of Transport, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 3EB</p>

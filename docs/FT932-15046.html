			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Woolworths plans ADollars 2bn flotation INDUSTRIAL Equity, formerly part of Mr John Spalvins failed Adelaide Steamship group, yesterday announced a second attempt to float its Woolworths supermarket chain on the Australian stock exchange. Woolworths is expected to raise up to ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.43m) if the offer goes ahead, which would make it Australia's biggest flotation. IEL abandoned its first attempt in the face of market jitters last year. IEL said the flotation would proceed unless there was 'a serious deterioration in the market which significantly reduces the price obtainable for Woolworths relative to its earnings and value'. The Australian market has rallied since the last attempted flotation was abandoned in September. The ASX All Ordinaries index closed at a three-year high of 1704.4 after the announcement. IEL said the prospectus would be ready by June, but the exact timing would depend on market conditions. It said the offer would be made via a book building process under which institutional investors would be invited to apply for shares within a nominated price range. The offer will not be underwritten. Woolworths, which made an operating profit of ADollars 247m last year, is the biggest asset remaining in the Adsteam group, which has been controlled by its bankers since Mr Spalvins was fired by the board two years ago. IEL is jointly owned by Adelaide Steamship, David Jones and Tooth, the group's three main companies. IEL has already spun off its National Foods subsidiary as part of the financial restructuring of Adsteam, which has debts of about ADollars 6bn. IEL reported an improvement in net profit to ADollars 79m last year from ADollars 27m in the previous year, compared with substantial losses incurred by its parent companies. It said the improvement would have been larger but for the ADollars 19m cost of deferring the flotation of Woolworths. The Woolworths flotation is expected to be followed over the next 12 months by the privatisation of the government's remaining 75 per cent stake in Qantas, the sale of a further 19 per cent of the government-controlled Commonwealth Bank, and the flotation of the Channel Seven television network.</p>

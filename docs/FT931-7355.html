			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / New round of MSA talks opens in Geneva TRADE officials from about 30 countries yesterday began a fresh effort to reach a Multilateral Steel Agreement to eliminate import barriers and scrap most subsidies to the industry, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. The two-day meeting will take stock of positions nearly a year after negotiations broke down last March. Neither the US nor the EC is ready to start striking bargains over the main issues in contention: allowable subsidies and US recourse to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy action. The Clinton administration has yet to issue policy instructions to US negotiators, while the EC is largely preoccupied with the crisis in its own steel industry. The two sides plan bilateral consultations tomorrow over the recent US imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on steel imports from the EC and elsewhere. This marks the first step on the road to establishment of an independent disputes panel under Gatt.</p>

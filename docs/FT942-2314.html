			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Opec ministers trade frowns for smiles as oil prices rally: Production ceilings have played their part Fresh optimism that short-term oil prices are on their way up was clearly reflected in the smiles and jaunty steps of oil ministers at last week's meeting in Vienna of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Gone were the tense negotiations and mutual recriminations that accompanied abortive attempts last November and March to prop up collapsing prices. They were replaced by satisfaction with the present strategy of maintaining Opec's production ceiling at 24.52m barrels a day until the end of the year, and perhaps even beyond. Last week's price rally, which saw the benchmark Brent blend reach Dollars 17 a barrel, more than Dollars 4 above February's five-year low, may have had little to do with the ministers' decision to re-confirm their adherence to the ceiling. The news from Korea and supply bottlenecks in the fast growing US market were more important factors. But ministers, and most independent analysts, believe Opec's present course should help to underpin prices as long as the strong pace of US economic growth is maintained. One Gulf Arab delegate last week thought prices could rise by another Dollars 3-Dollars 4 by year-end. Many analysts still expect some short-term price volatility, in part because of the presence of hedge funds. Most would agree, however, with Mr Vahan Zanoyan, an analyst with the Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company, who says 'all market sensitivities are on the up side'. The Centre for Global Energy Studies in London believes 'prices could rise steeply towards the end of the year if Opec continues to restrain output' in the face of sharply rising demand. It recently warned that sudden price rises were possible because stocks held by oil companies are likely to fall sharply by the fourth quarter. Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris believes the inventory strategies of companies in the second and third quarters will play 'a key role in avoiding strong upward price movement later in the year'. Oil companies will obviously welcome the stronger cash flows which higher prices bring. But few are likely to drop their caution over longer-term prices. And there is little likelihood of a new wave of investment in the North Sea or elsewhere. The link between prices and investment is changing, according to Ms Jo Armstrong, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. She says recent price fluctuations have caused companies to focus on factors which are within their control, such as cost cutting, when reviewing individual projects. 'Companies try to identify the break-even price of oil for a project,' and a judgement is then made as to 'whether or not such a price level is likely within the critical time frame', she says. It also makes companies less reliant on future Opec actions for their profits. In spite of last week's smiles, the outlook for the organisation is not altogether rosy. The presence in Vienna of the Iraqi oil minister for the first time in several years was a reminder that Opec has yet to face what could be its biggest test: the need, perhaps early next year, to re-integrate Iraq, one of its biggest exporters, without causing prices to crash.</p>

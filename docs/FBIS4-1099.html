			<p>BFN     [Text] The Malian Government and the Unified Movements and  Fronts of Azaouad stressed their commitment to implementing the  national pact signed in Bamako in April 1992.    A press statement issued in Tamanrasset yesterday after the  meeting of the follow up committee overseeing implementation of  the pact, said that on the basis of a proposal from the  mediating country, Algeria, the two sides accepted the idea of  setting up two follow up committees which would be in charge of  looking into matters in connection with the military, security,  political, and development aspects of their dispute.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Management: One step ahead of the pack - How T&amp;N handles R&amp;D spending A country mansion in Warwickshire might seem an unlikely setting for some timely good news about British manufacturing. But Cawston House, the base of T&amp;N Technology, is a world away from the sort of isolated rural establishment once so beloved of UK corporate research and development departments. This utilitarian, market-driven unit has been central to T&amp;N's successful drive for a growing share of the global motor component business. Technological innovation is especially vital to T&amp;N's competitiveness because the company specialises in components which are critical to a vehicle manufacturer's ability to make changes in the design of its engines and braking systems. 'Our customers insist on suppliers having a particular level of R&amp;D activity and technical reputation, before they even allow them to bid for contracts,' says Bill Everitt, the T&amp;N board director responsible for technology. But it is not so much the level of this spend - examined on this page last Friday - as its effectiveness that has helped T&amp;N buck the miserable competitive trend suffered by manufacturers in so many British industries. But why does T&amp;N do a sizeable part of its R&amp;D centrally, rather than making each of its three divisions, or the 11 product groups beneath them, responsible for all their own R&amp;D? Everitt replies unequivocally: 'Because it's more efficient and productive to do it that way in terms of people, knowledge, skills, equipment and - most important - speed.' Unlike many other companies which claim spurious internal synergy, T&amp;N's product groups really do share technology. They need similar or identical expertise in materials, design processes, manufacturing techniques and measurement processes - all of which are moving fast but expensively, thanks to the quest for lighter, cheaper and reliable products. In materials surface technology, for instance, 'virtually all our products move against something else - they mate with it', says Alec Parker, managing director of T&amp;N Technology. 'So we can read our advancing knowledge about materials, lubrication and so forth across the various businesses.' Together with the 15 per cent of Cawston's current Pounds 7m annual spend which goes on research, this work on what T&amp;N calls 'enabling technologies' generates about 60 patents a year. The rest of T&amp;N's Pounds 34m R&amp;D spend goes on applications engineering, testing and other activities in the businesses. The close commercial relevance of Cawston's work is guaranteed by a series of mechanisms. First, virtually all the work is funded on an individual project basis by the product groups around Britain and the rest of the world, rather than by T&amp;N's head office. Second is the method of project selection. Each project is determined in detail at an annual meeting by a mixture of specific input from a product group's sales engineers and managing director and Cawston's knowledge of market trends, gained via its direct meetings with leading T&amp;N customers. The third mechanism is detailed project control. The basic document for this is a one-page 'why sheet' on which the first item gives the commercial 'why?' of the project. Technical objectives and quantified target benefits are also summarised, together with costs, responsibilities and a timescale for checking the project's progress throughout the year. Contact between Cawston and the product groups is more or less constant. Small teams from each group are always visiting Cawston, which is also used as a training ground for engineers to move into the businesses. Although some of the projects are scheduled to last two to three years, they are not just reviewed in detail each quarter, but re-justified every year. Parker touches on every general manager's nightmare about R&amp;D when he says: 'We dislike projects which go on forever with no conclusion.' Everitt puts it more forcefully: 'Alec's people have to do their work within the timescale and cost that they said they would.' This control process was in operation six years ago in some of the group's businesses, 'but not all of them believed in the quarterly business reviews', says Everitt. 'It's been a question of persuading everyone to do it.' On the productivity of development work, T&amp;N's main measure is 'the rate per unit cost at which new products, processes and services are generated that enhance the prospects of the company relative to the competition'. These loose bones are given somewhat firmer flesh every year by a detailed analysis of the rate and cost of innovation, broken into different types of project. Cost-benefit analyses of Cawston's work are done frequently, and generally show a return of about twice the expenditure on it. Controversially, however, full investment analysis on individual projects is done rarely. Everitt says there is little point in doing so, since discounted cash-flow analyses are so prone to error, depending on the subjective assumptions that are fed into it. Of payback calculations, he says, 'we don't believe the numbers'. Instead T&amp;N takes what he calls 'a judgmental view' of the likely benefit to the customer. This reflects acute awareness throughout T&amp;N of a principle which many UK manufacturers used to ignore, at the expense of much necessary investment: that a heavy 'opportunity cost' can be incurred by not going ahead with a particular project. In addition to losing a particular sale and valuable market share, the company may harm its hard-won innovative reputation with an important customer, says Everitt. 'A lot of all this is to do with creating technical reputation and the ability to collapse lead time,' he continues. 'It's the opportunity cost of staying in business.' A final article will examine the impact of R&amp;D on one of T&amp;N's operating companies.</p>

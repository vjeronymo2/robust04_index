Situated in the northwest part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,  the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province is one of China's four  inland basins, and its deposits of sodium, potassium, magnesium,  lithium and bromine rank first in the country.    Jin Wanfu, chief engineer of the Geological and Mining  Bureau, said the strontium deposit added greatly to the value of  the basin.    He said that the strontium deposit found in the basin  amounts  to more than 18 million tons.    He said that the deposit is near the surface and easy to  extract.    Strontium is one of the materials for making electronic  video  tubes and strontium products are in strong demand at home and  abroad.    Qinghai Province has now set up a national strontium salt  production association to coordinate the processing of strontium  products in the country.    Geologists have also discovered a 1,100-square-kilometer  lake  containing strontium. About 20 million cubic meters of the  water can be made use of annually .</p>

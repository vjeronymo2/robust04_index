			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Used car sales surge by 19.8% LAST month's unexpectedly strong surge in sales of new cars was more than matched in the market for used cars, providing a further indication that the recovery is gaining pace. The number of used cars bought on credit - the industry's main means of tracking the used sector - jumped by 19.8 per cent to 86,955 in August compared with the same month a year ago, according to statistics from HPI, the vehicle credit monitoring organisation. This rise compares with nearly 18 per cent for new cars, and brings the increase in credit sales of used cars in the first eight months of the year to 668,146 - 10.8 per cent above the equivalent 1992 period. Hopes that the severely-depressed light commercial vehicle sector may soon start to revive were boosted by HPI statistics showing that credit sales of used light commercial vehicles were also up sharply, by 17.1 per cent to 24,712 in August. However, for the first eight months as a whole they were down 9 per cent.</p>

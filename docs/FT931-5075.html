			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Textiles One of the clearest beneficiaries of sterling's devaluation has been the UK's threadbare textiles industry. Having long been worn down by the heavy pound, the industry's competitive outlook was transformed by Black Wednesday. The market has been quick to appreciate the benefits. Textile company shares have shot up by 40 per cent since then and stand at a 25 per cent premium to the market. Having moved so far so fast, the textile sector is beginning to slow down. A two-way pull is now developing. It is easy to put together a scenario suggesting there should be further gains as the UK recovery gathers pace. A sustained upturn in consumer demand would allow retailers to pass on imported inflation permitting an easing of pricing pressures on domestic suppliers. Margins would recover even if volumes did not rise that sharply. Higher exports and translation of overseas sales would further flatter earnings. The trouble is that the market is already taking this as read. The four leading textiles companies are trading on fat premiums. They account for almost three-quarters of the sector's Pounds 3.4bn capitalisation with few undervalued second line companies to chase. Overseas earnings may also prove elusive if, as Courtaulds Textiles suggested last week, continental European retailers continue their severe destocking. Investors may be loath to abandon a cyclical sector at this stage in the game but there are few temptations to buy.</p>

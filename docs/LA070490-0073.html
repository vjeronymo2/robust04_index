			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FUTURE HOMEOWNERS WOULD PAY SCHOOL TAX  </P> <P> The governing board of the Palmdale School District, searching for a new source  of funding for school construction, gave preliminary approval Tuesday to a  special tax on future housing in the fast-growing district.  </P> <P> The Palmdale School District Board of Trustees set an Aug. 7 public hearing on  its proposed Mello-Roos tax district, named for the authors of the 1982 state  law that created them.  </P> <P> Under the plan, owners of homes built in the district in the future would pay  $400 to $500 a year to start, and the tax would increase with inflation over  its 30-year life. The starting annual rate for the tax would be 22 cents per  square foot of development. Future condos and apartments also would be taxed.  </P> <P> Although existing homes would be exempt, officials said Palmdale still would be  the first school district in Los Angeles County to impose such a districtwide  tax on future homes.  </P> <P> The tax could raise up to $300 million, about $118 million for new and  refurbished schools and most of the rest for financing costs. The tax is  unusual because developers, who own most of the undeveloped land, can vote on  whether to accept it. But it would be paid by those who buy homes from them.  </P></p>

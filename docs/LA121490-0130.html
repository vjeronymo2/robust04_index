			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS;  </P> <P> TUSTIN, WITHOUT BEILSTEIN, LOSES FIRST GAME OF SEASON  </P> <P> Tustin High School, playing without its top scorer, David Beilstein, lost its  first basketball game of the season Thursday night, falling in the  quarterfinals of the Tournament of Champions at Ocean View High.  </P> <P> Defending champion Long Beach Poly took advantage of Beilstein's absence and  scored a 62-51 victory.  </P> <P> "We didn't execute in the last three minutes and had trouble handling the ball  against their good athletes," Tustin Coach Tom McCluskey said. "They deserved  to win. I don't want to make excuses after a loss like that."  </P> <P> Still, Beilstein's presence likely would have made a difference. Beilstein, who  stayed home with the flu, averages 22 points per game, hits 52% from  three-point range and makes 57% of his two-point shots.  </P> <P> Tustin (5-1), missing Beilstein's ballhandling skills, committed 15 turnovers  in a ragged performance. Still, the Tillers were tied, 50-50, with three  minutes remaining when Poly guard Tyus Edney broke the game open.  </P> <P> Edney, who has signed with UCLA, scored eight of his 20 points in the fourth  last quarter, including six free throws in the final 56 seconds of play. He  also ran a flawless delay game down the stretch that frustrated Tustin.  </P> <P> Forward Yikeem Craddock led Poly (4-1) in the first three quarters, scoring 16  of the Jackrabbits' 41 points and making 8 of 10 shots.  </P> <P> "Yikeem carried us in the first half and Tyus took over in the fourth quarter,"  said Ron Palmer, Long Beach Poly coach.  </P> <P> Tustin's loss left only three undefeated schools in the county -- Estancia,  Irvine and Edison -- after two weeks of play. Poly's victory set up a rematch  with Mater Dei in tonight's semifinals at 8:30.  </P> <P> Poly defeated Mater Dei, 54-47, in the championship game of last year's  tournament, and Mater Dei came back to beat Poly in the Southern California  Division I regional final.  </P> <P> Poly has won the championship of the tournament three times and Mater Dei has  won the title four times in the past 18 years.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos 57, Pasadena 56 -- Forward Keith Boldon made two free throws with  24 seconds remaining to give Los Alamitos (5-3) a three-point lead, then the  Griffins hung on for the victory in the consolation quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Pasadena (2-5) cut the deficit to 57-56 when forward Lydell Hill scored on a  jumper with five second remaining. Boldon finished with 15 points, his best  game since scoring 42 points against University in the Trabuco Hills  Tournament.  </P> <P> "They eliminated us in the CIF (Southern Section) playoffs last year, so this  was a good win for us," Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks said. "Boldon really  gave us a lift tonight."  </P></p>

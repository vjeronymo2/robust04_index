			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> 72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT;  </P> <P> MALATHION IS STILL AN ISSUE, SAYS YUDELSON  </P> <P> Underscoring his campaign image as an activist and an environmentalist,  Democratic Assembly candidate Jerry Yudelson and a group of Hollywood celebrity  supporters sought Sunday to turn Orange County's outrage over malathion  spraying into an election victory on Tuesday.  </P> <P> In Orange County's heaviest malathion spray area, all three candidates seeking  the 72nd Assembly District seat -- including Yudelson's Democratic opponent,  Tom Umberg -- have called for a halt to the aerial spraying. And state  officials said the last scheduled aerial application of the pesticide in Orange  County was completed last week.  </P> <P> But at a noontime rally on a grassy field in Garden Grove that was sprayed just  last Wednesday, Yudelson told a sparse audience of about 40 people that the  issue must be kept alive or state officials will try again to eradicate the  Medfly with helicopter spraying.  </P> <P> "All we need is one more fly to be found and they will be back," he said. "If  you have to go into the streets to protest your own government, I'll be there  with you."  </P> <P> Yudelson, whose wife, Jessica Stuart, is an actress, was joined by celebrities  Gary Busey, Jan Smithers and James Brolin. Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, who  considered running for an Orange County congressional seat this year and is the  subject of the movie "Born on the Fourth of July," also attended.  </P> <P> Umberg, meanwhile, walked door-to-door in Westminster on Sunday as one of  Orange County's most contentious campaigns of the year wound down toward the  election. With just one day left, the two Democrats are competing in a race too  close for experts to predict. The winner will face Assemblyman Curt Pringle  (R-Garden Grove) in the November general election.  </P> <P> The district includes parts of Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Westminster and  Anaheim.  </P> <P> The primary has been dominated by unabashed hostility between the candidates,  which has split the loyalty of county Democrats and worried some that the  contest might damage the party's chances of unseating Pringle. Democrats  consider this seat their best chance in 1990 of breaking the GOP's lock on  Orange County's state assembly seats.  </P></p>

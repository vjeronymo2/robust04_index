Therefore, the People's Army is  firmly defending socialism of our own style at the most acute  confrontation place of the revolution and antirevolution, and  socialism and imperialism, and is vigorously advancing for the  ultimate completion of the fatherland's reunification and the  chuche revolutionary cause.    Even amid the vortex of a complicated and severe situation  as  today, socialism of our own style is firmly standing deep in the  core of the earth, and our party and the people are constructing  socialism and communism with confidence. This is because they  highly upheld the dear comrade leader, who strengthened and  developed the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100  revolutionary force, as the great commander at the helm.    More than anything else, the dear comrade leader provided a  programmatic guideline which must be firmly adhered to and  advanced to strengthen and develop the People's Army into an  ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary force.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il wholly elucidated the  revolutionary essence, basic demand, and method of realizing the  slogan of one-a-match-for-100 which was presented by the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Thus, he clearly clarified the road  to strengthening the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100.    The dear comrade leader regulated that the basis in  strengthening the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100 is to  prepare the soldiers well, and he also regulated that preparing  the soldiers is in essence a political, ideological, military,  technical, and physical preparation.    A soldier is the most important element of military  strength,  and a decisive element of the armed struggle. Weapons are  important in a war but the master using it are through and  through the soldiers. The might of an army and victory or  failure in a war are decided upon not by weapons but by men.  When all soldiers are firmly prepared politically,  ideologically, militarily, technically, and physically, can the  army come to the fore as a group of fighters who move swiftly  and as an ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary force  that has an invincible commander who can cope with one-a-  match-for-100.    The dear comrade leader also modernized the armed equipment  of the People's Army, and elucidated that making the military  camp into an impregnable fortress is a fundamental demand in  implementing the slogan of one-a-match-for-100. The armed  equipment must through and through be developed in a  chuche-oriented way in conformity with the situation of their  country, must be highly modernized, and the military camp must  be maintained into an impregnable fortress.    As such, the dear comrade leader profoundly elucidated the  revolutionary essence, basic demand, and method of realizing the  militant slogan of one-a-match-for-100. Thus, a programmatic  guideline which must be adhered to permanently was provided in  strengthening the militant strength of the People's Army.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also strengthened and  developed the People's Army into an invincible party's army that  is possessed with an absolutely perfect trait of an army of the  leader, army of the party, and army of the people.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: Amid  the arduous trials of the revolution, our People's Army was  trained into an iron-willed rank which is firmly possessed with  the party's unitary ideology system.    Our party's greatest honor and pride is having the People's  Army that resolutely advocates and defends the party and the  leader and that implements to the end the party's order and  instructions even through fire and water.    In accordance with the new high demand of the development of  our revolution and army construction, the dear comrade leader  presented the program of modeling the whole Army after the  chuche idea and intensified the work of establishing the party's  unitary ideology system in the People's Army. With the  presentation of the program of modeling the whole Army after the  chuche idea and by thoroughly implementing it, our revolutionary  force created by the great leader has been strengthened and  developed into an army of the leader forever, and it has been  possible for the People's Army to fulfill its lofty mission of  firmly advocating and defending through arms the ultimate  victory of the chuche cause under the leadership of the dear  comrade leader.    Today, a chuche-oriented leadership system in which the  whole  Army is moving as one person under the party's unitary  leadership firmly stands within the People's Army, all the  soldiers regard the slogan, "What the party decides, we will  do," as their faith, they are willing to sacrifice their youth  and lives if it is for the party and the leader, and they are  living and struggling with the soldier spirit of jumping into  water and fire if it is an order made by the party.    Thus, the party and the Army are linked as one today and  the People's Army has been strengthened and developed into the  ever-victorious invincible army of the party which shares  destiny with the party forever on the single road of revolution.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also strengthened the  military might of the People's Army in every way and thus  fostered our revolutionary armed forces into a unrivaled strong  army.    The dear comrade leader, regarding intensification of combat  training as a basic key to preparing the People's Army to be an  one-match-for-a-100 army, energetically led so that soldiers are  firmly prepared militarily, technically and physically through  such training.    The dear comrade leader put forward the five-point training  policies and training principles, as well as basic demands and  tasks that should be resolved in training, so that combat  training is intensified. He saw to it that all soldiers  thoroughly implement the party's training policy with  chuche-oriented outlook on training and establish the trait of  anti-Japanese guerrilla-style training and that a revolutionary  turn is registered in combat training.    By directing keen attention to the work pertaining to  organization of training, the dear comrade leader had a thorough  comprehension of the real condition in organization of training  within the People's Army and a deep understanding of defects  revealed from this condition. By establishing revolutionary  measures, he saw to it that combat training is conducted in  accordance with characteristics of each military branch and  service and with the degree of soldiers' preparedness. Thus, he  made combat training a course for soldiers to have practical  knowledge useful for actual combat.    With a view to enhancing the qualitative standard of combat  training, the dear comrade leader saw to it that various mass  movements, including the movement to win the red banner of three  revolutions, are carried out in close combination with combat  training. In particular, he led soldiers so that they can better  make military and technical preparations, as well as physical  preparation.    Combat training has been vigorously carried out within the  People's Army under the wise leadership of the dear comrade  leader. As the result, all soldiers came to have smart and  sagacious tactics, master marksmanship and iron-clad physical  strength. Thus, they became reliably prepared as  one-a-match-for-100 fighters capable of smashing any strong  enemy at a stroke.    In addition to preparing soldiers to be one-a-match-for-100  fighters, the dear comrade leader wisely led the work of  constantly modernizing arms and equipment and of fortifying the  military encampment.    The dear comrade leader put forward a wise policy for  modernizing arms and equipment with our own strength and  according to our practical situation, and energetically led so  that the work is thoroughly implemented.    The dear comrade leader saw to it that the might of arms and  equipment of the People's Army is increased many more times by  modernizing them with our own strength and in our own style, and  in accordance with practical situation in our country. He put  forward a profound plan to simultaneously upgrade onto a modern  standard arms and equipment of not only one specific branch and  service but also of all branches and services including the  army, air force, navy, artillery, tanks corps, and  communications branch. Thus, he carried out a bold operation  that cannot be found in any history of the building of the  military in the world nations.    Under such a wise leadership by the dear comrade leader, our  People's Army has been strengthened and developed into a  powerful army equipped with modern arms and equipment.    Military delegations from foreign countries, who attended  the  military parade held to mark the 60th anniversary of the  founding of the KPA, were struck with admiration for the fact  that the People's Army is equipped with ultramodern weapons and  all arms and equipment were domestic products. Head of a foreign  military delegation said with admiration that even with armed  forces mobilized in the military parade, one can carry out a  large-scale war and win victory.    The dear comrade leader also wisely led the work of  fortification of military encampment. The dear comrade leader  saw to it that the work of fortification of military encampment  is carried out not only as the work of the People's Army but  also as that of entire party, the whole nation and all the  people. Besides, he saw to it that the whole nation is firmly  fortified so that manpower and firing positions not only in  frontline area but also every place throughout the country can  be reliably protected from any modern firing means and that any  enemy who may sneak in with superior forces be smashed in all  places in a one-a-match-for-100 manner.    As the result of this, all soldiers of the People's Army  have  been firmly prepared militarily, technically and physically;  arms and equipment have been modernized at a high level, and  military encampment has been fortified. Thus, the People's Army  has been fostered to be an unrivaled indomitable army. All this  is attributable to the fact that the People's Army is upholding  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at its van as the great  sagacious commander.    Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, our  People's Army has been strengthened and developed into  one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary army with traits as the army  of the leader, of the party and of the people both in name and  reality and with indomitable military power. As the result, a  reliable guarantee is provided for firmly defending our-style  socialism and for expediting the historic cause of national  reunification.    Indeed, by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as  supreme commander of the KPA and as chairman of the nation's  Defense Commission, our People's Army today has been  strengthened and developed into invincible ever-victorious  revolutionary armed forces.</p>

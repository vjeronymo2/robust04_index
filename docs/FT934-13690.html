			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking unsettles equity market THE London equity market battled in vain against downward forces yesterday and was finally forced to concede ground after the recent outstanding performance which has seen share prices hitting new records for the past two trading sessions. Some senior market traders emphasised, however, that a modest decline in prices yesterday was merely a period of consolidation before a further strong upward move. Others were at odds with the bullish view, and said the London market was only one of a number of international markets, most notably Wall Street, that had run too far too fast and that a substantial correction was on the cards. The bearish pressures affecting London included a handful of rather gloomy surveys on retail sales and consumer confidence from influential sources such as the Confederation of British Industry and Gallup, as well as a sharp decline on the recently buoyant Hong Kong stock market. The two surveys tended to increase worries around the market that the recovery in the UK economy may be faltering, a view which began to gather strength last week in the wake of a batch of economic data showing a decline in manufacturing output and another rise in inflation. There was very little pressure on share prices as the market opened with traders tentatively moving quotations higher in response to yet another good showing by Wall Street overnight. The US market performed well on Monday, coming within 10 points or so of its all-time record and was within an ace of bursting into uncharted territory shortly after London closed yesterday. The FT-SE 100 officially opened just over three points higher before running into a flurry of pressure said to have been triggered by aggressive selling of the Footsie future. The pressure in the futures market was thought by dealers to have represented one of the leading UK securities houses adjusting its market positions to accommodate a large trading programme subsquently executed in the cash market. At its worst, the Footsie was down almost 14 points and looking extremely ragged. Once the futures selling was done, however, the market began to regain its composure, to the extent that the Footsie moved briefly back into positive territory at midday. Sentiment began to falter again almost immediately, but there was very little selling pressure evident. Prices went into a gentle decline which left the FT-SE 100 Index down 8.0 at the close at 3,129.6. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, meanwhile, put on a similarly resilient performance, closing only a fraction off at 3,486.8. Turnover in the market held up well, in spite of what was seen by some dealers as signs that the market had run out of steam. Some 658.2m shares were traded yesterday, just short of Monday's level, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for more than 403m shares. The value of customer business transacted on Monday was a creditable Pounds 1.33bn, indicating that the big domestic and overseas instititions have continued to pump money into the market. Drug stocks were the market's undoubted stars yesterday, closely followed by the oil majors, with both sectors responding to the pound's weakness and the consequent strengthening of the dollar.</p>

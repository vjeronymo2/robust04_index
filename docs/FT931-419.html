			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lucas' Pounds 5.2m meets promise - Engineer on track with plans to reduce costs and restore profits LUCAS INDUSTRIES, the international engineering group, yesterday delivered its promise of breaking even in the first half of its 1992-93 year. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 5.2m on turnover of Pounds 1.29bn for the six months to January 31, against Pounds 200,000, inflated to Pounds 90.2m from a contribution from the pension fund, on sales of Pounds 1.15bn last time. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman, said Lucas was 'on track with its plans to reduce costs, restore profitability and improve cash generation' and, therefore, is maintaining the interim dividend at 2.1p. Fully diluted earnings per share were 0.3p, against 10.3p if the pension fund contribution is taken into account or losses of 0.6p if it is not. In a half year when the increase in total sales came largely from favourable translation of exchange rates, the brightest spot in the trading performance came from the automotive division: operating profits rose from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 13.2m. In aerospace, however, there was a decline from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 7.2m. Applied technology operating profits were marginally higher at Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 3.9m). Margins have been wafer thin: 2.2 per cent in the aerospace division, down from 3.4 per cent; 1.7 per cent in the automotive division, up from 0.4 per cent; and 2.6 per cent in applied technology, up from 2.5 per cent. Immediate market prospects are encouraging only in isolated parts of the business, like diesel engine injection systems. 'Delayed world economic recovery must inevitably dampen sales prospects for this year,' said Sir Anthony. This suggested that Lucas's aim of earning enough to pay covered dividends for this financial year - indicating annual pre-tax profits of some Pounds 75m - is dependent on the internal changes of its restructuring programme. By the year end Lucas will have spent Pounds 52m of last year's Pounds 88.4m provision for restructuring. Annual costs of Pounds 85m have been taken out of the business. The workforce will have been reduced to about 50,250 by 2,800 redundancies and the loss of a further 2,500 through divestments. A new management structure is already in place, although the appointment of a new chief executive is still awaited. Lucas also announced that it had signed a contract with BMR Rolls-Royce to supply engine mounted accessory gear boxes for the BR700 series. The contract is worth about Dollars 100m (Pounds 70.4m). The group plans to dispose of two aerospace businesses in the UK - a switchgear and ignition plant in Coventry and a wiring systems plant in Newcastle-under-Lyme. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISTRICT ATTORNEY TAKES MOBIL CASE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has taken over prosecution of  two top-ranking officials at Mobil's Torrance refinery on charges that they  contributed to the death of a contract worker and the injuries of two others in  an explosion on July 15, 1988.  </P> <P> The case, brought originally by Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord, also names  three top officials of Cal Cat Chemical Inc. of Benicia. Lord said he asked the  district attorney to prosecute the case because of new information that could  elevate the charges from misdemeanors to felony manslaughter.  </P> <P> Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said, "The charges are meritless, and we intend  to defend our position rigorously."  </P> <P> The blast occurred as Cal Cat Chemical employees were treating sludge from  storage tanks containing water contaminated with sulfur compounds.  </P></p>

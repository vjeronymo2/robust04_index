			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Public outcry fails to fend off bid for BNZ - The pain caused by Australia's takeover of a neighbour's financial icon NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB) yesterday emerged triumphant in its NZDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 787m) battle to buy the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), marking the end of the most bitter and controversial takeover in New Zealand's history. NAB announced last night it had secured 90.27 per cent of the ordinary shares, a day ahead of the final deadline. This narrow victory, just 0.27 per cent over the threshold allowing it to acquire the remaining shares compulsorily, ends a chapter in the turbulent history of the country's biggest bank. To the last, minority shareholders in BNZ battled to keep the bank in local hands. All week several shareholders staged pickets outside bank branches, seeking to stop the sale. Thousands of other small shareholders sought to halt the deal by refusing to accept NAB's 80 cents a share offer. Two US funds, the Wisconsin Investment Board and Grantham Mayo van Otterloo, with a combined 3 per cent holding in BNZ, encouraged the protesters by saying they were unlikely to accept the offer. Controversy over the sale of BNZ was inflamed by Mr Winston Peters, an MP in the a ruling National party. Armed with documents tabled under parliamentary privilege, he alleged wrong-doing by BNZ directors and others involved with the bank from 1988 to 1990. Letters to newspapers, callers to radio talk shows and public opinion polls suggested a majority of New Zealanders wanted an inquiry into the bank which the National Party government is refusing to allow, despite a pre-election promise to do so. Most critics said they did not want BNZ sold, while others expressed concern that the sale would see the country's banking dominated by four Australian banks - ANZ, Westpac, NAB and Commonwealth - and two British banks - Countrywide and National Westminster. Only one bank remains in New Zealand hands, Trust Bank, a grouping of regional banks effectively excluded from the main Auckland market. An often acrimonious extraordinary meeting, forced by dissident shareholders last Friday, showed the depth of feeling among the 1,500 shareholders able to attend the marathon five-and-a-half hour meeting. Many targetted their frustration at director Sir Michael Fay, a representative of Fay, Richwhite, and Ms Ruth Richardson, the finance minister. It was their decision in June to sell their combined 82.9 per cent holding to the NAB that sparked the uproar. However, the BNZ has been no stranger to controversy in the past. Launched by Auckland entrepreneurs in 1860, there were early accusations of impropriety in land deals. In the late 1880s, BNZ was involved in property and other speculation, requiring a rescue with the injection of taxpayers' money. Oddly the same thing happened 100 years later. But successive governments maintained a share in the bank until it was nationalised by the Labour government in 1946. In 1986, a reformist Labour government sold 17 per cent to the public for NZDollars 1.75 a share. The shareholders who bought these shares spearheaded the latest campaign to keep the bank in local hands, arguing that improving profits showed it was on a road to recovery. Small shareholders have had two shocks recently: one in 1989 when BNZ revealed heavy losses following the 1987 crash. However, the bigger one came in September 1990, when the bank was forced to raise NZDollars 1.5bn from the government, Fay, Richwhite and other sources to cover large unexpected losses in Australia. Last week's extraordinary meeting revealed for the first time how grave the Australian problems had been. As part of the 1990 rescue, BNZ set up Adbro, a separate company to handle the 'bad bank' loan portfolio, while BNZ itself became a 'good bank' and continued to trade. About half the bad and doubtful debts in Adbro, which has a total of NZDollars 2.7bn in debts, will never be recovered. The Adbro issue dominated the extraordinary meeting, as a leading group of dissidents argued that NAB's offer of 80 cents a share was artificially depressed by overly conservative accounting of the potential recoveries from Adbro. Mr Paul Kocourek of Booz Allen and Hamilton, the international management consultancy, revealed how much of the financial crisis in September 1990 was due to the BNZ's ill-judged foray into Australia between 1985 and 1988, when it sought to become a leading player there. He said that much of 77 per cent of increased provisioning needed between March and September 1990 was due to problem Australian loans, which accounted for only 20 per cent of the bank's lending. Mr Kocourek said hardly anyone had seen the magnitude of Australia recession, while hopes for an improvement in the New Zealand economy did not materialise. This meant an increasing number of companies were unable to repay interest and principal on their loans. 'Not only did more loans go bad, but the value of the collateral underpinning them deteriorated substantially,' he said. Property prices in Sydney and Melbourne fell by an average 40 to 50 per cent. He said that, while the board could be criticised, very few commentators expected the collapse in Australia to be so severe. Only a year earlier independent valuers had been forecasting a maximum 5 per cent drop in property values. The provisioning in September 1990 forecast recoveries at NZDollars 1.07bn, or 40 per cent of the debts that were put into Adbro. Since then, the bank had recovered NZDollars 622.4m, about 58 per cent of the expected recovery level. Mr Kocourek said further recoveries in Adbro are forecast at NZDollars 456m. Responding to suggestions that the bad debt provisions were too high, which suggested that the BNZ was being sold too cheaply, he said there could be no certainty about the provisioning levels, but his judgment was that they fairly reflected the value of the bad loan portfolio. He said that, of the total bad debt recoveries, 60 per cent would come from Australia and 40 per cent from New Zealand. Provisioning was based on the expectation of only modest economic growth over the next several years, and could change if the Australian and New Zealand economies became 'Asian Tigers'. NAB's determination not to pay more than 80 cents a share, or to offer a share swap, did not ease the way for it to buy the BNZ. Nor did it lessen the controversy over the loss of a national institution, popularly called the 'peoples' bank' to Australian control. Most New Zealanders harbour deep-seated suspicions about their bigger neighbour, and clashes both on and off the sporting field are legendary. Now that it has succeeded in its takeover, NAB will need to mount a big public relations effort. It has said it intends to keep BNZ's name and identity, emphasising that it will allow BNZ the same measure of autonomy they permit the banks it controls in Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>

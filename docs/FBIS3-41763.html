He reported to journalists that the indicators for the  dysentery epidemic that began 2 months ago in Goris have  declined significantly. In this time 500 cases of this disease  were registered. In 6 months of this year 150 brucellosis cases  were registered. Last year 700 cases were registered. Ten days  ago cholera bacillus was discovered in Shaumyanovskiy Canal,  Erebuninskiy Rayon, Yerevan.    Last week the republic's epidemiological commission held a  meeting in the Ministry of Health. During it a decision was made  to stop the cholera epidemic--to create special subdivisions in  customs offices for public health inspection. Attention must be  turned primarily to large transportation junctions, the airport  and the railroad station. There are plans for carrying out  preventive measures, and for taking samples to study the  condition of water basins. Swimming in open-air water basins was  prohibited.    Ararat Mkrtchyan reported that cases of cholera have not yet  been registered in Armenia, but such cases do exist in states  neighboring on Armenia--Turkey and Iraq. Special attention is to  be turned to tourist ties with countries neighboring on Armenia.    The situation is more reassuring in Georgia, where the  overall level of infectious diseases does not elicit any  apprehensions.    The health ministries of the two countries--Armenia and  Georgia--agreed on joint public health inspection.    Ararat Mkrtchyan announced that cases of cholera were  recently registered in the territory of the former Union. On 3  August seven cases of cholera were registered in Tajikistan, and  on 4 August 15 were registered in Azerbaijan and seven in  Dagestan, one of them a fatality. Three cases of cholera were  registered in Krasnodar, and two cases in Rostov. Cases of  illness were registered in St. Petersburg. In the words of the  chief public health physician, foreigners are the source of  disease in Krasnodar, Rostov and St. Petersburg.</p>

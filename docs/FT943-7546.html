			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Vietnam admits an equality gap: Central Committee calls for faster industrialisation and modernisation Vietnam's ruling Communist party has admitted what economists say could be the biggest threat facing the country's recent rapid economic growth: a yawning gap between the urban and the rural economy. A resolution issued by the party's Central Committee calls for faster 'industrialisation and modernisation', a catchphrase reflecting growing concern over the country's ability to reach the ambitious target of doubling per capita income by 2000. The phrase is understood to mean an increased emphasis on developing Vietnam's state manufacturing sector, much of which has limped along on dwindling state subsidies since economic openness, or doi moi (renovation), was officially sanctioned in 1986. The emphasis appears to be on attracting the country's vast rural workforce into the sector. The resolution added that Vietnam was now facing 'acute difficulties' because of low economic growth, loose control of inflation, limited funding sources and increased competition, reflecting increased candour in the way policymakers are dealing with the country's progress to a market economy. Keen to avoid the chaos that engulfed many of the former eastern bloc countries' attempts at fast-track private-sector growth, Vietnam's leaders are steering policy towards placing crucial state industries into commanding positions in the economy while encouraging foreign investment and private-sector growth. Despite an impressive list of economic achievements, including attracting Dollars 9.5bn (Pounds 6.1bn) in foreign investment in the past five years and sharply reducing inflation, the results of economic reform have so far been felt mainly in the capital, Hanoi, and the southern industrial centre Ho Chi Minh City. In both cities, a growing class of new rich is enjoying increasing spending power. But they account for only 20 per cent of the population. The rest are still locked into the farm sector, where unemployment is increasing. 'The real issue is to get people out of the agricultural sector and into industry,' a Washington-based official at the World Bank's agricultural division said. Local press reports say that last year industry accounted for only about 20 per cent of gross national product. Figures released last month by the country's national statistical bureau disclosed rapid growth in foreign trade but also a budget deficit of about Dollars 200m as imports have overtaken exports. Although national per capita income is often quoted as Dollars 220, many economists agree that it would be more realistic to make a distinction between Ho Chi Minh City, where the figure is unofficially put at about Dollars 500, and the countryside, where the figure of Dollars 220 is said to be more accurate. The Central Committee's resolution said Vietnam must create the conditions necessary for private business to invest in production and joint ventures and co-operation with the state-owned economic sector. 'We must continue to renovate economic policies, especially the financial and monetary policies, in order better to create, mobilise and effectively use capital, and to strive to increase gross investment accumulation rate to around 25-30 per cent of the country's GDP,' the resolution said. Only two months ago, in his closing speech to the National Assembly, the country's rubber-stamp legislative body, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet began his remarks by dwelling more on what the economy had failed to achieve than the usual glowing catalogue of achievements.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / US justices back forced extradition of suspects THE US Supreme Court yesterday ruled that the government was entitled to kidnap from a foreign country those wanted for prosecution by American justice. By a six-to-three margin and over a blistering dissenting opinion, Mr William Rehnquist, the chief justice, found that the US government had not broken the terms of an extradition treaty with Mexico by arranging for the forcible extradition in 1990 of a Mexican doctor suspected of involvement in the murder of two American narcotics agents in 1985. He ruled that it was up to the Bush administration, and not the federal courts, to decide if the doctor should be returned home, as Mexico has requested. Lower federal courts had ruled in the doctor's favour, prompting the administration's appeal. Mr Rehnquist conceded that the kidnapping itself might have been 'in violation of general international law principles,' but would not be judicially reversed because it had not broken terms of the 1980 extradition treaty with Mexico. The US government had never asked Mexico to extradite the doctor. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by justices Harry Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor, wrote: 'I suspect most courts in the civilised world will be deeply disturbed by the monstrous decision the court announces today.' He added: 'Every nation that has an interest in preserving the rule of law is affected, directly or indirectly, by a ruling of this character.' The torture and murder in 1985 of the American narcotics agent and his pilot had soured US-Mexican relations at a time when the US was becoming increasingly concerned at the flood of drugs from Mexico. The administration had offered a reward for the capture of the doctor and subsequently allowed the kidnappers to remain in the US.</p>

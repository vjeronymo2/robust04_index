Under the law, the federal government offers a lump sum of  up  to 25,000 U.S. dollars as a buyout to each of those who resign  or retire provided he or she has completed 12 months of  continuous service.    The U.S. President signed the legislation while vacationing  in southern California.    The new law is part of the effort of the White House to slim  the federal government which employs more than two million  people. The law will help reduce the federal government  workforce by 12 percent, bringing the figure below the  two-million mark for the first time since 1966 and to the lowest  level since 1950.    In a statement released by the White House, Clinton said  that  the law would help the government achieve goals of making  government work better and cost less.    In a related development, White House Budget Director Leon  Panetta announced that the Clinton administration had eliminated  284 federal advisory committees, which are required by law,  saving 17 million U.S. dollars a year.    Clinton had ordered a year ago that the 801 advisory  committees that are not required by law be trimmed by a third to  267.</p>

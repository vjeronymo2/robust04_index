			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Press Center of Ukraine's Security </F> Service: "Radiation for Consumption Off the Premises"]    [Text] As already reported, a capsule containing  cesium-137, which is a part of the control and measurement  equipment in the furnace for quicklime slaking, had been stolen  from the Nikolayev Alumina Plant. In accordance with tentative  data, several persons, who are yet to be identified in the  course of investigation, stole a steel capsule from the  equipment, fixed it in a screw-vise in the workshop and tried to  pulverize it in the hope that it contained a precious metal.  The hermetic seal of the capsule was broken. The offenders  threw its fragments into the fire-prevention reservoir filled  with water. As a result of the actions, the reservoir and the  adjacent premises of the plant were contaminated.    After the disappearance of the capsule became known, the  territory of the plant was thoroughly examined. Places of  radioactive contamination were pinpointed. Their total area  amounts to 25 square meters. The territory around the reservoir  was covered with concrete. There is no danger of spread of the  radioactive contamination.    Eleven persons were exposed to various doses of radiation.  Three workers were hospitalized in the Kharkiv Radiological  Institute. None of those affected was diagnosed as suffering  from "radiation disease." A criminal case was initiated.</p>

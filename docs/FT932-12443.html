			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Sandoz raises sales 2.5% in quarter to SFr4.12bn SANDOZ, the Basle-based pharmaceutical and chemicals group, said sales in the first quarter of 1993 were up 2.5 per cent to SFr4.21bn (Dollars 2.97bn). Mr Marc Moret, chairman, said he was confident about the outlook for the year, in spite of the unfavourable economic climate in Europe. 'I can already state that we will be able to look back on a good year. So far, we are well within the framework of budgets set last September, and I can see no reason for any change in the next few months,' Mr Moret said at the group's annual press conference. Mr Rolf Schweizer, vice-president, said all divisions except seeds achieved sales gains in the first quarter, and the 1.4 per cent decline in seeds sales was due to a disposal. Mr Max Link, head of the group's pharmaceutical division, said first-quarter sales in Germany and Italy had both fallen by more than 10 per cent as a result of govern-ment-imposed price restrictions. Sandoz executives were confident that they could overcome increasing government pressure on drug prices in both the US and Europe with a steady stream of new and innovative products.</p>

Carlos Moorehead  (R-Glendale), are investigating allegations that toxic chemicals illegally  dumped in Placerita Canyon by a defense contractor endangered public health and  contributed to four deaths in a family that lived near the plant.  </P> <P> If a preliminary study indicates a possible health risk from the chemicals, the  agency will conduct a comprehensive study on the incidence of cancer and other  diseases in the community, Mark Bashor, a toxicologist with the Agency for  Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, said Friday.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services also is reviewing previous  studies on the Space Ordnance Systems plant to determine whether a  comprehensive health survey is warranted.  </P></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / US arm of Lucas to pay reparations Lucas Industries, the British-based motor and aerospace components group, said yesterday it expected to pay reparations for supplying allegedly faulty equipment to the US forces. The company said a settlement was likely to avoid court proceedings over claims that a US subsidiary, Lucas AUL, supplied defective missile launching components and military radios that failed to meet specifications. US prosecutors are expected to seek criminal charges in the missile case, which US federal authorities have been investigating since 1992. However, Lucas said the US authorities had made clear there was no link between this case and investigations into 'friendly fire' deaths during the Gulf conflict three years ago. The equipment is for launching Maverick air-to-ground missiles, which caused two of the worst incidents of the war. But Lucas said it believed that the US Air Force A-10 aircraft involved in the incidents were equipped by a different supplier. Seven US marines were killed in a light armoured vehicle on January 29, 1991. On February 26, during the Allied land offensive, nine British soldiers died when their Warrior vehicles were hit, also by Maverick missiles. Lucas took over AUL from private owners in December 1986 as part of a series of US acquisitions in defence electronics. The radio business became part of Lucas AUL in 1989. The British group said it had been co-operating with investigations into test procedures at the US subsidiary for the past 18 months. Many of these procedures were already in place when it took over the US companies, it said. The contracts with the Pentagon also dated from before the acquisitions. Lucas added that it had already made 'appropriate' provisions to cover likely payments arising from the US investigations. It indicated that it expected to reach a settlement somewhat lower than the Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) which prosecutors have been reported to be seeking. The UK group, which has defence sales of around Pounds 100m in the US, said the 'ultimate sanction' would be to have its Pentagon contracts withdrawn but this measure was rarely invoked.</p>

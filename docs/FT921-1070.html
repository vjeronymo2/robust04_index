			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / People: My Little Pony lassoes licences across Europe The European Licensing Group (ELG), in charge of licensing characters from the Ninja Turtles to My Little Pony across the Continent from Portugal to Latvia, has chosen Robert Watson from US toy manufacturer Hasbro as its new managing director. His predecessor Oliver Reid was killed in a traffic accident in January at the age of 54, shortly after taking up his assignment. ELG is a joint venture, trading since January, between Copyright Promotions, the UK's largest character licensing operation and part of Mosaic Investments, and Merchandising Munchen, part of the German media empire belonging to entrepreneur Leo Kirch. It is located in Amsterdam and aims to break down the barriers of European-wide licensing. David Cardwell, joint managing director of Copyright, says Englishman Bob Watson, 43, latterly vice-president of international licensing at Hasbro International in London, 'knows the licensing business inside out' and speaks fluent French, German and Italian; 'He was the person we reported to at Hasbro,' in transactions connected with licences for My Little Pony, Playschool and many others. Cardwell points out that Watson also understands third party licensing, where Hasbro would buy in for its own purposes licences from Disney, or the rights to Turtles from Copyright. He will be in charge of 16 countries - including a series of offices just opened in eastern Europe and the Russian Republics, which are starting to license characters such as the Turtles, Pink Panther, and, shortly, Indiana Jones. 'Oliver did a tremendous job setting it up,' says Cardwell. 'Bob will be there to keep the monster under control.' ***** When the Euro Disney park opens outside Paris on April 12, Peter Woodhead will be counting on the publicity to give a boost to such ageless characters as Mickey Mouse and Goofy. Woodhead's job is to ensure that the British have Disney characters for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Appointed managing director of Disney Consumer Products in the UK, Woodhead, 41, will continue Disney's activities in the granting of licences to clothing manufacturers, retailers and publishers, but he also sees a great future for Disney characters in food products. One of his most important tasks, however, will be to take advantage of a recently-concluded pan-European licensing agreement between Disney and Nestle, the Swiss food giant. Lined up for UK consumers, says Woodhead, are more Disney characters on yoghurt cartons; Easter eggs with Disney themes; and, he hopes, pasta in the shapes of Disney characters. Before joining Disney, Woodhead worked on the licensing of products based on Mattel's Barbie doll. He also helped ATV to license the Muppets and Pink Panther.</p>

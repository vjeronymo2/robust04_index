			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Harmony in pub and shop deals Harmony Property Group has announced the sale of six public houses, comprising its managed house division, to Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based regional brewer, for Pounds 3.25m cash. The six pubs, one leasehold and five freehold, are all in the south-east. In the year to March 27 1994, they generated turnover of Pounds 1.7m with a book value of Pounds 3.7m at that date. In return, Castle Arcade (Cardiff), part of Bridger Properties, in which Gibbs Mew has a 75 per cent stake, is selling Castle Arcade, a Victorian shopping arcade in Cardiff, to Harmony for Pounds 3.7m cash. Mr Ian Jefferson, a Gibbs Mew director, also holds 25 per cent of Castle. Gross income of the arcade is currently Pounds 433,000 and is expected to rise to almost Pounds 500,000 when fully let. Harmony, which has changed from a leisure to a property based group, also announced the sale of Arion Properties, which lets residential property in Edinburgh, for Pounds 750,000 cash. Net assets at March 31 1994 were Pounds 800,000. Proceeds will be reinvested in core activities. Harmony's interim results showed losses up from Pounds 323,000 to Pounds 602,000 in the 27 weeks to October 2, after charging a Pounds 464,000 provision this time for losses on the sale of public houses. Turnover was Pounds 4.37m (Pounds 2.25m for 26 weeks) and losses per share came to 0.38p (0.5p). No dividend is declared, but the company said it planned a capital reconstruction in anticipation of making payments next year. Mr John Main, chairman, said Harmony was 'in its strongest financial position for some years'. Rental income was in the order of Pounds 1.6m, overheads had been reduced and gearing was 'now at a sensible level'. Mr Tony Potter has resigned as finance director and company secretary. He will be replaced by Mr Richard Mellish.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Gorbachev by Waldemar Gontarski and </F> Iwona Parchimowicz in Moscow; date not given: "The Return of  the Bolsheviks"]    [Text] [WPROST] What do you think of the Zhirinovskiy  phenomenon?    [Gorbachev] Do not fear the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. The  voters voted for his party in order to express their disapproval  of the authorities in power until now. The result of the voting  is merely a reflection of their disapproval of those at the head  of the government. Do not think that fascist ideology enjoys  such a great success in our society, and that a fascist ego  dwells in the Russian soul.    [WPROST] Do you sympathize with Yavlinskiy's group?    [Gorbachev] I do nothing surreptitiously. I am closely  watching Yavlinskiy's group, Travkin's Democratic Party of  Russia, and the Civic Union. To be honest, the Union has lost  its distinctness, even though realists, entrepreneurs, and  economic activists, people who control the economic situation on  a day-to-day basis, are connected with it. Very much depends on  these people, and they are backed by the masses. However, on a  Federation level, people from the Union are looking about them  as if they do not know what to do. I find this very sad, and  that is why I support Yavlinskiy, even though I should be  supporting the Alliance.    [WPROST] What made you decide to vote in favor of the  constitution proposed by Boris Yeltsin?    [Gorbachev] I am in favor of Yeltsin's draft, but it still  requires a lot of hard work on it in the State Duma. There are  two issues in particular that must be considered. First, there  is no balance between the different types of authority at the  Federation level. I support the idea of a presidential  republic, which means a strong president and strong government.  But I cannot come to terms with the pitiful situation in which  our parliament has found itself. A strong president, plus a  strong parliament and independent Constitutional Court -- that  is the arrangement that best suits Russia's interests. Yet the  president is keeping the candidacies for the Constitutional  Court in his pocket. There is still the problem of the conflict  between the center and the regions. The provinces are prepared  to assume responsibility, but first they must be granted the  relevant powers. How can one undertake privatization and bring  help to the poorest sectors of society if one does not have any  powers, for example a suitable fiscal policy?    As far as the parliamentary election is concerned, it is  difficult to consider it a free election. It has been called  for by the very authorities that are taking part in it. These  authorities will now appoint election commissions, and in the  end they will count the votes themselves.    [WPROST] Then why are you taking part in such an election?    [Gorbachev] Because we must pass through all this as quickly  as possible, for there is no return to the past. Let the  authorities display their programs, then we will see what it is  they want. A politician may convince his opponents, but he  cannot escape from real life. And Russia's political reality is  such that if the present ruling team does not alter its program,  we are going to bear the consequences. But their are incapable  of making changes. I can see how very undecided they are.  President Yeltsin says "one cannot rely on force any longer,"  Gaydar says one can, and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin simply says  "the era of shock therapy is over." They are all beginning to  play for time. The prime minister fell ill just before the  election. I wish him health, of course, but his sickness  occurred at the best possible time. Gaydar attempted dialogue  with the miners and withdrew straightaway. The miners stuck to  their guns. And how many more collective interests like this  are there?    [WPROST] In that case, when will the next putsch take place?    [Gorbachev] It is possible to avoid such an eventuality.  This election has enabled various parties and groups to  consolidate. Now the process of forming coalitions and joint  programs will be faster. Perhaps that is the only favorable  result of the election, although the new parliament will once  again consist of a mixture of people from whom one does not know  what to expect. All sorts of surprises are in store for is.    [WPROST] Who is going to head the new government? Will  Yeltsin want to choose between Chernomyrdin and Gaydar?    [Gorbachev] For some time now, the president has kept a  distance from Russia's Choice in order at appear as a neutral  referee, the leader of the nation. Yeltsin has said that he  will cooperate with all the parties that enter parliament. And  yet his entire sympathies lie with Russia's Choice. He is also  playing for time.    [WPROST] Gennadiy Burbulis, strategist from Russia's Choice,  has admitted that, in the long run, Yeltsin might be merely an  unnecessary burden on the Democrats.    [Gorbachev] Have you not noticed that the Democrats are  distancing themselves from the president and turning themselves  into an independent force? Notice what Gavril Popov said: "I  have resigned from the post of mayor of Moscow because I do not  want to become a second Rutskoy, a representative of authority  without any powers. I do not agree with the president." They  have started their own game and they do not need the president.  But Yeltsin has noticed everything, and the conduct of the  "democrats" is not escaping the attention of the Kremlin's  advisers.    [WPROST] Will you take an active part in political life  after the elections?    [Gorbachev] I am already doing so by talking to you.    [WPROST] I meant political activity.    [Gorbachev] The students union of Nizhniy Novgorod has  suggested that I run for parliament. I have also received  offers form Moscow, St. Petersburg, and the northern Caucasus.  I refused, because I do not want to assume any state post. For  the time being, I see no reason to alter my present status. And  later? We will see.    [WPROST] What is your attitude toward the present Russian  president?    [Gorbachev] That is not going to distract my attention. His  attitude toward me should not concern you, and my attitude  toward him even less so. We can discuss politics, you are most  welcome to do so. After all, Russia requires a complete change  of politics. Look where the policies pursued over the past two  years have brought us -- the Bolsheviks are back in the Kremlin.  Until now I have called them neo-Bolsheviks, but now I see that  they are real. They are using the same methods of action, only  under a different banner. The Bolsheviks of 1917 chased everyone  off to the state farms, today's Bolsheviks are chasing everyone  away from them. What kind of democrats are they? The  individual means nothing to them, that is why I shun calling  them democrats.    [WPROST] What about the Army?    [Gorbachev] The Army should not be brought out onto the  streets. Everything should be resolved by political means.    [WPROST] Would you not have brought the tanks out into the  streets on 3 and 4 October?    [Gorbachev] I tried to do that in March 1991, but I quickly  realized how it would end. Therefore I ordered the soldiers  back to their barracks.    [WPROST] You are sneering at Russian domestic policy. What  about foreign policy? According to Yeltsin, when Germany united  in 1990, you reached an agreement with Western leaders that NATO  would not expand eastwards.    [Gorbachev] That is right. International agreements contain  a clause whereby neither NATO, nor even the FRG itself, will  deploy any forces on the territory of the former GDR [German  Democratic Republic]. I think the question of the admission of  Central and Eastern European countries to NATO has been wrongly  presented. Perhaps it is because the Americans are needlessly  afraid that their role will diminish. The Europeans should  explain to them that Europe must decisively shape its own future  with the participation of the United States and Canada. Such is  the reality of international politics. Everything else is  merely a game.    However, there is something else that worries me more.  Perhaps Russia has made people nervous because of its  "imperial" way of behavior or because of some of the statements  made by Russian politicians. Basically there is nothing behind  these statements, but they have been made nonetheless.  Representatives of the authorities have begun to compete with  "patriots" to see who can best defend Russia's interests. They  all realize that society is stunned by the collapse of the USSR  and the socialist camp. However, the road to reconstructing the  state follows a different course. Our friends in Central and  Eastern Europe should be clearly told that Russia will never  conduct warfare. Such activity should be rejected once and for  all. We must build a common European home, and from both  directions, east and west. Despite everything, structures  common to the entire continent should be formed.    [WPROST] We were building a common European home when you  were still in office.    [Gorbachev] There are mechanisms that exist on paper, there  is the Paris Charter, and nothing should be added to them.  However there is a lack of real instruments, various  institutions, with the aid of which one might fulfill these  plans. For example, Europe needs a security council. Expanding  alliances is a bad solution, because it divides Europe instead  of uniting it. Do we want to proceed from one division to  another? Are 12 NATO member-countries to determine the fate of  the entire continent?</p>

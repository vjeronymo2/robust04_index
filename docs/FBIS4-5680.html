			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The government's tax  commission generally favors shifting Japan's tax burden from  income to consumption taxes, panel chief Kan Kato said [12  April].    Although some members are cautious about shifting the burden  toward direct taxation and want further discussion, no  opposition emerged at a panel meeting, Kato told a news  conference afterward.    Kato, an emeritus professor at Keio University, said the  advisory panel to the prime minister must pick up the pace of  its deliberations to meet a June deadline for its final report,  which the government is to use to craft its tax policy.    The commission, which will meet again Friday, also agreed to  form a working group of scholars, excluding bureaucrats and  interest- group representatives, to examine the possibility of a  regional consumption tax, Kato said.    The tax options that the commission is to lay out in its  report will likely not be numerical, he said. Kato has said he  agrees with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa that the net tax  burden must be raised to meet the needs of Japan's aging society.    The commission ended its previous meeting in confusion just  as Hosokawa announced last Friday that he will quit as premier.    But Kato said the members agreed Tuesday to press on with  their work, noting Japan's international promise to spell out by  the end of June its pledge for tax reform, including permanent  income tax cuts, to be enacted by year's end.    "Whoever becomes the next prime minister, the road is  narrowing" as the tax debate proceeds and time runs out, Kato  said.</p>

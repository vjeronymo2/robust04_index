			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic from Tirana] </F>   [Excerpt] [Perincic] Our embassy was opened in the capital  of Albania today in a formal ceremony held in the presence of  Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia. The  ceremony was attended by the leadership of this friendly  country: Albania President Sali Berisha, Pjeter Arbnori,  president of the People's Assembly, and Prime Minister  Aleksander Meksi. Also present were members of the diplomatic  corps and many citizens of the host country.    Following a speech by Croatian Ambassador in Tirana Mladen  Jurisic, those present were addressed by Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman.    [Begin Tudjman recording] The opening of the Croatian  Embassy  in Tirana marks the beginning of something special in that it is  the continuation of the (?historical) links between the Croatian  and Albanian people ever since the Illyrian times. [end  recording]    [Perincic] Let us remember Queen Teuta. The legendary  Albanian hero, George Kastrioti, is mentioned in Croatian folk  songs. This is yet more evidence of the links between the two  peoples. It should not be forgotten, Tudjman went on to add,  that in the former Yugoslavia under the leadership of Tito, a  Croat, the Albanians of Kosovo enjoyed all rights, including  their university and academy.    [Begin Tudjman recording] Today, under democratic  conditions,  and with the introduction of democratic systems in Croatia and  Albania, we wish to continue the legacies of history on new  foundations and in the new situation in which both Albania and  Croatia need to be the mainstays of the new international order  in southeast Europe. [end recording]    [Perincic] Albanian President Sali Berisha also spoke  briefly. He expressed the hope that the Croatian Embassy in  Tirana would serve to enrich cooperation between the two  countries. He also expressed satisfaction with President  Tudjman's visit to mark the occasion. He voiced the hope that  the Croatian and Albanian people will continue to nurture their  traditionally good relations. In this context he mentioned  (Milan Suflaj), a Croat expert on Albania, killed at the time of  the Yugoslav monarchy. [passage omitted]</p>

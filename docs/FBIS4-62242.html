			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Presidential elections on 26 June may deprive the  president, government and parliament of the political clout on  the regions, President Leonid Kravchuk told the new parliament  late on Wednesday [11 May]. As an urgent priority, he offered  the deputies to consider rescheduling presidential and local  elections until a later date.    Kravchuk insists that presidential elections must follow the  creation of a proper legislative basis for government  functioning and the adoption of a new constitution.    In his view, parliamentary approval is needed of laws on the  presidency and local government before the elections can be  held. These must provide for an executive presidency and  sweeping powers to regional council heads, Kravchuk believes.    He also spoke of a risk that the presidential and local  election campaign might lead to polarization and a bitter power  struggle instead of defusing social tension at a time when "we  are in need of consensus and tolerance".    Kravchuk believes that the danger of power erosion is  increased because of the specifics of the economic situation in  Ukraine whose predominantly state sector is in need of central  government.    In his view, further experiments in government reform may  wreck the levers of economic management while political  instability push back the international financial agencies  willing to provide economic aid to Ukraine.    "The dispute between Ukraine and Crimea are known to all and  sundry. There is a risk that it may spread to other regions,"  Kravchuk said.    IF Note: Some Crimean leaders consider Kravchuk's drive for  rescheduling the presidential election as a desire to try to  cling to his office as long as possible. Crimean Vice Premier  Yevgeniy Saburov said that "Kravchuk ought to have set an  example of civilized behavior by stepping down in a dignified  manner." In an interview with INTERFAX, he said that "a  democratic changeover of government is when the politician is  seen off with honors but not when he is driven out of power or  tries to hold back to his office with tooth and nail." Stepping  down in time is the main thing in a democratic society, Saburov  believes.    Meanwhile, the rescheduling question is not even on the  parliament's preliminary agenda.    The Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission reports that the  following have received the 100,000 signatures required for  registering as presidential candidates: President Leonid  Kravchuk, Chairman of the Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs Leonid Kuchma, ex-speaker Ivan Plyushch, leader of  the Ukrainian socialists Aleksandr Moroz and Education Minister  Petr Talanchuk.</p>

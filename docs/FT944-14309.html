			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Chester Barnard Barnard (1886-1961) was a rarity among management thinkers this century in actually holding down a proper job. After Harvard - which he left before completing his degree - he joined the statistical department of American Telephone and Telegraph, a company where he was to remain for the next 40 years. He ultimately became president of New Jersey Bell. Barnard is not everyone's favourite inspiration today but his writings are described in Tom Peters's and Robert Waterman's book In Search Of Excellence as 'probably the first balanced treatment of the management process'. His essential message was that authority in an organisation only exists in so far as the people working there are willing to accept it. Small groups can operate informally, but as they grow they have to establish formal systems to make sure that organisational goals are fully understood and that individuals can be motivated in support of the organisation's 'purpose'. Barnard identified today's 'organisation man' stating that 'the most important single contribution required of the executive, certainly the most universal qualification, is loyalty, domination by the organisation personality'. He enunciated three principles of communication which he applied at New Jersey Bell and which are pertinent given today's 'flatter' corporate structures. Make sure everyone knows what the channels of communications are. Make sure there is a formal channel of communication to tie in every member. Make the line of communication as direct or short as possible. Despite the importance attached to it by some of today's gurus, Barnard's work remains largely neglected, partly because it is fairly impenetrable. Barnard admitted that The Functions of the Executive - the book of his lectures - took five to 10 readings to understand. The man whose intellect a Harvard professor once equated with that of Leonardo da Vinci was one of the first thinkers to talk about the chief executive as shaper and manager of share values in an organisation. He contrasted this concept with that of the authoritarian, manipulative manager working strictly on a system of rewards and short-term efficiency. Barnard saw business organisations as the most effective means of achieving widespread social advancement: he believed the church and state had failed because they were concerned primarily with authority rather than co-operation. He would have been at home with today's concept of company stakeholders (employees, investors, suppliers and customers). 'I rejected the concept of organisation as compromising a rather definitive group of people whose behaviour is co-ordinated with reference to some explicit goal or goals. In a community all acts of individuals and of organisations are directly or indirectly interconnected and interdependent.'</p>

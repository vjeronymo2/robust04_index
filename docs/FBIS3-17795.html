Moldova has sufficient  credibility in the eyes of the World Bank's Coordinating Council  and due to this it has granted Moldova $300 million credit so  far. Teodor Stolojan, World Bank's expert in privatization  problems, said that a group of experts representing the  executive power and the parliamentary commissions should be  organized during the formation of new government. This group  will discuss the privatization program for 1994-95. In  Stolojan's opinion, "it is very important to take decisions at  already solved in other countries," says the communique. Leonid  Talmaci, Moldovan National Bank Governor, pointed out that the  WB had reduced the interest rate for its credits due to a  decrease of inflation to 10 percent in early March. President  Snegur said that in his speech to the new parliament he will  emphasize specifically the promotion of economic reforms in pace  with a program for the social assistance of vulnerable groups.  Snegur noted that it is difficult to attain these objectives and  this is due to the conservatism of certain enterprises' managers  and oppositionist speculations. He said the opposition  manipulates the population in a difficult moment with a  well-defined aim to gain political capital, says the communique.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGER OVER MALATHION SPRAYING  </P> <P> The malathion spraying doesn't eradicate Medflies, and there's overwhelming  evidence that this toxic rain is dangerous to our health and devastating to the  environment.  </P> <P> I can only conclude that the spraying isn't about Medfly eradication at all.  It's about the arrogance of government in this "democratic" country to do  whatever the hell it wants to do, and the taxpayers be damned. In a perfect  expression of naked power and contempt for the citizens, the officeholders in  Sacramento and Washington poison us, then hand us the bill to pay for it.  </P> <P> Jefferson was right. We do need to have a revolution ever so often.  </P> <P> R. P. NICHOLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Retail sales recovery gives boost to Bush PRESIDENT George Bush's re-election campaign received a boost yesterday from figures showing a surprisingly robust recovery of retail sales since Christmas. Analysts saw the figures as further evidence that the US economy is beginning to stir after one of the longest downturns in recent history. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 1.3 per cent last month and by 4.6 per cent since February last year, when spending was depressed by the Gulf war. Figures for January were revised substantially to show a monthly gain of 2.1 per cent rather than 0.6 per cent as initially estimated. Sales were far stronger than indicated by gloomy consumer confidence surveys or the cautious forecasts of most leading economists. They follow a raft of other mildly encouraging statistics, including a jump in employment last month, higher home sales, a surge in the Purchasing Managers' index and an acceleration of monetary growth. On Wall Street, lingering hopes of another cut in interest rates were dashed, putting pressure on bond prices. Many analysts now fear the Federal Reserve may have to tighten monetary policy later this year if it is to keep inflation low. Mr Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, the New York investment house, said consumer spending was developing an 'unmistakable momentum.' The Bush administration would benefit from a 'significant improvement in the economy as the campaign progressed.' Mr Wayne Gantt, chief economist at Interstate/Johnson Lane, an Atlanta-based investment bank, said last year's monetary stimulus pointed to a 'fair amount of economic vigour.' The economy might grow at an annual rate of as much as 2 per cent this quarter and 3.5 per cent between April and June, he said. Many analysts, however, stress that the signs of recovery are still tentative and caution that any upturn could prove short-lived, as occurred last year. US economic statistics are notoriously volatile. Some fear growth of jobs and incomes will not be fast enough to support a sustained recovery of consumer spending. Separate figures yesterday showed a fresh rise in weekly claims for unemployment insurance to above 450,000, a level that normally points to recessionary conditions. Some of the bounce in retail sales reflects the partial recovery of the housing market, following cuts in interest rates. Sales of building materials rose 5.7 per cent in February, the third sharp monthly increase. Furniture sales were up substantially. Yesterday's report, however, also pointed to a broadly-based improvement in department store sales. Bond prices fall, Page 27</p>

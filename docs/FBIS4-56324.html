			<p>BFN     [Text] After three days of deliberations, the Workers Party  [PT] ended its ninth national meeting in Brasilia. Party  delegates formalized the designation of Luiz Inacio Lula da  Silva as PT candidate for the presidential elections on 3  October.    This is the first time the PT has adopted a more moderate  position on the foreign debt. After the various party sectors  reached a broad understanding, the government program  established that a moratorium should be declared only after  rejecting [contestar] the agreements that already have been  approved and after negotiating with the international financial  community.    Concerning abortion, the party decided that in the cases  provided for by the law women will have the right to make use of  public hospitals.    The ninth PT national meeting lasted three days. Lula said  that despite the fact that the program does not reflect  unanimity on some questions, the decisions were made by a  considerable majority. He added that the war of election  contenders will now begin, and that the PT will advocate a  campaign without dirty practices:    [Begin Lula recording] I cannot engage in dirty practices.  As  I said at the beginning, we will not answer any mean attitude by  our adversaries. [end recording]    As for the bugging of politicians' phones, Lula said he is  not afraid of the use of such methods because he usually takes  care of important conversations through personal contacts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Restrictions on Foreign Banks' Activity </F> May Be Lifted"]    [Text] Viktor Gerashchenko has said that currently  "options are being contemplated to lift restrictions on the  activity of foreign banks in Russia imposed by edict in fall  1993," and he hopes that this decision may apply not only to  banks that already had licenses to carry out operations in  Russia by the time the edict was passed. A spokesman for a  large Western bank has confirmed that during bilateral meetings  Russian officials also mentioned the possibility of lifting  restrictions on the activity of foreign banks in Russia in the  very near future. Informed Russian sources have also reported  that a bill on the subject may be submitted to the parliament as  early as the end of April.</p>

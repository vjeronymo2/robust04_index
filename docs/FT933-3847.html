			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Reality dawns in Palestine OUTSIDERS HAVE been urging Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation to recognise each other and allow the establishment of an autonomous Palestinian entity alongside the Jewish state for so long that the reaction to news that they have done so can only be immense relief. The question is whether the Israel-PLO recognition deal finalised yesterday and the self-rule agreement to be signed on Monday have come in time to pave the way for a comprehensive peace, or whether they are too late to do more than demonstrate how intractable the Middle East conflict has become. For more than a century, competition between Arab and Jew for the land of Palestine has poisoned the politics of the region. With the establishment of Israel and dispossession of many of Palestine's Arab inhabitants in 1948, followed by Israel's conquest of the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in 1967, the competition took on the air of a zero sum game in which each side could only assert its own right to exist at the expense of the other's. Short of a territorial and national compromise, or of a war in which the Arabs prevailed, the conflict could only end in the expulsion of all Palestine's remaining Arab inhabitants. Given that these include a significant number of Israeli citizens, the result would have been to destroy the legitimacy of Israel itself. Enormous credit To his enormous credit, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has decided to set aside his domestic opponents' territorial ideology, confront his countrymen's fears and accept these realities. The deals he has concluded with the PLO's Mr Yassir Arafat - the latter admittedly negotiating from extreme weakness - should enable most Palestinians in the territories to rule their own affairs and improve their economic conditions while preserving Israel's essential security requirements. It outlines the only conceivable settlement to the core issue of a conflict that has in the past led the world to the brink of thermonuclear war and, unresolved, could do so again. That, in essence, is why the west and the other regional powers have a vital interest in helping make this agreement work. It is easy to think of ways in which it might not. Many details of the self-rule accord have still to be negotiated, including highly sensitive questions concerning the relationship between Israeli security forces defending Jewish settlers in the territories and a yet-to-be-formed Palestinian police force. The PLO could split, thus eroding its leader's already shaky authority. The Palestinians themselves could descend into internecine strife, eventually prompting the return of the occupiers to areas from which they have withdrawn. Mr Arafat, used to strutting the international diplomatic stage and manoeuvring through the minefields of Arab politics, may prove incompetent in the more mundane tasks of municipal administration and undemocratic in his approach to a people that has never directly elected him to any office. Grassroots frictions Beyond the sensitivity with which the two sides handle the inevitable grassroots frictions, much will depend on the policies adopted by the new Palestinian authority, and on the Israeli government's response. Separation of the Palestinian entity from the Jewish state can only be a gradual and partial affair; tens of thousands of Palestinians will continue to work in Israel; and it is vital to the viability of the Palestinian proto-state that it obtain the freest of trading arrangements with both Israel and Jordan. Given those essential prerequisites, aid money from the west and from the wealthy Gulf states will be well spent in seeking to effect a rapid improvement in the Palestinian economy, underpinned by a well-focused programme of public works - preferably under the auspices of the World Bank. Without such an improvement in infrastructure and living conditions, accompanied within months by democratic elections, paper commitments by Israel and the PLO will be worthless, hoped-for investments by talented Palestinian businessmen will fail to materialise, and militancy of all kinds, including the Islamic variety, will proliferate. From now on, the choices do not get any easier. But at least they are concerned with concrete realities rather than conflicting aspirations.</p>

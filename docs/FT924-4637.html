			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes at day's high but volume stays low A RALLY in steel and shipbuilding shares, spurred by foreign investors, was one of the day's main features as the Nikkei average closed higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index closed up 213.04 at 17,683.65, the highest point of the day. The index fell to the day's low of 17,457.57 in the morning on small-lot profit-taking. Volume fell to 230m shares from 247m. Advances led declines by 777 to 202 with 145 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained for the eighth consecutive day, rising 15.81 to 1,323.35 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.61 to 1,071.27. Some traders believe that the technical resistance level of 17,700 could be broken. Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the Nikkei could rise to 18,000 in the near term. 'Public fund managers will want to increase their equities profile for future government fund allocation,' she said. However, with the Nikkei at 53 times earnings and prospects of an early corporate profits recovery uncertain, other investors are reluctant to commit large funds to the market. Some dealers said a bulk of corporations want to liquidate tokkin, or specified money trusts, at the 18,000 level. Steel makers and shipbuilders were bought by leading foreign brokers. Nippon Steel rose Y8 to Y291, NKK Y7 to Y256, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y13 to Y553. High-technology exporters were higher, with NEC up Y24 to Y695 and Toshiba gaining Y2 to Y622. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said the easing of the yen and an expected recovery of the US economy supported electronics issues which have been previously sold on profit concerns. Housing issues were higher on the 10.3 per cent rise in housing starts for October. Misawa Homes rose Y40 to Y1,120 and Daiwa House Industry advanced Y10 to Y1,430. Dealers were active in speculative theme stocks. Mitsui Mining and Smelting, the most active issue of the day, rose Y9 to Y508. The issue, which had surged recently on reports of a gold vein discovery, firmed yesterday on rumours that the company would announce the latest research data on the veins. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 172.46 to 18,961.05 in volume of 26.5m shares. The index posted its eighth straight rise on buying by public funds. Machinery and construction stocks gained while pharmaceuticals stalled. Nintendo, the video game maker, lost Y100 to Y10,500 on profit-taking. Roundup MARKETS in the Pacific Rim were mixed to lower. Manila was closed for a public holiday. HONG KONG fell nearly 3 per cent as China's row with Britain about democracy in Hong Kong took a turn for the worse at the weekend. The Hang Seng index ended 176.04 lower at 5,810.63 in low turnover of HKDollars 2.25bn. Among the most actives, HSBC Holdings was down HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 58.50, Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 1.50 lower at HKDollars 53.50 and Swire Pacific HKDollars 1.25 cents lower at HKDollars 31.00. AUSTRALIA lost early gains following the publication of a disastrous current account deficit for October of ADollars 2.04bn, compared with ADollars 1.74bn in September. The All Ordinaries index closed 2.7 lower at 1,448.1 in turnover of ADollars 188.2m. NEW ZEALAND ended steady, with falls in some leading stocks masking a strong rise in Fletcher Challenge and Telecom. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 1.90 to 1,547.37 in turnover worth NZDollars 28m. FCL, which began firming last week in anticipation of the sale of its unit, Rural Bank, ended 11 cents higher at NZDollars 2.22 after the sale was confirmed late on Friday. SINGAPORE posted strong gains as foreign investors' view of Singapore improved after healthy trade indicators. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 21.11 to 1,469.07 in volume of 132.9m shares against 177m. Shipyards and banks were the main gainers. Sembawang Shipyard rose 45 cents to SDollars 8.25 and DBS Foreign 40 cents to SDollars 13.80. SEOUL rose on expectations of an interest rate cut and a more flexible monetary policy. The composite index added 10.42 to 663.36. Posco and Dong-Ah Construction Industrial gained sharply on news that the two companies had been approached to take part in building a motorway between Beijing and Hong Kong. Both shares ended limit-up, with Posco gaining Won1,000 to Won26,100 and Dong-Ah Construction up Won800 to Won19,100. KUALA LUMPUR fell back on renewed selling in the afternoon. The composite index ended just 1.41 up at 641.89 in volume of 164.4m shares against 255.4m on Friday. Magnum fell 40 cents to MDollars 9.90 while Multi-Purpose Holdings and MISC foreign lost 15 cents each to MDollars 2.49 and MDollars 7.10 respectively.

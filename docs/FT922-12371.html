			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Bush and Clinton taking aim at each other PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas are increasingly taking aim at each other, rather than their respective party challengers. In speeches on Thursday in Pennsylvania, which holds the next primary on April 28, the president recycled an old proposal for increased student loans. Mr Clinton, front-runner for the Democratic nomination to oppose him in November's election, countered that the Bush plan was politically cynical, since the administration had previously done its best to cut student loan programmes and was now borrowing from one of his own main education policy positions. Mr Lamar Alexander, secretary of education, tartly observed that 'if Governor Clinton thinks it's a good idea, that's terrific. But his friends in Congress don't think it's a good idea. Maybe he should talk to them.' However, the main thrust of the Democrat's speech, given to the Wharton School of Business, was to attack the president for mismanagement of the economy and to present his own plans for the future. He gave a similar speech on foreign policy in New York two weeks ago. Mr Clinton cited the case of Mr Michael Milken, the convicted junk bond dealer (and, incidentally, a Wharton graduate), as an example of where the economic philosophy of the 1980s had gone wrong. 'We must bring an end to this something-for-nothing ethic,' he said. His blueprint, drawing together several previously stated positions, includes a new Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) tax credit for new investments; making permanent the existing research and development tax credit, now costing about Dollars 1bn a year; and a new 'enterprise tax cut' worth Dollars 200m a year. He would also establish what he called a 'future budget' to increase investment in the country's social and physical infrastructure, running from schools to roads and bridges. He promised to focus on the critical issue of converting defence programmes into civilian output and to put more resources into education and training. This would be broadly financed by cuts in military spending, a reduction in administrative outlays, and a determined effort in future to ensure that costs stayed below the rate of inflation. 'We spend a quarter of what our competitors do on training programmes for our workers,' Mr Clinton said. 'Last year Germany and Japan had productivity growth rates several times ours because they educate their people better and they organise their economies to change better than we do.' The two speeches mark the end of what had been a lull in the campaign, with Mr Clinton sidelined by an overworked voicebox and Mr Bush mostly attacking the Democratic-controlled Congress. The president's latest pitch is that he, not Mr Clinton, is the real architect of change, though his critics have observed that many of his recent policy proposals, including that on student loans, have been old ideas dressed up differently. But Mr Bush has less of a hill to climb in establishing his credentials than does Mr Clinton, who needs to put the 'character' questions behind him and clearly differentiate his policies from those of the president. This extends even to what the two men eat. Yesterday, Mr Clinton, in a Philadelphia street market, held up a stick of broccoli, the president's least favourite vegetable, and said he liked it. The impact of this staggering expression of preference has yet to be recorded in the polls. US turned off, Page 6</p>

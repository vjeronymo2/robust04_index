			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIDS-STRICKEN TEACHER REMEMBERED AS A HERO;  </P> <P> MEMORIAL: STUDENTS, FAMILY AND FRIENDS PAY TRIBUTE TO VINCENT L. CHALK, WHO  FOUGHT TO STAY IN THE CLASSROOM.  </P> <P> Vincent L. Chalk, the Irvine teacher with AIDS whose battle to stay in the  classroom established rights for other patients, was remembered Thursday as a  hero to his students and an inspiration to family and friends who paid a final  tribute to his life in an emotional memorial service.  </P> <P> More than 200 people packed the Stricklin/Snively Mortuary, where many  personally delivered tearful eulogies of the University High School teacher of  the hearing impaired who died Tuesday of complications from AIDS.  </P> <P> "He taught great things to all the children in high school," said University  High graduate Antonio Daverso, 20, who delivered a eulogy in sign language and  was interpreted for the gathering. "We all miss him and love him so much. We  have many, many memories. No matter what, he was there for us. We always looked  to him."  </P> <P> Donny Jacobs, 15, a freshman at University High, lingered long after the  services had ended, helping to comfort fellow students who had gathered near  the front of the chapel to admire a photographic display of their teacher. The  photographs were placed against a backdrop of floral arrangements near the  chapel's small wooden podium.  </P> <P> During the memorial, Jacobs described Chalk as a mentor who helped others  overcome their handicaps.  </P> <P> "I'm glad to have known him," Jacobs said. "Vince was a good teacher. I can't  express how much he meant to University High School."  </P> <P> Public attention was called to Chalk's life and career in 1987 during a legal  battle to keep his position as a teacher in the hearing impaired program.  Chalk's lawsuit against the Orange County Department of Education resulted in a  landmark court ruling protecting the job security of AIDS patients in  government jobs.  </P> <P> "Vince kept us all aware that we were there to learn, even as adults," said  Carol Rowland, head of University High's program for the hearing impaired. "The  strength that he had -- he always followed through. He was always there for the  kids."  </P> <P> In her brief remarks during the service, Rowland recalled a time at a meeting  of parents and teachers when she became upset and walked into an empty hallway  with tears in her eyes.  </P> <P> "He came up behind me, turned me around, put his hands on my shoulders and  said: 'Stop that! Stop that! Now, go in there and show 'em your stuff.' "  </P> <P> Rowland said she believed that the students were managing to deal with the  loss. "The kids are good. They are OK," she said.  </P> <P> Others who took their turns at the podium included Chalk's sisters, Cindy Haag  and Jodi Venable, who presented a poem they believed best described their  brother's death.  </P> <P> "Death is nothing at all," Haag read. "I have only slipped away into the next  room. I am I. You are you. Whatever we were to each other, we are still."  </P> <P> The service ended with a dramatic sign interpretation of Bette Midler's song,  "Wind Beneath My Wings."  </P></p>

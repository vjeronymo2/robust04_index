			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "Knudsen Put Norway's Case in Song"] </F>   [Text] London -- With the sounds of "Vestland, Vestland"  new Trade Minister Grete Knudsen put Norway's case in song in  London.    "It was a little bit exciting," Grete Knudsen said after  paying her maiden visit abroad in the EU [European Union]  context. She sang her song in the dignified rooms of the  British Foreign Office when she met her counterpart, European  Affairs Minister David Heathcoat-Amory, for talks yesterday.    "I was very frightened," she had to admit afterward. But  encouraged by the extremely positive tone she encountered  vis-a-vis Norway's negotiations with the EU and from the  minister himself, she kept her courage. There is no indication  of how the otherwise so formal British took this Norwegian song.  But Whitehall is still standing.    With Grete Knudsen in the international arena in the context  of the EU, things have come full circle for the Bergen  politician who, in the past, was in opposition in many areas to  parts of the Labor Party system.    Knudsen headed the Labor Party inquiry into Europe that led  to the party's decision to submit an application for membership.  And now the former "no to the EC" politician has thrown herself  completely into the battle for an agreement, and by her own  admission even with some degree of enthusiasm:    "I expect that we will pull it off. Both the British and the  Norwegian sides are putting their efforts into an agreement  before March," she said at a news conference. There was no  discussion of any scenario for what will happen if Norway falls  behind in the negotiations.    According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, the EU position  paper  on fisheries will not be ready before the end of this month.  Spanish demands for access to the available resources are  creating internal problems within the EU.    Grete Knudsen left London yesterday in the knowledge that  the  British are warm supporters of Norwegian EU membership. But the  question is whether all the positive vibes can be transformed  into concrete action and movement on the difficult points in the  negotiations. In the field of regional policy, Norway has run  into difficulties about having all of northern Norway included  in the Objective 1 category of the EU's regional support system.  It was thought until recently that this issue was as good as  solved, but Trade Minister Knudsen was told yesterday that the  British side also fears a contagious effect within the EU if  people are too kind about the support criteria.    As far as agricultural policy is concerned, Britain has in  the past had the greatest sympathy with Norway's demands for a  gradual transition to the EU prices for agricultural products,  but has given way inside the EU to the demand for EU prices on  foodstuffs from day one. But the signal from Britain now is  that it still has sympathy with the Norwegian demands and that  it is paving the way for flexibility in the negotiations.    The question has been raised in negotiating circles about  whether the new trade minister in the final phase of the  negotiations is mentally prepared to give way on some points in  order to win on others:    "I will not swap things for other things. We could end up in  situation where we have to allocate priorities, and this is  exactly what it is all about," Grete Knudsen said.</p>

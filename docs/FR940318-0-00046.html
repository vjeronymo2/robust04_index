			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule revises ECCN 1B70, which controls equipment that can be used in the production of chemical weapons precursors or chemical warfare agents and revises ECCN 1C61, which controls microorganisms and toxins, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ECCN 1B70  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) 1B70.a is revised by raising the control thresholds for reaction vessels, reactors, or agitators, by revising storage tanks and containers to include receivers, by specifying a heat transfer surface area for heat exchangers or condensers, by revising distillation columns to include absorption columns, by removing degassing equipment and adding multi-walled piping (previously controlled under 1B70.c). Finally 1B70.a now controls, not only equipment having contact surfaces that are made of nickel or alloys having more than 40% nickel by weight, alloys with more than 25% nickel and chromium by weight, glass, or graphite (for heat exchangers) but also equipment having contact surfaces that are made of the following: Fluoropolymers, glassed-lined (including vitrified or enamelled coating), tantalum or tantalum alloys, titanium or titanium alloys, zirconium or zirconium alloys, or graphite (for heat exchangers or condensers, distillation or absorption columns, or multi-walled piping only).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) 1B70.b is not revised and continues to control remotely operated filling equipment with contact surfaces made of nickel or alloys with more than 40% nickel by weight or alloys with more than 25% nickel and 20% chromium by weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 1B70.c is revised to control multi-seal, canned drive, magnetic drive, bellows, or diaphragm pumps, with manufacturer's specified maximum flow-rate greater than 0.6m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /h, or vacuum pumps with the manufacturer's specified maximum flow-rate greater than 5 m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /h (under standard temperature (0 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C) and pressure (101.30 kPa) conditions) having contact surfaces that are made of nickel or alloys with more than 40% nickel by weight, alloys with more than 25% nickel and 20% chromium by weight, fluoropolymers, glass or glass-lined (including vitrified or enamelled coating), graphite, tantalum or tantalum alloys, titanium or titanium alloys, zirconium or zirconium alloys, ceramics, or ferrosilicon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) 1B70.d is revised to control incinerators (previously controlled under 1B70.e) that are designed to destroy chemical warfare agents controlled on the U.S. Munitions List, or chemical weapons precursors controlled by ECCN 1C60, and that have specially designed waste supply systems, special handling facilities with an average combustion chamber temperature greater than 1000 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C in which all surfaces in the waste supply system that come into direct contact with the waste products are made from or lined with any of the following equipment: Nickel or alloys with more than 40% nickel by weight, alloys with more than 25% nickel and 20% chromium by weight, or ceramics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) 1B70.e is revised to control toxic gas monitoring systems and dedicated detectors capable of detecting chemical warfare agents controlled on the U.S. Munitions List or chemical weapons precursors controlled by ECCN 1C60, or detecting phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, or chlorine, and their compounds, at a concentration less than 0.3 mg/m3, and capable of continuous operation, or capable of detecting chemical compounds having a cholinesterase-inhibiting activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

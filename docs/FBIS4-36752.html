			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM  expresses the fear that the war in Yemen may drag on, as the  language of artillery and rockets continues to prevail over that  of dialogue and logic and amid signs that foreign parties are  interfering in the conflict. In its Monday issue, the paper  says that if a French magazine's report on the flow of Iranian  military aid to northern Yemen is true, this would be an  extremely serious development, boding ill to the Gulf area, the  Arabian Peninsula, and perhaps to the entire Middle East. The  paper points out that current signs give credence to the French  magazine's report. These signs are apparent in the growing  influence of the extremist groups in the ruling structure in  Sanaa, as the Reform Grouping is the main partner in the ruling  People's Congress. Other signs are manifest in the facilities  given by the Yemeni extremists to their fellows from other  countries. They give them, among other things, shelter and  transit facilities. This cooperation brings together the  extremist wings in Yemen and their counterparts in Iran on the  other shore of the Gulf.    AL-AHRAM asserts that the covert sectarian substance of this  war definitely indicates that Iran has a hand in the war,  particularly in view of the existing evidence affirming that  Iran supports the Shiite az-Zaidiya sect, which historically  dominates Yemen. Concluding its editorial, AL-AHRAM voices hope  that the two parties to the conflict in Yemen will be reasonable  and spare their country and their Arab and Islamic nation from  the evil looming on the horizon.</p>

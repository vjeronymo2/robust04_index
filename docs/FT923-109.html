			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / US seeks a chunk of European taste: The continental chocolate industry has been undergoing takeovers and blending On the face of it, it seems slightly improbable that two leading US food companies should be competing to pay more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m) for a medium-sized Nordic manufacturer of chocolate, snack and biscuit products which are almost unknown to consumers outside Scandinavia. However, the intensity of the contest between Kraft General Foods (KGF), part of tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris, and Hershey Foods to take over Freia Marabou of Norway is explained in two words: rarity value. In the last five years, Europe's chocolate industry has undergone rapid concentration as manufacturers concluded that it was faster and less costly to expand across borders by acquisition than by struggling to build brands and win market share a few points at a time. Today, two thirds of the European chocolate market is controlled by five companies: Nestle of Switzerland; Mars of the US; Jacobs Suchard, which is owned by Philip Morris; Cadbury Schweppes of Britain; and Ferrero of Italy. With few companies left to buy, prices soar when a manufacturer with proven brands and a strong market position becomes available. KGF's Dollars 1.5bn bid for Freia Marabou values the Norwegian company at about 25 times earnings - typical of the multiples paid for other big acquisitions in the industry in the past few years. How quickly such huge premiums can be recouped through increased efficiency and scale is questionable. 'A business school professor would conclude that a lot of big acquisitions are hard to justify on a cash-flow basis,' says Mr Clive Richardson of London brokers Henderson Crosthwaite. 'The large acquirers are taking a very long-term view.' In acquirers' minds, however, such doubts are often overshadowed by the prospect of seizing unrepeatable opportunities. Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman of Nestle, says the Pounds 2.5bn paid for Rowntree in 1988 was worthwhile because the deal 'decided relative positions in the industry for the next 100 years'. Though Freia Marabou sells little outside Scandinavia, it dominates a regional market which has so far been hardly penetrated by big multinational confectionery companies. It supplies a quarter of the biscuits, a third of the chocolates and almost half the snacks sold in the four Nordic countries. Hershey and Philip Morris have entered the bidding from different starting points. The former has long had most of its sales in the US, where its chocolate is a brand leader, and recently began scouting for small-scale acquisitions in Europe. Apart from its 18.5 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, it has so far made one - Gubor Schokoladen in Germany. Philip Morris is already Europe's fourth largest food manufacturer, with sales of about Dollars 8bn, and an extensive distribution network. Its operations there include coffee, cheese, dressings and pasta as well as chocolate. If the Freia Marabou contest is decided simply on price, the odds overwhelmingly favour Philip Morris. Its net income of Dollars 3bn last year exceeded Hershey's sales of Dollars 2.9bn, and its tobacco business generates massive surplus cash. Until recently, there had been doubts about the company's long-term commitment to chocolate. However, most analysts believe this week's bid has removed any uncertainty. 'Philip Morris has clearly signalled its intention to build an international empire in the business,' says Mr John Campbell of brokers County NatWest. Whether or not KGF wins Freia Marabou, the company is therefore likely to be on the look-out for further expansion opportunities in Europe. Among potential acquisition candidates, only three of any size remain: Ferrero, Lindt in Switzerland and Cadbury Schweppes of Britain. However, Ferrero and Lindt are controlled by families which have shown no inclination to sell out. Cadbury has long been touted as a potential takeover target, but seems determined to resist predators. Furthermore, although Cadbury's 30 per cent share of the UK chocolate market could be attractive to Suchard, which has almost no presence in Britain, the two businesses would be difficult to integrate. Indeed, the two companies are believed to have abandoned discussions on a proposed joint venture last year after concluding that there was little scope for productive co-operation. Not only do their strengths in moulded chocolate overlap, but a 'taste barrier' keeps continental demand for Cadbury's products small. Even if Europe's second rank chocolate manufacturers retain their independence, they must contend with steadily fiercer competition from industry leaders such as Nestle, Mars and Cadbury. Increasingly, growth in the European chocolate market is generated by transferring well-established brands internationally. Though national preferences in classic moulded chocolate differ widely, there is a growing convergence in taste for snack products and some speciality lines. Nestle has led the way, aggressively extending across Europe sales of Rowntree brands such as Kit-Kat bars and After Eight chocolate mints. These are now made on the continent as well as in Britain. This is an enormously expensive game, requiring powerful local distribution networks and lavish advertising and brand support budgets. Among the smaller, nationally-based producers, only Ferrero has so far played it with any success, largely because of its prowess at product innovation. Though Cadbury has acquired chocolate makers in France, Spain and Germany, it has lacked the scale and resources to establish a strong market position in these countries. Given the steadily rising stakes in the industry, the question facing second-rank chocolate makers is whether it is worth persevering with ambitions to build a Europe-wide presence, or whether they should retreat to a more defensible home base.

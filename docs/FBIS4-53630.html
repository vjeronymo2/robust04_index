			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Discussion by Yoshihiko Morozumi, former vice minister for </F> international trade and industry and currently adviser to  Electric Power Development Co., and Kaoru Moroi, author; place,  date not given: "Bureaucrat-Bashing Is the Very Path to National  Ruin!"]    [Text] If told to mind their own business,  bureaucrats will lose the will to carry on. Then, who in the  world will sustain Japan?    [Moroi] It seems to me that criticism of bureaucrats began  suddenly to grow stronger after the change of government last  summer [1993]. You are a veteran of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI], but for example, at  MITI there was a rare incident of a minister for international  trade and industry intervening in a vice ministerial appointment  because of promotion of an official who was going to run for  election. To be sure, the minister does have the power of  appointment and dismissal, but I wonder if it would not leave a  source of calamity for posterity if a precedent in which a  minister actually exercised that power at will were recognized;  but when one scans opinion in the media, it is not necessarily  that kind of atmosphere. Behind this there probably lies the  justifications of deregulation and administrative reform, and it  looks to me as though there exists, by common agreement, a view  of bureaucrats as villains, which holds that bureaucrats are the  ones who are riding on the trend of the times.    I think that, basically, Japan's bureaucratic organization  became too large. As might be expected, we probably must attempt  to make it leaner. But at the same time, I still want to make a  distinction between that recognition and today's trend of  bureaucrat-bashing.    [Morozumi] Today there is certainly a great deal of  criticism  of bureaucrats. But one thing that can be said is that there is  within that no debate on how an administrative organization or  bureaucratic organization should function within today's  government structure and political system. From the outset,  there is not even a clear consensus. Some people say that  bureaucrats should be weak, and government should be small, or,  conversely, they say that bureaucrats need not be so  deferential....    The other day I read comments by a certain British  industrialist in a newapaper, and he says that Japanese are  criticizing their own political and administrative system  because they take it for granted that U.S.-style organization  and use of staff are good, but that each country has its own  history and national character; therefore, it is to be expected  that each will have a system corresponding to that, and it is  not satisfactory to just go along with the current of the times  and attack one's own system without any fixed principle. It does  not mean that I go along with that argument, but it appears very  much as though the current criticism of the bureaucracy lacks a  philosophy or vision in that sense.    [Moroi] In the United States, bureaucrats are certainly  replaced every time there is a change of administration. But  that system works because in the United States, state  governments exist securely, and local autonomy is firmly  established. If in Japan we were to change top bureaucrats every  time that ministers changed, the bureaucratic system would end  up breaking down completely.  <H5>  The Bureaucracy Is Japan's Line of Resistance </H5>   [Morozumi] Of course, speaking from the constitutional setup  of a parliament-cabinet system, ministers--and there is no  requirement that they be Diet members--formally hold the power  to hire and fire personnel. But in employing that power, to  respect the spirit of personnel-neutrality, which guarantees  neutrality of administration, up till now there has been no  conspicuous intervention though there were informal  consultations. That had been a tradition.    I am not saying that there were no former examples at all.  But in those cases a scar was sure to remain. As a former member  of MITI, I think the recent incident was truly deplorable and  inexcusable. But, not in the sense of permitting politics to  intervene in personnel matters, in the sense that an undesirable  situation within administration was the cause of the trouble.    [Moroi] This is a layman's view, but I wonder if it is not a  matter of Japan's parliament-cabinet system itself, in which  Diet member-legislators are the chiefs of administration, are  not functioning skillfully today. In other words, the division  between administration and legislation has become very blurred.    [Morozumi] I think it has. I have been saying for some time  that Japanese politics has become administration. The politics  is not taking up what are by nature political matters, and  conversely, those very detailed technical questions have become  political matters. For example, as a question of the nation's  basic posture, let us assume a defense problem; if the  authorized number of Self-Defense officials changes suddenly  because the cabinet changes, it will influence morale. To what  extent has politics debated such things which really should be  debated as security questions, the question of becoming a  permanent member of the UN Security Council, and development of  Japan-U.S. relations? I feel that a situation which can only be  called a domestic Diet and domestic administration has continued  for a long time.    [Moroi] The commentary by the Englishman mentioned earlier  was aptly put; I suppose that the bill has come due for Japan  having come along under the U.S. umbrella, not making any  politically independent decisions while calling itself an  independent nation. Now that it suddenly becomes independent  leaving the U.S. umbrella and building a relationship of  equality by its own ideas, Japan is literally forced to bear the  brunt of internationalization. Both politicians and bureaucrats  resemble inexperienced maidens. Naturally, politicians ought to  be the ones who should take the lead at this kind of time, but  political leadership itself has become weaker, and with that  weak leadership, they are trying to intervene in administration.  An outsider sees best, and the recent political situation looks  like that to me.    [Morozumi] Looking at it internationally, one wonders just  how much one can really depend on the level of Japanese  politics, the direction of which is set by new politicians who  made their entrance with great fanfare by riding the crest of  some boom or other. The performance up till now has necessarily  been satisfactory. In the final analysis it may be the fault of  Japanese people. If that is so, who, in what manner, should  support Japanese action that will be sufficient to make  independent statements and independent achievements in the  international community? To give no thought to that, and just  bash bureaucrats because they stand out, will not solve a single  problem.    For example, arguments which as if to tell bureaucrats in a  rude manner to mind their own business are lined up in a certain  general magazine as a special issue on the bureaucrat question.  That is probably the trend of the times today. I think that  bureaucrats will be happy to mind their own business if they are  convinced that there is a reason they should do so and a  responsibility for them to do so. However, even if the kind of  malice or envy mentioned earlier and lots of arguments are lined  up against bureaucrats as though turning that malice or envy  into logic, bureaucrats will not easily accept it.    [Moroi] You called it the trend of the times, but rather  than  the true opinion of average Japanese citizen, I think that is  something which the mass media and journalism often create.  Journalism reported the public's distrust of politics on the  single point of monetary influence and corruption, but in fact,  there was annoyance over the fact that there were many  incompetent politicians and their level kept going down with  time. What the public now thinks about bureaucrats, in an  unsophisticated way, is probably that there are too many of them  and they cost too much in taxes. They do not think that  bureaucrats are too meddlesome; rather, they feel that  bureaucrats should stand firm. I feel that in the kind of  climate of which you speak, it would be a national loss for  bureaucrats to back down.    [Morozumi] It amounts to citing a self-serving example, but  I, too, am worried about that. In the course of Japan-U.S.  negotiations in all sorts of fields, including the economic  framework talks, the U.S. side has begun criticizing Japanese  bureaucrats severely. It is because Japanese bureaucrats do not  obey what the U.S. side says. The resistance line which rebuffs  the United States, even if it tries to overwhelm opposition in a  domineering manner by unreasonable arguments, is found in  bureaucrats. And the ones who understood that fact well were,  for example, the former trade representative, Carla Hill. The  United States would probably be overjoyed if the persons it  negotiates with are replaced by politicians.    [Moroi] Bureaucrats resist, but after all, Japanese  politicians back down quickly if you bluff a bit.    [Morozumi] How ironic it would be for officials now to mind  their own business and for Japanese to join with the United  States in rejoicing.  <H5>  The Danger of "Confusion Between the Imperial Family and the </H5> Shogunate"    [Moroi] But what is it like? I mean the relationship between  politics and that kind of think-tank type official, so to speak,  not officials who conduct business at the point of contact  between the public and administration. Are they being used by  politics or are they using politics? That is another area that  I cannot see clearly.    [Morozumi] That is the point. It is a somewhat disconnected  simile, but Japan is a country in which the duality of power of  the imperial court and the Shogunate has functioned in a fairly  skillful manner. Conversely, there is no example of a  single-power style having operated smoothly. There are such  examples as the military before World War II and of The General  Council of Trade Unions of Japan after the war; however, if  political power were to flaunt making decisions on its own  authority as "the supreme authority of state power," Japanese  society would indeed become a politically omnipotent social  system as though the imperial court and the Shogunate had  merged. But would Japanese have been able to use that kind of  system in a skillful manner? Would it have been possible to  elevate Japan's level as a nation by that means?    I think that the role of politics is bear the responsibility  for choices. And as for administration, I think that officials  are entities which should first, provide the options for choices  and second, execute in a fair and neutral manner the laws which  are decided on. But the transformation of politics into  administration began by politicians saying that they would do  both of those things by themselves. I do not know for sure  whether that is Ozawa's idea, but I would like to venture to ask  whether one can govern the country efficiently that way, and  what its quality level would be.    [Moroi] Ultimately, I always end up returning to the  post-war  argument; under the U.S. occupation, Japan did not consider  independently the political and administrative principles and  philosophy set forth in the preamble of the Constitution. Japan  has only come along until now by incorporating into the existing  system what it was told by the occupation authorities.    [Morozumi] If people say that in future Japan's  administrative functions should be taken over by politicians,  how about Japan, too, copying the United States and making  everyone up to police chiefs and prosecutors subject to  election? That is probably fine for a country where an ethos by  which even the fact that a sheriff can carry a pistol on his hip  is because he was chosen in an election has permeated to the  farthest reaches of the society. But that is not true of Japan.  I cannot help but say that to bring in that kind of idea and  suggest putting it into practice is an unrealistic argument for  marital union between the Shogunate and the Imperial Family.    [Moroi] Therefore, what I would also like to ask you is that  in the trend which is like Edo and Kyoto uniting, Diet members  who are former bureaucrats have begun to increase greatly. One  of the embers that ignited the incident of interference in  promotions by the minister for international trade and industry  was also the problem of promoting an official who was standing  as a candidate. What will happen to the question of independence  and neutrality of administration if the number of politicians  who were former bureaucrats increases? Will not the distinction  between politics and administration become more and more blurred?    [Morozumi] It will. Particularly if one is speaking of zoku  [interest group] Diet members, this is without doubt an evil of  the long reign of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and its  origin lies in bureaucrats having cozied up to politicians or  political parties. That is, at the beginning they cozied up to  politicians and curried favor with them, thinking it would be  good for developing their own work. Then they went beyond  currying favor, and this time came to strongly aspire to become  politicians themselves. But in a certain sense, this can be seen  as a counteraction in which the result of politicians' position  having become stronger is that bureaucrats, and especially the  younger generation, fell into losing confidence in the relative  significance of the position of bureaucrats. In order to  compensate for losing confidence, they themselves aspire to be  politicians, and one cannot deny that it is charged with danger  of confusion between the Shogunate and the Imperial Family.    But if we change the way we look at it, this problem  probably  becomes one which relates to the foundation of Japanese  government.    [Moroi] Politicians who are former bureaucrats are not the  only problem.    [Morozumi] You are right. One cannot say that the rapid  increase in second-generation Diet members is without problems,  and Diet members who are former members of labor unions and  former members of prefectural assemblies also have their  problems. That is, Diet members come only from such places is  the basic problem of Japanese society, and that indeed is a  large factor which determines the level of Japanese politics.    [Moroi] Therefore, it is no use to argue about unimportant  details of the problem of bureaucrats and administration without  debating that part in a rigorous manner. Similarly, we have  dealt for a long time with the debate on revision of the  election law and a law to prevent corruption, but if we are to  carry on a substantial debate, since democracy politics does not  operate by the power of a monarch or military power or by the  power of a party in a Communist Party dictatorship, it is bound  to cost money. Actually, I think it is necessary for us to pin  down first the difficult question of to what extent it is  acceptable to spend money. It may be that the question of Diet  members who are former bureaucrats will also, in the end, become  that kind of delicate debate.    [Morozumi] I agree. Let me say in passing, and this is also  true of the minister in the current personnel incident, that no  one has a side which is as cold toward bureaucrats as a Diet  member--and it may not be limited to Diet members--who was once  a bureaucrat. It is probably because in a certain sense they can  be independent of bureaucrats. Diet members who are not former  bureaucrats need help from bureaucrats; so, they cannot be cold  toward them.    [Moroi] It is not unlike stories that if a committee  chairman  of a labor union, and a militant type at that, leaves the union  and becomes an entrepreneur, he will carry out coercive labor  measures in such a way as not to recognize unions, and to crush  them if formed.  <H5>  Can One Expect Fairness From the "Invisible Hand"? </H5>   [Moroi] Incidentally, I also mentioned this at the  beginning,  but the one thing I must agree with in the chorus of criticism  of bureaucrats is the poor efficiency, the red tape, of Japan's  bureaucratic system. One might call it elaborate, but why did it  become like this?    [Morozumi] Let me give a technical explanation. If we search  for its roots it is probably something like this. There are many  laws, there are many items for authorization, and there are many  bureaucrats. That was because postwar democratic politics  decided that every matter related to the rights and duties of  the people must be set by law. But in practice it takes too much  time and trouble to explain each and every item to Diet members  and make a law. Therefore, on the economic-policy side we  thought we would do it by persuasion and dialogue, that is, by  point-of-contact guidance. There existed in this, to whatever  degree, a sense that laws are a nuisance. However, if it turns  out that, from the viewpoint of human rights, entrusting it to  the arbitrary decisions of officials, which is termed  point-of-contact guidance, does not guarantee rights, there is  no choice but to return to laws. That is, it becomes  authorization and regulation. The above is strictly a technical  explanation.    I am very much in favor of reducing the items for  authorization and criticizing red tape. But my opinion differs  fundamentally from that of the members of today's financial  circles in regard to the kind of criteria by which it should be  done. They call in unison for operating by free competition and  entrusting things to market principles. This, too, can probably  be called the dominant trend today. Adam Smith is fine. But what  are market principles? Its reverse side are profit principles.  Will social fairness and national welfare really be guaranteed  by profit principles? At least in the past, we could not trust  the "invisible hand." It was, rather, expansion of the gap  between rich and poor.    Do the Japanese public think that cheap government is better  and that a political philosophy like that of the U.S. Republican  Party is better? Speaking from the standpoint of working under  the principle of a certain kind of fairness and neutrality, not  just whether taxes are low, and judging from the inevitability  of a time when we are moving toward a nation of aged, a welfare  state, it is difficult to accept, even if free competition and  market principles are presented to us as though they are symbols  of supreme authority and we are told to mind our own business.    [Moroi] I agree with you on that point. Market principles in  themselves have neither philosophy nor morality. One need only  make a profit. Enterprises and business have, by nature, no  such thing as ethics. That is precisely why morality is required  in it, and administration and legislation are sought. It would  be terrible if we really entrusted everything to market  principles and such. If one asks what were the various kinds of  regulations, they were not the spirit of the new constitution,  but I suspect it was a matter of how to go on making an equal  society, and that in order to do that, regulations which control  market-principle-type tyranny by the strong gradually became  necessary. It is simply incomprehensible to me that even the  mass media, which once professed to be the guardian diety of  equality and fairness, now forgets that and suddenly joins in  the chorus calling for abolition of the tax system. The  regulations and items for authorization become out-of-date over  the course of time, and at the same time new items become  necessary. Notwithstanding that we must abandon what is old and  make something new, we pile new things on top of previous items;  so, it ends up becoming red tape. Does it mean that politics  was lazy?    [Morozumi] No, one cannot necessarily say that.  Administration can scrap and build on its own, and it probably  should. It is good to scrap regulations which should be scrapped  by bureaucrats themselves. I am not opposed to keeping  regulations to a minimum; I am opposing the simple philosophy  which says that the fewer regulations there are, the better it  is.    [Moroi] You remember there was a Provisional Council for the  Promotion of Administrative Reform. It has been widely reported  that it could not produce an ideal report because of opposition  by bureaucrats. The problem of regulations and items to be  authorized is one thing; if it became a matter such as  consolidation and integration of the bureaucratic system, could  it be done by the power of bureaucrats themselves?    [Morozumi] One could also be stated this way, for example.  If  one were to assemble several bureaucrats now and tell them to  debate and come up with the long-term outlook for Japan's  administrative reform according to their individual  qualifications, a definite plan would emerge within one or two  months. But if you told them to debate it together with one as  representative of the Ministry of Finance, one as representative  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and one as  representative of the Ministry of Home Affairs, it would  absolutely not emerge. Therefore, it is not a matter of them not  having ideas. Why can they not do it? I often wonder this  question. To tell the truth, I do not understand what it really  is, but I think, for one thing, the organization law of each  ministry is causing problem.    The work conducted by each agency is listed in the  organization law of each ministry. Such being the case, when a  new problem arises, an argument is bound to develop as to which  agencie's work it falls under. One can probably say that turf  wars derive from the very fact that it is listed in laws. In  short, if, for example, the content of books published by  private-sector publishers were determined in advance by law so  that company A published works on literature and company B  published works related to law, there would be bound to be a  fight over the publication of books whose content fell between  law and literature. When all is said and done, it is the same  thing as that. When you get to that point, it is a question of  choice; so, probably the only way is for politics to decide.    When the issue of administrative organization comes up for  discussion, questions of international cooperation, for example,  are within the province of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  MITI, and the Ministry of Finance; therefore, there sometimes  emerge lateral-organization views that cut across existing  agency boundaries, such as that it would be better to make a  Ministry of International Cooperation. I am not impressed with  this kind of idea. The people of the country would be troubled  before bureaucrats were troubled. If a Ministry of International  Cooperation is acceptable, a Ministry of Social Welfare should  also be acceptable. And, if we divided each administrative unit  by function, it would end up becoming unclear what was what.  Vertical division by agency is not without problems, but if we  create a ministry for international cooperation, it is certain  that there would develop within it departments and bureaus in  charge of foreign affairs, trade and industry, and so on. It  means that this kind of lateral organization would retransform  into vertical organization.    [Moroi] But when I look at the Uruguay Round and so on, I  cannot help feeling that neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  nor the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries  functioned in a satisfactory manner. Both were timid, and I  cannot deny a kind of vexation just like when a fly ball falls  between fielders who are deferring to each other.    [Morozumi] Concerning current diplomatic problems, there is  a  very strict rule called centralization of diplomacy, and because  it cannot be removed by any means, every ministry must operate  within its framework.    [Moroi] Therefore, we entrust to the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs even matters which need not be entrusted to it. It will  not do for the trade representative to negotiate with full  authority and have what is left be only the talk with the White  House.    [Morozumi] Well, this problem has a long history that,  before  the war, when they created that Ministry of Greater East Asian  Affairs, the chiefs of every bureau in the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs did their best to oppose it by submitting letters of  resignation. There could probably be a debate over whether that  logic is appropriate in this era of internationalization, but....    [Moroi] Certainly, vertically organized administration  probably has merits. If that is the case, I hope that  administrators will cooperate with each other firmly by the  leadership of politics.    [Morozumi] Yes. The present cabinet system also has the  Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs and the Councilors'  Office on External Affairs, and as organizational theory, it is  arranged that this place is in charge of the coordination  function. But since the power of each ministry is strong,  coordination does not turn out satisfactorily.    [Moroi] Particularly when politics is weak, decisionmaking  will end up being timid. Putting aside Kakuei Tanaka's merits  and demerits, the biggest problem today is probably that  politicians lack Kakuei-Tanaka type resolve.  <H5>  Not a Public Servant, "One Who Serves the Common Good" </H5>   [Morozumi] Certainly there exist limitations on bureaucratic  thinking. I say this with the sense of a tribute to former Prime  Minister Tanaka, who I served as vice minister for international  trade and industry; his thinking was totally opposite to the  thinking of we bureaucrats. Our thinking is bound to be  deductive; first there is an idea, and in the development of  that idea, we pick up individual items and fit them in. But  former Prime Minister Tanaka's thinking was inductive. He would  collect practical questions and create a picture before one knew  it. It was like making a garden by bringing rocks from river  banks here and there at random. In our case, first we draw a  plan of the garden. We go so far as to determine the size and  shape of the rocks and bring only those rocks that fit it. That  is what was great about Mr. Tanaka; conversely, that is also the  reason we bureaucrats, who have not spent our lives gaining  practical experience, are criticized as lacking conceptual  ability which is rooted in reality.    [Moroi] We are told that Kakuei Tanaka once called for  raising teachers' salaries by 50 percent. What I would like to  ask you about is the question of bureaucrats'compensation and  the satisfaction in their lives. Also, according to the tone of  the media, retiring from the bureaucracy to a good position in  the private sector is absolutely bad. If that is so, elite  bureaucrats retire from office too early, and it is odd why the  media does not discuss the nature of bureaucrats' compensation  up to the time of their retirement at the same time. The  government agencies of Kasumigaseki usually have their lights  burning until past midnight. In fact, a MITI bureaucrat whom I  know told me that he rarely returns home before 0200 hours. If  one continues that kind of life, one will surely becomes  frustrated. After all that, if bureaucrats are told that they  must not retire to a good position in the private sector, I am  sure they get discouraged and no longer want to serve as  bureaucrats.    [Morozumi] There are all sorts of arguments concerning  retirement by bureaucrats to good positions in the private  sector. I do understand, for example, the argument, developed by  the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, opposing  retirement to public corporations and government enterprises  because, looking at it from the perspective of career staff,  someone who has just entered the organization is putting on  airs. A large corporation has hundreds or thousands of  subsidiaries, and therefore there is no difficulty finding other  employment; however, there are no such opportunities in  government agencies. If one compares things in relation to that  one point, if bureaucrats' compensation is poor while on active  government service, staff will not gather.    When I entered the Ministry of Commerce and Industry before  the war, the minister was Nobuskuke Kishi, who was 42 years old;  the administrative vice minister, Etsuro Shiina, was younger.  Chiefs of all the bureaus, from the General Affairs Bureau down,  there were even ones in their 30's. The early retirement is  partly a hangover from that time. But today the number of years  which an official serves has greatly increased, and for all  practical purposes it has become lifetime work. Young staff will  not gather unless we devise some sort of system to give them  appropriate salaries.    [Moroi] I think that what is at the root of media criticism  of bureaucrats is a "public servant" thesis. They do not come  right out and say "you are only public servants," but I feel  that they have a premise of looking down on bureaucrats as  "servants."    [Morozumi] The translation of "public servant" [Japanese  transliteration of the English phrase] is clumsy. If you consult  a dictionary, it may be listed as "koboku," but the meaning is  "one who serves the common good" because the main idea is found  in the point that the work of bureaucrats deals not with a  private enterprise, but with total capital, that it deals not  with some private individuals but with the entire society. What  is stressed is the "public," not the "serve."    [Moroi] What do they mean by "servant"! As in all men are  created equal, democratic societies do not have relationships of  superior and inferior, right?    [Morozumi] Bureaucrats probably do not dare to dispute being  classified as "servants" in a democratic society.    [Moroi] When I think about that kind of problem, I always  think of bureaucratic structures during the Tokugawa central  government which included elders and junior elders. The amount  of their stipend was, at most, 40,000 or 50,000 koku [1  koku=5.119 bushels] of rice. They were small daimyo [feudal  lord]. But they also had authority, and I think they had their  own pride and high ideals. I think that the true worth of  Japanese government offices is that bureaucrat ability and pride  which continues uninterrupted. All sorts of things are said  about them, but Japan's bureaucrats are excellent.    [Morozumi] Well, I do not say they work for the sake of the  country, but people with old-fashioned sensibility, so to speak,  who dislike the kind of work where one takes money into  consideration, join up. Persons with such hidden intentions as  using the position as a stepping stone to political circles also  do come. But as things stand now, such excellent staff also  gradually disperse to the private sector or other places.    [Moroi] Bureaucrats are not ordinary salaried staff. I think  they have similar to such journalists as newspaper reporters, an  aspect of being able to go on working because they have that  kind of consciousness.    [Morozumi] What I said to Eiji Suzuki of the Provisional  Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform was that I  hope the council would please not destroy officials' will to  work. I said that if they say there need not be a will to work,  they should create the most efficient kind of salaried worker  organization. But the trade-off will be that staff will not  gather. If that happens, the level of Japan's public relations  will probably decline. The level of Japan's administration and  politics will probably lose international competitiveness. It  was in that sense that I said that the problem will not be  solved by telling bureaucrats to mind their own business.  Since I was a bureaucrat of the prewar school, I joined the  ministry with pride in service. And I think that the image of  an official, image of a bureaucrat, that we inherited has been  inherited, even after the era of the Public Service Workers' Law  arrived after World War II, by a generation which is  conceptually close to us. However, it has probably grown weaker.  A generation has been born which scoffs at service without a  fixed amount, and which returns home when the time arrives. I do  sense a gap there. One can probably say that in that transition  period that today's problems have arisen.    [Moroi] No, speaking from my own observation, leaving aside  the question of working hours, rather in the generation of the  bureau-chief class of many government agencies today, I sense a  "public servant" type of timid posture. Conversely, it is in  those one level lower, in the division-chief class, that I think  the kind of prewar-type pride or confidence that you spoke of  now seem to exist. That can also be sensed in MITI's recent  trouble; if that is so, it will be another new generation gap.    [Morozumi] Well now, that is a very encouraging observation,  but I am sure the times will also be critical of it.</p>

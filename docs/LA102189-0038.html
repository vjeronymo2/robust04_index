			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REGARD RUNS TO VICTORY AT LOS ALAMITOS FEATURE  </P> <P> Regard led every step of the way, winning the Pocahontas Handicap by three  quarters of a length Friday night at Los Alamitos Race Course. Cameron Aubin's  bay filly by Moon Lark won her second stakes in a row and sixth of seven starts  since returning to Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> "I knew she had to steal the lead going 400 yards," trainer Blane Schvaneveldt  said. "I haven't run her 400 yards in a while. She's older now and she's  developed and maybe her heart is bigger now."  </P> <P> Regard defeated the favorite, Aqua Treasure, by three-quarters of a length, who  was a half in front of 17-1 longshot Lil Bit Rusty.  </P> <P> Regard paid $8.40 to win, $3.60 to place and $3 to show. Aqua Treasure paid  $3.40 and $2.60. Lil Bit Rusty paid $4.80 to show.  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Russia in warning on N-pacts RUSSIA'S new deputy defence minister, Mr Andrei Kokoshin, yesterday warned Ukraine that Russia alone could observe and sign nuclear treaties as successor to the Soviet Union. The issue has been complicated by this week's statement by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, that the US was willing for all four former Soviet states holding nuclear weapons - Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan - to sign the strategic arms reduction treaty. The dispute between the former Soviet states is delaying signing of the Start treaty and talks on a Start Two, which Mr Kokoshin is anxious to begin. Mr Kokoshin said Russia's new defence doctrine would involve the armed forces playing a purely defensive role. Troops trained to operate behind enemy lines in a war in Europe would be redeployed as rapid reaction forces for emergencies. The army would be reformed on more west European lines. States could have nuclear cover provided by Russia, 'though they might have agreements with other nuclear states as well'.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOFTENING BY IRAQ ON KUWAIT SEEN IN REACTION TO ARAFAT  </P> <P> Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has won the  backing of six Arab countries for a peace initiative that might open the door  to an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, according to a PLO official.  </P> <P> Arafat discussed the plan with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz on Saturday.  </P> <P> A senior Palestinian official said afterward there are grounds for optimism  that a political solution can be found for the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Diplomats said the idea implies a softening of the Iraqi position and could  indicate that Baghdad is willing to shift from its refusal to withdraw from  Kuwait.  </P> <P> Arafat, one of only three Arab leaders who have openly sided with Iraq, has  been shuttling around Arab capitals trying to win support for a negotiated  solution.  </P> <P> Arafat's political adviser, Bassam abu Sharif, told reporters Saturday that the  new plan provides for a step-by-step approach, with the gulf crisis to be  tackled first and the rest of the Middle East problem later.  </P> <P> The procedure would hinge on a commitment by the United States and the four  other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to implement U.N.  resolutions on Israel.  </P> <P> "This is a linkage in principle. . . . We can start with the hottest problem in  the Middle East, the gulf, but then have to be sure the next step will be  dealing with Palestine," Abu Sharif said.  </P> <P> According to Abu Sharif, Arafat has won backing in principle from Libya,  Algeria and Yemen, as well as Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia.  </P></p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Dutch Bonds: Guilder's stability paves the way for 10-year yields FOR the past 10 years or so the Dutch central bank has managed to maintain the guilder at virtual parity with the German currency. This policy has gained so much credibility with the money markets that the Dutch authorities barely have to lift a finger to get their currency back in line. It is a situation that the Banque de France, forced to carry out large intervention at the start of the year when the franc was under heavy speculative pressure, and possibly facing the prospect again following the franc's slide last week, might envy. It is a situation that has enabled the yield on 10-year benchmark Dutch bonds to be the only one within the European exchange rate mechanism to fall below the German equivalent for a sustained period. Even after the enormous shifts of money back into Germany at the end of last week as international investors finally came to the conclusion that their pessimism over the outlook for the German economy might be overdone, the yield on Dutch government bonds of 10 years' maturity is still something like 10 basis points under the going rate in Germany. The Netherlands has public borrowing requirement for this year of about Fl 42.4bn, a level which most analysts concede to be in the region best described as comfortable. The capital funding has gone so well that the Treasury announced at the beginning of June that it had raised Fl 34.4bn in the market and there would be no more borrowing in the capital markets until September. Many investors see the Netherlands as Germany without the burden of reunification. German inflation is running at 4.2 per cent compared with 2.1 per cent in the Netherlands. However, the strong ties between the two countries are working to the disadvantage of the Netherlands. According to some Dutch economists, there is little likelihood of 10-year bond yields - one of the strongest indicators of long-term economic confidence - falling much further below that in Germany. The Netherlands needs the market credibility that the link with Germany provides and, with 30 per cent of its exports going to Germany, it is inextricably tied to its neighbour. Mr Arno Barens, European economist with F. Van Lanschot Bankiers, the Dutch commercial bank, believes: 'The spread will reach parity by the end of the year; not so much because of the good performance of the German economy but more because of the close link between the two and the arbitrage opportunities that provides.' The Dutch central bank has been paring its short-term rates in order to maintain currency parity and although its floor rate, the official advances rate, is at 6.5 per cent against the German discount rate of 6.75 per cent, the 'special advances rate', which is used as a fine tuning, mechanism is only just below at 6.7 per cent. As Ms Ellen van der Gulik of the new Dutch merchant bank Mees Pierson says: 'The markets realise that if you push the guilder up too much the central bank will punish them. Even if the whole ERM blew up and Germany had to get out the Netherlands would still stay with it.'</p>

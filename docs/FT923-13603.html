			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Two lead race to be president of India THE Indian parliament today elects the nation's ninth president to succeed Mr Ramaswami Venkataraman, whose five-year term ends on July 24. Over 4,500 parliamentary representatives will vote. The contest is largely a two-man race between Mr Shankar Dayal Sharma, India's vice-president, the favourite to win and the ruling Congress (I) party nominee, and Mr George Gilbert Swell, the opposition-sponsored candidate. Mr Ram Jethmalani withdrew on Saturday. The only other candidate is Mr Joginder Singh, sponsored by a group of legislators. The contest is the culmination of a new phase of Indian politics. The presidential debate has broken the opposition ranks, and radically altered the agenda of the main opposition parties. The Communist party of India (Marxist) did not bow to pressure from its allies, the National Front, and has decided to support the ruling party candidate. This has left the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party in uncomfortable alliance with the National Front, to support the opposition candidate. This regrouping is seen as an indication the opposition is reactivating itself to pressure the ruling party. It could undermine the influence of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. India's new president will be announced on July 25. The ruling party candidate has always had an edge over the opposition candidate. The Indian presidency, can be highly influential in times of turmoil.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): UK income funds may face crisis - A research group predicts that some trusts may be forced to cut their distributions in the months ahead BACKING A UK equity income trust has proved to be very profitable for investors over the past decade - it was the second best unit-trust sector over the 10 years to January 1, 1992, with an average rise of 405.2 per cent. But could this be about to change? Fund Research, the group which specialises in analysing collective funds, warned last month that 'some income funds will be forced either to cut their distributions in the months ahead or 'trade' their portfolios heavily to capture income.' The latter tactic would involve buying shares just before they pay their dividends. Since shares fall in value when they become ex-dividend, this could easily lead to a poor capital growth performance. The problem for equity income funds is the recession. After borrowing too much in the boom years, many UK companies face cash-flow difficulties. Cutting the dividend is an obvious option to save cash, despite the pleas of institutional investors such as M&amp;G for companies to maintain pay-outs. The share price of a company that has announced a dividend cut will usually fall very quickly - which means that shareholders will lose both capital and income. And if fund managers opt for shares with very high yields, they can face very high risks. Shares trade on a high yield when the market feels there is a strong danger that the company may fail to pay its dividend altogether - or even go bust. Managers who buy high-income shares hope that the market is wrong about at least some of these companies - and that the gains they accrue will outweigh the occasional losses. That was certainly true for much of the 1980s, but it may well be that in the 1990s, the balance has moved in the opposite direction. Individual funds will suffer accordingly. The Standard Life UK Equity High Income unit trust, for example, has dropped by 20.5 per cent over the last six months. According to Peter Jeffreys, managing director of Fund Research, the better-managed funds can avoid these pitfalls. 'Quality is the watchword for 1992, with diligent research arguably more important than at any time in the past.' A good guide for consistency is whether a fund is above average (ie, appears in the top half of its sector) over many different periods of time. The following funds have produced above-average performances in the UK Equity Income sector over one, three, five and 10 years; CU Equity Income, Equity &amp; Law Higher Income, Invesco UK Income, James Capel Income, Lazard UK Income, Lloyds Bank Income, New Court UK Equity Income, Pearl Income, Prolific High Income and Schroder Income. The top-performing unit and investment trusts are listed on pages 34 and 35 of this Review</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Speaker Struzik Will Ask Prime Minister </F> for a Substantive Talk With `S'; People Do Not Like To Be  Slighted"]    [Text] "The speaker will suggest to the prime minister  that our talk be about specifics, that it be substantive, and  that it lead to solutions that would end this dispute and allow  us to take a breath," Solidarity ["S"] Chairman Marian  Krzaklewski told RZECZPOSPOLITA after the Tuesday [15 March]  meeting with Senate Speaker Adam Struzik of the Polish Peasant  Party. If the meeting with Waldemar Pawlak does not result in  negotiations, "S" will announce the preparation of a "schedule  of broader pressure." There may be a mass protest, a strike  cumbersome to the people, as a reaction to the deteriorating  material situation of employees; however, there may also be a  doubly-strong reaction to the slighting of the people by the  authorities. "Such a reaction is often greater because people  do not like to be slighted by the authorities," said the "S"  chairman.  <H5>  The First "Exchange of Views" </H5>   At the press conference, Krzaklewski said that the meeting  with the Senate speaker was "the first platform for an exchange  of views" with the authorities. The talk, to which he was  invited by Struzik, served, among other purposes, as "the  preparation of the ground" for the Friday meeting with Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak. "I drew the speaker's attention to  the fact that the talk with the prime minister cannot be  prepared in advance, be courteous, and be held only for the sake  of being held. If this is what the government thought, the  scenario for further developments will be more dramatic."    Asked about whether Struzik is playing the role of a  mediator  in the talks between "S" and the government, Krzaklewski said  that "one can certainly speak about the role of a mediator, but  not just that" because the speaker "is not a neutral person."    According to the "S" head, during that meeting he discussed  the strike situation and the union demands; both of them debated  them and "jointly sought ways to reach agreement": methods,  scope, and consistency in implementing these demands.  Krzaklewski added that, before that, Struzik had forwarded a  letter to "S," in which he signaled the possibilities of  including the issues suggested by the union in the Senate  debate. The "S" head is not counting on a radical change in the  Budget Law, but on "resolving the problem through decisions  around the budget."    Krzaklewski stated that he and Struzik had come to a mutual  conclusion that "it is bad that so far no substantive talk on  the demands has been held, and that the polemic is being held  through the mass media." According to them, the "information  hype in the mass media" impedes agreement, even though they have  similar views. Both of them agreed that there must be more  direct contacts between the parliament and the trade unions.    The speaker and the "S" head also discussed "issues  concerning the political system": implementation of the "Pact on  Enterprise" and giving state property to citizens.  <H5>  Clubs and a Serious Force </H5>   According to Krzaklewski, the government treats agreement  with "S" as a concession to a serious force, the only opponent  (with the current parliamentary majority, it does not need to be  afraid of either the president or the opposition), which may  become stronger after agreement is reached. During the  protests, the union saw what the real program of the center left  is really like, and it turned out, said the "S" head, that many  parties have an antiemployee program.    Asked about "S" political clubs, Krzaklewski said that the  decisions must be made by the union's congress; however, for the  time being, "S" cannot afford to "draw attention to specific  issues" because it must implement important union tasks. The  "S" head added that he could see the necessity for the union  activists to get in touch with people and that discussions,  without the establishment of any parties and the usage of the  "S" sign, are within the limits of trade union activities.  Krzaklewski would like to take advantage of these contacts by  building "the broadest possible contract," a contract for names  and for the resolution of problems before the self-governmental  elections."  <H5>  Pickets and Strikes </H5>   Yesterday the action was joined by the Swietokrzyski Region,  with the strike by the plant in Konskie as well as the Slupsk  Region (among other strikes, the strike by the Uska Shipyard).  National Committee Press Spokesman Piotr Zak explained that 24  miners who are on strike in the "Andaluzja" mine went  underground and submitted not only wage demands to the Bytom  Coal Partnership, but also national "S" demands. Zak says that  a similar situation may develop in the "Silesia" mine, which  belongs to the Vistula partnership.    Today, from 0400 to 0800, the municipal transportation  establishments in the Katowice Voivodship (among other places,  in Katowice, Sosnowiec, and Zawiercie) will go on strike.  Contrary to earlier statements, Bydgoszcz will strike only  today. Also, Bialystok will participate in a protest on  Thursday, when the union's "popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] picketing begins in front of the Sejm. The picketing  is supposed to end regardless of whether the new popiwek law is  passed.</p>

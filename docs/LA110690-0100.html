			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SLAYING SHOWS LANCASTER ISN'T IMMUNE TO URBAN ILLS  </P> <P> It's the kind of murder case that makes people in Lancaster realize they don't  live in a country town anymore: a 14-year-old girl from a devoutly religious  family is found strangled to death beside a desert road, hours after running  away from home in a relative's car.  </P> <P> And while Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators have made the slaying of  Angela Migliore a top priority, they say they have developed few leads since a  motorist found the girl's body Oct. 11. The Lancaster City Council planned to  offer a $5,000 reward at its meeting Monday night in hopes that someone will  come forward with new information.  </P> <P> "It's a real high priority case," said Sgt. Jacqueline Franco, a sheriff's  homicide investigator. Franco has spent weeks talking to people who knew Angela  and canvassing the neighborhood where the teen-ager apparently abandoned the  car after slipping out of the house late at night.  </P> <P> "She was 14 years old," Franco said. "We don't want this to happen to anyone  else up here."  </P> <P> Officials hope the reward will generate the same kind of attention that  followed the area's first gang-related slaying earlier this year, when a high  school soccer star died in a shooting outside a party.  </P> <P> The Migliore case is more mysterious. Neighbors and investigators describe the  Migliore family, who were not available for comment, as religious and strict.  The Migliores moved to the western Lancaster neighborhood about three years ago  from Edwards Air Force base after Angela's father, Daniel Migliore, retired  from the Air Force, neighbors said.  </P> <P> Angela attended services three or four time a week at Lancaster Baptist Church  and was an eighth-grade student at the church school, neighbors said. But she  had also run away from home several times during the past year because of  family conflicts, according to neighbors and deputies.  </P> <P> "She didn't look rebellious, but the police had been over here a couple of  times when she ran away before," said a neighbor who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> The neighbor said he was told by Angela's father that on one such occasion the  teen-ager was found at the residence of a male friend. He said the father had  described the friend as "rough around the edges."  </P> <P> Angela was last seen by her parents on the night of Oct. 10, when she went to  bed about 10 p.m., Franco said. She left the house and drove off in her  brother-in-law's car, which was parked in front of the house, deputies said.  </P> <P> A teen-age neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said Angela was angry  because of an argument with her 17-year-old brother. The neighbor said she had  run away before because of similar arguments. Investigators would not comment  on that account.  </P> <P> Angela had planned to meet a female friend in Lancaster and drive to a site  outside Los Angeles County, which Franco would not disclose. But the two never  met. The car was found in a residential neighborhood near downtown Lancaster  the next morning.  </P> <P> Investigators believe Angela, who did not have a license, abandoned the car  because of engine trouble or because she had difficulty driving.  </P> <P> The girl's parents discovered that she was missing the next morning and called  deputies. The body was found at about 2:30 p.m.  </P> <P> There was no evidence in the car of foul play, Franco said. Investigators  believe the killer dumped Angela's body behind a tumbleweed near 70th Street  East and Avenue N, east of Lancaster, after strangling her elsewhere.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies said initially that the girl's clothing was disheveled and  that she appeared to have been sexually assaulted, but Franco would not comment  on those reports.  </P> <P> Franco said deputies have not ruled out either the possibility that the killer  was someone Angela knew or that the attack was committed by a stranger who saw  the girl on the street at night.  </P></p>

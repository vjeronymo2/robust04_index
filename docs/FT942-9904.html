			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Revised trade data add Pounds 300m to deficit The Central Statistical Office and Customs and Excise board yesterday unveiled the results of a sweeping review of the European Union's controversial system of collecting trade statistics. They concluded that, on balance, little had changed. The review of Intrastat, as the system is known, led to an upwards revision in last year's visible trade deficit to Pounds 13.7bn from Pounds 13.4bn, and numerous other changes in price and volume figures. Detailed checks on more than 11,000 companies disclosed that on average traders were under-recording the value of UK imports from the EU by 1 1/4 per cent and under-recording British exports to the EU by  1/4 per cent, while late reporting by traders of some of their shipments had also been substantial. But after taking into account the results of a big compliance exercise carried out by Customs, the net effect was to increase last year's UK deficit with the EU by only Pounds 309m. The CSO says it is confident that the new statistical system, which was introduced in January last year to cope with the elimination of border controls in intra-EU trade, is now capturing most of the UK trade flows. But this confidence is not shared by some in the City, who continue to complain that the statistics are painting an overly rosy picture of the UK trade balance - and at odds with other data, such as surveys by the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS, for example, believes that even after yesterday's revisions the CSO is still underestimating imports by some Pounds 4bn a year. 'The CSO has tried very hard in this review, but I think it still misses a lot of trade,' he said. Before last year, UK trade flows used to be measured as they passed through ports. However, because these 'trade posts' are illegal under the EU's single-market, the CSO collects its statistical data directly from companies. Since Intrastat collects figures through value added tax returns and other statistical inquiries, it had been assumed that it would underestimate imports. The CSO's review yesterday confirmed some of these fears. But the revision to the trade deficit was far lower than most market expectations, and most of the other revisions were minor and unlikely to seriously change the GDP or output figures.</p>

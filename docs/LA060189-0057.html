			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TUNNELS OF TROUBLE;  </P> <P> SEALING OF FREEWAY WALKWAYS SOUGHT  </P> <P> Pedestrian tunnels beneath the San Diego Freeway, built in the 1960s to provide  convenient neighborhood passageways, have become unsafe neighborhood nuisances  in the 1980s and should be sealed up, Los Angeles Councilman Hal Bernson said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Four Sepulveda tunnels have been the target of persistent complaints from  nearby residents who describe them as dim shelters for vandals and drug deals  and quick escape routes for criminals being chased by police.  </P> <P> Bernson, who represents the north San Fernando Valley, introduced a City  Council motion Wednesday seeking authorization to order the state Department of  Transportation to barricade tunnels at Superior, Tupper, Rayen and Chase  streets. The matter should come before the council within a week.  </P> <P> "Those tunnels were built for convenience, but the people are afraid to use  them," Bernson said. "The community has been complaining about them for years."  </P> <P> Ramona Strongbow, 60, who lives next to the Superior Street tunnel, circulated  a petition in her neighborhood to seal it.  </P> <P> "You wouldn't believe what comes through that tunnel," she said. "People stand  in it and fill it with graffiti and it has turned into a giant urinal. We don't  want it. There's no reason to have it."  </P> <P> Another resident, who lives near the Tupper Street tunnel, said he and most of  his neighbors no longer want their quiet streets of single-family homes to be  connected by pedestrian tunnel to the neighborhood of apartments east of the  freeway.  </P> <P> "Our side is very well-maintained," said Julio Armenteros, 48, of nearby  Aqueduct Avenue. "The other side is a very rowdy neighborhood. When they are  chased by police, they run through the tunnel."  </P> <P> Caltrans spokesman Jim McCarthy said that in 1962, Los Angeles city officials  required that the tunnels be built as a part of the San Diego Freeway  construction project that lasted through the mid-1960s. At the time, the  tunnels were promoted as a means by which neighborhoods that otherwise would be  severed by the freeway would instead remain linked, he said.  </P> <P> "Now they are undesirable," he said.  </P> <P> If the council approves the barricades, Caltrans will fill the tunnels with  sand and build cinder-block walls at each end.  </P> <P> "We want to keep those people from the other side from coming in," Armenteros  said.  </P></p>

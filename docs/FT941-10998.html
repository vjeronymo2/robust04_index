			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / A Clinton Fed might hesitate: America The Federal Reserve acted responsibly on Friday. This was about the last moment it could have begun tightening without jeopardising its credibility on inflation. Its decision was justified even if share prices plunge further this week. Equity markets were frothy partly because the Fed had delayed an inevitable tightening move for so long. Had it waited until March or April, equities would probably have climbed higher, and any correction would have been more violent. Yet while congratulating the Fed, we should remember that Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan. In a capital run by Democrats, the Fed is one of the last bastions of Republican power: all of Mr Greenspan's fellow governors are either Reagan or Bush appointees. The regional presidents who control a minority of votes on the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee have a more diverse political background, but as they are selected by local business interests, they tend to be conservatives. It is largely because the Fed - still the anchor of the world's monetary system - has enjoyed strong leadership for so long that Democrats can now blithely dismiss fears of higher inflation. Indeed, had Mr Greenspan not sought to reduce the 5 per cent inflation rate he inherited from Paul Volcker in the late 1980s, the US would probably not today be within striking distance of genuine price stability - meaning inflation so low that it can be ignored for all practical purposes. Whether the US succeeds in permanently kicking the inflation habit now depends on Bill Clinton. Last month the White House signalled that Mr George Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution, was likely to succeed Mr Wayne Angell, an 'inflation hawk' whose term as a Fed governor has just expired. But Mr Perry has still not been formally nominated because lawyers are investigating a possible conflict of interest - Mr Perry's wife manages several large investment funds. Following the surprise resignation last week of Mr David Mullins, Mr Greenspan's able deputy, Mr Clinton must now fill a second vacancy on the Fed's seven-member board. These appointments are important. They could significantly alter the balance of power within the Fed. But they are nothing like as important as a question that, so far, has received surprisingly little attention: who will replace Mr Greenspan? Fed chairmen serve four-year terms (concurrently with their 14-year governorships). Mr Greenspan's second four-year term expires in March 1996. He will then be 70 and would be unlikely to seek a third term. In any case, Mr Clinton will want to put his stamp on the Fed by appointing a Democrat to the top job. In theory Mr Clinton need not worry yet about replacing Mr Greenspan, but as he fills the two slots already open, it would be natural to groom somebody for the chairmanship. Indeed, the White House may regard Mr Perry as a suitable successor, not just to Mr Mullins but to Mr Greenspan. Messrs Angell and Mullins are departing. Mr Greenspan will go in two years. It would not be surprising if Mr Larry Lindsey, a conservative Bush appointee, went soon. This means that an era of stability, during which the Fed has been run by a team of committed inflation fighters, could be ending. Within a couple of years Clinton appointees will probably dominate the central bank. Regional presidents may not put up much fight because congressional committees are already threatening to clip their wings, either by making them White House appointees or by cancelling their right to vote on interest rate policy. On Friday, far from bashing the Fed, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, emphasised the importance of its remaining independent. Neither he nor Mr Clinton's other senior economic advisers would regard themselves as 'soft' on inflation. So as they flip through CVs, can we relax confident in the knowledge that a Clinton Fed would act responsibly? Regrettably, I think not. The problem is not that Mr Clinton will appoint lunatics or people obviously incompetent, but that the type of person he favours will be just a shade more complacent about inflation than the Greenspan team. And even a little complacency can lead to serious financial instability  - and eventually a wrenching recession. Think of Britain's problems in the late 1980s or those of the Fed in the 1970s under Arthur Burns and G. William Miller. Mr Perry, for example, is a respected economist. But his credentials as an inflation fighter may not wholly satisfy financial markets. In a recent article Mr Perry agreed with the old adage that a central bank must take away the punch bowl just as the party gets lively. But not, he quipped, 'just when the guests are arriving'. This notion that the recovery has not really got going, even though national income has been growing for nearly three years, is characteristic of many Democratic-leaning economists. I suspect most Clinton administration officials believe inflation of 5 per cent, or preferably a bit less, is perfectly acceptable. At a Jackson Hole monetary conference in 1992, Mr Larry Summers, now undersecretary at the Treasury and a possible future candidate for the Fed chairmanship, argued that 'austerity encounters diminishing returns'. He implied that Mr Greenspan's avowed goal of stable prices made little sense, because the cost of achieving zero inflation in terms of lost jobs and output exceeded the benefits - which were highly dubious. We can assume this will be the attitude of the next Fed chairman, whomever he or she may be.</p>

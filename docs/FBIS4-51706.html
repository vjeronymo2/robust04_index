			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chit Estella] </F>   [Text] All former rebels subject to arrest by the  underground movement for alleged crimes must surrender to the  New People's Army (NPA) rather than fight it out, the National  Democratic Front (NDF) said yesterday.    In a statement, NDF chairman Manuel Romero said that arrest  warrants will be served by guerrilla units on all those  currently facing criminal charges before people's courts.    Romero stressed that the NDF, a coalition of at least 12 big  organizations fighting the Ramos administration, has a judicial  system that upholds "the right of suspects to due process."    "Upon the issuance of the warrant of arrest by the people's  court, a criminal suspect like (Ricardo) Reyes can submit  himself willingly and peacefully to the NPA arresting unit or he  can voluntarily surrender himself to the revolutionary  authorities," Romero said.    Reyes has been accused by the NDF of implementing Kampanyang  Ahos [Garlic Campaign], a campaign which resulted in the torture  and murder of "hundreds of hundreds of Communist Party of the  Philippines members, NPA fighters, NDF allies and mass activists  without due process." The campaign was mounted in 1985-1986 to  weed out alleged deep penetration agents (DPA) within the  underground movement.    Subsequent events indicated that many of those executed on  suspicion of being DPAs could have been innocent.    With a rectification movement taking place within the rebel  movement, leaders allegedly behind such incidents as Kampanyang  Ahos are now being called to account for their deeds.    Warning them against resisting arrest by NPA unit, Romero  said the NPA has been authorized to "give battle when necessary  to defend itself or prevent the suspect from resisting arrest."    The leaders accused of authorizing the campaign have been  criticized for refusing to follow orders to cease their campaign  to divide the NDF and discredit the current leadership of both  the CPP and the NPA.    Charges against them were filed by the families of victims  and those whom they have attacked openly for more than two years  after the rectification campaign was launched by the CPP in late  1992.    One of the anti-Sison leaders has warned that if the  "people's court" issues a death sentence, they will retaliate by  sending an assassin to eliminate Sison.</p>

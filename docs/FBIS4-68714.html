			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Davydov, minister of foreign economic </F> relations, by Andrey Avdoshin in Madrid; date not given: "How To  Revive Trade and Economic Relations With Spain"]    [Text] The economic element was an important topic of  discussion during RF President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin's  official visit to Spain. The details of the talks on ways of  stimulating trade and economic relations between the two  countries were discussed by a direct participant in the talks,  Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, at the  request of a DELOVOY MIR correspondent.    [Davydov] The first thing we ascertained during our  conversations with Spanish colleagues and businessmen was the  obvious lack of correspondence between our economic relations  and the level of political relations and productive potential of  Russia and Spain. This is particularly true of trade and  investments, as well as the presence of Spanish business in our  market.    I must admit that we also had problems with the Spanish  businessmen's pessimistic opinion of current processes in the  Russian economy. They are still temporizing, in the belief that  the right time for them to enter our market has not arrived yet,  preferring to allow such countries as the United States and  Germany, with their colossal financial potential, to take all of  the risks at this time.    We feel, on the contrary, that temporizing could lead to the  loss of the whole Russian market, which is undergoing spirited  development. Furthermore, this process will be stepped up after  1 July this year, when voucher privatization comes to an end and  privatization for money begins. This would be a convenient time  for the Spanish to find their own niches in our economy for the  best use of their experience and technology.    We were particularly impressed by the high standards of the  production, processing, shipment, storage, and packaging of  agricultural products in Spain. It was no coincidence that the  Russian president visited one of the country's largest meat  processing enterprises--Campofrio, which is also operating  successfully in Moscow--on his last day in Madrid.    Spanish businessmen do not know enough about the situation  in  our currency market either, including the domestic  convertibility of the ruble.    In view of all this, the Russian side invited Spain's  Minister of Commerce and Tourism Javier Gomez-Navarro to visit  our country with a group of businessmen for the purpose of  taking a closer look at the situation and establishing business  contacts. The main advice we tried to give the Spanish was this:  "Do not get held up at the starting gate; start moving  vigorously." Furthermore, they have to remember that Russian  imports are being reduced: They decreased by 27 percent last  year, and this tendency will continue. Today the state has  already stopped all centralized imports: It is not buying  anything. Of course, centralized exports still exist and  represent around 20 percent of the total volume, but these will  also be phased out by 1995. The state will be occupied solely in  establishing favorable conditions for the development of  export-import operations and helping domestic enterprises  compete for sales markets.    [Avdoshin] What was your impression of B. Yeltsin's meeting  with the Spanish businessmen?    [Davydov] The president's speech was quite brilliant, it  seems to me, and all of the people present at the meeting were  pleasantly surprised, first of all, by his awareness of the  whole range of problems in Russian-Spanish trade and economic  relations and, second, by his candor. He frankly discussed the  difficulties we are experiencing, but nevertheless advised the  Spanish to work more vigorously in our market.    [Avdoshin] What kind of agreements were concluded on new  Spanish credits for Russia? Reports in the local press have been  ambiguous, particularly with regard to specific figures and  amounts....    [Davydov] The whole thing is quite simple: The Spanish will  extend 100 million dollars for the development of mutual trade  and are willing to extend another 100 million through EC  channels for various programs of aid to Russia and 425 million  for the promotion of direct private Spanish investments in our  country. These funds will be extended to private businessmen  with specific promising projects.    [Avdoshin] The press has also had much to say about our debt  to Spain, which is supposed to be impeding the intensification  of bilateral economic relations....    [Davydov] We said we would pay it off (it amounts to 900  million dollars) within the confines of the clubs of Paris and  London. This is not a problem. Last year we fulfilled all of our  obligations in the Club of Paris and we are fully determined to  do the same this year. State budget allocations for this purpose  amount to around 2 billion dollars.    [Avdoshin] What was your personal impression of your  contacts  with Spanish businessmen? How would you assess the results?    [Davydov] The results were indisputably positive. I have  rarely encountered this kind of sincerity and eagerness to  establish relations. Furthermore, all of this is occurring at a  time when Spain has serious economic difficulties of its own!    [Avdoshin] In his speech the president said that measures  would be taken soon to establish more favorable conditions for  foreign investments in Russia. What did he mean?    [Davydov] This is envisaged in the amendment to the Law on  Foreign Investment in Russia that was submitted to the State  Duma for consideration. One of its provisions stipulates that  foreign companies investing in Russia will be exempt from profit  taxes for the whole period of investment recoupment and will  then be taxed at the national rate. If we do this, the  investment climate is certain to improve dramatically. The  government feels that this would be advisable.</p>

[Begin Salinas recording] There is no possibility of  development without peace. That is why it is essential to  protect peace as an unbreakable value of unity, as a requirement  for civilized coexistence. [end recording]    Guatemala has experienced 30 years of violent confrontation,  and Mexico experienced a social outburst in Chiapas State. The  Mexican president said peace and social justice constitute the  best legacy to future generations of the region. De Leon asked  the Mexican people for their solidarity so his country can  finish the peace and reconciliation process this year, a process  under negotiation in our country. De Leon commented on the  painful reality of underdevelopment, mainly among Indian groups.    [Begin De Leon recording] This way, it is clear a gap exists  between Indian and ladino sectors, with the former experiencing  the worst educational, economic, and political indexes. [end  recording]    The anthems of the two countries set the tone of the  official  reception. In the National Palace central courtyard, the two  presidents spoke in favor of giving a new boost to economic and  political relations.    [Begin De Leon recording] We came to promote cultural,  economic, and social cooperation, and to agree on the grounds  for an equitable commerce accord. [end recording]    The two governments issued a joint communique pledging to  make the fund for the development of Indian peoples operational  soon.</p>

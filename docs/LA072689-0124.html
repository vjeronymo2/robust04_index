			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MERCURY S&amp;L BLAMES ACCOUNTING CHANGES FOR CONTINUED LOSSES  </P> <P> Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, stung last year by accounting changes that sunk it  into red ink, posted a $1.5-million loss for the first six months of this year.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach institution reported a net loss of $851,000 for the second  quarter, contrasted with net income of $1.5 million for last year's second  quarter. For the six-month period last year, Mercury reported net income of  $2.6 million.  </P> <P> Mercury Chairman Leonard Shane said the six-month loss, like the $13.8-million  loss last year, was a direct result of the accounting changes required by  regulators earlier this year.  </P> <P> The accounting changes were necessary, he said, because incorrect assumptions  had been made for several years involving profits recorded on the sale of  loans. In addition, assumptions that had been used to figure Mercury's tax  liability were incorrect, he said.  </P> <P> The loss was not generated by the S&amp;L's continuing, traditional operations,  which have been profitable, Shane said. The S&amp;L turned a profit in June and  will record an annual profit this year, barring unforeseen setbacks, he said.  </P> <P> "Things are pretty well straightened around now," he said.  </P> <P> Mercury's second-quarter revenue rose 8.4% to $65.1 million from $59.6 million  last year. For the first six months, revenue grew 8.7% to $126.7 million from  $116.6 million in the same period last year.  </P> <P> Shane denied persistent rumors that the S&amp;L is actively seeking a buyer.  </P> <P> Except for the previously announced effort to sell Mercury's five branches in  Northern California, there are no serious talks with anyone about the sale of  assets or the entire thrift, said Alan E. Rothenberg, a senior consultant at  Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco investment bank hired by Mercury 18  months ago.  </P> <P> But industry analysts doubt whether Mercury can remain independent under new  capital requirements that President Bush's industry rescue effort will impose  soon unless it sells up to half its 26 branches.  </P> <P> "I don't see any alternative but to sell" the S&amp;L or a substantial chunk of  the branches, said James F. Wilson, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co. in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Capital is an institution's last reserve against losses. For most companies, it  is the amount of money that shareholders put into the firm plus the annual  earnings that companies retain.  </P> <P> But in the last decade, capital for S&amp;Ls has included a number of other  items that have helped to prop up the sagging industry. Those other items would  be eliminated under the Bush rescue plan, and all S&amp;Ls would be required to  maintain a 1.5% ratio of tangible capital to assets.  </P> <P> Shane said Mercury currently exceeds regulatory requirements for capital and  will continue to do so. He said the S&amp;L's capital at the end of March was  $76.2 million and that about $36 million of that amount must be written off  over time under the pending legislation.  </P> <P> He said the S&amp;L's previously announced plan to sell the Northern California  branches, to cut Mercury's assets to $2 billion by the end of the year and to  eliminate cash dividends should help it meet capital requirements.  </P> <P> MERCURY SAVINGS AT A GLANCE  </P> <P>  Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, founded in 1964 by Leonard Shane, now has 25  branches across the state and $2.3 billion in assets. Shane and his family own  about 15% of the stock.  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:2.33IN:2.33IN:2.33IN:2.00IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 2nd Qtr '89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1st Qtr '89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $65.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $61.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $247  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $233  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $263  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net Income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($851,000)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($680,000)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($13.8 mil)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $5.1 mil  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $9.4 mil.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.3 bil  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.47 bil  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.5 bil  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Employees: 1,000  </P> <P> Shares outstanding: 6.3 million  </P> <P> 12-month price range: $4.75-$9  </P> <P> Tuesday close (NYSE): $4.875 unchanged  </P></p>

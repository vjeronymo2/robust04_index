			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Counties link up to attract investment Five counties in south-west England yesterday launched a partnership to attract investment to the region. The West of England Partnership is expected to win seed funding from the government's Invest in Britain Bureau. It will represent Avon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire. Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister and MP for Bristol West, said at the launch that the five counties were the only part of the country outside London and the south-east to lack a regional development organisation. With the growing importance of regional identity in Europe, it was an 'extraordinary gap', he said. The partnership, to be chaired by Sir Michael Lickiss, chairman of Somerset Economic Partnership, is supported by county and district councils, training and enterprise councils and existing county-wide economic forums.</p>

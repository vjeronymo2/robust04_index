			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pearson interested in acquiring Star TV stake PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, is interested in buying a stake in Star TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite television company which broadcasts to 38 Asian countries. The interest in Star, which is a 50-50 joint venture between Hutchison Whampoa and a company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, comes as Pearson finalises its Pounds 99m acquisition of Thames Television. When Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, announc-ed the purchase of Thames, the company added that it intended to expand in the international television market. Mr Julian Mounter, the newly appointed chief executive of Star, has recently had talks with Pearson. However, it is by no means certain that the satellite company wants to take on new equity investors. It has also been talking to a wide range of television groups, including US networks, about possible collaboration. However, Mr Mounter used to work at Thames Television and has had a close working relationship with Mr Richard Dunn, Thames' chief executive, for many years. At the moment Star broadcasts five channels, covering sport, music, Chinese language, news and information and entertainment. The news channel is provided by BBC World Service Television 24-hours a day. A second satellite is expected to be launched next year and the company is already talking about the possibility of using the latest digital compression technology to squeeze out as many as 180 channels. Apart from the possibility of a stake in Star, two other projects with a Pearson involvement are being suggested. One is to take UK Gold, the entertainment channel set up by Thames and the BBC - or a version of it - to Asia. Another is that Longman, Pearson's educational publishing group, could be involved in an educational channel for broadcasting to Asia. Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, declined to comment last night. Star TV is aimed at the most affluent 5 per cent of its potential market from the Middle East to Japan. Independent market research published in February found that 11.36m households, or more than 45m viewers, could receive its broadcasts, which are funded by advertising. According to the research, undertaken in 10 countries, the largest audience is in China, with 4.8m households, but India has 3.3m and Taiwan 1.98m.</p>

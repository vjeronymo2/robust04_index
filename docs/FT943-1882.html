			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Civil service union forced to cut spending The NUCPS civil service union is planning a 10 per cent cut in spending for the rest of the year with similar cuts next year as it seeks to break even by next autumn. The cuts are required after the union failed to sign up all its members in its check-off campaign - under new legislation, unions had to ensure this year that members paying subscriptions by direct deductions from wages renewed their authority for the deductions. Union officials say that about 93 per cent of their 108,000 members have signed up for check-off - more are expected to sign, but there will be a shortfall. The plan for cuts is expected to be approved by the union's executive today. The union's latest financial report says: 'It is anticipated over the final quarter our average monthly income will be nearly Pounds 112,000 less per month than in the first eight months. The combined effect of developments during the year is that nearly Pounds 400,000 still has to be saved from our 1994 expenditure in order to break even.' Membership income for next year is estimated at just over Pounds 10m. Mr Hugh Lanning, the union's assistant general secretary, said: 'The union has overspent for the past five years and has used up all of its reserves.' It had Pounds 4.4m in liquid reserves in 1988 but last year it was working within a Pounds 101,303 overdraft. Proposed budgets for next year are designed to eliminate the union's overdraft with Unity Trust Bank, the trade union bank, by October next year when the union hopes to merge with the financially strong Inland Revenue Staff Federation. The union's financial report - drawn up by Mr Lanning - says the union has made progress in restoring its financial position but cannot contain its expenditure within current income levels. The union had a negative cashflow of Pounds 503,109 at the end of last year and it projects a Pounds 210,465 positive cashflow in December if the agreed cuts are implemented. Without them it will have a Pounds 348,535 negative cashflow by the end of this year. The report predicts a sharp fall in membership income receipts this month to Pounds 550,000 from Pounds 905,000 in August, pushing the union's bank balance into deficit. The report says the union has 'managed not only to operate within the limits set by Unity Trust Bank but also to reduce the overdraft significantly'. But it warns: 'The last quarter of the year will be when cashflow will be most affected by reduced membership.' However the union will still require further bank help next year. 'The bank are currently considering options for funding a redundancy package and rescheduling outstanding mortgage payments,' the report says. 'It is not envisaged any revised arrangements will be necessary this year.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric "Rescuing the </F> Drowning": "An Unprecedented Scandal on Ukrainian Television";  with separate commentary by Vitaliy Zhuravskiy, chairman of the  Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine: "Why the Christian  Democrats Left the Television Studio"]    [Text]  <H5>  An Unprecedented Scandal on Ukrainian Television </H5>   On Monday, 21 February, representatives of the Christian  Democratic Party (KhDPU) and the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists (KUN) gathered in the UT [Ukrainian Television]  studio in preparation for conducting a pre-election interparty  debate. But it did not take place; in voices shaking with  emotion and fear, the UT commentators began to read the  "instructional" letter from Tsentrizbirkom [Central Election  Commission], by which the parties' leaders (top people) were  prohibited from taking part in such debates (!?).    As a sign of protest, after making statements appropriate to  the moment, both party delegations left the television studio.  It was pitiful to watch the lonely moderators of the "television  debates" pressed close to one another and trying somehow to  "save face" for the completely and wholly compromised Ukrainian  (read "presidential") Television, which is mired in lies and  political censorship.    So the party leaders are prohibited from speaking on the  air.  But then at the most convenient times, in the best tradition of  the era of stagnation, the chairman of Gosteleradiokompaniya  (State Television and Radio Company), Nikolay Okhmakevich, a  candidate for deputy in two rayons of Zhitomir Oblast, was  allowed to film and "roll" short features of Ruzhin and  Popelnya, where he is registered.    It will be interesting to see how events develop further:  before last Monday UT had already offered the floor to a number  of party leaders. But now it is prohibited. Next Monday is the  next round of debates. We express our sincere condolences to our  colleagues who found themselves in the role of scapegoats.  <H5>  Why the Christian Democrats Left the Television Studio </H5>   In the opinion of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine,  the directive read on the air is a flagrant legal offense. The  Christian Democrats consider it a case of settling accounts for  opposition to the "party in power." After all, preceding us, on  17 February, three parties, two of which are clearly  pro-presidential, were not refused permission to take part in an  hour-long television debate. In this way Ukrainian Television  violated Article 27 of the current Law: "From the time they are  registered by election commissions and receive certification,  candidates for deputy have an equal right to conduct an election  campaign: to appear at pre-election and other meetings, rallies,  parades, and sessions directly related to the election and on  the mass information media (in the press and on radio and  television)."    Six of our candidates for deputy were not allowed to  communicate with television viewers and acquaint them with the  pre-election platform of the KhDPU.    So on the basis of Article 18 of the Law of Ukraine "On  Elections of People's Deputies of Ukraine," we protest the  decision of the chairman of the Central Election Commission. And  we are submitting this protest to the Supreme Court of Ukraine.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA FE VIEWPOINT  </P> <P> My daughter and I just returned last week from a trip to Santa Fe, which (made  me) interested me in your June 3 article on that town by Jerry Hulse.  </P> <P> I would agree with your restaurant recommendations, with the exception of the  Coyote Cafe. We had been looking forward to a return visit to this trendy  restaurant since our first visit in 1987. What a disappointment! We suggest an  alternative just a block away: the restaurant in the Hotel St. Francis. You'll  find real Santa Fe hospitality there in addition to Old World charm.  </P> <P> SONJA ROBINSON  </P> <P> Lomita  </P></p>

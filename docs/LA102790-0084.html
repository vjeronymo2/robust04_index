			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WRONG ABOUT KIDS  </P> <P> I'm sorry to say so but the article you wrote on the New Kids concert was very  bad.  </P> <P> Maybe the fans enjoyed the concert. Also maybe we enjoy wasting our money on  them.  </P> <P> Another thing I'd like to see is you get up on stage and try to sing after  dancing and trying to catch your breath. Just because you don't like their  music doesn't mean you can put them down.  </P> <P> A lot of people think the New Kids are great, so if you don't have anything  nice to say about them, why don't you just shut up?  </P> <P> RACHEL MOEDER  </P> <P> Diamond Bar  </P></p>

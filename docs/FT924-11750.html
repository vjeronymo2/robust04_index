			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Institutions switch into second liners LONDON'S equity market staged another strong upward push on the back of the government's new 'growth and recovery' policy, but was showing distinct signs of running out of steam towards the close of trading. Nevertheless, the Footsie still managed to post a 12.4-point rise to 2,658.1, a gain of 99.1, or almost 4 per cent, over the past five trading sessions, amid hopes of more interest rate cuts in the near future. The session began on a cautious note with a gloomy review of the UK economy during the third quarter from the British Chambers of Commerce, which confirmed recent official statistics detailing the deepening economic recession. But the opening trend which showed the Footsie 100 down almost three points within minutes of the market opening was quickly reversed when the Footsie future attracted a flurry of exceptional buying interest and moved to a near 50-point premium over the cash market. Demand for leading shares, partly triggered by stock index arbitraging and a big short position in the market, reached a peak around midday when the Footsie was up over 36 points. Enthusiasm was not disturbed by the September trade figures, which disclosed a current account deficit of Pounds 963m, against a general consensus forecast of Pounds 1.15bn. Markets were additionally underpinned by the solid performance of sterling against the dollar and the D-Mark, after the government gained a comfortable victory in the Commons on the debate over the mining industry. The afternoon session in the stock market, however, saw the emergence of intermittent bouts of profit-taking, prompted by a rather ragged early performance on Wall Street, and a downturn in the Footsie future premium over cash which came off to around 31 at the close. Dealers said there was a significant shift in the pattern of buying interest in the equity market yesterday. Having bought the leading stocks aggressively this week, the big institutions switched their attention to the second-line stocks. This suggestion was vindicated by official turnover figures which showed Footsie volume of 314.9m shares and non-Footsie volume of 412.9m shares. And further proof of the move into the second-line stocks came from the performance of the Footsie Mid 250 index which easily outperformed the Footsie 100 in jumping 30.4 to 2,494.6. The all-encompassing Footsie 350 rose 7.9 to 1,278.7. Overall turnover in the market totalled 727.9m shares, a figure expected to see customer, or retail business continue above the Pounds 1bn mark. The value of Wednesday's retail business surged to over Pounds 1.5bn, continuing the upturn in activity that followed the recent cut in UK interest rates and the Government's 'dash for growth' policy shift. There was heartening news for the market's smaller companies as Smith New Court said it would start marketmaking in a further 44 smaller company stocks this morning. The stocks would otherwise have been relegated to the Stock Exchange Bulletin Board, after being dropped by other marketmakers.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THORNBURGH DENIES SHIELDING AIDE;  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPT.: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS HE DIDN'T TRY TO HIDE THE OFFICIAL'S  FAILURE OF A LIE DETECTOR TEST.  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh on Sunday denied that he had tried to hide the fact  that his chief personal aide had flunked a lie detector test during a sensitive  department investigation.  </P> <P> "Absolutely not," Thornburgh said when asked about the allegation of Deputy  Atty. Gen. Donald B. Ayer, the department's No. 2 official, who has turned in  his resignation, effective on Friday. The charge was reported by The Times on  Sunday.  </P> <P> "Mr. Ayer is sadly misinformed about the facts," Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> "There was no evidence that tied any person on my staff to the unauthorized  disclosure." Thornburgh was referring to a leak of information during an  investigation of alleged financial irregularities in the office of House  Majority Whip William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> Appearing on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Thornburgh was asked about  his former executive assistant, Robert S. (Robin) Ross Jr., who failed a lie  detector test in the leak inquiry. Asked whether the failure was not  "evidence," Thornburgh responded: "No, it isn't evidence of wrongdoing -- not  in our courts of law."  </P> <P> Later, in a statement issued Sunday, Thornburgh said he found it "unfortunate  that Mr. Ayer has chosen to conduct himself in this manner with respect to his  former colleagues."  </P> <P> After he resigned, Ayer contended that he had been blocked from performing the  deputy's duties by Ross. According to Ayer, Ross acted as the department's  chief operating officer.  </P> <P> The statement released by the department did not deal directly with Ayer's  allegation that Thornburgh had tried to keep the leak investigation away from  the department's internal watchdog unit and, failing that, refused to follow  the unit's recommendation for further investigation.  </P> <P> Instead, the statement noted that Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr's review  of the investigation concluded that there had been no reason for Thornburgh to  remove himself from the case -- as Ayer had unsuccessfully sought to persuade  him to do.  </P> <P> The statement also noted that Thornburgh was acting within his discretion in  deciding not to discipline anyone over the leak. The statement said that Starr  also had considered the concerns of the department's watchdog unit, which had  called for further investigation and possible discipline.  </P></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Conservatives rest on election laurels AFTER two months of dispassionate analysis, the Tory party came to the spectacular conclusion yesterday that its general election victory was 'a ringing endorsement of its principles and policies', Ralph Atkins writes. The official party version of events leading up to April 9 lays to rest any suggestion that the Conservative victory might have been a lucky escape - or even the product of Labour's shortcomings. Campaign managers, who at the time faced a barrage of complaints about lacklustre tactics and sweeping mid-campaign strategy, have been vindicated. 'I don't think there is any criticism in it,' said a party spokesman. The Conservative research department, which compiled the paper, is prepared, however, to offer lessons aplenty to Labour. Indeed its criticism of the Opposition's 'damaging and discredited' economic policies and identity with 'narrow and shrinking' political interests dominates the report - from the shadow Budget at the beginning of the campaign to Mr Neil Kinnock's 'ungracious speech' after the results. 'Labour's position is grave,' the report adds helpfully. In contrast, Mr John Major has a 'winning style'. When accused of perhaps a slight bias, Tory party officials confirmed the report was but one of many campaign 'feed-back' studies prepared by senior Tories. The others will not, however, be published.</p>

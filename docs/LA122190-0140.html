			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIGURE IN BRAWL IS REVEALED AS A WOMAN;  </P> <P> IMPERSONATION: A 19-YEAR-OLD CREDITED WITH SAVING THE LIFE OF AMBER JEFFERSON  IS TAKEN TO ORANGE COUNTY JAIL ON SUSPICION OF BURGLARY AND TURNS OUT TO BE  FEMALE.  </P> <P> A 19-year-old who was credited with saving the life of a high school  cheerleader during a highly publicized brawl four months ago is a woman who has  been impersonating a man, sheriff's officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said investigators  discovered Lewis Jones' true identity -- Teresa Jones of Anaheim -- on  Wednesday after she was taken to Orange County Jail in Santa Ana on suspicion  of burglary.  </P> <P> He said Jones also goes by the names Louilla Jones and Louilla Martin.  </P> <P> "It was confirmed by one of the female medical staff," Olson said. "We also  confirmed it through fingerprint comparisons."  </P> <P> Jones was among several people with Amber Jefferson, 15, of Garden Grove on the  night of Aug. 6, when Amber's face was slashed during the brawl. Amber's  parents, who have called the attack racially motivated, credited Jones with  saving their daughter's life by holding her severely cut face together until  paramedics arrived.  </P> <P> Jones and three others were later charged in the brawl. Jones has pleaded not  guilty to charges of malicious mischief, assault with a deadly weapon and  fighting in public.  </P> <P> The revelation that Jones is a woman stunned investigators, prosecutors -- even  Jones' own attorney.  </P> <P> "He's a she, that's what they tell me," said Peter Haviland, who is  representing Jones on the brawl charges. "I never knew."  </P> <P> Prosecutors said it is too early to tell how the latest disclosure will affect  the trial of Amber's alleged attacker, Kurt David Wimberly, 18, who is accused  of throwing the glass that slashed her face.  </P> <P> "It was new information to me, I can say that," Assistant Dist. Atty. Kathi  Harper said. "But nothing in this case surprises me anymore."  </P> <P> Jones was arrested Wednesday, along with a 16-year-old boy, in connection with  a condominium burglary in the 9100 block of Cerritos Avenue in Stanton.  Sheriff's officials said a condo in the complex was ransacked and about $1,600  worth of property was taken. The complex is the same one where Amber was  injured.  </P> <P> Contacted Thursday, Amber's mother, Cody Donnelly, said she had heard rumors  that Jones was a woman several months ago but discounted them.  </P> <P> "I don't think any of us ever took it seriously," Donnelly said. "I asked  (Jones' girlfriend) about it, and she denied it vehemently."  </P> <P> Jones has also been charged with false impersonation and giving false  information to a police officer, Olson said. She is being held in lieu of  $25,000 bail.  </P></p>

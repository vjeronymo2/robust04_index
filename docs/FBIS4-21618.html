			<p>April'   <F P=102>   SK0404020494 Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean 4 Apr 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> SK0404020494 </F> <F P=104>  Seoul TONG-A ILBO </F> <F P=105>  Korean </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Cha-su from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] A controversy has arisen over the deadline for  further inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. A report to the UN  Security Council by IAEA Director General Hans Blix says that  further inspections of the North Korean nuclear facilities must  be conducted within six weeks. Therefore, some people say that  the deadline should be the end of April, and others say it  should be mid-May.    An ROK Foreign Ministry official, who is now visiting Japan,  said on 3 April that this issue must be clarified because the  deadline for further inspections would be an important factor  for the UN Security Council's next step.    The Security Council president's statement indirectly  mentioned the deadline, saying: "The Council invites the  director general of the IAEA to report further to the Security  Council on the question of completion of the inspection  activities agreed between the IAEA and the DPRK on 15 February  1994, when the director general is scheduled to report on the  follow-up inspections required to maintain continuity of  safeguards, as noted in the director general's report to the  council."    However, when presenting a report to the Security Council on  24 March, Director General Blix said that to ensure the  continuity of nuclear safeguards, further inspections of not  only the facilities which were not inspected during the  inspection period ending 15 February but the facilities which  were inspected during the same period must be conducted within  six weeks.    The Foreign Ministry official views that "within six weeks"  must be interpreted to be six weeks from 15 February, when the  first round of inspections were completed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ann Eveleth and Farouk Chothia] </F>   [Text] In a significant hardening of his position, Zulu  monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini has demanded the "complete  restoration of the Zulu kingdom" in talks with President F.W. de  Klerk. Sources close to the hush-hush encounters say the king  has called for a sovereign Zulu state according to pre-1838  boundaries. This would encompass all of Natal, including  kwaZulu, and would stretch from the Drakensberg mountains to the  sea and from Mozambique to the Umzimvubu River in the south.    The demand runs directly contrary to speculation that the  monarch would adopt a less political role with the imminent  demise of the kwaZulu homeland, in a bid to secure his position  under a new dispensation.    With the failure this week of the trilateral talks between  the government, ANC [African National Congress] and Freedom  Alliance to reach agreement on outstanding constitutional  issues, the king has lost interest in remaining part of the new  South Africa, the sources say.    Arguing that the new dispensation would herald not only a  new  government, but a new state as well, one source noted: "Before  conquest by Britain, the Zulus were a sovereign nation. Now  that the British are no longer ruling South Africa, we are not  obliged to remain part of it."    Conspicuously absent from last week's pow-wow between  Zwelithini and De Klerk was kwaZulu chief minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi. Buthelezi has clearly begun a strategic retreat from  the political frontline -- in the hope that an anti-election  call from his nephew will have wider appeal among Zulus. By  raising the spectre of a UDF [United Democratic Front]-style  campaign to boycott elections with the backing of a royal  decree, Zwelithini has sharpened the battle for his allegiance.    The ANC's decision to place its deputy secretary general,  Jacob Zuma, at the top of its Natal electoral list was in part a  strategy to win over the king, whom ANC president Nelson Mandela  last year lauded as the king of all South Africans." But  efforts by Zuma have so far failed to produce a  Mandela-Zwelithini indaba [meeting]. Instead, when Zwelithini  decided to enter the heart of the debate, he arranged for a  private meeting with De Klerk.    Sources say De Klerk went further than Zuma's promise to  seek  a constitutional position for the monarch by hinting that a  post-election arrangement could secure him the constitutional  monarchy of South Africa. Zwelithini is said to have baulked at  the suggestion.    Said one source: "(Zwelithini) looks over the border at  Swaziland and Lesotho and says: `They were far smaller than  (the Zulus) in my grandfather's time and now they have sovereign  kingdoms. Why should I settle for second best?'" Among  Zwelithini's representatives in the talks are IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] chief executive officer Joe Matthews and Prince  Gideon Zulu. The government is represented by Constitutional  Development Minister Roelf Meyer and his Foreign Affairs  colleague, Pik Botha.    In the clearest reflection that Zwelithini's demands have  created a dilemma for the ANC and government alike, Meyer said  this week in an SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  interview that the king's demands were tantamount to a call for  secession. He declined to give details. A few hours later,  Mandela responded by calling upon the king to meet him rather  than De Klerk, who would not be in power after elections.    ANC sources this week claimed the king had already agreed to  meet a delegation of its Natal leaders, but that Zuma's absence  on an overseas visit had delayed the encounter.    Given the probability that the IFP will, together with its  allies, boycott the coming election, the king's move to centre  stage is a shrewd strategy. Inkatha leader Buthelezi and his  negotiators have exhausted their options for obtaining  concessions from the government and the ANC.    Now, faced with the task of organising an effective boycott,  the party is playing its trump card, observers say. The  exclusion of the word "kwaZulu" from the interim constitution  has strengthened Buthelezi's argument that the ANC and the  government cannot be trusted with the fate of the Zulu nation,  sources say.    It is unclear how Zwelithini plans to rule such a kingdom,  but it is likely that Buthelezi would retain his position as the  "traditional prime minister to the Zulu monarch."</p>

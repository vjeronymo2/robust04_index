			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry has spoken out for  preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity. In its Monday  statement the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry says that Lithuania  recognized the Ukrainian territorial integrity in February 1994  in accordance with the major international principles. The  statement comes on the heel of a decision by the Crimean  parliament on 20th May to conduct its foreign policy  independently from the Ukraine and to have its own armed forces.  The law on the revival of the Crimean constitution was  denounced as unlawful by Ukraine. The Crimean authorities in  their turn responded by suspending the decision [as heard] of  the Ukrainian parliament on the peninsula. The Lithuanian  Foreign Office called upon the parties to solve all  disagreements by applying sensible and commonly acceptable  measures.    Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has also urged all  political forces and officials involved in the Crimea dispute to  approach the issue with responsibility and moderacy [as heard].  In his Monday statement the president said that international  organizations should concentrate on producing a quick and  peaceful solution to the Crimean issue, preventing the peninsula  from turning into a source of instability that could threaten  security in the region and on the continent.</p>

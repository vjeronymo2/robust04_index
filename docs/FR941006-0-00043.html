Intra-agency or inter-agency memoranda or letters that, according to recognized legal privileges are not routinely released to a party in litigation with the Air Force or DoD. If such a record or part of such a record would be made available routinely through the discovery process in the course of litigation with the agency, release it. In the discovery process, litigants get from each other information relevant to issues in a trial or hearing. if the information is only made available through the discovery process by special court order, then it is exempt. Release factual records or parts unless the information is privileged or otherwise exempt. Generally, release a direction or order from a superior to a subordinate, though contained in an internal communication, if it forms policy guidance or a decision, but is not a discussion of preliminary or other matters that would compromise decision making. Consult your SJA about whether Exemption 5 material would be routinely available through the discovery process. Here are examples of exempt information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The deliberative process privilege_those parts of records with internal advice, opinions, evaluations, or recommendations that reveal Air Force or DoD deliberations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Those nonfactual parts of Air Force personnel evaluations of contractors and their products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Advance information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative nature on such matters as proposals to buy, lease, or otherwise acquire and dispose of materials, real estate, facilities, or functions, if such information gives private personal interests an unfair competitive advantage or impedes legitimate governmental functions. Generally, you cannot use this privilege to withhold factual information. However, you may withhold facts when they are so interconnected with deliberative information that disclosing facts necessarily discloses the Air Force's deliberative process or when facts and deliberative information are so interconnected that separating them would be uninformative or redundant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Official reports of inspection, audits, investigations, or surveys on safety, security, or internal management, administration, or operation of the Air Force. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The attorney work product privilege_records an attorney prepares, or supervises the preparation of, in contemplating or preparing for administrative proceedings or litigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The attorney-client privilege_confidential communication between an attorney and client. For example, a commander expresses concerns in confidence to his or her judge advocate and asks for a legal opinion. The legal opinion and everything the commander tells the judge advocate in confidence qualify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Unlike deliberative process privilege, you may withhold both facts and opinions in attorney work product or privileged communications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

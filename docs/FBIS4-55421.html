			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the announcement issued by the  cabinet of Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that aid in the amount of 100  German marks will soon be given to all families of killed Muslim  fighters [sehit] in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Liberal Party of  Bosnia-Herzegovina has issued the following statement:    We are very pleased with President Izetbegovic's statements  and concrete activities concerning the welfare of families of  killed fighters and (?killed Muslim fighters), as well as his  statement that he will soon devote his endeavors to this problem  alone. However, what has been left unclear is whether there was  an error in the announcement or whether discrimination against  killed fighters, patriots in the defense of the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, is really being introduced, something that  we cannot support. We expect the error, be it in the  announcement or intentional, to be immediately corrected.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kolokoltseva and Aleksandr Bekker: "Truth </F> About Russian Finances"]    [Text] The report, "Russian Finances in 1993," prepared  under the guidance of former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov,  essentially represents the first attempt at a comprehensive  analysis of the state of Russia's financial policy last year  from the standpoint of principles generally accepted in the  civilized world. Analyzing Russia's monetary, credit, and budget  policy, the authors of this work reach the conclusion that, on  the whole, during 1993 it was possible to adhere to the  "anti-inflationary direction of Russia's financial policy. A  market economy exists in Russia and it can be regulated by  market, that is, monetary, methods." They refute the view that  the notorious policy of "shock" therapy was conducted in Russia.  "By no criteria can a policy, under which the budget deficit  comprising 10 percent of the GDP is financed through emission,  the annual inflation is 900 percent, the population's monetary  income and average wages in all sectors have grown more rapidly  than prices, unemployment has remained at the level of 1  percent, and there are no bankruptcies or enterprise closures,  be shock therapy," the authors of this report think. Here,  perhaps, it is appropriate to add that in 1993 Russian arbitral  tribunals, nevertheless, registered eight cases of bankruptcies.  However, in Russia there are 220,000 enterprises, of which about  one-third are unprofitable. Thus, in Russia until now there has  been neither shock, nor therapy.    The finance minister's report debunks a number of myths  stemming "from the basic principle of socialism" about the  primacy of production over the sphere of services and  circulation. It lies in the fact that "at first it is necessary  to raise production and to produce goods--and inflation itself  will disappear." During the last one and a half years Mr.  Gerashchenko has tried to convince the Russian and the  international public that "Russian inflation is not of a  monetary nature," but is due to the high degree of monopolism.  However, it was demonstrated a long time ago that a strict  dependence exists between the growth of the money supply and  inflation rates and that the monetary factor accounts for 70 to  75 percent of Russian inflation. Furthermore, thousands of  enterprises have already adapted themselves to the market rules  of the game and the experience of the last few years has  demonstrated quite convincingly that under Russian conditions a  selectively structural policy degenerates into ordinary emission  pumping and the extortion of preferential credits and import  subsidies by lobbyists, such as Messrs. Zaveryukha, Yefimov,  Shurchkov, and Glukhikh.    The authors of this report quite appropriately cite  ex-minister Fedorov's favorite quotation, which he got from  Grigoriy Sokolnikov, author of the 1922-1924 monetary reform:  "Emission is opium for the people." It is to be supposed that  Mr. Sokolnikov's book, which was presented to Viktor  Chernomyrdin with marked off places, as well as Ukraine's sad  experience, has had some restraining effect on the government's  distribution of unsecured subsidies. Now, however, after Boris  Fedorov's departure from the Ministry of Finance, if Mr.  Chernomyrdin wishes to follow the principal points of this book,  he will have to confront the "red economic managers" almost  alone.    The entire question is whether the prime minister, declaring  his devotion to the policy of reform, but, at the same time,  proposing that the economy be stabilized by "nonmonetary  methods," is ready for this. It would not be bad for the prime  minister's speech writer to find out what, as a rule, the fixing  of the currency rate, price restriction, introduction of a  100-percent sale of currency proceeds and of obligatory  deliveries, and similar administrative pranks mean in economic  practice.</p>

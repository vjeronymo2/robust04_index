He first set out the priorities of  Greece's Council Presidency, in conformity with the programs  already analyzed by EUROPE and stressing the importance of an  in-depth debate in all member states on the guidelines of the  White Paper by the European Commission. It is then that,  answering questions from MEPs [member of European Parliament],  he took the aforementioned stances. Here is what he had to say,  according to the report put out by Parliament:    (1) Convergence criteria. Asked by Mr. Fourcans (France)  about a possible revision, Mr. Simitis said that there was no  revision procedure going on, but these criteria are being  discussed and "some have already said that they were possibly  excessive and that they aimed at a goal which would have as  consequence limiting economic activity (...). The Community  institutions must follow the debate, hear the criticisms and in  their actions include the results of the discussion" so as to be  able, should it prove necessary, to revise their position;    (2) Industrial policy. According to Mr. Simitis, such a  policy is "necessary as we cannot simply count on the market  mechanisms. The role of the Community is not simply to be an  observer, it has to intervene and set out the guidelines." Over  restructuring the steel industry, he confirmed that the private  sector would meet the Commission in February and should then  announce commitments to closures.</p>

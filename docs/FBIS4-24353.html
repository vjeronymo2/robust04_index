			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] After inspecting his troops in Goma in Zaire and  visiting a Tutsi refugee camp in Nyarushishi in southwest  Rwanda, this afternoon Francois Leotard went to (Gishyita), a  town on the central shore of Lake Kivu, still in Rwanda. The  French defense minister was visiting a group of French special  forces stationed less than 4 km -- as the crow flies -- from the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] positions. Francois Leotard  explained that Rwanda must remain a multiethnic country, and  preached French neutrality. Christophe Boisbouvier:    [Boisbouvier] [passage omitted] There won't be any  evacuations, said Francois Leotard, since there is no place  where these refugees can be housed, but there will be more and  more frequent French missions on the ground. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Francois Leotard stressed the need to pass the  baton on to the United Nations soon, and indeed the arrival of  French troops in Rwanda has somewhat destablized the work of the  UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR], the UN mission on the  ground. The two military forces now have to coordinate their  missions: That is what UNAMIR Commander General Dallaire wants,  as he said just now in Nairobi, where he presented the UN medal  to 100 or so soldiers who had served in Rwanda:    [Begin recording] [Dallaire] We are working hard to increase  its capacity and to be in a position to deploy more resources to  be able to help the humanitarian side and to be there to monitor  the cease-fires which I hope we will have some day.    [Correspondent Jean Helene] Is it possible to envisage the  French, and the coalition, the French Government, deploying in  government zones, and UNAMIR reinforcements deploying in rebel  zones?    [Dallaire] No. The scenario appears to reflect that, but my  positions and headquarters could move, and what we are doing is  to retire via our logistics base, which is Entebbe, and we are  going to spread out throughout the RPF zone and in the  government zone. We still have men in Kigali, on the government  side, and (?will continue to have them).    [Helene] Do you expect to replace the French coalition in  the  west of the country when you have received your reinforcements?    [Dallaire] Well, we -- the commander of the force and I --  are going to hold discussions, to see exactly what its  operational plans and its operational aims are, and the  procedures will then be determined.

			<p>BFN     [Text] An assembly of Black Sea Fleet officers has  condemned "the openly confrontational actions by Ukrainian  servicemen with respect to Black Sea Fleet units in Odessa."  The officers took as a basis a resolution where they stated  their complete lack of confidence in the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry and personally Ukrainian Naval Forces Commander Rear  Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovainy.    The officers hoped that the Ukrainian president would not  approve the actions by the Ukrainian servicemen who attacked  Black Sea Fleet units in Odessa and would take corresponding  measures against the organizers of the large-scale provocation  in Odessa.    The officers said the conflict was "pushing them to respond  in kind." They recalled that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's  unilateral attempts to seize a fireboat in May 1993 triggered  off an outbreak of indignation in the entire fleet which  resulted in hoisting historical St.Andrew's crosses on 226  vessels. The officers were quoted as saying that "there were  neither common sense in the actions by the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry, nor reasons that would prevent Black Sea Fleet from  voicing their protest in this way," i.e. hoist Russian St.  Andrew's crosses once again.    The chairman of the committee coordinating the activities of  officers' assemblies in the entire Black Sea Fleet, Valeriy  Volodin, told the meeting that there had been no contact with  the fleet's units stationed in Odessa for five days. The Army  telephone exchange is at a standstill.    The wives of Odessa navymen had been calling via public  telephone networks to say the Ukrainian command was still  applying pressure upon the personnel of the vessel conservation  group and the hydrographic unit. Representatives of the Russian  command and the Black Sea Fleet had not been admitted to the  territory of the unit.    Interfax learned that many of the officers supported a  proposal to withdraw Ukrainian troops from Crimea. In addition,  some proposed not to admit the Ukrainian vessel Slavutich to the  main base of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol until the issue  was solved.</p>

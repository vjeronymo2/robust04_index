			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Oil and gas push industrial output in UK to record levels A strong performance by the North Sea oil and gas sector boosted UK industrial production to record levels in the second quarter, indicating that the growth in output is gathering pace. Manufacturing output slowed slightly in June, providing further evidence that the pick-up in the manufacturing sector is steady rather than spectacular. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that total industrial production grew by a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent in the three months to June, compared with the three months to March, and by 5.7 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. The rise led the CSO to revise up its projections for annual industrial growth to 5.5 per cent. This is considerably higher than the 3.3 per cent annual growth rate for overall gross domestic product in the second quarter of this year, and underlines the significance of the industrial sector in the overall recovery. The index of production rose to 102.6 in the second quarter - its highest level in the series which takes 1990's production level as a base of 100. Oil and gas production rose by 6.8 per cent in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter of the year, and was 37.3 per cent higher than the same period a year ago. The rises were recorded in spite of the fact that May and June are two of the main months in which North Sea platforms are shut down for annual maintenance. The surge in output, which earlier this year took the international industry by surprise, reflects the large number of new fields which were brought on stream earlier this year, and which are now building up to peak production. Growth in the manufacturing sector, by contrast, was more patchy, Manufacturing output fell in June by 0.2 per cent, compared with the previous month. But though this fall surprised the City, analysts yesterday pointed out that measured on a three monthly basis - considered a better guide to the trend than volatile monthly figures - manufacturing rose by 1.3 per cent in the second quarter of the year, compared with the first quarter. This leaves manufacturing output some 5 per cent higher than during the low point of the recession two years ago, albeit 2.6 per cent below the peaks reached during the last recovery in 1990. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, yesterday welcomed the figure as evidence that the country was now seeing 'broadly based growth', and this upbeat verdict was echoed by City analysts.

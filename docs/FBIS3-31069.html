			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Toast by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman at dinner given </F> in his honor by Romanian President Ion Iliescu in Bucharest on  14 February -- recorded, in Croatian with superimposed  translation into Romanian]    [Text] Esteemed Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and  gentlemen:    I want to express thanks for the warm welcome on behalf of  the Croatian delegation and on behalf of myself.    Esteemed Mr. President, your visit to Croatia in June last  year paved the way and laid the bases for friendship and  cooperation between democratic Croatia and Romania.    We in Croatia attach particular importance to developing  many- sided relations with Romania, because Romania is the  biggest state in South-East Europe and plays an important role  in the international order on European soil.    As early as your visit to Zagreb, we signed accords. We will  finalize accords at the economic, scientific-technical level,  and our friendship accord in Bucharest today and tomorrow.    Our countries have experienced the same circumstances with  the disintegration of communist socialism in the past four  years. This has given birth to similar problems in other areas  as well.    In exchange, we in Croatia are facing problems linked to the  disintegration of communist Yugoslavia, because we have not been  able to overcome the crisis peacefully; and we have also  experienced the war and we are still concerned with the war in  Bosnia- Herzegovina. We would like this crisis in former  Yugoslavia, which emerged together with Tito's disappearance  from the scene of history, to be solved in a peaceful way. You  probably know that Tito was able to renew Yugoslavia, which was  dismantled in World War Two, due to domestic ethnic  contradictions, for Yugoslavia was not made up only of peoples  with differing ethnic individualities, but also of people who  belong to different civilizations.    Tito succeeded in renewing Yugoslavia through setting up a  federation that ensured full equality for its peoples. This  lasted as long as he lived. After he died, there was a tendency  to create a centralized state in which hegemonic tendencies  would have been repeated, something that gave birth to a crisis  and separatist demands.    We wanted to solve this crisis in a peaceful way by  proposing  that Yugoslavia be reorganized on the basis of a confederation.  Unfortunately, this was not accepted. Slovenia, Croatia, and  Macedonia proclaimed their independence. Bosnia-Herzegovina  followed suit. Then Serb aggression against Croatia and against  Bosnia-Herzegovina followed. The Yugo-communist army occupied  one third of Croatia's territory and now one fourth of Croatia's  territory is under the protection of UN peacekeeping forces,  but, in fact, the power is under Serbian occupation.    The whole world, the international community, the European  Union, the United Nations, and the Security Council have  recognized through their resolutions that these territories  belong to Croatia. We want to return these territories to  Croatia in a political, peaceful, and democratic fashion. For  this purpose, we have signed an accord on normalizing relations  with the Yugoslav Government. We hope that all our efforts,  with the help of the international community and your help, will  yield results.    The crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of the most  complicated throughout the world, not only in South-East Europe.  We must not forget that World War I began in Sarajevo. Now a  European, a world war, and war between civilizations could also  be triggered if we do not contain this situation. There are  volunteers on both sides, on the Serb side and the Muslim one.    The crisis in Bosnia has been prolonged because the  international community, Europe, and the United States, as well  as the United Nations, did not share the same viewpoints on how  to solve the crisis and to halt the war. For the first time in  history, the great forces of Europe were on the same side. They  agreed to give an ultimatum to the Serbs who are besieging the  city of Sarajevo. We hope that the Serbs will agree to withdraw,  that they will accept a political solution, and that the Muslims  will follow suit.    Croatia has favored and continues to favor an end to this  war, and a political solution. I want to stress with  satisfaction that during the talks with President Iliescu and  the Romanian delegation we arrived at the conclusion that we  have to make joint efforts to bring about this peace. The war  and sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia harm not only the countries  in former Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia itself, but also neighboring  countries, and thus Romania, and this is reason enough to seek a  peaceful solution. The war and crisis in Bosnia have reached  their climax. They may even expand. Through joint efforts,  however, we would be able to solve this situation.    I am convinced that the visit paid to friendly Romania and  our talks will contribute to expanding bilateral relations.    I want to conclude by toasting your health, Mr. President  Iliescu, the prosperity of the Romania people, and peace.</p>

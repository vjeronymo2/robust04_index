			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Balance will cut costs of housing Sir, It is a pity Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, has resurrected his party's criticism of deregulated rents in the private rented sector ('Pounds 4bn cost of housing benefit attacked', September 26). The way to reduce housing costs for all is to ensure that demand and supply are in balance. Personal help for those who need it, rather than subsidies to 'bricks and mortar', is more efficient and allows occupiers greater scope to choose tenure, type of landlord, and size and quality of accommodation. If the needs of those who cannot otherwise afford adequate housing are to be met, and if private sector funds are to be tapped for this purpose, both housing support and rents must be high enough to allow the private sector to be confident about long-term investment in rented housing. Recent statements by both the chief secretary to the Treasury and the Labour party have been unhelpful in these respects. Nonetheless a more fundamental look at the form of income support for both homeowners and tenants, with the aims of reducing the poverty trap and achieving a basis of support which is tenure-neutral, is overdue. Such a scheme could lead gradually to reduced housing costs to the public purse and in real terms.

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS  </P> <P> Helen Fladwed has lived in a list of towns that sounds like a conductor's "all  aboard": Deadwood, Des Moines, Hollywood, Burbank, Chatsworth. The biggest  challenge was getting from Iowa to California. Once in Los Angeles, Fladwed has  been a coloratura soprano, wife and mother of two children, church volunteer,  president of a PTA and a reluctant helper on the family chicken ranch. Fladwed,  84, lives in Chatsworth.  </P> <P>  I was born in Deadwood, S.D., and my parents brought me to Des Moines when I  was about 3 years old.  </P> <P> I came to California in 1927. My mother for many years had talked about coming  to California; all Iowans wanted to come to California. It was the place where  there didn't seem to be any prejudice. There was spiritual freedom. It was more  liberated socially. My husband and I moved in with my mother until we could get  all the money together to make the trip. I was 22. My father came on ahead in  '26, to get a job and place for us to live, so he was here.  </P> <P> We started out on the 5th of August in the heat of the day. We got here on the  27th. We had 22 days of problems.  </P> <P> None of us ever drove a car before. I'm talking about greenhorns, greeeenhorns!  My mother bought a Case car, which was as big as these new Toyota vans. It was  a second-hand car, six-passenger, eight-cylinder, all good tires, but the  salesman didn't say that there's a difference between city driving and gravel  driving. We began having all kinds of problems with the tires. In those days it  was tube tires. So my brother and my husband, Jacob, were constantly patching.  The tubes got to be very much crazy quilts of patches.  </P> <P> We got to Demming, N.M., and we had to stay over three days while they got a  part for the car. The engine had gone wrong. We had to sleep outdoors because  there was just a garage and a grocery store, that's all. We had to wash in cold  water, and there was the smell of gasoline. A lot of oil wells had come in. The  gas smell was prevalent all over -- miles and miles into nowhere and you could  still smell it.  </P> <P> When we left Demming, we started out across this high desert. Our little fox  terrier jumped out of the car before we realized it, and he ran wildly toward a  herd of cattle, barking his head off. The cattle started to walk toward him.  Mama says, "Stay right where you are now," because we had read that wild cattle  will attack anybody that's on foot. And, of course, we were the only car. We  were, all of this time, one lonesome car out there in that high desert. We were  so green.  </P> <P> We sat in the car, and it began to get dark, and there was thunder and  lightning, and we had the car windows open. Mom says, "Sit still, sit still.  Don't move." And the lightning was playing all around the car, inside the car  and out. By that time, the cattle had moved all around us. And lightning is  attracted to the horns of cattle. There were actually lightning balls. It was a  tremendous experience.  </P> <P> I never saw mama look at a map. I never saw a map, so I didn't know where we  were going. We were just going by guess and by golly, heading west.  </P> <P> Then we came to Yuma, Arizona. That was a big enough town to have an oil  station, and they were having a grasshopper plague. You had to cover your face  before you got a grasshopper in your mouth, it was that bad. And it was hot. We  got some gasoline, and we were just praying that we'd get into California  without anything more happening.  </P> <P> We finally got to Indio, and then that little old car just heaved a sigh of  relief and says, "Well, I gotcha here. I'm done." And all the tires went down  and we were stranded. They just went flat.  </P> <P> I had started to California in style, wearing a beautiful purple taffeta dress  and hat made to my specifications by a friend. By the time we got to Dennison,  Tex., I was feeling the heat, so I discarded the purple taffeta outfit and went  to the store and I bought man's bib overalls that farmers wear. I made my debut  in California in man's overalls.  </P></p>

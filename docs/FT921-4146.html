			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Investors lose Au Printemps bid battle MINORITY shareholders in Au Printemps, the Parisian stores group, yesterday lost an important court battle to secure more generous bid terms from Pinault, the timber-to-furniture retailing group. The move, coming in the shadow of the legal battle for control of the Perrier mineral water group, is expected to increase support for a change in French takeover regulations. These currently oblige a buyer to bid for only 66 per cent of a company's shares once a third of the equity has been acquired. A full bid is only triggered once the 50 per cent threshold is passed. Au Printemps' minority shareholders took action on the grounds that they believed Pinault had artificially arranged for the expiry of some of the voting rights in a stake it had bought in Au Printemps last November, so as to bring its investment in the stores group below 50 per cent. The seller, the Swiss holding group Maus-Nordmann, had made double voting rights on some of the shares expire by selling them to one of its subsidiaries before on-selling to Pinault, they argued. Pinault should have accordingly extended its FFr5.3bn (Dollars 940m) offer for two-thirds of Au Printemps to all the shareholders. However, the Paris appeal court concluded that Pinault had legitimately bought 37.3 per cent of Au Printemps' voting rights, and that it therefore did not need to make a full bid. Au Printemps' share price dropped by 4 per cent within minutes of the announcement. The finance ministry is consulting stock market organisations and employers' groups, which want an end to the 66 per cent rule, so that full bids would be triggered on the critical threshold. Failure to reform the three-year-old regulation could hamper the country's attempts to attract big institutional investors, they argue.</p>

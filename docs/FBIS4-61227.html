			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1920 GMT on 4 May carries a video report by L.  Shesterkina on the atomic weapons museum at (Snezhensk),  formerly known as Chelyabinsk 70. The museum shows "the most  powerful air-delivered hydrogen bomb in the world" which is,  Shesterkina stresses, the original weapon, and not a model.  Parts of decommissioned ballistic missiles and explosive  devices for civilian purposes are also shown.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Royal Trustco returns to profitability ROYAL Trustco, one of Canada's two biggest trust companies, has reported a CDollars 8m (USDollars 6.8m) loss for the final quarter of 1991, equal to 17 cents a share, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. But the company, which blamed the North American and UK recessions and heavy loan loss provisions for the setback, returned to profitability for the full year. RT took the unusual step last December 24 of releasing preliminary results for the final quarter, indicating that Canadian and US loan losses would be stable, but a further CDollars 70m provision would be made in the UK. The actual loss reported yesterday was higher than most analysts had expected. For the whole of 1991, RT reported net income of CDollars 107m, or 25 cents, after a CDollars 224m loan loss provision, against a loss of CDollars 65m in 1990 after a CDollars 220m provision. Operating income before provisions and taxes was CDollars 346m, against CDollars 200m, helped by lower interest rates, higher fee income and a 2 per cent drop in operating expenses. The dividend is being maintained at 74 cents. RT said it had tightened credit policies and was cutting costs across the board. Royal Trust Bank London is now solely in private banking, asset management and specialised corporate lending, but has a heavy burden of non-performing loans. The UK unit was badly hit by the drop in property values in 1990 and 1991. RT's total assets at December 31 last were CDollars 37.6bn, against CDollars 40.9bn.</p>

The great leader also completely set forth the  execution methods when he presented the militant tasks of this  year for the socialist economic construction sector in his New  Year's address.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: All  economic guiding functionaries should overfulfill this year's  people's economic plan by properly conducting the economic  organizational work and production control in conformity with  the demand of the party's economic strategy, and by highly  demonstrating the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creative  positiveness.    Properly conducting economic organizational work and highly  demonstrating the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creative  positiveness with high responsibility are important methods for  the economic guiding functionaries to overfulfill this year's  people's economic plan.    This year we face formidable tasks of economic construction.  This year, as has been decided by the 21st plenary session of  the party's Sixth Central Committee, we should implement the  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy,  push ahead with the coal and electricity industries and railroad  transportation, which are leading sectors of the people's  economy, and continue to develop the metal industry.    To achieve the enormous task we are facing, economic guiding  functionaries should first properly conduct economic  organizational work. To properly conduct economic  organizational work, one needs to scientifically, rationally,  and concretely conduct all economic work down to the last  detail, and this includes drawing up plans, and organizing and  guaranteeing production.    To properly conduct economic organizational work is a demand  which evolved from the essential character of socialist society.  A socialist society is a highly organized society where  everything is organically in gear with each other. For a long  time, the socialist economy has been tightly linked between  sectors, production units, and parts of the people's economy  that move together and develop according to plan. Therefore,  socialist economy cannot advance a single step if it is not  organized and economic and technical conditions are not  sufficiently guaranteed for the production masses to carry out  economic tasks well.    Furthermore, under practical conditions in which the volume  of socialist economy is growing incomparably and developing  rapidly, only when all the economic organizational works,  including economic management and production organization, are  properly conducted down to the last detail can socialist economy  be scientifically and rationally managed and operated so as to  highly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economic  system.    Properly conducting economic organizational work is also an  immediate demand to mobilize and use all inner reserves without  any waste. To discover all inner reserves and make the most of  them is a firm method to successfully carry out the tasks of  socialist economic construction that we face this year.    Inner reserves exist in diverse form in various sectors of  the people's economy and they grow as socialist construction  progresses. However, inner reserves are not easily detected.  They can only be unsparingly detected and used to the maximum  in production and construction through the functionaries' keen  economic organizational works. In other words, the production  potential and inner reserves can be mobilized and used to the  maximum only when the economic guiding functionaries conduct the  management of enterprises and production activities more  scientifically and rationally, and actively organize the works  for detailed balance and guarantee linkage between economic  sectors, production units, parts, and elements.    Therefore, the firm guarantee for more successfully carrying  out this year's economic task of forecasting massive efforts and  consumption of materials lies in properly conducting the  economic organizational works.    As the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song made clear in his  New  Year address, it is one of the important methods in successfully  carrying out this year's people's economic plan for economic  guidance for functionaries to highly demonstrate the masses'  revolutionary enthusiasm and creative positiveness.    The production masses are the masters who are directly in  charge of production. Without the production masses, production  cannot be done and economic construction cannot progress by any  means. However, even with the production masses, production does  not come automatically and socialist economy does not progress  at a high speed.    It is ideological consciousness that regulates all kinds of  people's acts. The economy can speedily progress when the  production masses are firmly armed with revolutionary ideology  and manifest all kinds of creativity and innovation. The work  to demonstrate the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative  positiveness of the production masses should become the first  step of all the works.    When all the functionaries firmly adhere to our party's  ideological theory before executing any work and freshly carry  out the political works and the works with the people to inspire  the production masses's ideology in various forms and methods,  they will achieve economic tasks given to their respective  sectors and positions displaying revolutionary enthusiasm and  creative positiveness.    When the political work to inspire the masses' ideology is  vigorously carried out, the spirit of collectivism will be  highly displayed in the implementation of economic tasks, so  that collective innovations will be achieved one after another  and economic management will be carried out based on the  principles of collectivism.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy presented at the  21st plenary session of the party's Sixth Central Committee is a  revolutionary economic construction policy which reflects our  party's idea to further display the superiority of our socialism  and strengthen the great might of our socialist self-reliant  national economy by enhancing the people's living remarkably in  the near future through a new upsurge in economic construction.    All the economic guiding functionaries should properly  conduct the economic organizational work in conformity with the  demand of our party's economic strategy and overfulfill this  year's people's economic plan by always being deeply involved  with the masses, sleeping and eating together with them so as to  vigorously carry out political tasks.</p>

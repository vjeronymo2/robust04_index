			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GANG TIES TO KILLING INVESTIGATED;  </P> <P> POLICE PROBE TEEN-AGER'S SHOOTING  </P> <P> Santa Ana police officers are investigating the possibility that the shooting  death of a 14-year-old Westminster youth was gang-related, a police spokesman  said Monday.  </P> <P> However, the family of Duy Duc Vu, a Westminster High School student who was  slain in front of a home on a quiet cul-de-sac in Santa Ana shortly before  midnight Friday, said they believe that the boy was an innocent victim who had  not been involved with gang activity.  </P> <P> After being on life-support systems for several hours, Vu died of the single  gunshot wound to his head late Saturday afternoon at Fountain Valley Regional  Hospital and Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said that there are no suspects but  that "investigators are looking into the shooting as being possibly  gang-related."  </P> <P> She said three unidentified Vietnamese men are being sought in connection with  the shooting.  </P> <P> Helen Vu, the victim's older sister, said the high school freshman "was not a  member of a gang. He was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was  there because he needed a ride home."  </P> <P> Duy Duc Vu had attended a birthday party and was on his way home late Friday  when the group of friends he was with stopped at a house on the 600 block of  South Corta Drive in Santa Ana. The reason for the stop was not known,  authorities said.  </P> <P> At about 11:55 p.m., Vu and his friends, who were assembled on the driveway of  the home, saw a caravan of about five cars pull up and stop in front of the  house. According to reports by Santa Ana police officials and family members,  three males emerged from the cars and fired several rounds, using three  handguns of unknown caliber. The crowd scattered, but not before one of the  bullets struck Vu in the head as he was trying to hide behind a white  Volkswagen parked nearby. No one else was injured, officials said.  </P> <P> The family gathered at the Vu house in Westminster Monday. Helen Vu said her  brother "was the youngest of our family. His death has created a void in our  home. Being the baby, he was loved by everyone. The first thing that he did  each night was his homework. He loved to repair broken electronic things; he  just wasn't the type (to join a gang). He even maintained a friendship with a  local policeman. He considered the man a mentor."  </P> <P> She said that the teen, who was known as "Dukey" to family members, was an  above-average student who loved music and enjoyed lifting weights and playing  volleyball.  </P> <P> "Whatever we do now won't bring him back," she added. "We hope that this won't  happen to others. We don't feel a need for revenge. Bloodshed won't replace our  loss."  </P></p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Power Corporation loses Pounds I103m after exceptionals POWER Corporation, the Irish property group whose Trocadero Centre development in Central London went into administrative receivership in January, has reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds 102.8m (Pounds 98m) for the year ending March 31st 1993, after an exceptional charge of IPounds 97m. The charge consisted of a write-off of IPounds 54.8m on the company's Trocadero and Island Site developments in London, and a further IPounds 42.4m of write-downs in other property values. Excluding the charge, the loss was IPounds 4.5m compared with a profit of IPounds 9.5m in the 1991-92 financial year. Net assets have fallen from IPounds 223m to IPPounds 24.5m. Mr Robin Power, chairman and chief executive, said that disposals of IPounds 14.5m have been made during the year to reduce borrowings. He said: 'As the recession lifts so will rental incomes and property values'. The company has 98 per cent of its properties leased. The company's portfolio of properties held for resale has increased by IPounds 43m to IPounds 85m, primarily due to reclassification of properties from its long-term investment portfolio. The principal asset that is up for sale is the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Losses per share were IPounds 88.43p, against earnings per share last year of IPounds 9.15.</p>

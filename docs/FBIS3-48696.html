			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 24 January, the leaders of four major Japanese  economic organizations urged ruling coalition and opposition  parties to work out a compromise to break their deadlock over  the political reform bills which have triggered both a sharp  drop in stock values and a weakening of the yen. This situation  prompted the business leaders to take action.    At a regularly-scheduled news conference held the same day,  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], said: "Political uncertainty  and economic effects have shown up in stock values, and Japanese  instability in the eyes of the international community has  appeared as yen depreciation. We are at an important turning  point not only from the domestic standpoint, but also from the  international standpoint." Hiraiwa then urged that the  political reform bills be enacted, saying: "Politicians should  take a broad perspective to try to bring about political  reform." He also stated: "The outlook on the economic situation  could further worsen. We ask that politicians handle  pump-priming measures along with political reform."    In his statements announced in the form of an informal talk,  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers'  Associations [Nikkeiren], said: "There is a growing sense of  disappointment concerning the outlook on the political reform  bills which we have asserted would have had the greatest  favorable impact above all else toward economic recovery. For  those politicians who fail to calmly analyze the grave impact of  the current situation and exercise common sense, their  responsibility is extremely serious. If the political reform  bills cannot be enacted during the current Diet session, the  very foundations of the Japanese economy could crack open." He  thus expressed his concern about the current situation.    Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate  Executives [Keizai Doyukai], stated: "Since there was such great  hope in the passage of the political reform bills, we are  concerned that (business and consumer) sentiments may cool down  in reaction to the rejection of the bills. Both ruling  coalition and opposition parties should disregard party  interests and strategies and pour their utmost efforts to  prevent the bills from being killed by seeking a compromise."    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry [Nissho], asserted: "Ruling coalition and opposition  parties should disregard what has occurred between them in the  past regarding political reform, tax system reform, and budget  compilation. They should then discuss and determine what should  be given priority in the interest of the people and promptly  take necessary action."</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Good volume in the futures market belied a somewhat featureless session yesterday enlivened only by a very large order from one leading UK house, writes Christopher Price. The December FT-SE 100 contract opened in muted trading, with business being executed in a narrow range of 2,968 to 2,978. Anticipation of a dull day's business proved shortlived however as a large buy order from one UK investment bank was seen in the late morning. This sent December smartly forward and encouraged a flurry of other buyers to come into the arena. The contract immediately jumped to a hefty premium against the cash market and at its best was trading 17 points ahead. Bear covering was also said also to have added impetus to the rise, which in the absence of Wall Street was maintained for the rest of the session. The contract finally closed at 3,108, up 38 points on the previous session and around 11 points over its fair value, currently standing at just over 4. Turnover was a healthy 12,289 contracts. Dealers said that derivatives trading was likely to remain directionless ahead of the UK Budget, with minds concentrated on squaring up positions prior to Tuesday. And with Wall Street expected to be muted, domestic considerations are likely to be further reinforced. In traded options, turnover reached just over 37,000, around one-third of which was made up of FTSE contracts. The Euro-FTSE recorded turnover of 2,509 contrcats. Among stock options, BT headed the list on 2,106, followed by British Steel with 1,777 and Redland at 1,428.</p>

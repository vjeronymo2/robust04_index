The conference is being held under the slogan:  "Towards New Partnership."    In his inaugural speech, Minister Olechowski put forward a  new concept for cooperation with Russia, which he called  "Partnership for Transformation." In his opinion such  cooperation would lead to the achievement by the two states of  "their proper place among the developed democratic countries."  Olechowski emphasized that the essential feature of  Polish-Russian partnership should be better use of traditional  trade links in order to fill the gap that has arisen after the  disappearance of the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance].    The Polish foreign minister pointed out that Poland and  Russia should support each other in creating a modern trade law  compatible with international standardsm, and they should set up  a system of preferential treatment for bilateral trade, as well  as cooperate in developing banking and transport services.  Olechowski said that Poland had already prepared a plan for an  Eastern European Trade Initiative that would coordinate such  cooperation.    The minister added that it was necessary to create a data  bank of information on investment capabilities of companies in  the two countries and to organize investment promotions and set  up capital links between the companies that in the past used to  cooperate within the CEMA.    Olechowski emphasized that the stabilization of the  situation  in Central and Eastern Europe would be a condition for joining  the community of democratic countries. He expressed the hope  that the participation of Poland and Russia in the Partnership  for Peace program would facilitate the process. In his opinion,  regional and bilateral cooperation in many areas, which should  be conducted as two sovereign states, would also facilitate  stabilization in the region.    "We need partnership with Russia, Ukraine, and other  neighbors in order to make an ambitious contribution to Europe  -- Europe, which is both diversified and unified -- and with the  aim of taking our proper place in it," Olechowski said.</p>

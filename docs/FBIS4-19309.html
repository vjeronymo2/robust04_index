			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Thomas Klestil by Otto Klambauer; </F> place and date not given: "In the European Union We Can Be  Docking Platform for Neighbors" -- first paragraph is DIE PRESSE  introduction]    [Text] Having hardly returned from his trip to the Middle  East, President Thomas Klestil will again go abroad today,  Friday: This time for a "visit to neighbors." Czech President  Vaclav Havel has invited the Central European heads of state to  a two-day summit in the Renaissance palace of Litomysl in  Bohemia. President Klestil defines his "summit position" for  KURIER.    [Klambauer] What do you expect of the Central European  summit in Litomysl?    [Klestil] Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, this area of  Central Europe has again become the center of dramatic events in  the world. After all, two world wars were caused by Central  European problems -- and now we are witnessing the return of  evil spirits in the Balkans. Last year, I myself extended the  invitation for the first talk of presidents to that effect --  therefore, I am particularly happy about the present increase in  the number of participants: It strengthens our efforts for a  zone of stability and peace in Central Europe.    [Klambauer] Regarding the future of Central Europe: Is the  idea of Central Europe still alive -- or is it already nostalgia?    [Klestil] President Havel recently talked of the "spirit of  Salzburg," which also is supposed to be felt now in Litomysl.  We Austrians are closely tied to our neighbors by history and  culture. We have been and we still are a community of fate.  Today we are unified by freedom, democracy, and a market  economy -- but also the joint concern about instability. You  see, the strengthening of comprehensive internal and external  security is at issue -- this also includes the struggle against  uncontrolled mass migration, crime, drug trafficking, and  dangerous nuclear power plants.    [Klambauer] How are the new democracies of East Europe to be  involved?    [Klestil] We belong to the explicit supporters of the  European Union [EU]'s expansion to the East. And, in the event  of a positive referendum in June, we Austrians will also  advocate the entry of the young Central European democracies  into the European Union as soon as possible.    [Klambauer] What does the Austrian president say to the  establishment of closer ties with NATO by our East European  neighbors?    [Klestil] Several Central European states participate in the  NATO Partnership for Peace. This is sensible and we Austrians  welcome it because it is promoting stability.    [Klambauer] And how do you see Austria's role in this "new  Central Europe" on the eve of the EU referendum?    [Klestil] We Austrians have already very close economic ties  with our Central European neighbors today. I would even go so  far as to talk of a "docking platform" which we could serve as  for our neighbors inside the EU This corresponds to our own  interests, our old and new task in the Central European area.</p>

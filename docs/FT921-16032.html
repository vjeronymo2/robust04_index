			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: World markets slowdown hits Carclo CARCLO ENGINEERING, which manufactures products for the textile, automotive and aviation industries, suffered a 33 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.87m. The downturn, from a previous Pounds 4.31m, was a result of the core divisions being hit by the slowdown in world markets. A widespread fall in demand over the six months to end-September put pressure on margins and led to a sharp decline in operating profits to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 4m) on lower turnover of Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 42.4m). Earnings per share fell to 4.9p (7.3p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p. The card clothing division, which provides products used in combing fibres in preparation for spinning to the textile and machinery industries, saw the greatest decline in operating profit - down 36 per cent to Pounds 1m. Mr John Ewart, chairman, said the division's UK businesses did somewhat better thanthe businesses in the Netherlands and France. That was due to the export strength of the UK businesses which supply mills and machinery manufacturers in English and Spanish speaking markets, including the Middle East, the Far East and South America. In the general engineering division, Gills, the control cables manufacturer, was able to buck the overall trend and enjoy increased demand. The operation saw increased demand from its main customer, Ford Motors, where it derives 85 per cent of its turnover. Gills supplies Ford with products for its export market where production figures have been resilient in contrast to the depressed UK car sales market. Carclo is selling Bruntons, a steel wire manufacturer based in Scotland and part of its wire division. The decision came as Bruntons incurred a loss of Pounds 400,000 on lower sales and was based on the board's view that the company does not fit in with its longer term strategy for the single European market.</p>

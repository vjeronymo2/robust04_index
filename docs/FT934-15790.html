			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short rates stay low MONETARY conditions in the UK continued in relaxed style at the end of the first week of the new quarter with short-term money rates staying low and the day's liquidity shortage easily dealt with, writes Peter John. Meanwhile, short sterling futures remained in the wings with volumes low and the range staying tight. At the start of trading yesterday, the Bank of England forecast a cash shortage for the clearing banks of around Pounds 1.1bn. The figure was below the high levels seen earlier in the week but still higher than the norm. Most of the shortage was dealt with immediately as the central bank bought Pounds 950m of treasury bills for repurchase by the market on November 1 at 5 29/32 per cent interest. Shortly afterwards, the Bank bought Pounds 61m of Bands One and Two bills at 5 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the shortage was revised upwards to Pounds 1.15bn and the Bank provided a further Pounds 164m, taking total help for the day to Pounds 1.075bn. The comfortable monetary conditions saw overnight rates falling as low as 3 1/2 per cent at one stage. However, those conditions are unlikely to continue next week and dealers said they were seeing the Monday-for-Tuesday rate quoted as high as 6 3/16 per cent. Short sterling held within a four-basis point range as one dealer commented: 'We're all waiting to see what the weekend press has to say about John Major's speech.' Certainly, the Prime Minister's speech itself, the key point of the Tory Party conference, carried little in the way of market sensitive information and while the most heavily traded futures contract is discounting a third of a percentage point off base rates few believe that further cuts will be made before the November budget. The December contract rose 2 basis points to 94.38, the high of the day, on turnover of less than 12,000 lots. German call money remained steady at around 6.82 per cent with some light demand from banks looking to build up reserves ahead of the weekend. Dealers said banks would lose liquidity as yesterday was the pay date for some DM1.2bn of bonds issued earlier in the week by the central bank of Lower Saxony. However, the volume was not high enough to put significant pressure on the market.</p>

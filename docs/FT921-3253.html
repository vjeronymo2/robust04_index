			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / EC to agree terms of aid for republics EC FINANCE ministers are today expected to agree on the need for Russia and other ex-Soviet republics to join the International Monetary Fund next month, and to settle repayments terms on past debt, before getting macro-economic aid from the west. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economic affairs commissioner, will present to the finance ministers' meeting a paper which details the economic plight of Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. It raises the question of whether the west should start organising for them a currency stabilisation fund, or a balance of payments loan. The tentative nature of the Commission's proposal stems from the fact that the EC executive is split on the need for urgency in helping the CIS. Mr Frans Andriessen, external affairs commissioner, returned two weeks ago from a tour of CIS republics convinced that IMF credits will be too little and too late to meet their immediate needs. The Bush administration's difficulty in getting overall IMF funding increased in a US election year has reinforced, in Mr Andriessen's view, the need to start planning extra funding for Russia now. But Mr Christophersen and the Commission's president, Mr Jacques Delors, appear to concur with the majority of EC governments in arguing that nothing must be done to undermine the IMF's leverage in negotiating reform programmes with Russia and the other CIS states. Yet there is no disagreement within the Commission that additional help will be needed later this year. The Christophersen paper forecasts that Russia's financing gap may rise to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in 1993.</p>

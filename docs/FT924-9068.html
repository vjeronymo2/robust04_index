			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Ashley tumbles Pounds 7.6m into the red ASHLEY GROUP, which is changing its year-end to December 31, reported a plunge from pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.7m to losses of Pounds 7.64m for the 12 months to August 31, while turnover grew from Pounds 389.9m to Pounds 422.6m. A second interim dividend of 0.375p has been declared, bringing the total so far to 0.75p. In the year to August 31 the total was 1.95p. However, Mr James White, chairman of the group which has interests in food distribution in Spain, window blind distribution and plywood, pointed out that Pounds 6.67m of the losses were incurred in the six months to February 29, 'a period of considerable difficulty'. He added that interest payable for the 12 months expanded to Pounds 5.21m (Pounds 1.4m), and that in the first six months there had been an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.81m - relating to restructuring and the Pounds 593,000 golden handshake for Mr Tony Butler, the former chief executive - against a credit of Pounds 2.15m previously. Mr White said the group had made 'sensible progress' in the second six months. The main problem remained Digsa, the Spanish food retailer, which turned in trading losses of Pounds 2.97m (profits Pounds 6.96m) on turnover up at Pounds 386.7m (Pounds 357.6m). Two regions, Zaragoza and Andalucia, performed satisfactorily; Madrid and Albacete moved into the black in the second half, but Catalunya continued to make losses. The window blinds side made profits of Pounds 4.31m (Pounds 6.72m) on turnover of Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 30.5m). Although the margin on sales was about 14 per cent, the Glasgow plant was only operating at 60 per cent capacity because of the depressed housing sector. Gearing stood at 90 per cent as debt grew to Pounds 34.6m, mainly through the needs for working capital in Spain, though Mr White said that should start 'throwing off benefit' soon. Losses per share emerged at 6.8p (earnings 7.5p), though 5.3p of that was attributable to the first six months.</p>

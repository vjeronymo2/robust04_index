			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / EIB may lend to Latin America THE EC is to consider allowing the European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance projects in Latin America, one of the few regions to which the Community's development bank does not lend. This was the main result of a weekend meeting in Luxembourg of the foreign ministers of the 12 and the Rio Group of the 11 main Latin American countries. The European Commission is expected to put the issue to foreign and finance ministers of EC member states next month. It was agreed, meanwhile, that work would start on evaluating specific candidate projects, probably inriver transport and electricity transmission. The EIB only carried out 5 per cent of its Ecu13.4bn (Pounds 9.25bn) lending outside the EC last year but it is the largest supranational borrower on international capital markets. Debt-be set Latin American countries would welcome not only the project finance but theEIB's seal of approval, a senior South American diplomat said.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: In step on the computer screen - Worth Watching Irresistable Force and Flux may sound like elements of a school curriculum, but they are actually dance music artists. Tracks from them and five others are now available on Escape, the latest home entertainment system developed by Philips Interactive Media and video producers Hex. A combination of compact disc quality music and computer graphics, Escape, is a Pounds 15.99 CD which is played on a Philips CD-I player. As the music booms out, computer-generated graphics whizz across the television screen. By moving the joy stick on the CD-I player the images can be manipulated to change shape, colour and direction in time to the music. Philips: UK, 081 689 4444.</p>

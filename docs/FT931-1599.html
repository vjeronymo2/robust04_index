			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Canberra warned on federal deficit MR Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, yesterday warned the government that recovery from the 1990-91 recession could not be sustained without a reduction in the federal budget deficit. Mr Fraser's warning accompanied a widely-forecast reduction of half a percentage point in official interest rates to 5.25 per cent, the 14th cut since rates peaked at 18 per cent in early 1990. Lower interest rates would assist business cash flows and encourage investment. But the budget deficit 'will need to be reduced over the medium term to provide room for a rising level of business investment', he said. The deficit is forecast to reach ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds 7.7bn) this year, equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The government claims that economic growth will reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Meanwhile, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, announced the promotion of 11 backbenchers in a reshuffle which stamps his authority on the Labor government following its victory in last week's federal election. However, Mr Keating delayed the announcement of portfolios until today, apparently to avoid distracting media attention from challenges to the leadership of both conservative opposition parties. The prime minister also postponed announcing senior bureaucratic appointments and changes in departmental structures which will accompany the revamped government. Several senior ministers were sacked, including Mr John Kerin, trade minister, who was briefly treasurer (finance minister) in 1991. Mr John Dawkins, the present treasurer is expected to retain his post. Mr John Hewson, leader of the Liberal party, the largest partner in the opposition coalition, comfortably defeated a challenge from Mr John Howard, a former leader. Mr Tim Fischer, leader of the National party, was also re-elected.</p>

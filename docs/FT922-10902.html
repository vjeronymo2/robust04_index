			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / NZ budget deficit doubles THE New Zealand government yesterday announced a projected doubling in its budget deficit for the year to June 30 to NZDollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.02bn), raising questions over its pledge to balance the books in the current parliamentary term. However, Ms Ruth Richardson, finance minister, expressed confidence that increasing economic growth would deliver the revenue she needed. She said the government remained committed to holding down spending. The rise was primarily due to a fall in revenue due to the deep economic recession, with business tax being much lower than expected. The government also lost NZDollars 225m due to a technical change in collecting the consumption tax, and had decided not to sell its recently acquired shares in Fletcher Challenge, the leading local forest products and industrial group, before June. On budget night last July Ms Richardson forecast a deficit this financial year of NZDollars 1.7bn. This was increased in December to NZDollars 2.75bn. The latest forecast is NZDollars 3.425bn.</p>

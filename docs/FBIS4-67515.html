			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by V. Semenchenko: ``What Do Statistics Know?''] </F>   [Text] Out of 7,927 surveyed industrial enterprises, 12  percent exceed the permitted levels of exhaust and hazardous  waste dumping. Over the past year, 30 emergency cases of waste  dumping were reported, most of which ended up in the Black Sea  basin. The ``Tsentrolit'' oil refinery and the pulp and paper  mill in Ismail remain major contaminators of the environment.    However, this cloud of exhaust has its own silver lining.  The drop in production spared us 17,500 tonnes of dirty  emissions into the atmosphere and some 115,000 tonnes of toxic  waste.    Vast damage has been inflicted by illegal logging. The  growing number of hotbeds of disease and pestilence has  obliterated 36 hectares of forest. However, employees of  ``Odessales'' do not just sit around twiddling their thumbs.  Already concluded prevention measures covered an area of 12,100  hectares--more than in the previous year. Unfortunately, there  were fewer saplings planted this year. The reason remains the  same: deficient fuel supplies.    The oblast's 37 hunting enterprises work to protect, breed,  and control the quantity of wild animals and birds. In the  ``Dunayskiye Plavni'' reserve, rare species of wildlife and  flora are watched and protected.</p>

Shots were fired on January 12 at the windows of Hrach's  office. One of the party officials was sitting in Hrach's  armchair at that time. By the latest reports, the bullets  pierced the table but did not hit the official.    The statement expressed its willingness to set up workers'  self-defense units which would "within the framework of the law  fight organized crime and stop the Mafia."    The Crimean Interior Ministry's press service says,  meanwhile, that the incident was an act of hooliganism rather  than an assassination attempt.</p>

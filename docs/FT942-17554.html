			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Now Caradon must deliver - The Bottom Line For Caradon, 1993 undoubtedly was a year of remarkable change. During the 12 months, it sold a business which in 1992 had contributed 30 per cent of pre-tax profits, and bought another which will double the turnover of its core building products activity. At the same time, it held a Pounds 334m rights issue and, almost as a sideline, changed its name. In spite of all this activity, underlying profits were 5 per cent up and earnings per share, excluding exceptionals, were unchanged. It is hard to fault the Caradon management's handling of the strategic changes it made last year. The sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox had been on the cards for some time - indeed, almost since the company was formed by the merger of MB Group's packaging operations with Carnaud of France. That was in 1989, shortly before MB merged with Caradon to form MB-Caradon, which has now reverted to the Caradon name. But CarnaudMetalbox had its problems, and Caradon had to play a waiting game to secure the best price it could for its stake. Its chance finally came in spring last year and it sold the stake in April for a net Pounds 467.5m, giving a profit of Pounds 100.3m. By then, though, interest rates had fallen. This meant two things: that the returns on the cash would not match the profits Caradon was getting from its packaging investment, and that prices of building product groups were rising, almost out of reach. So Caradon did well to strike a deal with RTZ to buy the Pillar businesses (for Pounds 808.7m) against opposition from other interested parties. The deal was announced in August, with the rights issue, and was completed in October, leaving the balance sheet with gearing of only 8 per cent. At the halfway stage, the diluting effect of selling the CarnaudMetalbox stake could be seen in a 5.3 per cent fall in earnings per share. But by the full year, with the benefit of only two months' trading from Pillar, this had been made up to leave earnings unchanged at 15.2p a share. That said, however, it could turn out that doing the strategic deals was the easy part. The Pillar acquisition takes Caradon into new areas, notably building products in North America, and its scale leaves little room for error. Caradon undoubtedly has bought itself a great opportunity. The Pillar business, although not neglected, did not do as well as it might have within RTZ where the focus is on mining. Pillar's margins are lower than Caradon's, giving potential for improvements, and it brings market leadership in segments where Caradon has not operated previously. So far, the city has been willing to take Caradon's ability to turn that potential into profits on trust. But, from here on, Caradon must start to deliver. What worried analysts about this week's results was evidence suggesting a poorer performance in Caradon's UK building products than had been achieved by its best competitors. If Caradon was not doing well in the business it knew best, they asked, how was it going to sort out Pillar? The Caradon management admits readily that, with so much going on at the corporate strategic level last year, it might well have taken its eye off the ball in the basic business. UK building product volumes rose 9 per cent, as the market began to recover from recession, but prices fell 1 per cent, leaving turnover up 8 per cent. Operating profits barely were changed at Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 35.2m), although much of the lack of growth could be put down to problems in bathrooms where the troubles at Spring Ram led to pricing pressures. Nevertheless forecasts are still for a large rise in present-year profits, to Pounds 200m or more from 1993's Pounds 132.2m excluding exceptionals. Chief executive Peter Jansen will not be drawn to make forecasts, but agrees that 'it would go very hard with us' if earnings per share were not enhanced by the Pillar deal.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Morita Proposes Task Force: Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita said he has  proposed the creation of a joint task force to study the United States'  $55-billion trade deficit with Japan and the growing dependence of U.S.  companies on Japanese manufacturing technology. He said he had already taken  his task force proposal to Japanese and U.S. officials, suggesting that they  study the trade issue and come up with a plan of action. "We (Japan) are not a  consumer supplier anymore," Morita said at a business conference. Morita said  the trade gap is increasingly the result of America's dependence on Japanese  manufacturing technology and could not be reduced only by pushing the dollar  down in value against the Japanese yen.  </P></p>

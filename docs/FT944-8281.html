			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Leading Article: No bad thing for Ireland The outside world in general, and Britain and Northern Ireland in particular, have been watching with some confusion and alarm as the Irish government pulled itself apart over the past week. Just as the peace process in Ireland offers a real chance of relief for the bombed and battered population of the north, the coalition in Dublin appears to have collapsed over what outsiders might regard as a domestic squabble. It would be wrong, however, to dismiss the issues involved in the disintegration of the Irish government, and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister and leader of Fianna Fail, the largest party, as irrelevant to the peace process and the future of Ireland. Far from it. The confrontation between Mr Dick Spring and his Labour party, on the one hand, and Mr Reynolds' party on the other, has exposed some vital questions about the democratic process in the Irish republic. The first is whether the country can claim to be a genuinely secular state while the Roman Catholic church continues to wield a pervasive influence in political life, a subject of enormous concern to the northern Irish protestant population. The second is the tradition of making blatantly political appointments to the Irish judiciary. The third is the question of accountability of politicians for their words and actions, an important component in an open and flourishing democracy. On all of these concerns, the Irish republic would appear to have emerged strengthened as a democratic state from the events of the past week. The confrontation in the coalition blew up over the insistence of Mr Reynolds on nominating his friend and attorney-general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as the next president of the High Court, the second highest judicial office in the land. Mr Whelehan was already a highly controversial figure for his role in seeking to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for an abortion. His obvious reluctance to extradite a self-confessed paedophile priest to face charges in Northern Ireland compounded the impression that he was unduly influenced by the most conservative elements in the Catholic church. The fact that both have now been forced to resign - and that their resignation has been welcomed by the Irish population - suggests that the trend towards a more secular state is growing, as is the pressure for clean government. Both misled their cabinet colleagues and parliament, and both have been held accountable. Mr Spring now faces a tough decision whether to reform the coalition with Fianna Fail under its new leader, Mr Bertie Ahern. On balance, he would appear wise to do so, at least to bring minimum disruption to the peace process. Mr Ahern has a good record as a successful negotiator and broker of tough compromises as a trade union leader, and labour minister. Mr Spring has proved some important points. Now the most crucial thing is to keep the peace process on track.</p>

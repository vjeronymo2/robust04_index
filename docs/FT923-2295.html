			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Policy after the collapse THE ECONOMIC policy of the UK is now in tatters. So, unfortunately, is its relationship with the German monetary authorities. The UK must refashion the first and repair the second. But it must also preserve what has been achieved under Mr John Major, both within the UK economy and in the UK's relations with the rest of Europe. The UK can and must be both actively and sympathetically involved in European integration. It will be so only if it solves its fundamental economic problem, that of securing non-inflationary growth. The ERM policy did not fail because the UK government was tactically inept, though it was. Nor did the policy fail because of the maladroitness of the Bundesbank, though that certainly helped. The policy failed because its price became too high. It became impossible to believe in the survival of a policy that seemed to promise indefinite continuation of recession, ever-rising unemployment and progressive fiscal deterioration. The markets decided that no government could support the parity at the price of an economic decline unparallelled in the history of the ERM. The defeat was suffered for two noble causes: a desire to eliminate the UK's ruinous inflationary psychology and a determination to play a full part in the councils of Europe. The FT supports both causes, as it supported the ERM policy. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Lamont are to be damned for their pursuit of this policy, nor even for their repeated assertions that they would never do what, in the end, they were forced to do. Such assertions are the swiftly debased coinage of any semi-fixed exchange rate regime. Yet sterling cannot simply be returned to the ERM at the earliest opportunity, as if nothing had happened. Even a resounding Yes in Sunday's Maastricht referendum in France would not decide the matter. Brutal reminders The argument for ERM membership was that it would both add to the credibility of UK monetary policy and reinforce the country's participation in European integration. But no new parity can have credibility. Who imagines that the government, after already losing some 7 per cent of the value of the huge sums dispensed in sterling's defence, would soon repeat the experience? Who believes that the backbiting between the British government and the German authorities of recent days has helped European integration? The last two years and, above all, the last few weeks have given brutal reminders of the rake's progress of vulnerable parities in exchange rate regimes like the ERM: the ever-more fulsome avowal of decreasingly credible commitments, the conflict between domestic and external exigencies, the arguments between those responsible for the key currency and those on the periphery, the one-way bet offered to speculators, the final panic and then the ignominious collapse. These are not risks to be run lightly once more. A regime with the economically turbulent unified Germany at its heart would again tie the UK to a frequently inappropriate monetary policy. At present that policy is probably still too tight. Until the dust settles in Germany, the UK would do best to wait in the wings. Real dangers It should, instead, take the opportunity offered by its floating exchange rate. But it must not ignore the real dangers of doing so. What is needed is to build on the still incomplete achievement of low inflation. The higher prices that will follow directly from the current devaluation must not be allowed to generate a new wage-price spiral. No dashes for consumption-led growth can be contemplated. The government was right to lower base rate to 10 per cent once again, but it should go no further than that for the moment. Devaluation will stimulate manufacturing, itself among the most depressed parts of the economy. A slow recovery, led by exports, would be far safer and gain far more credibility for whatever parity might ultimately be chosen than an attempt to stimulate consumption through much reduced interest rates. Any such reduction might also lead to a complete collapse of sterling, because it would be rightly perceived as a return to the often repeated short-term growthmanship of the UK. The case for granting the Bank of England the power to set interest rates, subject to an explicit and public override by the government, is now overwhelming. A government prepared to cede that power to the Bundesbank should not be averse to giving it to a reformed Bank of England. The Bank, in turn, should focus precisely on what the Bundesbank does, the growth of credit and money supply, the exchange rate and long-term rates of interest. A policy dedicated to attaining non-inflationary growth is best for the UK and also the best way for the UK to prepare itself for further involvement in European monetary integration. Europe needs a UK that believes in itself, not one that believes itself incapable of anything better than devotion to an inward-looking Bundesbank. What the Bundesbank was expected to do for the UK can also be done by the Bank of England. It was done by the Bank for centuries. That is the only monetary policy the British government can now sensibly adopt.</p>

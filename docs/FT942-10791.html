			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Treasury and Bank in halfway house Once upon a time I used to advise fellow economic journalists that the sure way of securing prominence for an article was to say that there was a difference between the UK Treasury and the Bank of England - or if the writer wanted to be pedantic, a difference of emphasis, as no two institutions ever entirely agree. This strategy will have to be reassessed, although not entirely abandoned, in view of the fact that the two organisations have dipped their toes into the waters of greater openness. The right attitude now is one of qualified rapture tinged with irony. The first serious move, taken over a year ago, was the publication of the Bank's independent quarterly Inflation Report, which the Treasury is now 'only shown in its final form'. Then last November the Bank was given discretion over the timing of interest rate changes - the substance is still decided by the chancellor. Finally, there was the decision to publish, after a gap of six weeks, minutes of the monthly Monetary Meeting between governor and chancellor. The plan to publish the minutes has been around about a year. The final decision was not made until after the disagreement between chancellor and governor in February over the former's proposals to cut base rates by  1/2 per cent. When the chancellor saw that the minutes recording this could be published without disaster he recognised a test case and pressed the green light. In fact, the disagreement took a second day to resolve; and officials toyed with the idea of pretending that the second meeting never took place until wiser counsels prevailed. The published minutes begin with an anodyne set of notes on recent developments based partly on the Treasury's own Monetary Report, which is published on the same day and has now been jazzed up in appearance. There then follows the opening remarks of the governor, Eddie George, set out fairly fully. Mr George makes sure of this by handing over a full set of his speaking notes to the Treasury secretariat. After that comes the chancellor's own assessment, often more briefly given. Here, however, a minor element of fiction enters. For the chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, usually encourages the Treasury's chief economic adviser, Prof Alan Budd, to lead off for the Treasury and comes in himself somewhat later. The rest of the discussion is given as a series of separate and unrelated points, not attributed to anyone. The final paragraph is called 'Conclusion' and contains the chancellor's summary and decision. In fact there are quite a large number of people in the room during this bilateral meeting, including the Treasury's permanent secretary, press advisers, and Sarah Hogg from the prime minister's office. This makes the preliminary meeting, between Treasury and Bank officials to prepare the ground, all the more crucial; and one is assured that these discussions are more systematic and less pointilliste than the chancellor-governor meeting. There are good hopes of the official anonymity being penetrated. For instance, at the February meeting, where the chancellor and governor disagreed over a base rate cut, Kenneth Clarke complained that the 'advice' he received was too cautious, but in no way exempted his Treasury officials from this stricture. The UK minutes obviously follow the model of the Fed Open Market Committee, but do not go as far. For the Fed lists who voted for and against the final decision. But it is in London only where one person has a vote - the chancellor (presumably the prime minister can whisper in his ear). The timing of the monetary meeting - a day or two after the publication of M0 figures - is itself a historical hangover, dating from the time when the Treasury was still trying to use this aggregate, which consists almost entirely of notes and coins, as its main monetary target. Now it is but one of many indicators that are examined. Indeed, the most important clutch of indicators, such as retail sales, more widely based money and credit, manufacturing production, unemployment and earnings and producer and retail prices, all come out around the middle of the month. Obviously, the two main characters are role playing. Kenneth Clarke fully intends to let Eddie George take the initiative when the issue is whether to raise interest rates. The governor, however, is not quite so reconciled to waiting for the chancellor to propose interest rate reductions. The base rate cut of January 1993 occurred, of course, before the publication of minutes. But it was triggered by the Bank's concern over the snail's pace of economic recovery. The more typical February 1994 debate was resolved by making the base rate cut one of a quarter per cent. This is fine, as far as it means smaller and more frequent changes, which could make monetary policy one degree less politicised. But it is far from fine if it means that disagreements are to be resolved by splitting the difference. Both in relation to Bank of England independence and in relation to greater transparency, the present arrangements are all too clearly a halfway house.</p>

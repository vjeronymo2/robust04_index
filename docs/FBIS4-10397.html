			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Any viable solution to the Haitian crisis must  facilitate the lifting of the embargo, according to statements  by [Senator] Julio Larosiliere, who labels the actions of the  second office of the Senate of the Republic a bluff. The true  solution is the one that will answer the desiderata of the  Haitian people, says Sen. Larosiliere.    [Begin Larosiliere recording, in Creole] In my opinion, this  is a bluff because any solution that does not take into account  the entire Haitian people and the lifting of the embargo will  fail, is not good. I have the impression that those who want it  have something up their sleeve. Many of those who want it would  like to see a government established even though they know it  will not be ruling for longer than two months. Meanwhile, they  will have time to dissolve the parliament, raise the money  ceiling, put money into circulation. It will also allow them to  put some money in their pockets. As exile does not harm them,  this is not a problem for them, even if they find a way to  remain in Haiti. But at least they will have time to make some  money. [end recording]    In addition, the quaestor of the legitimate [Senate] office  has asked the 18 January senators to refrain from participating  in the sessions, as provided for by the New York pact.

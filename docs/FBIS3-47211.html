The eight-member Foreign Ministry mission is looking into  possible areas for an expanded Japanese contribution to the  international efforts under way in the former Yugoslavia.    Shunji Yanai, director general of the ministry's Foreign  Policy Bureau, said there is much Japan ought to do in the way  of humanitarian assistance, such as helping with refugee camps.    He suggested that Japan could also help with reconstruction  after the conflict is over.    The team, which left Japan last Friday, visited an inland UN  protected area that is one of four such demilitarized sites set  up in Croatia.    They also crossed a cease-fire line between Croatian and  ethnic Serbian forces and visited the country's border with  Bosnia-Hercegovina at the Sava river.    At each site, the Japanese were briefed by local officers of  the UN protection force.    On Tuesday, the mission will visit the besieged Bosnian  capital of Sarajevo and meet officials of the government there.  They will also visit the Serbian capital of Belgrade and the  Macedonian capital of Skopje before returning to Japan on  January 17.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Doors open for Euro-shoppers EC finance ministers last night cleared the way for almost unlimited cross-border shopping for liquor and cigarettes from 1993. Legal limits on the amount of duty-paid liquor and cigarettes EC travellers can bring home with them will be raised far beyond current levels by an EC directive approved yesterday, which sets up a definitive system for administering and policing excise duty after 1992. This is the latest piece of the post-1992 VAT and excise system to be put in place, following last year's agreement on the broad indirect tax framework. Under pressure from Germany, which would prefer the whole package to be agreed simultaneously, EC ministers also promised to complete the other elements before Portugal's EC presidency ends in June. The outstanding issues include the definition of dutiable goods and the knotty question of harmonised VAT and excise rates. There is a consensus on rates, but Britain in particular is unwilling to agree a formal text. Under yesterday's agreement, border controls will disappear. But above certain indicative limits - as many as 800 cigarettes, 110 litres of beer, or 120 bottles of wine, for example - national authorities could stop travellers anywhere in the Community and ask for proof that the goods had been bought for personal consumption. According to European Commission officials, buying more than the indicated limit of 90 bottles of champagne for, say, a wedding would be acceptable, but driving them home to sell to friends would not. In practice, however, only the UK, Denmark and Ireland have said they will use an indicative limit at all. Other EC members seem set to allow unlimited cross-border shopping.</p>

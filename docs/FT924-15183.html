			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Eurotunnel shares hit by delay warning: Shareholders may be asked for extra funds as opening date is put back SHARES in Eurotunnel yester-day plunged 15 per cent after the group warned that the opening of the Channel tunnel would be further delayed and that shareholders might be called upon to put up more cash. The tunnel is not expected to open until December next year at the earliest  -six months later than originally planned. Even then the group is unlikely to have enough locomotives and rolling stock to run a full service until autumn 1994. Eurotunnel's share price fell 62p to 358p following the disclosure of more delays in a letter to shareholders accompanying the group's interim results. Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel chief executive, said the group had not been able to establish a final opening date for the tunnel as contractors had not agreed a settlement over their long-running claim for extra payments. 'The tunnel could open either side of Christmas next year but at the moment we are working towards an opening date of December 15, 1993,' he said. No extra funds would be needed until after the tunnel opened when cashflow problems were likely to arise because of late opening and slow delivery of trains, he added. 'Most current projections show that we shall have to seek further funds from various sources, including our shareholders, in 1994 and 1995,' said Sir Alastair. Eurotunnel is already in technical breach of its loan covenants and will need to seek a further waiver from banks at the end of next month to enable it to continue to draw down funds. 'By then the banks will have been able to study in detail our latest cost and revenue projections,' said Sir Alastair. The banks are particularly concerned that they should not be called on to provide any increase in the loan facilities available to the company. Independent forecasts published yesterday by Eurotunnel revealed that revenues in 1994, the first full year of operation, are expected to be almost Pounds 180m less than had been forcast 10 months ago by the same consultants. It was impossible to say how much additional finance, if any, would be required and how this might be raised, said Sir Alastair. Shareholders, however, would be very lucky if they received a dividend payment before the end of the century. The dispute with contractors over the cost of fitting out the rail tunnels has yet to be resolved although the gap between the two sides is now less than Pounds 130m in 1985 prices, according to Sir Alastair. He said a settlement was almost reached in mid-August when Eurotunnel was understood to have offered Pounds 1.2bn of which about Pounds 200m was expected to be in some form of equity including a convertible loan stock. Contractors, however, were concerned about how the share element was to be valued. Sir Alastair said contractors could pursue legal claims against Eurotunnel, which could take years to resolve, or accept the group's 'final offer'. The cost of the project has risen since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn. Lex, Page 22; Market, Page 46</p>

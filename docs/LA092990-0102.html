			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO FILE: LAW PAVES WAY FOR SURCHARGES TO FINANCE REMOVAL OF GRAFFITI  </P> <P> Voters could authorize cities and counties to impose surcharges on aerosol  spray paint cans and felt-tip markers to raise money for gang graffiti cleanup  efforts under a bill signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> "The problem of graffiti in our neighborhoods has reached epic proportions,"  said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), the sponsor of AB 3580, "and it is  the homeowner and the business owner who are bearing the high costs of removal.  </P> <P> "This bill sends a message to the (graffiti) 'taggers' that we aren't going to  bear the burden of your graffiti anymore."  </P> <P> Katz's legislation would permit local governments to levy up to a 10-cent  charge on aerosol spray paint cans and a five-cent charge on marker pens to be  spent solely on graffiti removal if two-thirds of the voters agreed with such a  move.  </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Bills Signed  </P> <P> Low-Income Housing: SB 2011 by Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) to require  cities and counties to approve housing developments that include a minimum of  20% of units that are affordable to low- and moderate-income families. The law  sets the stage for proponents to take cities and counties that balk to court.  </P> <P> Health Insurance: AB 1721 by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) to  prohibit health insurance companies from discriminating against applicants on  the basis of sexual orientation.  </P> <P> Drunk Driving: AB 2040 by Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel) to permanently extend  a program calling for the installation of ignition-interlock devices designed  to prevent repeat drunk drivers from starting their automobiles while under the  influence of alcohol.  </P> <P> Check Cashing: AB 3096 by Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland) to require  check-cashing operations to conspicuously post a schedule of service fees.  </P> <P> Worker Safety: AB 1675 by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) to  permit dual prosecution for criminal and civil penalties for violations of  state worker-safety regulations that result in death.  </P> <P> Environmental Advertising: AB 3994 by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) to  set specific standards that manufacturers must prove their products meet before  they can use such environmental terms as "biodegradable . . . recyclable . . .  or ozone friendly" in advertising. The governor said he was concerned that the  bill made no allowance for goods already in the consumer pipeline, but he said  the author has agreed to introduce corrective legislation next year.  </P> <P> Bills Vetoed  </P> <P> Auto Theft: SB 2544 by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) to require the Highway  Patrol to set up an auto-theft information reward program and impose an  assessment on insurers to pay for it. The governor said he wasn't convinced  that another program would improve efforts in this area.  </P> <P> Statutory Rape: AB 4312 by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) to allow  women to be prosecuted for statutory rape for sexual intercourse with a boy  under 18 who is not the spouse of the perpetrator. The governor said he was  concerned that the bill didn't receive the proper attention it deserved in the  legislative process.  </P> <P> Jet Skis: AB 2768 by Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) to outlaw the  operation of jet skis, wet bikes or surf jets by anyone under 16. Deukmejian  said he was unaware of any studies that showed that persons under 16 were  involved in a disproportionate number of accidents with such vehicles.  </P> <P> Capital Fact  </P> <P> Proposed legislation sent for further study between sessions of the Legislature  may resurface later, but more often it quietly dies and never becomes law.  </P></p>

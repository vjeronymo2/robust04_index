			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Maxwell's paupers - The plight of the former Maxwell employees LOLA Baker remembers November 22, 1991, very clearly. That was the day she and a group of other employees of Robert Maxwell's AGB Group were told they were being made redundant. In fact, it was the start of a chain of events that, in the words of one Maxwell company pensioner, could leave Lola Baker 'on the precipice of poverty.' After 31 1/2 years of loyal service, her severance terms entitled her to nearly Pounds 20,000 as a lump sum payment and, of course, her pension. But, by December, the company was in the hands of an administrator. On December 10, Baker and about 25 others were called in to see the administrator, Arthur Anderson, which had more bad news. It told the group it had no legal obligation to make redundancy payments and would not be doing so. 'I could quickly see what was happening but some of the other employees couldn't take it in. One of them said, 'But Christmas is coming. What are we to do?' The administrator told him, 'Well, if I were you, I'd go and sign on (for the dole) first thing in the morning'.' Baker is divorced and the mother of a handicapped adult son who depends wholly on her. Immediately, she set about getting another job, believing that her pension, at least, was intact. But the worst was to come. Late last week the pension funds were wound up, with administrators saying it was uncertain how much, if any, of the assets remained. Through all the turmoil at AGB, this was the one eventuality that had never occurred to Baker. 'I always thought a pension was sacrosanct. It's not like you're investing and taking a risk - not like unit trusts or something. It's supposed to be the one cast-iron guarantee.' Perhaps her position is even worse than most. She has been told she is not even eligible for a government pension because she had not paid enough National Insurance contributions. She had relied on her husband to make those on her behalf. When they divorced, he, not she, became the legal owner of the government pension. Ken Jarrett, who administered the AGB pension scheme before the Maxwell family acquired the company, concedes that, at least for the foreseeable future, his position is better than some. The administrators have said that current pensioners will have priority over assets. Unlike Baker, who had not yet retired officially, Jarrett took early retirement last November, aged 62, after 36 years of service. 'The day I got the news that the AGB fund might have been stripped was the day after my retirement party. It was my wife and I and 20 or 30 of our closest friends,' Jarrett recalls. 'My wife left Hanger Lane (the AGB offices in west London) with a great big bouquet. The next thing I knew, I had no pension. I'm extremely angry.' Jarrett says he is, at least, still getting pension benefits, although it is unclear if they will go on. He has some savings and his mortgage is paid off. But after having contributed to a pension fund for 36 years, believing his old age would be secure, Jarrett is bitter. While he had planned to devote his retirement to voluntary work for local charities, he is spending his time working with a group of other pension fund members trying to obtain redress from someone. If nothing else, the Maxwell collapse has highlighted the vulnerable legal position of all pensioners. Unlike investors, savers or insurance policy-holders, there is no such thing as a safety net to catch those whose pension funds collapse. Moreover, the plight of the Maxwell pensioners shows how little control fund members have over how their money is invested or disbursed. Tony Boram is head of a group of Mirror Group Newspaper (MGN) pension fund members who retained a solicitor to help them learn more about where their money went. As part of their effort to persuade the trustees to give more information, Boram had to promise Maxwell's solicitors that he would not make public comments about the funds. Part of the reason the group did not pursue Maxwell further in the courts was, quite simply, 'that we knew he would pursue the case to the High Court and it would be tied up for six years. And all those legal costs could be charged to the pension fund.' The sad truth is that fund members who wish to challenge trustees on anything must pay for their efforts themselves, while the full resources of the scheme are available for the defence of the trustees. Some recent legislation has helped pensioners. In particular, disclosure rules now require pension funds to give members an annual financial report. And those reports bear careful reading. Malcolm Albutt, a market research executive at an AGB-run company, decided to ask for the AGB scheme's annual report after hearing about problems at the MGN pension fund. After viewing the investments, he and a group of colleagues immediately requested a block transfer out of the AGB scheme into a private one. Unfortunately, the scheme collapsed before the transfer could be made and their pensions - or what remains of them - are frozen inside. Albutt said it did not take much for him to realise something was wrong. The annual report for the period ended April 5, 1990, showed that not one of the fund's 20 largest investments were in FTSE-100 companies. Most were connected in some way to Maxwell's private interests. In fact, those 20 largest investments, many in foreign companies, accounted for 65.6 per cent of total investments - a concentration that defies general principles of diversification. The Maxwell private company pension scheme members say the best for which they can hope is that the government will concede that its self-regulatory bodies failed to oversee the funds' investment managers properly. Otherwise, some are facing the loss of more than 30 years of savings.</p>

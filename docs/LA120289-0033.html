			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE POLARIZES EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> FMLN "terrorists" attack the U.S.-supported government of El Salvador, while  Contra "freedom fighters" attack the U.S.-opposed government of Nicaragua. I  imagine the appellations are reversed in the media of, say, Cuba and Russia.  </P> <P> When these threadbare and profoundly flawed pejoratives come from the mouths of  official spokesmen, is it any wonder that negotiations fail?  </P> <P> Does President Bush really believe that these characterizations are valid? How  can we play a positive role in the resolution of these blood-soaked guerrilla  wars while broadcasting such divisive misrepresentations?  </P> <P> E.C. BRESSLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

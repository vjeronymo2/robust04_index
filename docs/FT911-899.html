			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Seoul acts in land row SOUTH KOREA has frozen bank credit to 14 companies from eight of the country's largest business groups for failing to obey a government order to sell surplus land by Tuesday. The measure is the strongest yet taken by the government in its attempts to curb real estate speculation which has driven up land prices and diverted funds from productive investment. Last year, the government announced that companies must dispose of a total of 57.44m pyong (149.55m square metres) of land which was not being directly used for their business operations. At the beginning of this week, the deadline for the disposal, only 63 per cent of this land had been sold. The 14 companies - which belong to the Lotte Group, the Hanjin Group and six other conglomerates - are expected to suffer financial difficulties as a result of the credit freeze. They will face further penalties if they fail to dispose of their non-business land by the end of the month. In particular, they will be restricted to selecting just one company to be freed from existing credit constraints under a new government policy.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Sinn Fein in talks with US executive A senior Irish-American businessman is holding informal talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, in an effort to bring about peace in Nothern Ireland. It emerged yesterday that Mr William Flyn, president of Mutual America, one of the biggest US insurance companies, has renewed contact with Sinn Fein while on a visit this week to Dublin and Belfast. Mr Flyn is part of a delegation of Irish-American businessmen who have been discussing investment oppor-tunities on both sides of the Irish border with government officials and local enterprises. He is understood to have used the opportunity of the visit to try to persuade Sinn Fein of the growing support within the Irish-American community for the UK-Irish peace initiative. Mr Flyn was one of the central figures behind the controversial visit of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to New York in February. His invitation to Mr Adams to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland led to President Bill Clinton granting the Sinn Fein leader a visa against the advice of British and US state department officials. Mr Flyn believes the visit helped strengthen Mr Adams's influence within the IRA in support of the peace initiative.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACIST KILLING IN BENSONHURST  </P> <P> Some members of the Bensonhurst emigre community were heard fiercely  proclaiming their "100%" Italian origins at several of the African-American  demonstrators who marched through their xenophobic neighborhood in the  aftermath of the tragic Yusuf Hawkins murder. Very interesting indeed.  </P> <P> The grandparents of the young men accused of destroying Mr. Hawkin's life may  well have met some of the black American G.I.'s who fought and died in Sicily  and Southern Italy trying to rid that ancient land of its home-grown fascist  regime and their Nazi allies during World War II.  </P> <P> I'm not certain what those valiant soldiers thought of the locals as they  slogged their way up the Italian boot, dotting the countryside with the fresh  graves of their dead.  </P> <P> My late uncle, Dr. Arvin DeBerry, was a Howard University-trained dentist in an  all-black Army division that landed in Sicily. He and his fellow dentists, not  much older than Mr. Hawkins, set up chairs in cow pastures to provide the local  peasantry -- no doubt some of the relatives of the good people of Bensonhurst  -- with the first professional dental care many had ever received. The  outpouring of gratitude was overwhelming. The young black dentists were  showered with food, wine, invited in for family meals and, yes, several did  return home with Italian war brides.  </P> <P> Funny how one generation's savior is another's "animal, crackhead, n-----" to  name a few of the epithets hurled at peaceful members of the black community  who mourned the loss of their young son. It is all such a pity.  </P> <P> LEROY WOODSON JR.  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

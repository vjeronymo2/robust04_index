			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BACKSTAGE: 'CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD';  </P> <P> SPECIAL INSIGHT;  </P> <P> THE USE OF HEARING-IMPAIRED ACTORS PROVIDES LESSONS FOR ACTING NEWCOMERS AND  THE DIRECTOR.  </P> <P> Casting the Conejo Players' production of "Children of a Lesser God," director  John Hulette wasn't necessarily looking for actors with a hearing disability,  even though the Tony award-winning Mark Medoff play takes place in and around a  school for the deaf.  </P> <P> The rule is, he explained recently, that "professional productions are required  to use hearing-disabled people to play the three roles of deaf students.  Community theater groups, like the Conejo Players, are given more latitude."  </P> <P> Which may explain why, of the more than 100 inquiries he received from across  the country -- from as far away as New York -- the majority were from hearing  actors and actresses, ". . . what we affectionately refer to as "wannabe deaf  girls."  </P> <P> "But," he continued, "I have had no real experience with the hearing-impaired,  and I felt that if I didn't have the experience, the actors certainly should."  </P> <P> The leading role went to Kristine Finnestrom, an alumnus of the National  Theatre of the Deaf Summer Program and secretary of the organization Hearing  Impaired Performers. The smaller, though important roles, went to two  hearing-impaired students from Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley,  Teliaferro (Terry) Miller and Laura Jean Barton. Both are making their  theatrical debuts in the production.  </P> <P> "Once in a while," Hulette said as the play entered its final week, "you hook  yourself into a natural, one who will be perfect with what they bring to it.  And Laura and Terry were. One of the ways I know I made the right decision, in  addition to my own pleasure with their performance, was that all of the reviews  emphasized them strongly."  </P> <P> "I went with Terry to the audition," 22-year-old Barton recalled, "changed my  mind and went home -- I'd never done that sort of thing, and didn't think that  I could compete with experienced, hearing actors.  </P> <P> "The next day, Sherril Alstadt, one of the show's sign-language instructors,  called and told me to go out for it, that I was perfect."  </P> <P> Barton plays Lydia, a flirtatious student who competes with Finnestrom's  somewhat more mature character for the attentions of instructor James Leeds,  played by Michael Tachco.  </P> <P> "The character really matched me," Barton said with a smile. "I used to flirt,  and I look young -- Lydia's supposed to be in her late teens.  </P> <P> Unlike Finnestrom, both Barton and Miller are able to hear sounds and  comprehend speech, though with a far less than normal ability.  </P> <P> Barton grew up in Van Nuys in a hearing environment and went to public schools  -- Cal Poly in Pomona, where she studied ornamental horticulture, and now  Pierce College.  </P> <P> In high school, she joined the student agricultural organization 4-H and was  encouraged by her parents and teachers to participate in community work and  public speaking. "But after high school," she admits, "I fell apart, because I  was alone. I let my disability get in my way, and I shouldn't have."  </P> <P> Miller, 23, is from Gainesville, Fla. After losing much of his hearing in a  childhood bout of German measles, he went to a special school, wore a hearing  aid and took speech therapy. He's an award-winning runner and has a dance  group, Get 'n' Bizee.  </P> <P> In "Children," he plays Orin Dennis, a self-absorbed and contentious young man  whose resentment of the treatment received by hearing-impaired people parallels  the feelings of many persecuted minorities. As far as Miller has been able to  determine, he is the first black actor to play the role, though the parallel is  a right and insightful one.  </P> <P> "I've always had the goal of being an actor," he says. "I also wanted to be a  singer, but knew that couldn't happen."  </P> <P> In a dance contest, Miller met William Byrd, an actor who had appeared in the  film version of "Children of a Lesser God."  </P> <P> "He advised me about acting. Last year, I auditioned for three commercials:  Swatch, milk and Jack in the Box. I lost confidence in myself when I didn't get  any of the parts.  </P> <P> "I froze onstage during the auditions for this show. It was my worst nightmare,  coming true. I was called back to read with another actor and froze again. But  I wound up getting the part."  </P> <P> Hulette says: "One of the things that make Laura and Terry perfect is that they  are those people. You ask Terry the right questions, Orin's answers come right  out of him. When he understood that it would be OK to react to a situation as  Terry would do, that's when he got the character."  </P> <P> Miller admits to considerable anger.  </P> <P> "The sign language I learned in Gainesville is quite different from what's done  here -- I had learned to sign English, with each letter spelled out."  </P> <P> He said ASL, or American Sign Language, which is used in the play and in Pierce  College's program for the hearing-impaired, is shorter and more symbolic.  </P> <P> "The first time a guy signed to me in it, I thought he was stupid," he said. "I  got the hang of it, but I hated it. . . . I still hate it."  </P> <P> One of the play's basic conflicts -- whether the school should be staffed  solely by hearing-impaired teachers and administrators -- was eerily echoed  recently by students of the Washington, D.C., college for the hearing-impaired,  Gallaudet University.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize at first why all the deaf students were rioting," says  Miller.  </P> <P> "When I found out, I felt that the situation wasn't fair," he said, saying the  school is 100 years old, and the teacher who was passed over for the presidency  had been working there for 23 years. "The woman they hired was an outsider, who  didn't even know how to sign -- it made me angry," Miller said.  </P> <P> "It made me awake," adds Barton, who, after a lifetime of lip-reading, has just  learned American Sign Language and now divides her time between the deaf and  hearing communities.  </P> <P> "There are deaf and hearing-impaired people all over the United States, and we  should speak up for our rights. They might not have a voice, but they should  have a voice."  </P></p>

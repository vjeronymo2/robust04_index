			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: GM halts search for locomotive partner GENERAL Motors yesterday called off its two-year search for a strategic partner for its locomotive group, which it said would remain one of the company's main businesses. GM announced in June 1991 that it was looking for a partner for the business, as part of its plan to concentrate on its core automotive operations, which are losing money in North America. The locomotive business makes freight and passenger locomotives and armoured defence vehicles. Mr William Hoglund, a GM executive vice-president, said that the company had been considering stopping its search for a partner for some time. Since the search began, the group's electro-motive division and its partner, Siemens of Germany, had had a 'very substantial impact' in the market with new AC traction technology, leading to the largest locomotive contract in railway history. GM, Mr Hoglund added, had high expectations for the business, but this needed to focus on its objectives without the uncertainties of a search for a partner. In a separate development, GM yesterday gave a three-year reprieve to a Kalamazoo, Michigan, metal-stamping plant earmarked for closure and 10 months of extra life to a New York plant making mini-vans. The Kalamazoo plant was due to close in 1995 and the New York site the following year as part of the company's efforts to reduce sharply the size of its North American operations. GM said that keeping the Kalamazoo plant open, with about half its current 1,900 workers, would let the company avoid paying workers up to full wages for being laid off. A new labour agreement, reached by GM and the United Auto Workers' union earlier this week, maintains a system whereby GM continues to pay workers whom it lays off - even though the company is suffering from severe overcapacity in the US market and losing money. The New York plant will continue producing mini-vans until a factory in Georgia begins the manufacture of a new generation of vans. Lawyers for GM and for owners of 6m pick-up trucks yesterday asked a federal judge to approve settlement of 36 class action suits brought against the company over the trucks' controversial side-mounted petrol tanks, which critics allege are a fire hazard. Under the proposed settlement, GM would give owners coupons worth Dollars 1,000 towards the purchase of a new truck.</p>

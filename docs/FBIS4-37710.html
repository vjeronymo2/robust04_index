			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 22 June, KUNA -- At noon today, southern  antiaircraft defenses shot down a northern warplane that was  raiding Aden. A southern military source has said that the  aircraft was trying to raid the television station, which is  situated in the mountainous al-Tawahi region.    He added that the northern warplanes conducted more raids on  Aden a few hours after the airport was the target of a Katyusha  barrage from a northern military launcher. He pointed out that  the shells did not hit the airport, but a number of ordinary  houses were damaged instead. The source did not give any  details on the damage of the missile barrage.    KUNA's correspondent, however, saw a number of fire engines  heading to the areas close to the airport, which is situated in  the Khur Maksar district in the heart of the city of Aden.</p>

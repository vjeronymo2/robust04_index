			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Seasonal sweatshop greetings - Letter from China / From Shanghai to Shenzen, lowly-paid workers are producing decorations for the west Is nothing sacred? Chinese entrepreneurs have gone into business producing Father Christmasses with both Oriental and Caucasian features for the local and international markets. According to Xia Jinglan, the sales agent in Beijing for Xianfeng, one of the manufacturers based in China's southern Fujian province, 'western' Father Christmasses have bigger noses, deeper eye sockets and a sterner visage, while their Chinese counterparts appear more benevolent with rounder, happier, less threatening oriental features. 'When we think of an occasion like Christmas,' she says, 'we imagine our own symbols of happiness like a plump, smiling baby carrying a big fish at Spring Festival.' Generations of children in the west might not agree with the Chinese perception of a sterner, gruffer Santa Claus, but increasingly they are being exposed to Christmas ornaments and decorations, including the ubiquitous Saint Nicholas (or is it Nicolas) himself, carrying the 'Made in China' label. At hundreds, if not thousands, of sweatshops in China's southern regions from Shanghai to Shenzen, the economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong, lowly-paid workers, most of whom know nothing of the Christmas story, are producing what are called 'seasonal' items for a huge western market. In the Baoan district near the Hong Kong boundary, which has emerged as the headquarters in China of the Christmas-decoration trade, there are more than 200 factories making gifts mainly for North American consumers. No reliable statistics are available as to the sheer volume of Chinese output of so-called 'seasonal' products, but according to Tony Cheng, the Taiwanese owner of Delta Smooth Ltd, which manufactures poly-resin items, China supplies 'at least' 50 per cent of the Dollars 2bn US market for such festivals as Christmas, Hallowe'en, and Thanksgiving. Much of that production comes from a tangle of anonymous grey structures in the muddy streets and alleys of Baoan which has proved a magnet for hundreds of thousands of workers from China's impoverished hinterland, including particularly the provinces of Hunan and Sichuan. It requires a considerable leap of imagination to make the connection between these dank and depressing surroundings and the perfumed counters of top department stores where some of these escapist products are destined for the pleasure of middle America. Gaily-painted glass-domed musical boxes with nativity scenes and fake swirling snow could hardly contrast more sharply with the 19th century 'workhouse' surroundings in which they are produced. The Yuletide spirit evoked by tinny-sounding tunes such as 'We wish You a Merry Christmas' could not be further removed from the experience of the country waifs who work 10-hour shifts moulding and painting these items. But to local officials, such as the deputy party boss of Songgan township in Baoan country, there is no 'contradiction' involved in the world's largest atheistic state producing items for religious festivals: after all, 'business is business'. 'We don't care about this religion or that religion. We only care about production,' says Yang Bateng. 'We don't produce these souvenirs for Christianity, we make them for business sake.' So the manufacture of souvenirs continues around the clock in Baoan, a huge outpouring that is flooding western consumer markets in a rising tide of seasonal kitsch, mass-produced at an unbelievably low cost. Cheng's business is a perfect example of the explosive growth in Chinese souvenir trade. He established his factory in 1989 with a staff of about 200. Five years later, he is employing 1,100 and is about to open a third enterprise - in Shanghai  -to produce 'high tech' items. He has invested Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in his business and is planning a further Dollars 1m investment. In his first year of operation he shipped Dollars 1.5m worth of goods, mostly to the American market, and this year expects exports to reach Dollars 12m. Production in 1994 includes 1m Santa Clauses based on more than 50 different designs, including an improbable Santa armed not with a stave, but with a baseball bat. 'Every day, almost, we have a new item. That's how we survive here. Otherwise we would have to compete on price, and that's very difficult,' he says, in a reception area dominated by an incense-burning Buddhist shrine and a wall-slogan that reads: 'To attract fortune and expel ghosts.' Cheng's experience is, in a way, revealing of the difficulties of doing business in China . . . and also the rewards. In the past year dozens of local Chinese enterprises have begun producing seasonal decorations, including counterfeit copies of Delta Smooth's own designs: such is the cut-throat nature of business in China these days. But Cheng is not complaining. With labour costs in Baoan a fraction of those in Taiwan, labour-intensive activities are proving a winner for early entrants to the field, although costs are rising. Wages have shot up by 35 to 40 per cent in the past year, but still remain about one-tenth of those paid in Taiwan. Incredibly, low labour costs also proved enticing for the Tung Tat Electrical Co of Hong Kong which, in 1988, established a factory producing Christmas lights for the international market with an initial workforce of 70, now grown to 700. Again no reliable statistics are available, but China's production of 'fairy lights' accounts for at least 50 per cent of the world market, and Tung Tat is merely one of dozens of such factories churning out lights of various shapes and sizes to satisfy the fantasies of western consumers. Luk Yeuk Chun, one of those producing decorations in Songgan, says: 'There's money in Buddhism, too. Any religious belief can generate good business.' On the Tung Tat production lines, where young men and women, many still in their teens, fashion strings of lights from bits of wire and glass, questions about Christmas drew blank looks. Miss Song, a 19-year-old from Guangdong province, who has been working in the factory for more than a year, said simply: 'I heard it was somebody's birthday.' But ignorance at the shop-floor level of Christmas is not preventing more affluent Chinese consumers in the larger cities and towns from beginning to 'celebrate' the Christian festival in increasing numbers. Many shops throughout China now adorn their windows with Christmas decorations and the sound of Christmas carols wafts through the interiors of some of the smarter emporiums to encourage a buying mood, as in the west. At the Yaohan department store, on Beijing's main boulevard, business around the Christmas decoration counter is brisk with smartly-dressed young Chinese buying baubles, tinsel and Santa Clauses of various sizes and shapes to decorate Christmas trees at home. One door-knob decoration improbably invited purchasers to buy it so they could offer their friends a 'jingly, Kris-Kringly welcome'. Liu Fang, an employee of a joint venture company, is typical of a growing number of Chinese consumers who seem prepared these days to embrace almost any new fad, or fashion, especially if it has a western flavour. 'More and more of us are celebrating western festivals,' she said, 'like Christmas, Valentine's Day and Thanksgiving. This is partly because many of our friends have spent time in foreign countries and we are associating more with foreigners.' Christmas western-style is also infecting the very young. Among children clustering around the Christmas decoration counter at the Yaohan store was a young man who said that his parents had for the past several years put presents in a stocking at the end of his bed. He also revealed that 'when I was very little I saw Father Christmas once . . . and he was a foreigner'.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): Getting rich, cautiously / Finance INVESTMENT ILLUSIONS By Martin S Fridson Wiley, Pounds 12.99, 230 pages. THE SUB-TITLE - 'A Savvy Wall Street Pro Explodes Popular Misconceptions About the Markets' - makes one want to ask why, if this pro is so savvy, he still writes books when he should have retired with millions long ago. But Marty Fridson, a managing director of Merrill Lynch and editor of 'The Journal of High Yield Bond Research', is a Wall Street pro in the sober rather than the speculative sense. His aim in Investment Illusions is to debunk several of the popular fallacies underlying the get-rich-quick attitude to investing. To appreciate Fridson's dose of common sense, you must either have doubts about the intelligence of the US private investor, or believe that the nation's investment diet consists of a stream of one-stop mail shops promising enrichment. If either is the case, then Fridson's investment homilies are long overdue. He advises investors to read annual reports for themselves and not to take company accounts or management statements at face value. They should distrust chartists, understand how mutual funds performance statistics can distort the facts; and they should not pride themselves on being contrarian when the majority may be right. Sometimes, Fridson's exploded misconceptions go off with a bit of a whimper. No, he says, the stock market is not always right to assume that a share price will rise when the company's eminent chief executive retires or dies. And no, not every potential winner benefits from a natural disaster (in other words, don't buy every housebuilder in the wake of a hurricane - the US bias shows throughout). In the UK we seem to have fewer of the over-the-top investment gurus that Fridson sends up. Such a one is Joe Granville, who besides appearing to get most things wrong, dressed as a chicken and liked to drop his trousers to allow his audience to read stock recommendations printed on his boxer shorts. Fridson's message is that there is no quick-fix to investment success. If a stock looks cheap, Fridson would say that it probably deserves to stay cheap because of the risks involved. For a private investor, 'the positive pay back of patient, conservative investing is one of the few things you can count on in the securities markets.' More advice of the 'how to' rather than the 'how not to' variety would have gone a long way to smoothing the platitudinous edge off many of Fridson's investment maxims - even if this were as uncomplicated as Warren Buffet's four characteristics of a sound investment: a growth market, a secure franchise, positive cash flow, and tested management. Fridson's book will not help you make much money, but it should at least stop you losing any. Not every stockbroker manages that.</p>

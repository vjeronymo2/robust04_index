			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** VAN MORRISON "ENLIGHTENMENT" MERCURY  </P> <P> It takes Morrison's most intense singing in years, and a return to his bedrock  of vintage soul and R&amp;B, to rescue many of the songs here. The record is  full of spontaneous interjections and exhortations, and the long fade-outs have  an immediacy and life that's rare on mainstream records these days.  </P> <P> "Enlightenment's" intriguing subtext is its focus on roots. The lyrics are  often couched as reminiscences, the R&amp;B sound recalls Morrison's formative  days, and he even quotes some of his own early lyrics: "Baby please don't go"  (from his days with the group Them), and "down by the viaducts of my dream"  from his classic solo debut, "Astral Weeks."  </P> <P> But the main text comes up short. The spiritual soulster's reverie on a serene  paradise, his latest visit to Celtic heaven, his surrender to a higher force,  his love songs . . . all are over-familiar or underdeveloped.  </P> <P> The great exception is "In the Days Before Rock 'n' Roll," a prime piece of  Morrison bravado and eccentricity. Irish poet Paul Durcan barks an unschooled,  strangely cadenced narration (at one point he even come in a bar early, in the  spirit of the Kingsmen's famous muff in "Louie Louie"), and Morrison captures a  fullness of emotion in his detailed remembrance of his youth.  </P> <P> If you turn the volume way up after it ends, you can hear Durcan say, "You  certainly got a lot of beautiful things in there, Van." He got that right.  RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antoni Z. Kaminski and Lech Kosciuk: "The </F> Polish Wedge; If Policies Vis-a-Vis the West Eliminate Chances  in the East, That Means They Are Bad"]    [Text] Lech Kosciuk is chief expert at the Defense  Ministry's Department of Strategic Studies, while Antoni Z.  Kaminski, a professor at Warsaw University, used to be a  director at the same department. While writing about Poland's  security, they are making unpopular arguments, the most  important of which is the following: A position based on making  claims is the worst way of conducting foreign policy. We do not  share the authors' suppositions that Poland's joining NATO would  be disadvantageous to the West.    While making efforts to join NATO, one should remember that  Poland is just an element of the European security arrangement.  Such a perception of Poland was the foundation for the recent  decisions made in Brussels. The collapse of the bipolar system  has not resulted in an elimination of dangers. The scale and  nature of the dangers have changed, and they have become less  clear, but, nevertheless, they continue to exist and to be a  challenge for individual countries of the continent, as well as  for international institutions. These circumstances make it  imperative to maintain a global perspective while thinking about  the foundations of European security.    The world order, including the European order, is based on  the strength and efficiency of institutions that constitute its  foundation, regardless of the fact that those institutions were  established in the period of the Cold War. Careless  manipulation with institutional structures creates the danger of  destabilizing the international order, and, consequently, of  destabilizing also the global arrangement of forces. In other  words, the disappearance of the bipolar world did not eliminate  the need for thinking along the lines of a global arrangement of  forces, and also along the lines of a feeling of responsibility  for the fate of the world. This has important implications for  both our membership in NATO and Russia's place in the European  security arrangement.    In the eyes of the West, the problem of Russia is linked to  the dangers that are a consequence of that country's huge  nuclear potential and numerous nuclear power stations, whose  disastrous condition may lead to results that could be similar  to those after nuclear weapons are used. It is unacceptable for  Russia to give up its cooperation with the West by taking a  hostile position and by becoming, for instance, an ally to  countries ruled by irresponsible leaders (Iraq, Libya, North  Korea) or by involving itself openly on the Serbian side of the  Yugoslav conflict. This becomes a global strategic imperative.  A development of uncontrolled processes inside Russia may bring  about different, although equally disastrous for the world,  effects--for instance, as a result of extremist elements seizing  control of nuclear weapons. It may also bring about the danger  of an uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear technologies and of  nuclear weapons themselves. Polish people must be aware of all  these problems while developing their relationship with the West.    From the standpoint of the degree of advancement of  transformations of the political and economic system, and also  from the standpoint of the degree of coming close to the Western  world, postcommunist Europe may be divided into four groups: 1)  The Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, and Hungary; 2) The  Baltic states, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Slovak Republic; 3)  Russia; 4) Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova.    The first four countries listed are the most advanced in the  process of building democratic structures and market economies.  With regard to those countries, one can assume that the  processes are irreversible and that the countries' institutional  integration with the West will be accomplished relatively soon,  through which the area of stability on the European Continent  will be widened.    The second group of countries listed will also most probably  go down the same road, even though the countries' starting point  is less advantageous than in the case of the first group. In  particular, the countries face a much bigger danger of involving  themselves both in domestic and external conflicts. The  remaining two groups constitute special cases.   <H5>    Russia at a Crossroads </H5>   Russia continues to be facing the choice of its way of  development. In comparison with Ukraine and Belarus, Russia is  still more advanced in the process of market transformations.  It also has reached a certain level of stabilization and of  strengthening its state structures, which cannot be said of the  other two countries. It is worth stressing that, with its  experienced diplomats, clerical personnel, and various experts  in the field of international relations and strategic issues,  and also having been a member of the world configuration of  forces for hundreds of years now, Russia, the widely accepted  successor to the USSR, has been handling its sovereignty much  better than the other post-Soviet republics.    Unless Russia falls apart, it will definitely retain the  status of a world superpower. The question arises: What will  its nature be? Will it be a civilized power, characterized by  restraint, or will it be an Eastern despotic country? So far,  it can be seen that Russia strives at incorporating the big  Slavic republics and also at making the Baltic states dependent  on Finland, to say the least.    Russia's protest against Lithuania's joining "Partnership  for  Peace" is a clear sign of the above. Political destabilization  in Ukraine, caused by the state's weakness, economic collapse,  or by both factors at the same time, may lead to the Yugoslav  scenario repeating itself on a much bigger scale and in a much  more strategic part of Europe, not to mention the fact that  nuclear states will be involved in these events. So we are  witnessing strife that may lead to a serious change in the  arrangement of forces in this part of Europe, and that may also  result in major political destabilization and a consequent  threat to security.    Russia's turn in the imperial direction being described here  is not irreversible. There is an awareness visible in Russian  political circles that a reconstruction of the empire and market  transformations are two separate and contradictory options.  Symptoms of that are visible in responses to the Belarusian  affair [not further specified]. It is not the case that the  West errs in principle by thinking that it has the power to  influence events inside Russia. The influence is not of course  determinant, but, in a situation where Russian reformers remain  a significant political force, the factor should not be ignored.  One can agree with the view that the reformers also want  Russia's position as a superpower to be rebuilt, but there is no  doubt that they want to achieve this through different means.  Leading Russian reformers are aware of a dilemma that exists  between implementing imperial goals through political and  military means on the one hand, and a continuation of the  process of rebuilding the Russian economy, using the free market  as foundation, on the other. A strong response by the West,  primarily by the United States, may perform a sobering function.  <H5>  Intentions and Costs </H5>   Postcommunist countries undergoing reforms began, naturally,  to look for ways of linking themselves to Western political,  economic, and defense structures. The countries wanted to gain,  first of all, support for the reform process, as well as a  minimum degree of protection. So they addressed the  EC--currently the European Union [EU]--and also NATO. Those  efforts caused a number of serious dilemmas for both of these  structures. One of the more popularly debated dilemmas was the  issue of a possible widening of the Community, which dominated  its meetings in 1991 and 1992.    As a defense structure established in the Cold War period,  NATO was suddenly faced with extremely complicated problems of  adaptation. The decrease in international tensions led to a  reduction--an excessive one, according to some--in defense  expenditures. Political pressure is increasing in the United  States, aimed at reducing the U.S. military presence in Europe.  True enough, NATO did introduce a number of major changes in its  functioning: A "New Strategic Concept" was elaborated, the  defense system has been reorganized, and, most importantly, an  effort was made to open up the alliance to its former enemies.  But the issue of accepting new members into NATO is a  qualitatively completely different kind of decision. Technical  obstacles, which are being considered by NATO member states and  which are impediments to widening the organization, require a  serious approach.    Trevor Taylor, a British security expert, can see the  following obstacles:    --First, a negative impact of the decision to widen NATO on  the political situation in Russia.    --Second, a disorganization in the area of NATO's doctrine,  structure, and development of forces.    --Third, under conditions of economic recession, tensions  would increase in the area of assets that have been excessively  reduced to begin with.    --Fourth, even debates on the granting of observer status in  NATO to countries of East and Central Europe caused sharp  differences of opinion among the alliance's members. If the  issue of membership were to be debated, these discrepancies  would definitely increase even more. As a result, a weakening  of NATO's coherency would follow.    --Fifth, given that countries with unstabilized political  and  economic structures would become NATO members, one could fear  that the alliance would not be able to effectively influence the  countries' behavior. Another problem along the lines of the  Greek-Turkish one would weaken NATO significantly.    --Sixth, other postcommunist countries with even more  troublesome legacies would line up to become NATO members, and  that would put in question the credibility of NATO's security  guarantees. Finally, along with the withdrawal of Russian  troops from East and Central Europe, the military threat was  radically reduced, which means that these countries do not need  to be NATO members to increase their security level.    Some of the above arguments, especially the first and the  last, could be subjected to well-justified criticism. But on  one fundamental issue, the arguments remain valid: One cannot  weaken the institutional structures on which West Europe's  stability is based. Maintenance of the structures' strength and  coherency is also in Poland's interest. That is because it is  beyond any doubt that acquiring membership in an alliance that  has lost its identity and credibility will fail to increase our  security to any significant extent.    It was only in January that Poland, which has fought for  NATO  membership in the most vigorous manner, has attempted to  evaluate the costs of its participation in Partnership. It was  soon discovered that the necessary funds are lacking, and a  conclusion was drawn from that: The West should bear at least  part of the expense of our participation. It also turned out  that we cannot afford to have more than one company participate  in joint maneuvers. That is not serious, given statements by  some politicians that Poland's participation in NATO would  greatly strengthen its defense capabilities.    So NATO was faced with a fundamental question--how to  respond  to this situation in a way that could contribute to an increase  of European peace and security, while satisfying the needs of  the new democracies, while not losing its positive elements at  the same time. The maneuvering room is delineated by the  following fundamental conditions: involving postcommunist  countries in political and military cooperation and providing  the European Continent with a minimum degree of security;  stabilizing and making permanent political and economic  transformations in the area, which make East and Central Europe  occupy a special position; preventing of the establishment of  new divisions in Europe and not allowing for an uncontrolled  collapse of the Russian state. "Partnership for Peace" is  exactly NATO's response to these challenges.    Partnership does not result in security guarantees that are  provided for by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty (allies'  obligation to mutual armed assistance in cases of aggression  from the outside), but what it does do is create an opportunity  for partners to conduct consultations with NATO members, as  provided for by Article 4 of the treaty. The partnership  formula does not formally discriminate against any European  country, but it provides for a de facto diversification,  depending on the extent of real involvement of the partner  countries in cooperation with NATO, and also depending on the  capability of meeting expectations associated with that  cooperation. In other words, the Partnership formula creates an  opportunity to create a material and functional association of  ties that would closely link those countries that have the will  and the capabilities to meet NATO's expectations. According to  some representatives of the U.S. Administration, the decision on  achieving NATO member status will be of a purely formal nature  once a certain stage of cooperation has been reached.  <H5>  Partnership Is Not Bad </H5>   Russia adopted an ambiguous position on the initiative (in  the end, it decided to join the Partnership on 21 April). On  the one hand, there were numerous statements by Russian  politicians concerning the country's will to participate in the  Partnership, and even concerning a possible joining of NATO in  the future, provided it undergoes deep transformations. But, on  the other hand, Russia took a negative stand concerning a  widening of NATO to include countries of East and Central  Europe, and even concerning participation of the republics of  the former USSR in the Partnership. At the same time, Russia is  making efforts for a widening of military cooperation among the  member states of CIS, and to have them join the Collective  Defense Treaty signed in Tashkent in May 1992. This means the  creation of a new political and military arrangement on the  territory of the former USSR, which has far-reaching  consequences for European security. The possibility cannot be  ruled out that, by playing this double-standard game vis-a-vis  the West, the Russian leadership is hoping for a chance to  recreate the division of Europe on currently the most  advantageous terms, from the standpoint of Russia's imperial  interests. But, even given this scenario of events, the  Partnership concept is not bad because it enables the West to  flexibly adapt itself to the circumstances, while not blocking  any options, including those expected by the countries of East  and Central Europe.    Even in the case of the Partnership, the maneuvering room  for  Russia, which uses military instruments of foreign policies, is  limited. This has put Russia in a dilemma: to join the  Partnership or not?    From Poland's perspective, participation in the Partnership  will not be an easy task, taking into account both the financial  standpoint and institutional adaptations. A paradox became  visible here. As John Roper, a famous expert on international  security, has noted, an increase in a country's feeling of  security should lead to a decrease in the country's defense  expenditures. But, in the case of postcommunist countries  making their cooperation with NATO closer, an increase in the  feeling of security must be accompanied by costly adaptation  measures. It is an unavoidable price for joining West European  security structures. Plus, one has to be honest: The rate of  our preparations for making cooperation with NATO closer is not  at akk impressive.    In the context of the issue of cooperation with NATO, we  must, in Polish policies, draw a few fundamental conclusions. So  let us stress the fact that seems to be ignored by a majority of  participants of debates on the Polish Republic's security  policies: Poland is a country of key importance for Europe's  future shape and for the future balance of power on the  continent. So its geographical location is Poland's asset--that  is, if the development of events in Europe facilitates creation  of a common political and economic order. It is not the case  that we have no impact on these events, but, if the situation  develops unfavorably from our standpoint, we will be the first  to suffer as a result of a possible European conflict.    Mutual coordination of measures undertaken in the East and  the West is a test for the quality of Polish policies in the  area of international security. If political activity vis-a-vis  the West reduces our chances of implementing our interests in  the East, that means that either the strategic concept is  mistaken or it simply does not exist. One has a feeling that  this is exactly what we are dealing with right now. It can be  seen particularly saliently in our relations with Ukraine.  Poland, because of its geographic location, must conduct an  active policy in all directions.    Establishment of European security on a continentwide basis  is in our strategic interest. This implies a need to widen the  area of stability and cooperation as far to the East as  possible. The "Partnership for Peace" proposal creates  precisely such an opportunity. Moreover, in case events in the  East take a turn that would be disadvantageous to us, the  Partnership creates a chance for gaining the necessary  protection against possible dangers.  <H5>  We for Ourselves </H5>   While striving to be integrated with the West, we must show  our understanding for the complexity of the circumstances  surrounding policies of the countries that make up the West, and  also of some international coordinating mechanisms. The West  will only be able to meet our expectations if it manages to  maintain its coherency and identity. This applies to both the  EU and NATO. So Polish people must have a lot of understanding  when it comes to resistance from the Western countries on the  issue of a too rapid granting of member status to new  democracies, and they must overcome the resistance in a skillful  and very thought-through manner. It is a fact that the West's  position often has particular interests of individual countries  hidden behind it, but the West's position also includes some  arguments of a general nature that would be hard to dispute. So  a strong and integrated West is in our interest, but also a West  that would be flexible and open enough to widen the system of  its institutions to cover countries that, while striving at  making use of the opportunities that participation in these  institutions creates, are ready to observe the required rules  and to take upon themselves responsibility for the continent's  fate.    The scale of the transformations going on in Europe is  comparable to those that took place after World Wars I and II.  The fact that we are creating this order without having waged a  war, in the strictest sense, before that creation is a  distinguishing trait of the current situation. Careless  political measures can make such a war likely. The  establishment of the new order in Europe is taking place under  conditions of a high degree of uncertainty that, among other  things, is a consequence of a diversification or unclear  definition of interests and of perception of problems by the  participating parties, as well as of a high risk factor for  global and European security.    So, before we ask "What should the West do for us?," let us  ask "What can we do for ourselves?" and also "What could we do  or propose to our neighbors and to Europe?" In the long run, a  position based on making claims, especially in the area of  security, is the least efficient method of conducting foreign  policy.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The French Connection): Bon Appetit You enter the little auberge and the waiter hands you the menu. Your mind goes blank. Just what is potage Longchamp? What is lingue? What is loubine? You have forgotten - or you never knew - so one of those interminable franglais conversations takes place as you extract the meaning from a recalcitrant waiter. There is another way. Take Tessa Youell and George Kimball's pocket guide to French Food and Wine (Pounds 5.95, Carbery, 240 pages). It is not a new publication but it has been reprinted and is worth mentioning again for those who want to remove the frustrations of understanding often complex menus.</p>

This amendment is prompted by an investigation to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controllability of Model 747 series airplanes following an in-flight thrust reverser  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deployment, which has revealed that, in the event of thrust reverser deployment during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-speed climb or during cruise, these airplanes could experience control problems. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure the integrity of the fail safe features of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the thrust reverser system by preventing possible failure modes in the thrust reverser  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control system that can result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective August 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

That action proposed to require various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction of any discrepancy found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> One commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members, requests that the proposed repetitive inspections and tests be withdrawn since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those actions will be added to the revised Maintenance Planning Document. The ATA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledges that the proposed repetitive actions may not be incorporated uniformly into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every operator's maintenance program unless an AD is issued. Therefore, the ATA asks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that another provision be added to the proposal as follows: Within 3 months after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of the AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a functional test of the thrust reverser control and indication system at an initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15-month interval. Inspections for damage to the bullnose seal would be conducted at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial 1,500 flight hour interval. The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have acceptably revised the maintenance program. Operators complying with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 91.417 or 121.380 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.417 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (PMI) for operators electing this alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA believes that its suggestion should be adopted because the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive actions will likely continue for as long as Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated. The ATA acknowledges that, while numerous AD's that require repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections continue for the life of the aircraft, it has either been shown that a satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminating action has not been developed or that service experience has shown that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of the inspections cannot be administered safely through an operator's maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The ATA states that its proposal is intended to minimize the impact of the AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process on an operator's maintenance program and cites other AD's that contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions similar to its proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes the ATA's concerns regarding the requirement for repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and tests of the thrust reverser control and indication systems. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA finds that this requirement is necessary in order to provide an adequate level of safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by addressing the specified unsafe condition. Further, the FAA determined the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive intervals based on the service history of similar components and on an analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the system design to predict the reliability of the system during the service life of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft. Lengthening these intervals would only be appropriate when a sufficient sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of systems is allowed to operate through an entire system overhaul cycle; adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made prior to that time may not account for the effects of age and wear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA finds that addressing inspections and tests of the thrust reverser control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and indication systems in a document that is not FAA-approved, such as a Maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Planning Document, will not ensure an acceptable level of safety with regard to the thrust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reverser system. The ATA's suggested provision for accomplishment of the inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and tests would permit each operator to determine whether and how often these actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be conducted. In light of the severity of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has determined that allowing this degree of operator discretion is not appropriate at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to ensure that operators accomplish the repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions in a common manner and at common intervals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time for the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication systems be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended from 6 to 12 months. This commenter offers no justification for the request. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second commenter indicates a false impression that a 12-month compliance time was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for these inspections and functional tests, and requests that the compliance time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be expressed in terms of maintenance checks (specifically, ``C'' checks) or 15 months to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coincide with regularly scheduled maintenance. (The FAA notes that no 12-month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance time is specified for any requirement contained in the proposal.) Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter requests that the compliance times be specified in terms of maintenance check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals (``A'' checks, ``C'' checks, etc.). The commenter provides no justification for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

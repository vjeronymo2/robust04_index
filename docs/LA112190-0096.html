			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> SHELL: NOTHING TAINTED ABOUT VICTORY  </P> <P> Coach Art Shell said Monday's victory wasn't tainted because Miami was playing  without receivers Mark Clayton, Freddie Banks and fullback Tony Paige.  </P> <P> "We didn't make excuses when we lost people," Shell said.  </P> <P> "I don't feel sorry for them."  </P> <P> Shell couldn't have been happier with his team's numbers against Miami: The  Raiders rushed for a season-high 177 yards and yielded a season-low 14 yards  rushing on defense. The Raider pass rush sacked Dan Marino twice and kept  consistent pressure on him, but the Raider offensive line did not allow a sack  of quarterback Jay Schroeder.  </P> <P> "The whole thing was impressive," Shell said. "The whole team came out and  played, not just the defense."  </P> <P> Shell on the possibility of signing defensive end Dexter Manley: "To be  truthful, we haven't discussed Manley." . . . Bo Jackson reported a sore neck  Tuesday and fullback Napoleon McCallum cracked a bone in his wrist on a  kickoff. CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

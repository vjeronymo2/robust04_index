			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RELIGION;  </P> <P> ACLU, TAMMY BAKKER TEAM UP  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union is joining forces with Tammy Faye Bakker in  efforts to overturn a zoning ban against church services in a warehouse area.  </P> <P> Warren Keiner, the ACLU's Central Florida chairman, said there is no compelling  reason to prohibit religious services in an industrial area, where peace and  quiet are not as important as they would be in a residential area.  </P> <P> Bakker and her husband, Jim, set up their New Covenant Ministries in Orlando  last year, before he began serving a 45-year federal prison term in connection  with fund-raising activities in their former PTL television ministry.  </P> <P> It has been housed in a shopping mall, a hotel, a piano shop and lately in an  industrial park.  </P> <P> After one Sunday service, Orange County zoning officials said that while she  could operate a broadcasting studio, no church services would be permitted.  </P></p>

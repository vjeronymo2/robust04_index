			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Arts: Oberto - Opera In many performances John Tomlinson gives the impression of a larger-than-life character in search of a role that is big enough for him. With the title role of Verdi's Oberto he has undeniably found one of the right size, but that has not stopped him being doubly ambitious and taking on not one role, but two. Last Thursday Tomlinson also made his debut as an opera producer. When Opera North decided to put on a production of Verdi's first opera, it originally turned to Ian Judge, but he started to get cold feet and withdrew. Tim Albery was approached and thought better of the opera, but decided against it. Enter Tomlinson, laying aside his Wagnerian spear and seizing instead a sword with which to champion this early Verdi rarity. His production is sketched with bold outlines, but not much in between - a bit like the opera, really. He has set it in the Italy of the 1920s, the ominous menace of dictatorship already casting a premature shadow. The chosen period may make the story even less credible than before, but it is a gift for the ladies of the chorus, who glitter in the party scenes as flappers with beads, plumed headdresses and long cigarette-holders  - the full works. As a whole, the show looks good, thanks to Russell Craig's effective designs, but in early Verdi neither that, nor clever production ideas, will ever make the evening. Oberto depends on singers who can fire the imagination and at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, it had three out of four. Tomlinson throws himself into his role, giving it every ounce of his energy and decibels from the moment he comes on. Some light and shade would be welcome, but single-handedly he galvanises the whole performance. The sparks fly when he is confronted with Linda Finnie's hyperventilating Cuniza. Heaven knows who gave her that awful wig (one imagines her worst enemy ironing the pleats in the dressing-room beforehand) but she makes an ace twenties' vamp, generously throwing around her ample, rather Wagnerian mezzo. David Maxwell Anderson had an apology made from the stage for a cold, but sang with promising clarity; only the lyrical writing strained his resources. With David Porcelijn keeping the impetus going (crucial in early Verdi) the musical performance had most of the rude energy it needs. Only Rita Cullis in the soprano role of Leonora was too polite, lacking the necessary punch in the middle of the voice. Although she gave all she had, her final aria, which is the climax of the evening, was a vocal firework display which went off without any eclat. Incidentally, how striking it is to hear the pre-echo of Rigoletto in her duet with her father. Why is Oberto worth seeing? First, for historical reasons, because it is the seed from which all the later Verdi masterpieces grew. Second, for the sheer adrenalin, which will set toes tapping and hearts pumping, even when the brain complains that the music is not good enough to support any serious emotions at all. Opera North has found its energy and to that extent has found the opera, too. On tour until March</p>

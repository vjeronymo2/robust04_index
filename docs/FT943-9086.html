			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Harassment of fishing boats 'stopped by navy' The arrival of the Royal Navy in the tuna-fishing grounds of the Bay of Biscay has stopped harassment of UK trawlermen by their Spanish rivals, the head of the fisheries protection squadron said yesterday. Speaking at a news conference, Captain Christopher Morrison said there had been no attacks on British fishing vessels since shortly after the first naval protection vessel, the Anglesey, arrived in the area eight days ago. Capt Morrison also defended his squadron's role, which has been criticised by fishermen's representatives, in checking that European Union fishing rules are being carried out. Two fishing vessels have returned to Cornish ports in the past week after claims that their nets were too long. Capt Morrison said when the Anglesey arrived at dawn on August 4, a British vessel radioed to say it was being harassed. 'As she arrived on the scene, the Spanish fishing vessels left . . . and since that moment no harassment has taken place on British fishing vessels,' Capt Morrison said. 'Any idea that the navy has sat by watching while Spaniards cut British fishing nets is simply not true.' The Anglesey has since been joined by a second fisheries protection vessel, the Alderney. Fishermen have been angered by incidents in which two vessels left the fishing grounds after Capt Morrison's squadron said their nets exceeded the maximum length. Capt Morrison's comments came after Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, told Cornish fishermen the navy would prevent Spanish ships driving British trawlers off the fishing grounds in the Bay of Biscay. The trawler Silver Harvest pulled in its net this morning in the middle of more than 100 Spanish boats with HMS Alderney 'riding shotgun', said Capt Morrison. Spanish fisheries ministry officials were unable to confirm reports that two Spanish vessels were sent back to port two days ago for using driftnets longer than 2.5km.</p>

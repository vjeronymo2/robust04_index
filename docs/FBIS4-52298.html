			<p>BFN     [Text] The Spratly Islands issue remains a threat to the  country's security. This was the assessment made by Senator  Orlando Mercado, chairman of the Senate Committee on Defense,  and Arturo Enrile, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the  Philippines.    However, they expressed the hope that the prevailing tension  would be solved by moves undertaken by the countries claiming  the Spratlys. They added that the talks for a joint development  of the Spratlys would help to prevent the dispute ending in  violent confrontation.    [Begin recording in progress, in English] [Mercado] ...and  the world, really, as a consequence of the demise of the Cold  War. But, it is also an accepted notion that Spratlys or  Kalayaan Island Group is a potential problem.    [Enrile] ...flashpoint is Spratlys which is (?unabated)  because I think everybody has agreed anyway that you know  diplomacy is still the best way to solve international disputes.  There is really no conflict there right now, but just to  anticipate any conflict. [end recording]</p>

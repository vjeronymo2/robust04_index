			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Consolidating for the futures - The merging two big US commodities exchanges US futures exchanges have been tilting at a variety of windmills in the 1990s, fussing like mature matrons as more agile upstarts steal away their global dominance. Electronic trading, competition from over-the-counter derivatives markets and blossoming overseas exchanges have all been blamed for the fading lustre of New York and Chicago markets. The big US exchanges, however, have also been concerned about the monster within - increasingly bureaucratic and expensive structures and fundamental changes in how futures are traded. The Chicago Board of Trade's plan, announced on Monday, to acquire New York's big metals market, the Commodity Exchange (Comex), is a bold step to fight those internal monsters and, if futures pundits are correct, it may be the first of many such mergers. 'I believe unambiguously that this industry will consolidate, just like we've seen in the airline business, the communications industry,' said Mr Richard Sandor, CBoT board member and managing director of Kidder, Peabody. It was too costly, he said, for 11 US futures exchanges to operate independently. In Europe, where the trend toward national exchanges is growing, there is also some consolidation. Germany's Deutsche Terminborse and France's Matif announced two weeks ago that they would join forces, recognising cost savings and substantial increase in competitive clout. Member approval of the CBoT's Comex takeover, particularly on the Comex side, is far from certain. The exchange's leadership will have to convince independent floor traders that the financial advantages of the partnership will compensate Comex members for their loss of voting representation on the exchange. Regulatory approval of the merger may come more easily. Mr William Albrecht, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry watchdog, said his staff would examine the proposal when it arrived in Washington. 'Personally,' he said, 'I am quite receptive to actions which simplify and standardise clearing functions. Such actions contribute to more efficiency in the markets.' The CBoT will pay nothing for the Comex, and a fund set up to buy out Comex memberships after the merger will be financed by the New York exchange's current and future income. Executives at both exchanges said they were confident that the affiliation would boost volume and profits at Comex. The exchange, which is free of debt, has assets of Dollars 18m and cash on hand of Dollars 12m. However, its life-blood - volume - has slipped substantially, and without a marketing and research transfusion, could face extended volume and seat value erosion. Comex's main products, silver and gold futures, have been battered both by the recession and the absence of inflation. With only one financial contract  -the newly launched Eurotop 100 stock index future - it also suffers the general malaise of US commodity exchanges. While commodity trading has always been cyclical, the shift in futures business to managed funds has consolidated trade and cut down on the profits available to locals (dealers operating on their own account). As pickings in agricultural pits get slimmer, more and more traders cross over to more profitable opportunities in financial markets, further starving the commodities arena of capital. The New York exchange's futures volume dropped to 10.7m contracts last year from 12.6m in 1991. At the same time the London Metal Exchange has thrived, building turnover to 24.7m contracts last year from 17m in 1991. The CBoT, while remaining the world's largest futures exchange, has not been immune to the trend toward slumping commodities volume. Its turnover last year was up 7.6 per cent to 150m contracts but its agricultural futures volume stalled. Attempts at offering new non-financial products have also lagged. Despite thriving Treasury markets, CBoT membership values and member profitability have also been on a decline. A study of member profitability, commissioned by Mr Thomas Donovan, the exchange's president, recently confirmed that member incomes were down. Particularly big losers were the independent soyabean futures traders, whose profits were off 40 per cent last year when measured in 1982 dollars. Chicago exchanges, sensing the trend, have spent the last year working at cost-cutting consolidations. New York Exchanges, engaged in long-running squabbles, have been unable to follow. When asked on Monday why Comex did not affiliate with a New York partner, Ms Donna Redel, the exchange's chairman, said none had offered. Comex had agreed to consolidate trade clearing operations with the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, but Ms Redel said that agreement had not been acted upon and would be voided if the new partnership with the CBoT was approved. In an interview, Ms Redel urged other New York exchanges to follow Comex's lead and join with Chicago. No such discussions are in process, but CBoT officials said they would welcome other partners. Mr Patrick Arbor, the CBoT chairman, said his exchange would continue to support Comex's part in a consortium of New York exchanges that plan to build a new headquarters complex and trading floor in Manhattan. In effect, the Chicago/New York merger will draw Comex into the joint efforts of the big Chicago exchanges. Mr Arbor said the CBoT intended to list Comex contracts on Globex, the after-hours electronic trading system jointly owned by the CBoT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Reuters Holdings. Mr Leo Melamed, chairman of Globex Corporation, applauded the proposed merger. The CBoT and the CME are slowly working toward joint clearing operations, and have merged overseas marketing functions. Comex will benefit from these joint efforts as well. The CME has been relatively low-key about the merger announcement, declining to issue formal comment. Informally officials are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The CME's volume was up 24 per cent this year, and seat prices are at all-time highs. Its commodity volume comprises only 5 per cent of overall turnover. With such strong results, CME executives feel they are on a better footing than the CBoT. The CBoT is still attempting to weave another, much larger alliance with the London International Financial Futures Exchange. Negotiations appear to have stalled, however, and CBoT officials did not mention that proposed partnership Monday, when announcing the Comex merger plan.</p>

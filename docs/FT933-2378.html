			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A blow to the G and T set - Giles MacDonogh thinks gin drinkers have cause for concern IN THE course of the past year or so, I have begun to feel sorry for the gin and tonic drinker. I realise that the manufacturers of his favourite drink do not think much of him and feel they can slip water into his gin without him noticing - except that a few people did notice. When I learned that Gordon's had reduced the alcoholic strength of its UK bottlings from 40 per cent alcohol by volume to 37.5 I called a gin and tonic drinking friend and asked him his reaction: 'Dear boy', he said, 'I poured myself my usual sundowner and had a snort and then I said to myself 'something's wrong]' At this point I looked at the label and suddenly the mystery was solved.' Gordon's controls about half the UK market for gin so when it sneezes all the other companies catch cold. In the wake of Gordon's' decision, one by one they all followed suit, with the exception of Burroughs' Beefeater which remains at 40 per cent. Beefeater is now being punished for its stubbornness, for the other brands have made around 50p a bottle out of this move, or if you prefer: Pounds 6 a case. Gordon's latest move is to remove the mention 'the heart of a good cocktail' from the label. It was right to do so: at 37.5 per cent it was certainly untrue. I have it on no less an authority than the head barman of the Palace Hotel, in Madrid, that it is quite impossible to make a decent dry Martini with less than 47 per cent; and he used to make Martinis for Ernest Hemingway, a man who knew a thing or two about drinking. Gordon's has been able to get away with all this because gin is basically a non-drink. Anything which is really worth drinking must be drinkable on its own: neat, or as near as dammit. Few people, however, drink gin by itself, or even with a splash of water: the odd Oxford don and the totality of gin distillers. I cannot even think of a handful of others. In this country gin and tonic drinkers account for 70 per cent of the people who buy gin. When I spoke to the distillers at Gilbey's Gin a few years back, they told me that they even tasted the gin with tonic to see how the product blended up with the tonic water from Schweppes. I think I must enjoy about one gin and tonic a year: on a perfect, English, summer evening (there have not been many of these this year) when care has been taken to put the lime, the tonic, the gin and the glass in the fridge; then, and only then is it a refreshing aperitif. The pub gin and tonic has to be classed as one of the most disgusting concoctions known to drinking man. The US uses gin more inventively than we do, and this is borne out by the fact that the gin distillers have not tampered with the strengths of gin on the American market: Plymouth is still at 40 per cent, Gordon's is at 43 per cent and Beefeater at a cocktail strength of 47 per cent, to name but three. The reason for this is abundantly clear: Americans use gin to make cocktails they do not drown it with tonic water. There was one respectable way of drinking gin in this country but these days it is rarely seen outside naval circles. That was the pink gin. You swilled a little angostura bitters around a glass and then tossed them out. Then you added gin and topped up with a little water. The result had the palest pink tinge. The favourite gin for making pink gins was Plymouth. Being so close to the dockyards in the great port, naval officers developed a loyalty to Plymouth gin which they never lost. Plymouth gin also had a slightly different character in that the chief 'botanical' constituent (or flavouring, if you prefer) was orris, or iris, root. Gordon's is perhaps the most juniperry of gins. All the other main brands have opted for the London Dry formula which relies far more on citrus character. This derives not only from the use of orange and/or lemon peel as a botanical, coriander is also a vital ingredient for making London Dry. Beefeater also stresses the importance of the highly aromatic angelica root. Gordon's has been making a big effort lately to explain to drinks writers that strength is not important: 'Alcohol is just a vehicle for carrying flavours', it says. It denies that the winetaster's term 'mouthfeel' has any importance when it comes to gin. This may be true in a gin and tonic, where the result of Gordon's decision to water its gin will mean simply that you will have to be more sparing with the tonic, but it is simply nonsense in the case of a dry cocktail. My advice to gin drinkers is the following: if you drink gin and tonic buy Beefeater; if you make cocktails buy Tanqueray at 47.3 per cent, the only generally available high-strength gin on the UK market; if you do not like the strong juniper-character of Tanqueray you must bring back your favourite brand at 47 per cent the next time you go abroad; or, if you are anywhere near Plymouth you could drop into the distillery shop and buy a bicentennial distillation at 57 per cent. Do not bother with tonic, drink it pink.</p>

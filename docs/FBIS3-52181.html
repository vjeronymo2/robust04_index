			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has stressed that  the Vatican's recognition of Israel is not a Christian  recognition. He noted that the new year marks the death of an  old era and the birth of a new one. He added: We told the  Vatican, which we respect, that if Christ were here now he would  expel the Jews from the temple as he did the thieves, because  the Jews are the thieves of security, politics, and economy.  Therefore, the Vatican's recognition of Israel is not Christian  because we believe in Christ's values, which are ones of right  and justice. To recognize Israel, he added, is to recognize its  injustice against the Arabs and the Palestinians.    'Allamah Fadlallah noted that the United States stands  against any righteous and just position in the Third World and  is working with its full power against the Islamists and to  besiege the Islamic Republic of Iran. He added: While we  believe that the United States is the enemy of the peoples and  justice, we have no problem with the American people but rather  our problem is with the U.S. Administration. Our problem with  this administration is that there is no U.S. policy in the  region, there is an Israeli policy.</p>

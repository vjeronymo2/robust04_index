			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China is putting final  touches to a 14-year-long, tremendous project to renovate  monasteries throughout the Tibet Autonomous Region.    According to Zhou Dunyou, official in charge of the region's  nationality and religious affairs, the project, started in 1980  and consuming more than 260 million yuan from the central  government and Tibet regional government, has given a new image  to over 1,400 monasteries.    Of these, 553 were seriously damaged during the Cultural  Revolution (1966-76).    Zhou said that the renovation campaign has covered a wide  range of lamaseries and temples.    The cost of renovating the Potala Palace in Lhasa alone,  which will be completed in August, has totalled 50 million yuan.    Dealing with a crack in the wall of the Johkang Temple in  Lhasa has cost the central government three million yuan.    About 66 million yuan and 600 kg of gold went to build a  stupa (shrine) and memorial hall for the late 10th Panchen Lama,  who died in 1989.    Zhou noted that the central government and the regional  government are now concentrating on helping the monasteries have  enough funds to support themselves.    Lamas in the Tibet region have been encouraged to take up  some subsidiary business to raise funds for the monasteries'  everyday expenditure.    "The move is going with the tide the of market economy,"  Zhou  said.    Over 90 percent of all the 1,400-plus lamaseries and temples  in the region still live on alms given by religious followers.    Any business activity by lamas usually consists of  handicrafts, restaurants or transport services for local  farmers. The region now has about 34,000 lamas.    According to Zhou, major monasteries in Lhasa have solved  the  problem of shortage of funds by such measures, while the other  areas still have difficulties in this direction.    He added that lamas enjoy a good "business image" because of  their respectable standing.    Local residents prefer lamas' service as they do not seek  excessive profits.    For instance, lamas in Shannan Prefecture who are offering  transport services have two hand-carts, a truck and a ferry  boat. Poor farmers can get free-of-charge ferry crossings if  they cannot afford the fare.</p>

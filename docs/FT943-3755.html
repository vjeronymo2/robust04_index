			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Bank backing for investors The World Bank has approved a proposal to use its financial might to boost flows of private sector finance to projects in the developing world. The board voted to use the bank's guarantee authority to offer investors insurance against the risk of governments changing their policies - a risk which has inhibited investors' willingness to put their money in developing nation projects. The decision will allow the bank to offer guarantees routinely, and to offer them on a stand-alone basis when it is not co-financing a project. The move marks a step in the World Bank's efforts to expand its involvement in the private sector. Although all its policy advice to governments in the developing world urges the virtues of privatisation and private sector capital, the bank itself is bound by its articles to lend only to governments or state institutions. Although the bank's International Finance Corporation subsidiary invests in the private sector, and its Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency provides insurance mostly for equity investments, both have limited resources; the bulk of the group's financial muscle is in the main bank. An influential report this year from the Bretton Woods commission convened by Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, said that 'of the challenges facing the World Bank Group, none is greater than adapting to a world that has turned from public sector dominance towards private enterprise and free markets'. But bank officials say private investors are often wary governments may change the rules: if they have funded an electricity plant, for example, will the government regulator stop them selling power at market prices? The World Bank has been experimenting with its guarantee power in some of its co-financing operations. In the Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.16bn) Hub River power project in Pakistan, for example, the bank has guaranteed commercial lenders against some risks, such as the possibility that the government might not fulfil its obligation to provide fuel and to distribute the power generated.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Forum" column: Article by Nihal Jayawickrama, </F> senior lecturer at Hong Kong University: "Don't Let Basic Law  Hand China a `State Secrets' Clause:]    [Text] The secret trial and conviction in Beijing of a  Hong Kong journalist and a Chinese bank official for the "theft  of state secrets", and the grossly iniquitous prison sentences  imposed on them, have focused attention once more on a crude  legal and judicial system that refuses to comply with the  universally accepted minimum standards of criminal justice.    But even this outrageous abuse of state power does not  appear  to have alerted the Hong Kong community to the very real  probability that, in barely three years, a law identical to that  which was invoked to commit these two persons to prison, for the  crime of disclosing interest rate and gold transaction changes,  may be introduced into our own legal system.    Article 23 of the Basic Law states that the Hong Kong  Special  Administrative Region (SAR) shall enact a law to prohibit the  "theft of state secrets". Today, Hong Kong has its own Official  Secrets Act. It is a law that seeks to protect from "damaging  disclosure" information relating to "defence", "security",  "intelligence" and "international relations". Each of these  terms is defined in the law with reasonable clarity. While many  may argue against the reach of this law, few would deny the need  to protect these interests even under the most open and  democratic system of government.    The Joint Declaration promised that laws previously in force  in Hong Kong shall be maintained in the SAR. This implied that  a localised version of the Official Secrets Act would continue  to operate after 1997. But contrary to that promise, the Basic  Law decreed that Hong Kong shall also criminalise the "theft of  state secrets". It was thereby made clear that, "one country;  two systems" notwithstanding, it was the intention of the  Chinese authorities that the unique Chinese socialist law  concept of secrecy be applied and enforced in Hong Kong after  1997.    From recent events we gather that apart from relatively  trivial information relating to interest rate movements and the  sale of gold in the international market, the Chinese judiciary  also regards an embargoed public speech of a senior party  official as a "state secret". None of these items of  information qualifies to be an official secret either in Hong  Kong or in Britain today. Indeed, no sanction has ever followed  the regular publication of obviously leaked "predictions" of  budget proposals. When some years ago the embargoed text of the  Queen's Christmas Day speech was published in advance, the only  admonition from the palace was a firm declaration that Her  Majesty was not amused.    What has emerged, therefore, are two distinctly  contradictory  conceptions of official information. We believe that the free  flow of such information serves not only to check corruption and  the abuse of power, but also to increase efficiency and promote  accountability. The Chinese authorities, on the other hand,  consider the rigorous control of information as indispensable to  sustain the essential authoritarianism of their autocratic  system. Investigative journalism which is fundamental to one  system is obviously anathema to the other.    There has also emerged two substantially different  conceptions of the role of the judiciary. Their willingness to  proceed in secret, to deny the accused persons their basic right  to a defence, and then to impose such grossly disproportionate  sentences, only tend to confirm the active role of Chinese  judges in strengthening and consolidating the "dictatorship of  the proletariat". To even suggest that judges ought not to be  subservient to the government, as we believe here in Hong Kong,  would probably be tantamount to blasphemy.    Therefore, to enact a law in Hong Kong to criminalise the  "theft of state secrets" is to alter significantly the existing  Hong Kong system. It will result in placing an almost  insurmountable obstacle in the movement towards democracy and  autonomy. It will erode the principles of the rule of law and  public accountability, and debilitate at least two of our  essential institutions: a free press and an independent  judiciary. It ought not to be done.    Unlike those who collaborated in the drafting of the Basic  Law, a substantial section of today's political leadership  enjoys a legitimacy which they have acquired through popular  election or acceptance. If they do not focus on this issue now,  history is not likely to look upon them too kindly.</p>

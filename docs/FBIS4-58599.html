			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled announcement on statement by "military source" </F> at the Defense Ministry and General Staff Command]    [Text] The forces of apostasy and secession in the  Socialist Party leadership are continuing their spiteful,  aggressive operations against the Armed Forces and Security  units as well as the citizens, the sons of our people, using all  types of ground and air weapons.    At 0530 [0230 GMT] today, two aircraft belonging to the  secessionist gang, which is rebelling against the Constitutional  legitimacy, launched air raids on the capital, Sanaa, aiming at  vital targets. The antiaircraft defenses intercepted the  raiding aircraft and forced them to flee. In the meantime, the  gang, which is rebelling against the Constitutional legitimacy  sent some aircraft to strafe the al-Hudaydah and Ta'izz  airports. The ground defenses forced them to flee without  hitting their targets.    The forces of that rebelling gang are continuing their  criminal aggression in more than one place in the homeland  against the sons of our brave Armed Forces. These criminal  forces will reap nothing but loss and defeat, God wiling, so  that the Yemeni homeland will continue to be united and  prosperous.</p>

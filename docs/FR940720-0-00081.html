			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Multiple-Refinery Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final reformulated gasoline rule also promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline adjustment provisions for multi-refinery refiners where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each refinery produced JP&hyph;4 in 1990. This adjustment provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that multi-refinery refiners are predominantly in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business of fuel production and thus possess the means to offset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the refinery's JP&hyph;4 volume and associated fuel parameter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases with fuels volumes at other locations. The adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also assumes that refiners with multiple-refineries have process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units offering various processing options which support an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average (or typical) fuel production operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's action modifies the JP&hyph;4 baseline adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple refinery requirement. Every refinery of a multiple-refinery is no longer required to have produced JP&hyph;4. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multi-refinery refiners are allowed to average their 1990 JP&hyph;4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production to 1990 gasoline production ratio across all of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refineries. However, all refineries of a multi-refiner must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still meet the other two criteria specified for the JP&hyph;4 baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment in the reformulated gasoline final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, only refiners that will not produce reformulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline and that meet the 1990 JP&hyph;4 to gasoline production ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are allowed to make a JP&hyph;4 baseline adjustment. The Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amending the requirement stipulating that each refinery of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple-refineries produced JP&hyph;4 in 1990 because, essentially,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same environmental impact and economic hardship is expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of whether a single refinery or all refineries of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple-refinery produced JP&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. JP&hyph;4 Baseline Adjustment Ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final reformulated gasoline rule promulgated baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment provisions which stipulate that 1990 JP&hyph;4 production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must have constituted a specified portion of a refiner's 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel production in order for a significant enough burden to exist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to justify permiting baseline adjustments. Additionally, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline is neither unrepresentative of 1990, nor incalculable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of post-1990 changes in crude availability, fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications, fuel markets, etc. EPA is permitting baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments for certain refiners which produced JP&hyph;4 jet fuel in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 because, as discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reformulated gasoline final rule, EPA believes that it has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited authority to allow such adjustments in certain extreme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases. The final reformulated gasoline regulations require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ratio of the refinery's 1990 JP&hyph;4 production to its 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline production equal or exceed 0.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon further evaluation of the baseline adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, the Agency has concluded that the JP&hyph;4 to gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production ratio, as promulgated in the RFG final rule (0.5), is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessarily restrictive. Based on responses from affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refiners, under the December 1993 criteria only two refiners in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States would likely qualify for the adjustment. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other words, very few refiners under contract to produce JP&hyph;4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will have the relief intended by the provision. Today's action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alters the refiner's 1990 JP&hyph;4 production to 1990 gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production ratio from 0.5 to 0.2. EPA believes this revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio indicates that a significant amount of the refinery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feedstock used for JP&hyph;4 production would have to be converted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to produce gasoline. Altering the JP&hyph;4 to gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production ratio will allow additional small refiners to qualify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the adjustment and not be forced to operate from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drastically less competitive position or be driven out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business. Based on feedback EPA has received, changing the ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 0.5 to 0.2 raises the number of affected refiners from 2 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. If large refineries had such a ratio also, the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden would be just as great. Also, it would be more difficult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to argue de minimis environmental impact for large refiners. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reality none do, such that the ratio is only an issue for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refiners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several different ratio options were suggested by commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the reformulated gasoline rulemaking as to what minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of a refinery's 1990 production JP&hyph;4 should have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituted for the circumstance to be extenuating, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JP&hyph;4 production to total refinery production, 20%; JP&hyph;4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production to gasoline production, 5%; JP&hyph;4 production to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline production, 75%; and, JP&hyph;4 production to gasoline plus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JP&hyph;4 production, 10%. EPA's 0.2 JP&hyph;4 to gasoline ratio is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> line with some of the commenters suggestions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At less than a 1990 JP&hyph;4 to gasoline production ratio of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.2, EPA believes the impact on benzene and aromatics may make it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more costly for refiners to comply with the regulations, though  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is unlikely that such refiners will be forced out of business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or experience some similar extreme burden. For example, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected that no economic hardship will occur at a  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> JP&hyph;4 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline ratio of 0.1. Thus, the Agency discretion recognized in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alabama <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  to grant variances or even dispensation from a rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where imposition of the requirement would result in minimal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental benefit but would extremely burden a regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party, would not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Alabama Power Company  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> vs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  Costle, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  636 F.2d 323.357 (D.C. Cir 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the adjusted emission baselines of those approved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both amended  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> JP&hyph;4 adjustments are likely to be higher than their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual 1990 baselines (primarily due to increased benzene and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aromatics) EPA expects minimal negative environmental affects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the number of refineries meeting the criteria is still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be quite small. Second, the total production of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such refineries is also small. Thus, not very much additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline will be affected by any baseline adjustments for JP&hyph;4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than if the criteria were less stringent or adjustments were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed at all. The modification of the multi-refinery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement and the reduction of the ratio requirement to 0.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both provide necessary flexibility to refiners and allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional refiners (that are simultaneously burdened by the JP&hyph;4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phaseout and the anti-dumping provisions) regulatory relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline final rule, JP&hyph;4 baseline adjustments will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be allowed only for those refiners which will not produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline, which is the most critical factor in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing environmental impact. While the anti-dumping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, in general, apply to all conventional gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not reformulated gasoline is also produced, in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific cases no dumping will occur due to reformulated gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production. The intent of Congress with regard to the anti-dumping program will be met while not unduly burdening those that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the specified criteria. Since both the unadjusted and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted baselines must be determined, if a refiner granted such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an adjustment subsequently produces reformulated gasoline, its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional gasoline compliance would immediately be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its original unadjusted baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

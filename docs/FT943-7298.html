The finalists are a biologist, a nurse, a shop assistant and a teacher. When that ends at 7.00, Radio 3 begins the first of today's BBC Proms 1994, relayed live, as usual, from the Royal Albert Hall. This is a tribute to Basil Cameron, one of the main conductors of the Proms in the 1940s and 50s. The BBC Symphony Orchestra under Alexander Lazarev plays the Sibelius 5 and Shostakovich 9 on either side of John Lill's performance of the Britten Piano Concerto.

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 'MR. FLORIDA STATE' DIES AT 89  </P> <P> The man credited with bringing football to Florida State University and helping  the school grow into a major university from a small women's college is dead at  89.  </P> <P> Coyle E. Moore, known as "Mr. Florida State" for his service and contributions  to the school for more than 60 years, died Tuesday at his home, school  officials said.  </P> <P> "He had more bearing on FSU athletics than any other individual anywhere, any  time," football Coach Bobby Bowden said.  </P> <P> Moore arrived at Florida State College for Women in 1928 and founded the  Florida State School for Social Welfare. When the university began  intercollegiate football in 1947, he was instrumental in persuading the  University of Florida to play in Tallahassee, beginning in 1964.  </P> <P> Once the Florida-Florida State games began, Moore said, "our image picked up .  . . and we moved from inferior salaries and appropriations to something  approaching par."  </P> <P> Moore is survived by his wife of 62 years, Mabel, and a niece, Janet Poole  Hicks of Wilmington, N.C.  </P></p>

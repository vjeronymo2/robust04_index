			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Casino group's gaming licences opposed MR JOHN ASPINALL, the casino operator, has objected to the application by London Clubs, the casino group that owns the Ritz Club and Les Ambassadeurs in the capital, for renewal of its gaming licences. The objection by Mr Aspinall has come as a surprise to London Clubs, which had hoped that the hearing of its application by magistrates on October 19 would proceed smoothly after the Gaming Board's recent decision to grant certificates of consent for its six casinos. Certificates of consent indicate that the board considers a casino fit to operate and paves the way for magistrates to grant gaming licences. Mr Aspinall, whose new casino opens in London on October 20, argues that approval of new licences for London Clubs is such an important decision for British gaming that the issues ought to be aired in open court. London Clubs, whose future had been clouded by uncertainty after a police raid on its Mayfair casinos in June last year, has undergone a transformation under its new chairman, Sir Gordon Booth, a former diplomat. The company has always denied any wrongdoing. After the previous management team, led by Mr Max Kingsley, resigned at the end of April, new directors were brought in and efforts were made to meet the Gaming Board objections to the company's operating procedures. One decision was to stop granting complimentary services for overseas players, such as payment of air fares and hotel bills, a practice understood to have worried the Gaming Board, although the company had claimed the practice was perfectly proper. The new management convinced the Gaming Board that it was 'fit and proper' to keep its licences and was granted certificates of consent for its six casinos, which are now set up as separate units instead of as a single entity. The company had assumed that the police would take the same view as the board and not pursue their objections. While the new licences are expected to be granted, the future of London Clubs remains dependent on the magistrates' hearing. Mr Aspinall's intervention is thought unlikely to alter the outcome but may lengthen the hearing.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> GALLERIES;  </P> <P> AMERICAN ICONS IN WATERCOLOR  </P> <P> FOR MANY, the term sport art is oxymoronic. Apart from the rare "Discus  Thrower," athletics doesn't seem to inspire fine art that pleases both critics  and consumers.  </P> <P> But now sports and art lovers with refined sensibilities can indulge their  passions at the Sports and Entertainment Gallery in Venice. Particularly  noteworthy among the gallery's current offerings is the work of local artist  and inveterate baseball fan, Robert Myers.  </P> <P> Myers relies on his eclectic assortment of late-'50s/early-'60s baseball cards  as inspiration for his large watercolor portraits (which sell for $1,500 to  $5,000). "I'm not a baseball-card collector," he insists. "I'm interested in  them only from an artistic perspective. Unlike today's cards, which are bland  portraiture, the older versions are not photorealism but neo-pop art. They are  American icons." He is attracted to a card primarily by the player's apparent  attitude. "I want a subject who knows he's being viewed. I look for that  confrontational, dramatic moment that's shared among the subject, the painter  and the viewer."  </P> <P> Sports and Entertainment Gallery, in the Venice Renaissance Project, 245 Main  St., Venice; (213) 392-5583.  </P> <P> ELLEN ALPERSTEIN  </P></p>

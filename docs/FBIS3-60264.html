			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, December 14 (BTA) -- The chemical plant in  Giurgiu has been shut down and will be brought on line only  after the waste-treatment installation starts operating and  Bulgarian experts establish that the plant will not pollute the  air of Giurgiu and Ruse, the Romanian minister for water,  forestry, and environmental protection Aurel Constantin Ilie  told his Bulgarian counterpart Valentin Bosevski on the first  day of a two-day working meeting. Since the early 1980's, the  Giurgiu Chemical Plant has been the major polluter of the air of  the Danubian city of Ruse.    The Romanian minister came to Bulgaria to work out a  regional  environmental programme aimed at the lower reaches of the  Danube. On the basis of the programme the two ministers will  sign a memorandum to the European Union to seek its support for  the implementation of the programme.    The sides are pleased with the fact that the two countries  are becoming increasingly active in European environmental  policy. "The signing of the Convention on Black Sea Protection  in Bucharest last year and the forthcoming endorsement of the  Danubian Convention, which will take place in Sofia, go to show  the will of Bulgaria and Romania to share in a very important  process: the conservation of Europe's natural resources," Mr.  Bosevski said.    Further talks between the two ministers will focus on a  number of issues related to the finalizing of nuclear safety  accords. The Romanian guest proposed that expert teams be set  up to work in the sphere of nuclear safety and exercise  reciprocal control. The sides are also expected to work out the  status and composition of the inter-governmental commission on  the implementation of the bilateral agreement on cooperation in  environment protection.</p>

"We have to express concern about the U.S. Government move  to  build up the strength of its procedures that would clear the way  for unilateral action in resolving trade disputes with other  countries," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a  news conference.    The top government spokesman made the comment after Clinton  reinstated Thursday the trade measure that gives the U.S.  Government broad legal authority to impose sanctions unless  Japan meets U.S. demands on greater access to Japanese markets.    Takemura argued that taking unilateral action as a means of  resolving bilateral trade rows is "implicitly" prohibited under  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or the  yet-to-be-created World Trade Organization.    Saying both Japan and the United States shoulder heavy  responsibility for smooth management of the world economy,  Takemura urged the U.S. Government to "take sensible action."    The chief cabinet secretary also reiterated Tokyo is  determined to do its utmost to further open its markets to  foreign competition on a voluntary basis.    Super 301, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1988, gives the  President power to retaliate against countries which the U.S.  deems to be engaging in unfair trade practices.    Prime Minister Hosokawa received a phone call from Clinton  shortly after midnight Thursday Japan time notifying him of the  decision to resuscitate Super 301, Takemura said.    Clinton was quoted as saying the revived provision is not  intended to target any particular country and that the U.S. and  Japan can resolve the brewing bilateral trade spat through  dialogue.    Under the provisions spelled out by U.S. Trade  Representative  Mickey Kantor on Thursday, the U.S. Government will not identify  any potential target country until September 30, and will seek  to negotiate a settlement over a period of 12 to 18 months  before taking any punitive action.    Kantor said, "It should be clearly understood we are not  designating or identifying any practice of any country today."    During the phone call, Hosokawa told Clinton that Tokyo is  scheduled to devise a package of measures to further open its  markets by the end of March and said both countries should show  restraint, Takemura said.    Asked if Japan will file a complaint with GATT if the U.S.  imposes trade sanctions against it, the chief government  spokesman only reiterated that Tokyo is making voluntary efforts  to formulate a market-opening package.</p>

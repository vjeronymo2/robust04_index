			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Arts: A vivid metaphor for Russian life - A violent start to Moscow's theatre season has not affected the quality of the drama It is hard to find a theatre in Moscow that does not have a currency exchange office or a night-club in it, and it is no surprise that the new theatre season in Moscow has started with offstage violence and brutality. Leonid Kheifits, the artistic director of the Russian Army Theatre, was severely beaten up by the Mafia after refusing to consider plans to house cabaret and variety shows in the theatre. A few days later police threatened to eject the famous director Yuri Lyubimov from his Taganka Theatre after actor and former minister of culture, Nikolay Gubenko, won a long lasting trial for the theatre. Once the most daring and liberal political theatre, the Taganka now maintains its political fame by means other than theatre productions. As one of the Russian newspapers reported, Gubenko hoped to rent the theatre out to a bank and use its stage as a venue for right-wing party gatherings. Whatever Gubenko's and Lyubimov's ambitions may be, all these quarrels have nothing to do with the art of theatre; rather, they reflect on the chaos, disintegration and fledgling market economy in the country. Yet even in the face of these extraordinary difficulties, some theatres are still able to produce plays of genuine artistic value; plays which resist the disintegration of Russian culture. The Wonderful Fusion, a comedy performed by a group of young actors at the small GITIS theatre, is one of the best examples of such resistance. Written in the 1930s style of Soviet socialist realism by Vladimir Kirshon, it was one of the most popular plays of Stalin's time. It is supposed to show the spirit and potential of the young communist country, describing how bright Soviet youths enthusiastically work together to build new aeroplanes - and fall in love in their spare time. From the very beginning of the production, the cheerful songs about 'the radiant future of communism' and 'the country that raises with glory to meet a new day' evoke not only the fervid atmosphere of the 1930s, but also a nostalgia for the highly optimistic art of that time. As one of the actresses said, 'we chose this play because it gives us a chance to feel happy and light-hearted for a change.' This new production is not a parody of the socialist realism of the 1930s, nor does it try to denounce the naivety and enthusiasm of that time. On the contrary, it is one of the first endeavours in Russian theatre to look at the 1930s historically, without the loathing that has lately become so fashionable. This fashion makes the old director, Vladimir Levertov, explain in apologetic tones before each performance: 'this is part of our history, part of the history of our theatre - we should remember it'. In a way the whole production is an act of remembrance, a tribute to the generation of people who sincerely believed in the ideas of their time. The Wonderful Fusion is also the fusion of two generations: Levertov, for whom the 1930s is a living memory; and young actors for whom the play is removed far enough in time to be simply a historical drama. Another historical drama opened recently at the famous Moscow Arts Theatre: Pushkin's Boris Godunov, directed by Oleg Efremov who also plays the central role. Boris Godunov is the most significant Russian national tragedy. It is set in the beginning of the 17th century during the Time of Troubles, so that directors have tended to use the play as a commentary on the evils of the day. But the new production of the Moscow Arts theatre is an exception to this. Efremov's production is hardly concerned at all with contemporary politics. It illustrates only the first part of Pushkin's definition of a tragedy: 'man's fate and the destiny of the people'. Efremov plays a man, rather than a politician; and maybe that is why the best scene in the production is the one where Godunov talks to his children - this is a Godunov who is tired of the constant struggle for power. Without directly drawing any parallels with the present day, the main theme of Efremov's performance corresponds to the spirit of modern Russia, a country exhausted by political struggles, coups, corruption and blood. While a sense of weariness defines Efremov's Boris Godunov, another production, The Deadly Trick (performed on the small stage of the Moscow Arts Theatre), brings energy and freshness into an upcoming theatre season. Written by actor Oleg Antonov and directed by actor Vladimir Mashkov, The Deadly Trick is, unsurprisingly, a production about acting. It starts with one of Fellini's images: a red clown is climbing a rope with one hand and playing a saxophone with the other. He misses his footing, and the sound of a crash reverberates round the theatre. After a second of darkness, four clowns emerge from the dead body and begin clowning lives of their own. These four clowns seem to be connected by invisible string and can only exist together. They finally return where they belong, enabling the red clown once again to climb up the rope and continue playing the saxophone. The Deadly Trick takes us back to the very roots of the theatre, to its magic and conjuring. One clown tries to catch a sunbeam in a mirror and suddenly hundreds of small sunbeams light up the black walls of the theatre. The production is filled with magic, producing sighs of rapture rarely heard in the theatre today. Tired of reality, Russian people want to be conjured and deceived by theatrical illusion. Yet the sense of illusion in The Deadly Trick is inseparable from a sense of fatal danger - which is probably what turns this slightly surreal production into a vivid metaphor for Russian life.</p>

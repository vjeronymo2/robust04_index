			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Akzo Nobel surges 35% on strong sales Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit before extraordinary items rose 34.7 per cent in the third quarter. This reflected increased sales volumes and reduced costs. The sharp improvement was seen in most divisions, with even the weak fibres sector producing a small profit after losses a year earlier. Net profit totalled Fl 322m (Dollars 192m) before extraordinary items, compared with Fl 239m a year earlier. Profits after extraordinary items jumped 75 per cent because the 1993 result was weighed down by Fl 55m in charges related to spinning off loss-making activities into joint ventures. There were no extraordinary items in the 1994 quarter. Mr Syb Bergsma, finance director, said the result confirmed expectations that second-half results in 1994 would be above those in 1993. The company left its interim dividend unchanged at Fl 1.50 a share. Economic recovery in Europe, coupled with continued good business conditions in the US, lifted sales volumes 5 per cent. Average selling prices rose 2 per cent, but Akzo Nobel faced a similar rate of increase in its own raw material costs. Turnover rose 4.3 per cent to Fl 5.42bn, and would have been higher if it had not been for the dollar's decline.</p>

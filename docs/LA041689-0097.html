			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Israeli army extended curfews to much of the occupied lands to prevent  violence on the anniversary of PLO military chief Khalil Wazir's assassination.  Soldiers reportedly shot and killed one Palestinian. Throughout the  territories, residents observed a general strike to protest the killings of at  least five Palestinians last week. Wazir, the military commander of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, was gunned down in Tunis, Tunisia, on April  16, 1988, by suspected Israeli commandos. Underground leaders of the  16-month-old Palestinian uprising have called for a "day of mass rage" to mark  today's anniversary of his death.  </P></p>

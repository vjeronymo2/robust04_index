			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / A lukewarm reception from potential partners Yesterday's twin-track announcement - a firm decision to buy 25 Hercules aircraft and a declaration of interest in buying up to 50 Future Large Aircraft - received a lukewarm reception from Britain's potential partners in the FLA project. On one hand the British decision makes it more likely that the FLA - whose viability is still in the balance - will materialise. On the other there is scepticism in France and Germany about whether Britain will find the money to buy as many as 50 FLAs, given that the order for 25 Hercules C-130J aircraft was on the high side of expectations. The high estimate for possible FLA purchases was seen in continental Europe as a thinly veiled attempt to ensure for British industry the all-important contract to build the new aircraft's wings. DASA, the German member of the consortium, makes no secret of its interest in making the wings for the FLA if Britain stays out. British officials have stressed that they see the immediate need for Hercules C-130J and the medium-term attractions of the FLA as separate issues. But for the FLA partners the British decision to become a launch customer for C-130J amounts to a considerable boost for that project which would affect the European aircraft's hopes of export to third countries. Experts put the minimum number of west European orders to ensure the FLA's viability at about 200, assuming 50 sales to non-European countries. Given that France and Germany are both in the market for about 60 aircraft, Britain might make all the difference between success and failure. But renewed British participation, and UK claims for a substantial share of the work, could diminish the attractiveness of the FLA among smaller European states. For France, British participation will reduce the risk of the FLA project being skewed in Germany's favour. But it could re-open the argument over whether the FLA should have a turbo-prop design - as France wants - or a turbo-fan design.</p>

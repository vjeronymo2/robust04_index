			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Arts: Baggage and Bomshells - Cockpit Theatre, NW8 Richard Crane's Gulf War play mounts a very different offensive to Trevor Griffiths' The Gulf Between Us at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. Whereas Griffiths has forged metaphors from recognisable events, Crane launches an all-out assault on that part of us that might still try to justify this, or any war. Baggage and Bombshells is crude in its language and and expressionistic in its imagery, but it shares with Griffiths' play an urge to mythologise history. Whereas Griffiths' does this ironically, through O'Toole, gilder, story-teller and down-beat omniscient, Crane gives us a seething, shaven-headed woman, naked beneath a sheathlike bandage, who introduces herself as the 'abominable blood-drinking rich bitch whore of Babylon.' Baggage and bombshells are the words used respectively by soldiers for wives and prostitutes; the subject of war, in Crane's account, is polarised between the two of them. Vera (Jacqueline Rudelle) is the simpering romanticiser of battle heroism, who spouts dewy eyed cliches before being rudely awakened by the accidental death of her husband; Joan (Kat Davison) is the camp groupie, fast and faithless, who embodies the raw sexiness of bloodshed. Although this is a show performed by three women, it rather disconcertingly seems not to be about women at all, except as projections of the warrior mind: neither Vera nor Joan have much reality beyond the sort of fictions created for the boys at the front by Vera Lynn or your average girlie calendar. Fielding her best toothpaste grin and a diction that seems to be trapped in an inter-war time-warp, Vera talks of the stories she has constructed to glamorise her husband for her children ('I tell them daddy might have to lay down his life'). Donning a black mask, Joan becomes a precision bomber, echoing those Vietnam posters of girl astride heavy artillery, while presumably making a point about more recent warfare. The imagery is so overloaded that it becomes confused and finally unhelpful. Johanna Benyon's whore of Babylon makes a striking contrast both visually and conceptually: she swears like a trooper, uncomfortably, even offensively; she is contemptuously androgynous, and yet her face is hunted, petrified. She is the most powerful element of a show that explodes in a blinding flash of heat and dust, leaving one rubbing one's eyes and wondering what on earth it was all about.</p>

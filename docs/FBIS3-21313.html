Lobbying is an accepted way of life in America's democracy,  and the institution is nearly as old as the signing of the  Declaration of Independence 200 years old. Lobbying firms have  proliferated in Washington over the years. For a price these  seek to influence policy-makers, legislators and the media in  favour of their clients. In the case of the Indian Embassy, the  price is half a million dollars a year.    This could well represent a sum equal to or greater than the  total salary bill of the embassy officials and staff, but that  is not the reason for the sense of unease here.    The real reasons are possibly two: doubts about what  lobbyists can actually achieve, especially when their goals are  not clearly defined and may possibly even be difficult to lay  down, and an appropriately perceived loss of prestige for the  doubtlessly competitive Indian Foreign Service whose officers do  not make less effective diplomats than the equivalent service of  any other country, no matter how powerful or well-versed in the  politics among nations.    India slipping in its own eyes?: It is perhaps for  these very reasons that the idea of hiring lobbyists had been  shot down before by the Government, and constitutes a  controversial decision today. The idea did not take off even in  the Eighties when Pakistan was playing havoc with the Indian  image on both Punjab and Kashmir in the United States through  its own hired lobbying firm. Ironically, the "pro-lobbyists"  have won when only half that problem remains in the sense that  the Punjab militancy is seen as being no longer a day-to-day  nightmare. It needs to be noted that big, strong or influential  nations do not have a record of hiring lobbyists in Washington.  In that sense, going for one now may reflect India slipping in  its own eyes.    Some of the P-4, i.e., the former USSR or now Russia,  Britain, France and China (excluding for this discussion the  United States among the Permanent Members of the Security  Council, as lobbying is resorted to for a favourable impact  inside America) are known to have used the services of lobbyists  for specific, single assignments but never on a sustained basis  with an omnibus brief, as appears to be the case with the hiring  of the firm of Mcauliffe, Kelly and Rafaeilli by India.    Indeed, lobbying can achieve little if it is not in tandem  with the broad perceptions of U.S. policy. It would no doubt be  accepted even by the lobbyists for Pakistan, for instance, that  they could not get their client off the hook on Pressler, even  though Pakistan has had the ear of the U.S. establishment for  four decades as a close associate in the ideological conflict  against the former Soviet Union and was a certified "frontline  State" while the war in Afghanistan lasted.    It is difficult to imagine, for instance, that even the most  impressive lobbying effort could sell the case for Iraq, Libya,  Cuba or North Korea in Washington, or, for that matter, Moscow,  in its earlier incarnation.    In India's own case, shortly after independence when New  Delhi was yet to be regarded as a "Soviet ally" by Washington,  nothing that the powerful world personality of Nehru projected  could persuade the United States to back the development of the  public sector in this country, though both nations saw each  other as civilised democracies. It is doubtful if lobbyists  would have succeeded where Nehru had failed.    It would not be unfair to the American lobbyists to suggest  that their most notable successes lie on the domestic agenda.  Lobby firms make it a practice of donating funds to election  campaigns of politicians, and this is a key strength in their  dealings on Capital Hill.    Lobbyists (against India) also do well when constituencies  of  politicians include Khalistanis, PoK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir]  expatriates, or Pakistanis in useful numbers. But in the final  analysis they work out best for an overseas client when American  policy goals converge with the brief a lobbyist is handed.    It is not clear what brief India expects its lobbyist in  Washington to handle. Is it the economy and the flow of private  foreign capital and business?    Boot on other leg: The boot is on the other leg,  really. Were the Americans themselves not lobbying India hard at  the highest level for decades for a change in its economic  structure so that U.S. business interest could be attracted? And  when this did begin to happen, did American business not show a  keen interest? That was well before a lobbyist was retained.    Can India realistically look to a lobbyist to get it past  the  U.S. establishment on NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], or the  Kashmir question, or human rights, especially when these are  centre-stage for policy-framers in Washington? Unfortunately,  these cannot be achieved through hired retainers, but through  national will, and skilful and augmented diplomacy. China  presents a striking example of this.    Recent visitors from the United States have suggested that  the American executive and the legislature are crowded with men  and women who have spent time in this country as Peace Corps  volunteers, and a large number of them still see India through  friendly eyes. Has the embassy in Washington, for a start, even  sought to tap a natural reservoir of goodwill such as this,  before rushing into lobbies of the image-building industry?</p>

The polls failed in the southern Sakhalin constituency where  four duma mandates were competed for. Only 18.3 per cent of the  electorate came to the polls there.    However, the local duma with its 12 members has a quorum  which enables it to work.    Irkutsk -- 45 per cent of the electorate came to the polls  in  the Irkutsk region in Siberia to elect the governor, local  parliament, heads of administrations, cities and towns, urban  and rural councils.    A vote on the main provisions of the charter of the region  also took place.    Current Governor Yuriy Nozhikov retained his post.    Elections to local parliament were valid in 42 out of 45  constituencies, while the polls to local self-government bodies  were valid in all constituencies.    Novgorod -- Elections to local duma were declared valid in  19  out of 27 constituencies, according to Igor Zlatin, a member of  the vote-counting commission.    An average of 37 per cent of voters came to the polls.    However, elections failed in the regional centre where  turnout was insufficient in all of its eight constituencies.    Eight out of 19 elected members of the new local parliament  are heads of city and district administrations.</p>

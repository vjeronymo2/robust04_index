			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (15): Europe within calling distance - Mobile Telephony IN THE 1980s, mobile telephony was one of the most dynamic service sectors recording explosive growth in the UK and worldwide. But recently its growth has slowed - just as a new generation of digital mobile telephone systems are launched. In Britain, so many customers bought mobile phones in the late 1980s that the two cellular telephone network operators, Cellnet and Vodafone, had to increase capacity to keep pace with the volume of calls. Helped by steady call charges and declining equipment prices Britain has ended up with more than twice as many cellular telephone users as Germany, France or Italy. But after several years of spectacular growth, the UK subscriber base - which is dominated by business customers and small businesses in particular  -grew by just 7 per cent last year to 1.23m, and both UK operators now have excess capacity. This slowdown has come at a critical time for the industry which, as Mr Chris Gent, managing director of Vodafone says, 'is very fast moving and changing.' The cellular system in the UK, in operation since 1985, uses analogue technology, but in future two new digital systems will be also competing for customers in the mobile communications market: The first, called Telepoint, is an economy-style mobile system designed for travelling business customers, but its main drawback is that subscribers cannot receive incoming calls. A second set of new services, which can also receive incoming calls, are based upon GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile), a pan-European digital mobile communications standard. However, these new technologies have got off to a shaky start in the UK. Three of the original four consortia licensed by the government to offer Telepoint services pulled out after sustaining significant losses and ending up with only 5,000 customers between them. Despite this the fourth, Hutchison Telecom, went ahead with the launch of its telepoint service, and a satellite-based paging service, in April. On a Europe-wide basis, however, most interest is focused on GSM which is viewed as the most important advance since the development of cellular phones. It is also changing the way existing European networks operate because many countries are using it to introduce competition for nationalised monopolies. When they are operational the GSM services will make it possible to drive from one end of Europe to the other using the same cellular mobile telephone. Seventeen countries agreed to the GSM standard and set a target of July last year for the launch of a limited initial service. Problems with the technology and other problems have resulted in some delays. However, several operators, including both Cellnet and Vodafone in the UK, have already successfully tested GSM systems. Mr Gent of Vodafone says the setting of original target was always 'a bit tongue-in-cheek,' but has, nevertheless, provided an important initial impetus. Indeed, the first of a new range of GSM telephones manufactured by Orbitel Mobile Communications, the Vodafone/Ericsson joint venture equipment manufacturer, received UK approval at the end of last month, ensuring that the first equipment for use on the new systems will be available to customers later this year. Once operational mobile phone users will be able to make and receive calls on any GSM phone in any country covered by the system. Subscribers' details will be recorded on a smart card which will plug into a slot in a GSM phone. Having plugged in the user card the phone will adopt the user's number, and all calls will be billed to the card owner. Because the system is digital, it should provide secure high quality voice and data transmission and enable system operators to offer additional features such as call hold, call transfer and messaging services. The GSM systems in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Benelux countries should become operational later this year, and Vodafone which launched its network in December, says it plans to have 90 per cent of its system in place by the middle of 1993. Cellnet, which is owned by BT and Securicor, has been also testing its GSM network and is planning to launch the service commercially next year. But, in spite of its imminent availability, it is unlikely GSM services will replace the older analogue systems, at least not in the short term. GSM phones will initially be more expensive than existing analogue cellphones and will also be much bigger, and heavier. Many mobile phone users are expected to remain on the analogue system and Mr Gent believes there will be a slow migration to GSM. However, the GSM system operators, who are investing very heavily in digital infrastructure, are hoping for a quicker take-up of the other mass market digital services which they will also be able to provide. For example, Vodafone plans to launch a second service on the back of GSM called the Micro-Cellular Network, or MCN, which will be a low-cost urban-based portable telephone service aimed at domestic customers and is due to be launched in the south east of England in mid 1993. MCN call charges are expected to be cheap, from only 10 pence a minute within a user's home town, to 20 pence a minute for national calls putting the service in direct competition with fixed telephone networks. MCN subscribers who travel will also be able to access the nationwide and pan-European GSM service, but at premium rates. Mr Gent belives MCN and similar services will make mobile telephony available to many more people. He admits that MCN is being launched in part as a response to the competition for the domestic market expected from other new digital systems called Personal Communications Networks. In 1989, when the UK government asked companies to apply for PCN licences, companies rushed to compete, buoyed by predictions of 10m customers by the end of the decade, and the belief subscribers would swap their ordinary phones for PCN's pocket-sized personal handsets. But since then the UK economy has plunged into deep recession and the need for heavy investment has frightened many of the original shareholders,leading to delays in starting the new services. Two of the original three consortiums awarded PCN licences, Mercury Personal Communications and Unitel, recently agreed to merge, while the third, Microtel, was sold to Hutchison Telecom. PCNs will use pocket-sized high frequency radio phones over short distances to link users to traditional telephone exchanges via a system of relay stations. Their proponents argue that PCN has a number of advantages over GSM, including smaller phones, and a greater network capacity because cells are smaller, and so the same frequency spectrum can carry a greater volume of calls. These new digital services, together with the advanced satellite paging systems, promise a second revolution in business mobile telecommunications. But although GSM will be a European-wide system, the dream of being able to use a phone anywhere in the world is still some way off. Although Australia, New Zealand, and some Middle Eastern and African countries have shown interest in GSM, Japan and the US have chosen different standards. A truly worldwide mobile telephone system may have to wait for a third generation of systems, the long-awaited universal mobile telephone system, or UMTS, which could be introduced by 2000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 1 KYODO -- About 3.7 million workers  took part in annual May Day events Sunday [1 May] in 1,200  locations nationwide to demand better working conditions and  more jobs.    As in past years, labor unions affiliated with the Japanese  trade union confederation (Rengo) and anti-Rengo union forces  held separate gatherings.    At Yoyogi Park, near the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo,  about 250,000 people attended a rally sponsored by Rengo,  Japan's largest labor group.    Besides Rengo leader Akira Yamagishi, coalition government  leaders and Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama,  whose party last week seceded from the government, were present  at the gathering.    Yamagishi called for more solidarity among the 8  million-strong Rengo workers to protect their organizations in  dealing with complex political situations resulting from the  first minority government since 1955.    From the coalition government, Labor Minister Kunio  Hatoyama,  director general of the Management and Coordination Agency  Koshiro Ishida, who is also Komeito [Clean Government Party]  chairman, delivered May Day addresses at the rally.    Rengo had planned to invite Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata as  the head of the new government launched on April 28 but gave up  the plan because the SDP now became an opposition by leaving the  regime.    In Kameido Chuo Park in Tokyo, members of unions in the  National Confederation of Trade Unions, which has close links  with the Japanese Communist Party, held a separate rally.</p>

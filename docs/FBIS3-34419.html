			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] The fifth joint session of the foreign ministers of  Iran, Turkey, and Syria has opened in Istanbul, Turkey. The  session is being held to examine the issues of north Iraq,  specially the events stemming from the recent Turkish air raids  against the region and losses inflicted in these attacks on the  border areas of Iran.    Besides the aforesaid cases, the three foreign ministers  attending the session will also follow up the manner of  enforcement of the memorandums of understanding and agreements  reached at the last session held in Tehran. At the current  session various issues including Bosnia-Herzegovina and  terrorism in the region have been discussed. However reports  say that the main subject of discussion relates to the  negotiations among the parties concerned over the events of  north Iraq and their impact in regional states.    Special attention of Iran, Turkey and Syria to the issues of  Iraq, and their importance for each of these three states, or  the outcome of the [words indistinct] occurrence in north Iraq  can have impacts directly or indirectly in the neighboring  countries.    Such impacts have an unbreakable link with the national  security of Turkey, Syria and Iran.    While at the fourth session of these three countries'  foreign  ministers held in Tehran in June 1993, there was expressed  concern over these adverse impacts within the framework of  diplomatic wordings in the final communique, this concern has  now emerged openly with the attack of Turkish war planes on  Iran's border areas.    However the question is asked too: What factors undermine  the  security stressed by these three states at numerous sessions  held by their foreign ministers in Tehran, Damascus, and Ankara?    Response to this question is evident in options for [words  indistinct] and accessible even though faced with certain  difficulties. The fact of the matter is that deployment of  multinational forces on the soil and some territorial water of  some regional states is one of the reasons behind eruption of  such unrest once in a while. These are the troops which enter  into action with the intention of backing the Kurds in north  Iraq but bring suffering to them and to their pains by the way  of their intelligence umbrella and their logistical support to  military operations against the people of this region.    At any rate it is hoped that by virtue of the identity of  views among Iran, Syria and Turkey over preserving the  territorial integrity of Iraq, current session of their foreign  ministers in Istanbul will think about the negative impacts  caused by Iraq's internal situation and find a solution to the  problems which are rooted outside the region.    This measure should be assessed not from the viewpoint of  intervention in Iraq's affairs but in terms of the desire and  commitment of Iran, Syria, and Turkey to bolster and stabilize  regional security.</p>

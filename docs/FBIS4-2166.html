			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Xu Hong (1776 3126) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 6 April (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- In an  interview with a correspondent of this news agency, Wu Yi,  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, pointed out  today that properly solving the issue of most-favored-nation  [MFN] status is a key premise for developing Sino-U.S. trade and  economic cooperation. China hopes that bilateral trade and  economic cooperation can cast off the shadow of the MFN status  issue and achieve greater development.    The female minister, who will shortly head a delegation to  the United States, said that MFN status is only a trade issue  and trade should not be linked with other unrelated issues.    Wu Yi believes that the revocation of China's MFN status  would work against the interests of all parties concerned.  China would suffer certain damage, but the United States would  also be hurt, and the extent of this, moreover, would not be  smaller than for China.    According to data released by a relevant international  organization, if China's MFN status is revoked, about 200,000  people in the United States would lose their jobs; many American  firms specializing in trade with China, especially small and  medium-sized firms, would likely be closed down, and American  consumers would spend $18 billion more each year buying  substitutes for Chinese products.    Wu Yi said: In this way, the United States would lose China,  a market with enormous potential. Middlemen in Hong Kong and  foreign- invested firms engaged in the processing industry in  China, including U.S.-invested firms, would be hit.    The female minister believes that the Chinese and U.S.  governments should rise above the MFN issue and should pay more  attention to common economic benefits.    She said: China's economy is developing in a sustained,  rapid, and healthy manner, and the market is continuously  expanding. In the next seven years, China's total import value  will reach $1,000 billion [figure as received]. Transport,  telecommunications, and energy -- all of them key development  sectors in China -- are precisely where the strengths of the  United States lie. U.S. economic sectors are facing a historic  opportunity for developing trade and economic cooperation with  China.</p>

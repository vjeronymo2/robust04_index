			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that the following conditions may be imposed in any SEC order granting the requested relief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Each class of shares of a Portfolio will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of a Portfolio will relate solely to one or more of the following: (a) the method of financing certain class expenses, which are limited to any or all of the following: (i) transfer agent fees identified by applicants as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) SEC and/or Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (v) directors' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; and (vi) accounting expenses relating to one class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a shareholder services plan and/or 12b&hyph;1 plan (whether an administrative 12b&hyph;1 plan or a distribution and service plan or both) with respect to such class; (c) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to the Fund's shareholder services plan and/or any 12b&hyph;1 plan (except as set forth in condition 16 below); (d) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (e) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund; and (f) the fact that certain classes will have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated unless and until approved by the SEC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The directors of the Fund, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the offering of additional classes of new shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the directors' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interest of both the Fund and its shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors. Any persons authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Distributor and the Adviser will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Distributor and the Adviser, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Fund to agree to conform to such standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the shareholder services plans and any 12b&hyph;1 plans and the related service agreements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Dividends paid by the Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount per outstanding share, except that administrative or service payments made by a class under a plan and any class expenses will be borne exclusively by that class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to the applicants that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations would be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to section 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, and Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' and ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distribution of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 9 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective action if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The prospectuses of each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors with respect to the Multi-Class Systems will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the directors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

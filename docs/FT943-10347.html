			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Factory orders and jobless data lift hopes for German recovery A rise in manufacturing orders and a sharp fall in unemployment yesterday reinforced the belief that a broad-based recovery is under way in west Germany. There were also signs that the erosion of jobs in the east was coming to a halt, according to Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the Federal Labour Office. Seasonally adjusted for the effects of the summer lull, west German unemployment fell 18,000. This was the second successive monthly decline after 2 1/2 years of increases, and the biggest drop since the early spring of 1991. June data showed an adjusted fall of 4,000. Provisional figures for manufacturing orders in west Germany were also better than expected, showing a fully adjusted 2.2 per cent rise in volume in June over May, and an 8.5 per cent increase against June 1993. The latest economic statistics coincided with an upward revision in the economic growth forecast of the Munich-based Ifo institute. Thanks to the steady recovery in demand, it is expecting pan-German growth of 2 per cent this year, against a former figure of 1.5 per cent, and 3 per cent in 1995. Although the number of people out of work in the west rose an unadjusted 92,600, this partly reflects school-leavers joining the labour market. Another hopeful sign was a 34 per cent rise in the number of vacancies in manufacturing industry in the west. In east Germany, the unadjusted jobless figure rose by 19,000. The pan-German unadjusted jobless total of 3.7m pushed the unemployment rate from 8 per cent to 8.3 per cent in the west and from 14.8 per cent to 15.1 per cent in the east. Economic analysts agreed with Mr Jagoda that the figures indicated stabilisation in the labour market after three years of heavy job losses. They were also encouraged by the better than expected manufacturing orders. Ifo stressed that although export orders had started the recovery process, steadily improving business expectations had also contributed to a clear recovery in investment spending. Ifo also said real disposable incomes would continue to be squeezed in west Germany - forecasting a real decline of 2.5 per cent this year and 3.5 next. Even in east Germany, where wages have rapidly been approaching western levels, a 0.5 per cent drop was expected next year, it said. Government bonds, Page 20</p>

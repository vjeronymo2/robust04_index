			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAMSTOWN SEEMS PICTURE PERFECT  </P> <P> Robert Sterling Clark was a dashing exemplar of the adage that living well is  the best revenge.  </P> <P> An heir to the Singer sewing machine fortune, Clark bred and raced horses,  roamed the globe and had an educated taste for Kentucky bourbon and French  cuisine. He also had a passion for art.  </P> <P> For nearly half a century -- he died in 1956 -- Clark and his wife, Francine,  assembled one of the most dazzling collections ever held in private hands.  </P> <P> Especially rich in works by the 19th-Century French impressionists, it includes  more than 30 Renoirs and dozens of lapidary paintings by Pissarro, Monet and  Degas. American artists Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent and Frederic  Remington are also represented, along with the European masters Hans Memling,  Jacob van Ruisdael and Frans Hals.  </P> <P> This beauty of a collection is on view in the small Massachusetts college  community of Williamstown. Taken together with Williams College's considerable  holdings of ancient and modern art, it makes of its bucolic setting an  improbable world center of artistic delights.  </P> <P> Clark chose Williamstown as the repository for his beloved collection because  of its remote site in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts. Cities, he  decided, were too risky in a nuclear age.  </P> <P> To house his treasures he built a white marble temple in a spacious park. It  opened in 1955. In 1973 a red granite annex was tacked on for expanded study  and exhibition space.  </P> <P> The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute is not for devotees of abstract  modernism. Clark bought solely for his own pleasure; what he liked did not  include Picasso or Henry Moore.  </P> <P> Instead, the galleries glow with a romantic vision of sweeping seascapes and  landscapes, tenderly portrayed nudes and the teeming vitality and gossipy  details of everyday life in centuries past.  </P> <P> Visitors enter through the annex. Two galleries dominate the ground floor. The  larger is devoted to American art of the 19th Century.  </P> <P> There, for example, you can savor Homer's "Summer Squall": waves climbing a  ridge of froth, a small boat tossed on a green sea. A few steps away,  Remington's haunting "Scout" depicts a mounted Indian straining forward on a  moonlit snow plain for a glimpse of distant campfires.  </P> <P> In the gallery opposite, Adolph-William Bouguereau's 1873 oil of four comely  nymphs teasing a muscular satyr fills an entire wall. The painting was a  favorite of Clark's.  </P> <P> An enclosed bridge leads from the annex to the main building. The original  galleries flow in a square around an enclosed court.  </P> <P> Begin in the southwest corner with the misty landscapes of  Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, then work your way east to the Paris street scenes  of Eugene Boudin. There is a Van Gogh or two, the ravishing dancers that  celebrated Degas' lifelong love affair with the ballet, and a fugue of pink  blossoms by Monet.  </P> <P> But the stars of the show grace the interior court. These are the paintings of  Pierre Auguste Renoir, one of impressionism's leading theorists from the 1870s  until his death in 1919.  </P> <P> Renoir had only one subject, sun-drenched color: the warm flesh tones of sturdy  farm women and the rich blues, reds and greens of the seaside and countryside.  </P> <P> No connoisseur will want to miss "His Girl Crocheting" (1875), with its golden  hair and red earring complementing a blush of lip rouge.  </P> <P> Close by, the famous 1881 "Onions" stands out as an exercise in pure design.  The pink and lavender skins of the rounded tubers are as lushly portrayed as  one of the artist's adored nudes.  </P> <P> The institute, on South Street half a mile south of Main Street, is open  Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission free. For more  information, call (413) 458-9545.  </P> <P> As campus art galleries go, the one at nearby Williams College also is a rare  gem: well-lit, a place for leisurely browsing. Nineteenth- and 20th-Century  American paintings are its strengths -- oils and watercolors by Winslow Homer,  George Inness, Thomas Eakins, Lyonel Feininger, Philip Pearlstein, Larry  Rivers, Edward Hopper.  </P> <P> The Williams College Museum of Art began life as the school's first library in  1846. It became an art museum in 1926 and expanded steadily through the 1930s.  </P> <P> In 1986 the brick-faced edifice was completely renovated and enlarged once  again with the addition of light, airy second-floor galleries springing from  the building's centerpiece, the original columned rotunda.  </P> <P> The new galleries -- bright pine flooring, blue and dove-gray walls -- focus on  permanent holdings of 60 or so panels and canvases by the avant-garde  Prendergast brothers.  </P> <P> Maurice (1858-1924), a disciple of Cezanne and Matisse, worked in flowing,  semi-abstract oils and watercolors.  </P> <P> Charles (1863-1948) was a primitivist whose tiles and wood carvings were  inspired by ancient craft traditions.  </P> <P> The ground-floor main gallery centers on the more familiar luminaries of  American art. A splendid selection of 19th- and 20th-Century masterpieces  includes Childe Hassam's atmospheric "Rainy Day, Boston" (1886) and a  turn-of-the-century seascape by Robert Henri.  </P> <P> An adjoining gallery displays works by American and European modernists. There  is, for example, Hopper's starkly realistic "Morning in the City," Pearlstein's  massive nudes, a surreal design by Yves Tanguy and Andy Warhol's celebrated  pop-art composition of Marilyn Monroe.  </P> <P> The museum, known locally as Lawrence Hall, is on Main Street just east of  Spring. It's open Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday, 1 to 5  p.m. Admission is free. For more information, call (413) 597-2429.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Except for an enclave of shops and restaurants and a clutch of outlying  hostelries, Williams College is Williamstown. With its broad leafy avenues and  appealing array of Georgian and Greek Revival buildings, the sprawling campus  is a perfect place for a morning or afternoon stroll.  </P> <P> Williamstown also is a convenient base for Berkshire fall foliage tours and  outings to nearby Lenox, summer headquarters of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  For ticket information, call (617) 266-1492.  </P> <P> Standout for comfort and ambience is The Orchards, a Berkshire version of an  English country inn, with 49 cozy rooms and afternoon tea served in an  impeccably appointed drawing room. Address: 419 Main St., Williamstown, Mass.  01267. Prices: $135 to $170 double. For reservations, call toll-free (800)  225-1517.  </P> <P> The nearby Williams Inn (The Green, Williamstown, Mass. 01267; $95 double;  (413) 458-9371) is a modern, Colonial-style establishment with 100 guest rooms.  </P> <P> For cuisine centering on such seasonal specialties as quail, salmon and  venison, The Orchards, again, is the best bet. About $70 for dinner for two  with wine. At the River House (123 Water St.) the emphasis is on hearty  chowders and steaks. Dinner for two is about $40 with wine.  </P> <P> Specifics about hotels, restaurants and touring in and around Williamstown are  available from the Williamstown Board of Trade, Cold Spring Road, Williamstown,  Mass. 01267, (413) 485-9077, or the Berkshire Visitors Bureau, Berkshire  Common, Pittsfield, Mass. 01201, (413) 443-9186.  </P> <P> For other information on Massachusetts, contact the Department of Commerce and  Development, Division of Tourism, 100 Cambridge St., 13th Floor, Boston 02202,  (617) 727-3201.  </P></p>

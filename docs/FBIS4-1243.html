			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] official Vusimuzi Zwane told SAPA a "massive car  bomb" had exploded just half a block from the PAC regional  offices. Mr Zwane said the building, which he could not  identify, was "blown to bits". There was a fire raging and water  pouring from it. Police had cordoned off the area, he said.  "It's hell out here." Earlier people had jumped from the  building, he said. Mr Zwane said he personally had moved three  bodies and saw another two which seemed to be dead. "I think  the blast was aimed at us," he said.    This seemed to contradict earlier reports that the blast was  outside the African National Congress' PWV regional offices at  Lancet House. The ANC are in Jeppe Street, but the blast was in  Bree Street, he said.</p>

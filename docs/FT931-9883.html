			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley pledge on benefits THE GOVERNMENT'S manifesto pledges to uprate child benefit and the basic retirement pension in line with inflation for the lifetime of the present parliament would not be affected by its recently announced long-term public spending review, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told MPs last night. The government had 'no intention of reneging on' these promises, he said. 'Our manifesto was explicit: we believe the basic pension must remain the foundation for retirement . . . likewise, we are committed to child benefit.' Mr Lilley also set the benefits agency and councils a combined target for the year ahead of identifying and stopping Pounds 1bn of fraud across the full range of benefits. It was, he said, 'essential to staunch the flow of money to those whom parliament did not intend to receive it'. Confirming that the government was uprating all main benefits in line with inflation, the social security secretary said he had been 'mindful particularly' of those hit by the recession. Mr Lilley said two main principles underlaid the long-term review in the context of social security, the government's biggest-spending department. These were to focus improvements in benefits to those in greatest need and to harness private provision wherever possible.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Old Lady who took a long time to act - Robert Peston looks at the downfall of David Backhouse IF ANYTHING remains of the City of London's clubbiness, Mr David Backhouse was until last week a comfortable member of the club. For generations there have been Backhouses in the City and he made a modest name for himself as managing director in the seventies and early eighties of Dunbar Group, the financial services concern now owned by Allied Dunbar. He also has close links to Cazenove, the leading stockbroking firm. Mr Backhouse was shattered therefore last week when the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England, blackballed him. The Bank put pressure on Mr Backhouse to resign the chairmanship of Henderson Administration, an old established fund management group. Two weeks before, he had stepped down from the board of TSB, the banking group. Mr Backhouse and the Bank are constrained from discussing his departure by the secrecy provisions of the Banking Act. But Mr Backhouse's colleagues say that the Bank became concerned about his stewardship in the mid 1980s of Authority Bank, a small bank. At the end of 1990 Authority, which operated from one branch in London's Sloane Street, went into administration under UK insolvency procedures. Mr Backhouse had resigned from the group several months earlier, but from August 1986 he had been chairman of Authority Bank's parent company, Authority Investments, which is also in administration. At the time Authority Bank went into administration it had assets of around Pounds 48m. These included just over Pounds 20m in deposits with commercial banks and the Bank of England together with loans to customers of Pounds 28m, according to Mr David Bowen, one of the administrators from the accountancy firm Pannell Kerr Forster. The bulk of its loans had been made to small property companies and individual property developers. Mr Bowen said the loan book was 'not particularly bad' but it was concentrated on just one sector. When the property market went into recession Authority Bank's customers had difficulty meeting their interest payments. Authority Bank had a particularly large exposure to one customer, a property and leasing company called Maingreen. A statement sent to Authority's creditors shows the loan to Maingreen at Pounds 6.57m, which is an unusually large loan to a single customer for a bank of Authority's size. However, that figure is Authority's net exposure to Maingreen after deducting provisions the bank had made against losses on the loan. The gross exposure was far bigger. On April 25 1991, Maingreen went into voluntary liquidation. Its estimated statement of affairs lists Authority Bank as being owed Pounds 74.4m under a guarantee. The statement also says that Authority is unlikely to receive a penny of this. The Bank of England had been keen in the 1980s for Authority to reduce its exposure to Maingreen. But the original exposure was acquired long before Mr Backhouse arrived at Authority. It dated from before the property slump of the early 1970s. Mr Backhouse is probably acutely aware of the paradox that he has been haunted by a loan to a property company which went bad in the early 1970s, which was when he was making his reputation by sailing comfortably through that recession at Dunbar. None of his friends say that he is proud of Authority Bank's poor performance. The bank's depositors, many of whom are foreign, have so far received 67.75p for each pound of their deposits and are unlikely to receive more than 75p in total when the administration process is complete. However, Mr Backhouse's former colleagues at Authority say that the Bank was fully aware of Authority's loan book both before and after it went into administration. As one of them said yesterday: 'It was all so long ago. I can't think why the Bank of England took so long to act'.</p>

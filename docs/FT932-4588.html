			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Denmark hopes for initialling of EC-Russia deal at summit Denmark, which holds the presidency of the EC, hoped an EC-Russia deal could be initialled at the Copenhagen summit in two weeks and is finalising arrangements for the visit of Mr Yeltsin, which should begin on June 19, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. But the Commission believes it would be unwise to rush into an agreement for political reasons before important problems of substance have been resolved. EC foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg today, will have to decide whether enough progress has been made to issue a political declaration of EC-Russian solidarity at Copenhagen, and make Mr Yeltsin's trip worthwhile.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: FIRST THINGS FIRST: LEADING LADIES' MATINEE FOR DONORS  </P> <P> Los Angeles is a fountain of youth with all kinds of new firsts on the social  scene.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's First Chair Society entertained at its  first Leading Ladies' Matinee on Wednesday morning. Said co-president Jennifer  Diener: "In Salzburg, they have matinees in the morning. I thought it would be  different." The morning Matinee, planned by Carol Henry, feted the big donors,  and among the Ladies were Susie Barker, Peggy Parker, Rosalind Millstone,  Barbara Reilly, Debbie Tellefsen, Judith Rosen, Kay Duke Ingalls, Dorothy Woods  and Jane Arnault.  </P> <P> Then, at a sit-down at the Hilton, Jack and Elaine Lerman, Marty and Marjorie  Roth, Dr. Stan and Jackie Furer, and Hal and Cynthia Gershman decided to form a  new charitable foundation -- Associates for Breast Cancer Studies. They've  pledged 75% of all monies raised to the John Wayne Cancer Clinic. The Furers  have donated their guest house for an office, the Gershmans provided phones and  office equipment, the Lermans a computer, the Marty Greenbergs a 3-M Copier,  and the Norman Ripps gave office supplies. They plan a membership affair Dec.  21 at Jimmy's.  </P> <P> And those spectacular examples of eternal youth -- Bob Hope and Dick Clark --  celebrate inauguration of the National Parkinson Foundation California Research  Laboratories at USC's Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center on Wednesday.  </P> <P> AMERICANA: Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee and the  honoree at the Americana Associates' Americana Ball, couldn't resist. He picked  up a guitar and sang with Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham's Sweet Baby Blues Band at  the Regent Beverly Wilshire the other evening.  </P> <P> That's the black-tie affair Lydia Webb chaired to raise funds for Project  Americana of the Fine Arts Committee at the State Department. In the spotlight  were former Ambassador to Australia William (Bill)Lane, Ginie and Henry Braun,  Glen and Gloria Holden, Chuck and Diane Norris, Roy and Pauline Naftzger and  Lydia's daughter Mary Ann Hunt (one of the Texas Hunts) and her escort, Andrew  Reisini of New York.  </P> <P> Now Lydia and her husband, Dr. Roscoe C. Webb Jr., will attend Canadian Consul  Gen. Joan Winser's welcoming reception Wednesday at the Canadian residence for  Canada's prime minister, the Rt. Hon. Brian Mulroney and Mrs. Mulroney, and  then they and Mary Beth and Robert Van Dine are off to Washington, invited for  dinner with President George and Barbara Bush on Thursday and luncheon at the  home of Vice president Dan and Marilyn Quayle on Friday.  </P> <P> ENCORE: The American Horse Show Assn.'s New York tradition -- Champagne at  Cartier -- was brought to Cartier on Rodeo Drive last year with such success  that it was a repeat the other evening with Marion Scharffenberger and Mrs.  Allan M. Cartter co-chairing the reception to raise funds for young rider  programs of the National Equestrian Federation of the United States.  </P> <P> Joining in was honorary chair Stefanie Powers (who had just returned from the  Polish Arabian national sales). More there to support future Olympic efforts  were Bettina Bancroft Klink and her daughter Elisabeth Goth Clark, Montgomery  and Jo Fisher, Robin Parsky, jockey Chris and Judy McCarron, Chris Shoemaker  and Olympic rider Lisa Jacquin. Flying in for the party were the association  president, James C. Wofford, and his wife, Gail, of Uppervillle, Va., and Jane  Forbes Clark of New York.  </P> <P> THE TOPS: Alison and Joseph Winter host an intimate reception for Count and  Countess Giuseppe Panza di Biumo (foremost private collectors of post-World War  II American Art) on Oct. 18 at their Pasadena home. . . .  </P> <P> Jenny Rutt and her co-chair, Mary Milner, are raving about the combined glamour  of Bob Mackie (he just costumed for the San Francis Opera), Neiman Marcus and  Luminaires Juniors for their extravaganza to benefit Estelle Doheny Eye Clinic  Nov. 30 at the Beverly Hills Hotel. . . .  </P> <P> Marilyn McCoo will dazzle for Northridge Hospital Foundation's elegant  black-tie night Oct. 20 at the Beverly Hilton. . . .  </P> <P> Roy Anderson heads the Center for Excellence (originally the Admiral H. R.  Rickover Foundation) dinner Tuesday at Century Plaza Towers, giving Gayle  Wilson (wife of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson) its Excellence in Education Award. . . .  </P> <P> Longtime supporter Roberta Rinehart chairs the Olive Crest benefit Friday at  Long Beach Petroleum Club to aid abused children.  </P> <P> 50TH: "Viva VNA" means "50 and forward" for the Visiting Nurse Assn.'s 50th  anniversary tribute Wednesday at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Phyllis Diller  will make it fun as Betsy Palmer gets the caring and compassion award, Don  Mullane the corporate-caring accolade and Roger Barkley a Silver Apple.  </P> <P> KUDOS: To Simon Ramo, saluted with the fourth Vision Award at a dinner-dance  hosted at the Regent Beverly Wilshire by the Doheny Eye Institute. . . .  </P> <P> To Jane Wyatt, for the Valley Knudsen Award Friday at the Los Angeles Beautiful  awards lunch at Los Angeles Hilton. . . .  </P> <P> To Claremont McKenna College's President Jack and Jil Stark, hosting dinner in  Claremont to celebrate the Leaders in the Making Campaign. . . .  </P> <P> To Val Toms, chairing the Music Center Opera League garden supper for 300. . .  .  </P> <P> To Mr. and Mrs. Cary S. Brokaw, donating their Cliff May home for the Westside  Guild of Childrens Hospital kick-off of the guild's holiday boutique this past  week chaired by Deborah Brown. . . .  </P> <P> To Mrs. Lee Youngren, chairing the 75th anniversary luncheon of the South Bay  Auxiliary of Childrens Hospital at the Palos Verdes Country Club.  </P></p>

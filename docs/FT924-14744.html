			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water The 3 per cent fall in Anglian Water's shares yesterday was inevitable given Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez's decision to sell its stake. Less clear is why the sector as a whole reacted badly. True, Pounds 110m institutional cash was required to soak up the shares - money which may have been diverted from elsewhere in the sector. More worrying is the sight of a well-informed investor selling out at what, presumably, it perceives to be an opportune moment. The timing is doubly curious as the stake was worth more to the vendor before sterling was suspended from the ERM. But perhaps Lyonnaise has reasons of its own. It could certainly use the exceptional gain on its investment. The Dumez contracting side - which includes a hefty exposure to the Channel tunnel - will probably struggle again this year. More property provisions are also likely. The poor performance of other listed investments, including minority stakes in Havas, the French media company, and Alfred McAlpine, may have narrowed the list of potential disposals to one. While Anglian loses a useful minority shareholder, this will not jeopardise co-operation with the French at an operational level. Anglian is probably the least expansionist of all the UK water companies, but then the travails of Lyonnaise over the past two years are hardly a glowing advertisement for diversification.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: VNU moves into US magazine market VNU, the Dutch publisher, yesterday unveiled a Dollars 220m deal in the US that will give it control over two 'bibles' of the West Coast entertainment industry, the daily newspaper Hollywood Reporter and Billboard magazine. The Dutch publisher, best-known until now as the largest producer of consumer magazines in the Netherlands and Belgium, will also take over 17 other US trade magazines covering music, media and entertainment. The titles include Adweek, Music &amp; Media, and Backstage. The magazines are all published by BPI Communications, which VNU has agreed to buy from Boston Ventures, the New York Times and BPI's management. The BPI deal will also give VNU several business information databases that will tie in well with its existing US database activities. VNU, which generated only 9 per cent of its turnover in the US in 1992, against 67 per cent in its home market, said the acquisition would give it a broader base from which to pursue further growth in the US. The Dutch company, which is already active in trade magazine publishing in Europe, said: 'The publications are all trade magazines, an area in which we have a lot of experience. However, the subject matter is new for us.' Its existing trade titles in Europe cover fields such as electronics, computers and engineering. VNU said it would pay for BPI, and raise money for future expansion, by issuing 3m new shares during the first quarter, probably in March. The shares, equivalent to 20 per cent of VNU's existing capital base and worth around Fl 530m (Dollars 270m) at yesterday's price, will be placed by a banking consortium led by ABN-Amro and Goldman Sachs. The company said it expected 1994 per-share profit to show a further increase even after the capital expansion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ercan Kanar, president of the Istanbul Human </F> Rights Association, by Dirk C. Fleck; place and date not given:  "Torture Is an Everyday Occurrence in Police Life"]    [Text] [Fleck] Mr. Kanar, is Turkey a state that uses  torture?    [Kanar] Torture is an everyday occurrence in police life.  Torture is used in every interrogation. The problem is only to  prove it. The IHD [Istanbul Human Rights Association] knows of  500 cases that occurred in 1993 in Istanbul alone. These  instances of torture were confirmed by doctors.    [Fleck] How is torture done?    [Kanar] By electrical shocks, hanging, blows to the soles of  one's feet and genitals, treatment with ice water. The clothes  of the prisoners are removed and ice water is poured over the  people. Ice water also makes the swelling from the blows go down.    [Fleck] How many of the tortured prisoners come to you?  What can you do to help?    [Kanar] The people who are tortured are told in prison that  they must fear for their lives if they go to a lawyer. If  someone still has the courage to do so, we inform the  international human rights organizations and try to take the  matter to court. The cases that we know about do not tell  anything about the reality in our prisons. It is extremely  difficult to get a certificate from a doctor, particularly for  people who are detained for political reasons. According to the  law, they may be taken to a doctor only after 15 days. Usually,  they are tortured during the first three days. When the doctor  comes, the wounds have mostly healed. The real rate of torture  in Istanbul is probably something like 5,000 cases a year.    [Fleck] What are the difficulties that you yourself have to  fear?    [Kanar] My colleagues and I are under constant observation,  our offices are searched arbitrarily by police, any step that we  take is watched, our telephones are bugged. Over the past two  years, eight IHD members were killed. Again and again our  lawyers are imprisoned and detained for up to three months --  and that during pending lawsuits.    [Fleck] What will happen to the Kurds, who are waiting for  deportation in Germany, as soon as they return to Turkey?    [Kanar] Kurds, in particular, are in extreme danger in our  country. Any Kurd who is deported from a country of the  European Union ends up in prison first. Anyone who is known to  the police as someone who demonstrated for democracy and human  rights abroad will almost certainly be subjected to heavy  torture. The countries of the European Union know that, but  obviously they are applying a double standard to human rights  issues.</p>

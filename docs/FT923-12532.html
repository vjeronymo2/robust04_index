			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Gains lost after Bundesbank news THE UK stock market reacted with guarded relief yesterday to the increase in German discount rate to a record 8.75 per cent, thankful that the key Lombard rate had been left unchanged and that the UK Treasury had reiterated commitment to sterling's entry into the narrow bands of Europe's exchange rate mechanism in due course. However, UK shares closed lower after abandoning a sharp rise achieved in early trading. Equity strategists see narrow band entry as the best hope for reducing UK base rates before the end of the year. Ahead of the announcement from the Bundesbank, UK equities had risen steadily in moderate trading, climbing 20 points on the Footsie scale to clear the 2,507 mark in a favourable response to the latest data on the domestic economy. Unemployment figures for June, with the seasonally adjusted rise of 7,000 barely one-third of market expectations, were regarded as a sign that the domestic economy is rallying. May's average earnings gain of 6.5 per cent, below City estimates, suggested some easing of inflationary pressure. London equities responded positively as the first news on German rates flashed across the trading screens; and the focus on the discount rate, together with a rise in the sterling/D-Mark rate, soothed fears that UK rates might be forced higher. Share buyers, however, backed off as the foreign exchange markets digested news of higher rates elsewhere in Europe, and equity prices began to retreat. The 20-point gain on the Footsie was replaced by an eight-point loss. However, investor-based selling was moderate and an increased Seaq volume of 525.5m shares represented hasty re-shuffling by marketmakers. On Wednesday, Seaq turnover of 404m shares represented customer business worth Pounds 831m. At least two trading programmes, weighted towards the sell side, were identified yesterday, and there was a drop in the Footsie futures contract before it steadied late in the day. By the close, the FT-SE Index had shown some recovery and the final reading of 2,483.4 left a net loss of three points - no great reaction, in view of London's evident apprehension ahead of the Bundesbank's rate decision. The weakening US dollar restrained most of the overseas earnings stocks, but ICI, a beneficiary of a firm D-Mark, enjoyed a successful trading session. There was a handful of casualties in the building sector, where several UK companies have extensive exposure in Germany. Across the broader range, London share prices were content to follow the modest downward move in other European bourses. Mr Ian Harnett, strategist at Strauss Turnbull, the London securities arm of Societe Generale, said the outcome of the Bundesbank's deliberations was 'positive for London'. Strauss is holding its year-end forecast for the FT-SE Index at 2,800. However, London strategists still see the economy vulnerable to a rise in base rates until at least the end of the year, with economic recovery evidently arriving even more slowly than expected.</p>

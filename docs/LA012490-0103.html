			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: '80S 49ERS, '70S STEELERS COMPARE -- OFFENSIVELY  </P> <P> Many NFL observers are saying that the San Francisco 49ers of the '80s might be  the best football dynasty ever. Their competition is the Pittsburgh Steelers of  the '70s.  </P> <P> How do the teams compare? Former Steeler Steve Furness, an assistant coach  under former Steeler defensive coordinator George Perles at Michigan State,  told Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press:  </P> <P> "Offensively, they have a lot of similarities to us. They have a great  quarterback, we had a great quarterback. They have outstanding wide receivers,  and we had outstanding wide receivers. The running backs shared some  similarities.  </P> <P> "But defensively, I don't think there is a great comparison between us and the  49ers. Their offense is so powerful the defense doesn't have to play  traditional defense. (Joe) Montana takes them on a 12-play, 70-yard drive and  they score.  </P> <P> "They never have to hold the team time after time. Their offense is so powerful  it's ahead, 7-0, 14-0, 21-7. That's the question I have in my mind. They have  never been on the field where they had to hold the team repeatedly. We did  that."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What was the first Super Bowl called?  </P> <P> No comparison: Nose tackle Fred Smerlas and his Buffalo Bill teammates played  against both the 49ers and Broncos this season. Smerlas said: "When we played  Denver, we came out flat as a pancake and we still almost beat them. When we  played San Francisco, our defense was flying all over the place and playing  great and they still beat us without Joe Montana.  </P> <P> "Montana makes it all work. He has the greatest vision of any quarterback. He's  like Larry Bird looking for an open man. Montana can read and deliver better  than anyone I've ever played against, and I've played against some great ones:  (Terry) Bradshaw, (Dan) Marino, (Bob) Griese."  </P> <P> Bands of gold: If the 49ers win the Super Bowl, Montana, Bradshaw and former  Raider quarterback Kenny Stabler will have nine Super Bowl rings and nine  marriages among them. With a victory, Montana would tie Bradshaw with three  marriages and four rings. Bronco quarterback Elway has no Super Bowl rings and  one marriage.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The AFL-NFL World Championship Game.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Bronco safety Dennis Smith: "I'm hell when I'm well."

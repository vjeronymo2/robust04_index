			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Leading Article: How to escape a trade war that nations and governments have never learned anything from history'. To this his pupil, Karl Marx, added that history reappeared 'the first time as tragedy, the second as farce'. Marx looks right, for a change. The world economic malaise may soon be aggravated by a 'trade war' between the European Community and the US over less than 2m tonnes of oilseeds. This farce must be stopped. Immediate responsibility for doing so rests with the EC. Allegations of interference by the president of the Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, in the work of Mr Ray MacSharry as farm trade negotiator - a position he himself had arguably usurped from Mr Frans Andriessen, the commissioner for external affairs - are just symptoms of the malaise. The disease is confusion over the role of the EC in the world. Mr Delors has argued that 'adolescent Europe' should be able to say no to its American big brother. So it should. The question is over what. Can the EC wish to make its refusal to accept two adverse Gatt panel findings on its oilseeds regime the principle on which, like Martin Luther, it must take its stand, because it can do no other? What needs to be recognised now is, first, that the oilseeds dispute and the Uruguay Round, though connected, are at least juridically separate; second, that the credibility of the Gatt dispute settlement process is under test; and, finally, that the underlying Gatt principle of reciprocity does allow the US to withdraw concessions from the EC. This withdrawal can be up to the value of the losses imposed by the EC oilseed regime, which Gatt panels judge to have unfairly damaged the interests of the EC's trading partners. Counter-retaliation by the EC would be a different matter. It would take the dispute into uncharted territory. The EC should, instead, accept the American proposal for binding arbitration on the size of the losses imposed by its oilseeds regime. It should also agree that the US may withdraw concessions equal in value to the losses identified by the arbitrator, if agreement cannot be reached on changes to its oilseeds regime. Such a rebalancing of the account in a protectionist direction would be far from ideal. But the potentially lethal infection from the oilseeds dispute would have been sterilised. With the oilseed dispute contained, the wider question of the Uruguay Round could be tackled once more. Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt's director general, should consider calling the negotiators back to Geneva. This would seem to be particularly timely now that the EC negotiation is back in the hands of a man responsible for trade policy as a whole. It also looks as though the best chance of resolving the outstanding issues in farm trade might be in the context of an overall negotiation. Some in the EC appear not to want the round completed at all, whether for domestic political reasons or because they believe the EC will be strengthened by a confrontation with the US. They play with fire. Neither the political cohesiveness nor the economic strength of the EC would be strengthened by failure of the trade negotiations, particularly if the EC were to be blamed for the collapse. This is looking increasingly like a pivotal moment in the post-cold-war era. An intrinsically trivial dispute over oilseeds could lead to the disintegration of the Uruguay Round and even of the GATT; it could divide the US from the EC; it could create serious friction within the EC; and it could imperil world prosperity. A few hundred million Ecus worth of soyabeans are not worth the risk. Let the epitaph on postwar international economic co-operation not be that for once people did learn from history, but then they forgot.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ole Mathismoen report: ``Norway Cannot Give Much Help to </F> the Kola'']    [Text] Russia cannot afford nuclear safety in the northern  regions. And Norway cannot afford to give very much help.    This was Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal's conclusion  yesterday when he yesterday put before the Storting a report on  nuclear safety and chemical weapons in the regions close to  northern Norway.    The Cold War has been succeeded by major environmental  challenges. In areas very close to Norway there are enormous  temporary dumps of nuclear waste, several dozen abandoned  nuclear submarines, an old and unsafe nuclear power station, and  large quantities of nuclear arms.    ``It goes without saying that Russia has an indepednent  responsibility for safety at nuclear installations and for  solving the problems of waste. But neither Russia nor the other  states of Eastern Europe are able to give this the highest  priority. Such enormous resources are needed to sort all this  out that the only possibility is broad international  cooperation,'' the foreign minister said. He mentioned NATO,  the EU [European Union], the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council as  possible forums for such cooperation.    The foreign minister stressed strongly that Norway can only  be involved in a small way in paying the bill for the biggest  nuclear cleanup operation ever. Hitherto Norway has spent only  36 million kroner in aid for the East. In the past it has been  estimated that it will cost somewhere in the order of $150  billion to clean up the nuclear chaos on the Kola Peninsula.    ``But Norway is assuming a lobbying role to get nuclear  safety in northwestern Russia onto the international agenda,''  Godal said. But who will actually pay the bill, he was asked.  ``Russia and Europe's taxpayers will have to foot the bill,''  he said.    Asked whether Norway has plans for further short-term  assistance for the Kola region in the absence of a larger-scale  international aid operation, he replied: ``We are keeping the  situation under constant observation, but we have no plans for  measures at present. These are sensitive issues on which we  naturally want to work closely with the Russian authorities.''    In the course of last winter there were several minor  accidents at the nuclear power station on the Kola Peninsula,  further nuclear submarines were mothballed, and the situation  regarding several of the temporary waste dumps -- such as the  dump ship Lepse, for example -- deteriorated dramatically. In  the light of this the foreign minister was asked if Finnmark is  today facing a real nuclear threat:    ``The potential dangers are considerable. But the situation  is not acute,'' Bjorn Tore Godal said.    Yesterday the foreign minister was able to announce that the  Russian authorities with the foreign minister at their head have  given permission for a third Norwegian-Russian research  expedition to former nuclear waste dumping sites in the Kara  Sea. Now the way is clear for an expedition to the formerly  forbidden Ambrosimov Bay on Novaya Zemlya where there is reason  to believe that considerable quantities of solid nuclear waste  has been dumped.    The foreign minister's report to the Storting is the first  public document on nuclear safety in the Kola region. Hitherto  it has been the Bellona Environmental Foundation which, since  the fall of the Iron Curtain, has constantly been digging up new  information about the piles of radioactive waste the Cold War is  leaving behind in the northern regions.</p>

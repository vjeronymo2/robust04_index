			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Veronika Kutsyllo report in the "Cadre Reshuffles in the </F> Russian Leadership" column: "Petr Filippov Has Become the First  Victim of National Accord"]    [Text] Rumors about the resignation of Petr Filippov,  chief of the presidential administration's Information Support  Directorate, which have been surfacing and subsiding  periodically in the past month, began to justify themselves by  Victory Day: On 7 May Petr Filippov went on a vacation from  which he will return to a new job. Some observers assess this  resignation as a calculated strike on Filippov's "patron" Sergey  Filatov, but signs are that this is rather the case of a person  being victimized "in the heat of the moment."    Petr Filippov, 48, graduated from the Leningrad Aviation  Technology Institute in 1967. In 1990 he became people's deputy  of Russia. In the Supreme Soviet he headed a privatization  subcommittee. He was a leader of the Reforms Coalition  parliamentary faction and member of the Supreme Economic Council  under the Supreme Soviet Presidium. In early March 1993, he was  appointed head of the Analytical Center on Socioeconomic Policy.  A year later he became chief of the Information Support  Directorate.    Although the edict on Petr Filippov's resignation has not as  yet been issued officially, it is clear even now that the  struggle over this political figure between Sergey Filatov on  one hand and the Duma's agrarian lobby together with regional  "agriculturists" on the other has ended in favor of the latter.  Shortly before the holidays Petr Filippov went on a vacation  from which he will return to a new job. The latter has not so  far been determined finally. It is only known that Filippov  will get an appointment in one of the presidential  administration's directorates, somewhat lower in status than his  latest one.    A cause for the resignation has been the ill-fated draft  "agricultural edict" prepared by Filippov in early April which  provoked a storm of indignation from the agrarian lobby in the  State Duma. As a presidential administration official told  KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the promulgation of the draft "has caused  tremendous damage to the president's peace-making policy."  However, attempts to assess the appearance of Filippov's  analytical memorandum half a month prior to the signing of the  Public Accord Pact as a way to trip up Sergey Filatov, who  patronizes Filippov, are in all likelihood inconsistent.    What is involved is a more large-scale action by the  opposition aimed at either discrediting the president's efforts  to achieve national accord or at forcing him into serious  concessions. The Filippov memorandum gave the agrarians reason  not to sign the accord pact on 28 April in spite of the fact  that as a result of the noise they had raised, the president had  to agree to include into the text of the pact a provision about  the inadmissibility of "administrative measures" in the  countryside.    The double defeat, together with strong pressure by the Duma  and regional agrarians (and not only them but also some  "highbrow" officials in the presidential apparatus who believe  that Filippov is not only insufficiently professional but simply  not very intelligent) has angered the president and sealed the  fate of the well-known proponent of privatization. Even Sergey  Filatov's cautious intervention resulted only in a softening of  "punishment:" resignation has been replaced by "transfer to  other duties."    At the same time it would be premature to think that  Filippov's resignation means a change in Boris Yeltsin's  position with respect to the money-losing kolhozes and  sovkhozes. Especially if one recalls that the Filippov  memorandum was prepared based on the experience in Shakhovskoy  Rayon, whose forefather [praroditel] Nikolay Travkin recently  received carte blanche to continue transformations from the  president, who appointed him minister without portfolio.    Generally it can be said that Petr Filippov has suffered for  advocating a common cause but in a rather untimely manner. And  therefore became the first victim of the Public Accord Pact.</p>

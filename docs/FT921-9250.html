			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: Never mind childcare, what about the over-40s? Sir, It makes my blood boil every time I read yet more inches of newsprint on the subject of childcare facilities for working mothers. It seems to have escaped the notice of the powers-that-be that there are armies of women who are past child-bearing age but willing and able to work for another 20 years before reaching pension age. Where are the jobs or concern for these women? One would be forgiven for imagining that women between the ages of 40 and 60 did not exist] If one has the misfortune to fall into that category, the job prospects are poor, if not nil, after the age of 50, despite having years of good experience under our belts. Which is why I have been forced to obtain employment in Libya - the last outpost of the middle-aged secretary] In the UK they are, apparently, unemployable. On one of the few occasions when I secured an interview last year (for a low-grade, low-paid job), and having presented my credentials stating I had 30 years' experience and for the past six years had been employed as an executive secretary, I was obliged to take a spelling test] We may be regarded as dinosaurs - but we are not cretins] If there is indeed an actual or projected shortfall in the workforce, owing to decreased numbers of school-leavers, why are mothers of small children targeted for vacancies? We exist, too, and we do not demand nursery facilities. Are employers too short-sighted to recognise this fact? Incidentally, I raised four children, as a working mother and made my own childcare arrangements, when it became necessary to return to work 20 years ago. Nobody ever wet-nursed me] Janet L Johnson, legal department, National Oil Corporation, PO Box 2655 Tripoli, Libya</p>

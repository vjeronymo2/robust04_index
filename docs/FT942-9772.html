			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: China to broaden B-share market China plans to increase listings of B shares denominated in dollars for foreign investors in an effort to enliven its depressed stock markets, China's top stock regulator said yesterday. Mr Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told an international business seminar in Beijing that the B-share market was too limited and steps were being taken to expand issues. China was also considering allowing enterprises that had floated B shares to issue American depositary receipts (ADRs) and convertible notes. This move would be aimed at 'activating transactions' and 'raising more capital'. At the end of 1993, some 42 enterprises had issued B shares on China's two fledgling stock markets. This had raised some Dollars 1.2bn for the companies involved. China's A- (domestic) and B-share markets have suffered steep declines since their highs of early last year. Many local investors have deserted the A-share market for bonds or futures. Foreign traders, after an initial burst of enthusiasm, had until early this year found China-related stocks on the Hong Kong market more appealing. China stock regulators and market managers have been striving to boost the markets, but have encountered little success largely because of a widespread loss of confidence among investors who were unprepared for a prolonged downturn. Mr Liu indicated that China would press ahead with an increasingly ambitious programme of overseas listings. 'Chinese enterprises have a tremendous demand for capital . . . it is an important task to fully make use of the Hong Kong and other markets to speed up economic development,' he said. The Chinese official said overseas listings were at a 'testing stage'. Seven Chinese companies among nine selected for listing had been floated on the Hong Kong market. Another 22 enterprises had been selected for listing abroad either in Hong Kong or in New York. Mr Liu did not provide a timetable for these listings, but some are expected to go ahead this year. Mr Liu said China favoured listing foreign companies on its own securities markets, but a number of steps were required before this would be possible. These included further refinement of China's laws and regulations, and full convertibility of the Chinese yuan. Lack of convertibility was a similar impediment to the unification of the A and B-share markets. 'If foreign companies and investors cannot freely remit their renminbi abroad, it is meaningless for them to issue stocks in China,' Mr Liu said.</p>

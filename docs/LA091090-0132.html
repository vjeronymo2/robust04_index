			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CRONKITE FOCUSES ON DINOSAURS  </P> <P> Former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite says he has something in common with every  "red-blooded human being" -- a fascination with dinosaurs.  </P> <P> Cronkite was doing his part last week to publicize the great beasts of the  past, spending time in Montana to film a documentary series on dinosaurs.  </P> <P> "It's a fascinating project," he said as an international crew filmed a segment  northwest of Great Falls, Mont. "It's something that I think will make an  impact in America."  </P> <P> The four-hour series produced by Canadian, British and German television will  be shown in the United States on the Arts and Entertainment cable channel about  a year from now.  </P> <P> Cronkite, 73, spoke with owners of the Bynum Rock Shop, who found the bones of  baby dinosaurs that led to discovery of a key fossil site. The crew has also  filmed a fossil dig near Circle, Mont., where the most complete skeleton of a  Tyrannosaurus rex was discovered two years ago.  </P></p>

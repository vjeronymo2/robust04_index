			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Czech Parliament's Chamber of Deputies Foreign  Committee delegation began a four-day visit to Germany today.  Our Bonn correspondent, Jiri Halousek, has more information.    [Halousek] The Foreign Committee delegation is formed by 10  deputies from our Chamber of Deputies. The delegation was  received by Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag Foreign  Committee, this morning. He told me after the first round of  talks that, besides a number of shared views and interests,  there were also some issues that were left open in the  Czech-German agreement. Although these issues cannot be  resolved within two weeks, we have to have a plan on the basis  of which we can resolve them. The deputies should take a more  active part in setting up this plan.    Jiri Payne, chairman of the Czech Foreign Committee, summed  up his first impressions with these words.    [Begin Payne recording] I must say that, surprisingly, we  have assured each other that both sides were interested in new  contacts. I think that this is a good start for our talks in the  approaching days. [end recording]    [Halousek] This afternoon, our deputies delegation visited  the Defense Ministry in Bonn. The deputies were received by  Deputy Defense Minister Bernd Wilz, who said after the meeting:    [Begin Wilz recording in German, fading into Czech  translation] I believe that the NATO Partnership for Peace  proposal is at present the right thing to do in the interest of  the two countries--the Czech Republic and Germany--and the whole  NATO Alliance. Of course, our long-term goal is equal security  to all in Europe. [end recording]    [Halousek] Bernd Wilz went on to say that the agreement on  military cooperation between the two countries had already been  signed, that Czech officers had been studying at military  schools in Germany for four years now, and that good relations  had developed between [military] units in the border area. It  will be possible to launch joint military exercises, although  their relevant legal basis still needs to be set up.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Kaufman tells ITV chiefs of bleak future ITV COMPANIES are living 'everyday life in Pompeii before Vesuvius erupts', Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP, warned yesterday. He told Yorkshire-Tyne Tees executives that the future looked bleak when the rules governing ownership of television companies were relaxed to allow hostile takeovers. Chairing a Commons national heritage committee inquiry into the BBC's future, Mr Kaufman said ITV companies needed to face reality. 'We are talking about minnows being swept away in a tidal wave,' said the former shadow foreign secretary. He suggested that ITV companies should merge with the BBC and turn themselves into software suppliers of programmes for the new age of broadcasting which he said was just around the corner. Currently, ITV chiefs are only dealing in millions of pounds when huge multi-media foreign organisations are talking in terms of billions in overseas sales, he added. 'And the overseas rivals will oust British companies on their own territory unless they face reality,' he said. 'We are already seeing 11 per cent of the British TV audience belonging to Mr (Rupert) Murdoch and that is before Mr Murdoch has got going and that is before the technological revolution has arrived.' Mr Kaufman foresaw a reasonable future for the BBC and ITV only into the early part of the next century - after that, he predicted, their audi-ence levels would plummet. 'It is not a question of competing in the outside world, it is competing to keep any kind of audience in this country when the new regime arrives,' he said. Giving evidence, Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees chairman and chief executive, said he refuted Mr Kaufman's volcano analogy. 'We are aware that Vesuvius might be erupting and we want to get ourselves organised in a planned and proper way and not be running around like scalded cats frightened about what is going to happen,' he said. Mr Leach asked for the moratorium, which blocks foreign takeovers of ITV companies and which is due to end in January, to be extended.</p>

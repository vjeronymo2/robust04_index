			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (1) Hoping for a slow upturn - A diverse economic base, lessons from the early 1980s and local attitudes to wealth have helped the region, one of north England's main economic engines, withstand recession. Can its industry and commerce survive recovery? IT IS not the recession which dominates talk around business lunch tables in Yorkshire and Humberside, but the recovery. Managers fear its arrival. The worry is whether business can afford anything more than a long, slow uplift. Recession has had patchy effects. Some businesses have expired or been taken over; some places have not even felt it. Wakefield, for example, is so well placed at the nexus of the M1, M62 and the A1 that it hardly has to sell itself to inward investors, who continue to arrive. Only 50 minutes away, along the M62 or the M180, the four main Humber ports are in a state of unfettered growth following abolition of the national dock labour scheme in 1989. The Humber estuary is therefore developing rapidly as the main European trading gateway for northern England and much of the Midlands. One large dock in Hull, shut down as hopelessly uncompetitive in 1981, has been cleared of silt and successfully reopened. Trucks from Ireland, Scotland, the Netherlands and Germany stream across northern England. In 1974, 8.6 per cent of UK seaborne trade was through the Humber. In 1990 (the latest available figures) it was more than 12.5 per cent. In 1985, throughput was 46m tonnes. It passed 60m tonnes two years ago, with a total value approaching Pounds 20bn. Mr Mike Fell, who runs the docks at Hull for Associated British Ports, says this puts the Channel Tunnel - which eventually expects to handle an annual 16m tonnes of freight - 'in perspective'. If recession had really bitten in the region, it would have shown more drastically in unemployment figures. The rate for the region improved to 9.5 per cent in June, having apparently bottomed out at 9.8 per cent in the first quarter. Yet in January 1988, more than 262,000 of the region's 2.4m workers were unemployed; a rate of 11.2 per cent. This had fallen to 6.9 per cent in October 1989, but as recession started to bite in the south, the effect such a change used to have on the north was not evident. The relatively small fluctuation in unemployment levels since then would seem to indicate a marked change in regional economic behaviour. In part, this is because of a changed structure. Big manufacturing closures took place more than 10 years ago and local economic reconstruction in the coalfields is slowly having an effect. Yorkshire and Humberside's economy now has a better spread by type and size of businesses. Many of them trade briskly between themselves. Leeds alone has 14,000 businesses in six sectors. 'This diversity has helped us to weather recession,' says Mr John Siddall, the city's economic development officer. Local cultural factors are also at work. Mr Richard Wilson, senior partner of Gordons Wright &amp; Wright, a Bradford solicitor, says: 'People have always liked to have more of their own money in their businesses than they borrow from the bank. 'This may make them more cautious, but it also makes them less vulnerable.' Mr Ken Denton, editor of a business magazine published by Kirklees and Wakefield chamber of commerce, says that owner-managers in textiles or engineering have always been used to ups and downs. 'Their attitude is, 'Let's make some money and get it in the bank to help us through the bad times.' This tells you something about why many such businesses have survived.' Mr David Thurston, production director of BTH Building Systems, which makes temporary premises, says: 'Businesses should always proceed with caution, however good the market looks. You should make a bit, invest a bit and never try to do everything in one big leap. If you can't expand out of your own resources, should you be expanding?' Mr Richard Dunhill, of Hill Woolhouse, a chartered surveyor, says there is no glut of office space in Leeds because most of the region's developers rarely do more than one project at a time, proceeding to the next only after exiting profitably from the last. Indeed, Mr Jon Trickett, Labour leader of Leeds city council, points proudly to new tower cranes going up in the city - although public spending is a factor here, with the relocation, to Leeds from London, of the Departments of Health and Social Security. Mr Dunhill says this stimulates a chain of demand as suppliers of associated services also move in or set up. He says the mechanism has been proven in Sheffield over the past 10 years, following the move of the government's manpower services to that city. The government this month announced a Pounds 20m grant to help relocation of the Royal Armouries museum from the Tower of London to Clarence Dock in the Leeds canal system. This is expected to stimulate property development around it. Prudence, rather than conservatism, is the way Yorkshire people like to describe their business attitudes. 'People here are used to managing a flat market,' says Mr David Wilkinson, who heads 3i's offices in Leeds, Hull and Sheffield. 'We have some very sound investments in very good, solid businesses. Maybe some did not seize the opportunities of the 1980s, but they are better able to stand up to what is happening now.' Yorkshire and Humberside contain 5m people - about the same as Scotland - and account for 8 per cent of UK gross domestic product. Mr Peter Coles-Johnson, who heads the combined chambers of commerce in the region, says Yorkshire and Humberside does 11 per cent of the UK's exporting and this has also has helped business resist recession. However, groups of business leaders assembled this month for chamber of commerce meetings or Bank of England informal lunches have unanimously agreed that there is no end to recession in sight. They have battened down to hang on, but anxiety is mounting about coping when the things turn up again. Finding enough working capital is the worry. Yorkshire prudence, combined with the lessons of 1980-82, ensured that many businesses went into the recession with cash reserves. Those which did not, or were overgeared, went into liquidation early. But cash is draining away from the rest while the national climate remains depressed. Many have started using up their overdraft facilities. Mr Wilkinson says: 'The general picture is that the flow into receivership has thinned. But if there is now rapid or uncontrolled growth, that picture will deteriorate.' Mr Charles Burton and Mr Peter Bancroft run the Bradford and Leeds offices of Haines Watts, a national accounting firm which specialises in small or medium-sized unquoted businesses owned by their managers. They say about 80 per cent of businesses are now running at their overdraft limits. Limits are tighter because banks have reduced their exposure during the recession. Banks insist they do not operate a formula on this, but a case-by-case judgment of what is prudent. Few customers believe this: Haines Watts says lending is usually set at 50 per cent of asset value and 30 per cent of debtors, compared with a respective 70 per cent and 50 per cent previously. However, Mr Trevor Skelley, chief manager of Natwest's business centre in Leeds, says: 'If we are satisfied with the probity of management, companies will not be starved of working capital. There is no joy for us in seeing our customers go down.' Mr Ralph Preece, a Touche Ross corporate recovery specialist, says more one-off investigative work on behalf of banks suggests that they are asking accountants to judge this managerial probity company by company, as each seeks more working capital. His opposite number at Price Waterhouse, Mr Gordon Horsfield, agrees. There is no point in foreclosing on a business if its assets are unrealisable, so the banks are looking for reasons to support recovery if a business's prospects look fair. 'What we are going to find on the way out of recession is not so much which are the good companies, but who are the good bankers,' Mr Horsfield says. 'But whatever happens, we are going to need a very long runway for take-off.'</p>

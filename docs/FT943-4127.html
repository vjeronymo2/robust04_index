			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Rising in the east There is something different about Japan this week. No, the current round of trade talks in Los Angeles has not miraculously resolved the country's conflicts with the US. But a process that will eventually do more to bring the two countries closer has begun: the Japanese economy is growing and its structure is slowly changing. There have been enough phantom upturns over the past 18 months that the news is spoken softly. But yesterday even the Japanese Economic Planning Agency included the word 'recovery' in its monthly economic update. Growth is still fragile enough for caution to be well-placed: real GDP may achieve only around 1 1/4 per cent growth this year, if that. But Japan's industrialised trading partners should be more encouraged by the emerging pattern of growth than its magnitude. Politically, things in Japan are as murky as ever, as the debate over the continuation - and funding - of last year's tax cuts carries on unresolved. But thanks to the past year's fiscal injections, economic prospects in consumption and residential investment are looking less sombre than for a long time. This does not mean that this year's further surge in the value of the yen will have no effect. So far, the dollar-denominated current account surplus has yet to show the effect of the re-adjustment currently taking place. But Japanese net exports will almost certainly fall in the coming year: what is different about this recovery is the way that re-adjustment will occur. Japan's exporters are benefiting from economic growth in their most important markets: the US, Europe, and East Asia. Falling competitiveness will probably rule out significant export growth, but the decline is unlikely to be dramatic. Greater improvement In contrast to past occasions, the country's exporters are finding themselves less able to compensate for losses abroad by raising prices at home. The competitiveness of Japanese export goods, in dollar terms, has fallen by 25 per cent since 1985. But a still greater improvement in the competitiveness of foreign goods has hit domestic sales of domestically-produced goods. The tentative rise in domestic consumption is increasingly going towards purchases of foreign goods. Imports of video recorders trebled in July alone. Thus the strong yen, coupled with the slow process of market deregulation, is adding momentum to the industrial restructuring taking place in Japan. Given the over-capacity left over from the 1980s boom, another ingredient of the typical Japanese recovery - surging capital investment - is also missing. The spur behind recent investment has been almost entirely residential: usually the country's weakest investment sector. Heavily-subsidised loans are helping young people buy cheap condominiums for the first time. New housing starts rose at an annual rate over 6 per cent in July, the fourth monthly rise running. Saving rate What does this very different picture of Japan in recovery mean for Japan's trading partners? The steady rise in consumer imports will lessen, but not eliminate Japan's current account surplus. As the Japanese (and others) never tire of pointing out, the country's high rate of net saving will continue to deliver a net injection of capital to the rest of the world for some time yet. Though the population is ageing fast, even very old Japanese display much higher rates of saving than pensioners elsewhere. But the destination of this capital contribution may well change, in light of recent developments. Wider deregulation of the economy now has the backing of many important business constituencies, as well as that of the ruling coalition. Though it may be held back by political shifts, it is unlikely to be halted altogether. This means that Japanese consumers could begin to enjoy a lower cost of living relative to Americans and Europeans, whose goods they will buy in greater numbers. That might give Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, and his successors less to talk about in years to come. Having lost approximately Dollars 320bn on their US investments since 1986, Japanese investors are likely to be more cautious of sending their surplus cash to the US. Non-portfolio flows may concentrate increasingly on Asian emerging markets. Japan's neighbours could therefore receive the benefit of still more of the know-how and technological creativity which helped Japan grow so rapidly after the war. Much could go wrong with this scenario, but there is encouragement to be found in this week's news from Japan. On Thursday, Mr Kantor predicted that there would be 'no breakthroughs' in the state of US-Japanese trade relations in the near term. He may, however, be looking in the wrong place.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar under pressure again THE DOLLAR was once again under pressure on foreign exchange markets yesterday because of its large interest rate differential with the D-Mark, writes James Blitz. Although most London dealers feel that the Bundesbank council will not lift the Lombard rate at its meeting today, overseas operators rushed to cover their positions, buying D-Marks and selling dollars. 'Deep down, most people are still bullish about the dollar,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation. 'But with a 6 per cent differential between the dollar and D-Mark, investors are starting to get hurt.' The US unit was adversely affected by comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, that it was too early to sound the all-clear on German monetary policy. And a repurchase agreement launched by the Bundesbank in the German money markets dealt a second blow: the bank drained nearly DM5bn from the money markets, and nudged up the 'repo' rate 5 basis points to 9.65 per cent. The dollar fell to a closing DM1.6305 in London, after opening at DM1.6405. It also lost considerable ground to sterling, which ended at Dollars 1.7945 compared to Dollars 1.7825 the night before, and the US unit dropped to FFr5.4950 from FFr5.5250. In New York the dollar closed lower at DM1.6287 and FFr5.4845, with the pound at Dollars 1.7975. Traders were starting to refocus their attention on the yen, after a string of public holidays had taken Tokyo dealers out of the market. The Japanese unit ended firmer against the dollar after traders considered the possibility of future intervention in its favour by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. 'More and more people are thinking that the Japanese and the G7 are keen to get the yen higher,' said Swiss Bank's Mr O'Neill. Bullish sentiment over the yen was compounded by comments from the French finance minister suggesting it is undervalued in the market. In London the yen ended at Y132.40 against the dollar, after an opening Y133.10. In New York the dollar slipped to Y132.25. Sterling also appreciated yesterday, in spite of the Bank of England's 1/2 percentage point interest rate cut on Tuesday. It gained against all the major European currencies and lost no ground to a resilient D-Mark, again closing at DM2.9250. Dealers said the UK currency still has the advantage of a solid political background and brighter prospects for the economy. The French franc again performed strongly on thoughts that it might replace the D-Mark as the central anchor in the EMS if Germany's economic problems continue. Dealers took the suggestion with a pinch of salt, but the French currency ended firmly against the D-Mark at around FFr3.3662.</p>

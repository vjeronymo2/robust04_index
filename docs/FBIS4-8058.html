			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference given by Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija </F> Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, and Bosnian Army  Commander Rasim Delic with unidentified reporters and an  unidentified moderator in the Presidency building in Sarajevo --  live]    [Text] [Izetbegovic] The situation in Gorazde, in the area  around Gorazde, is deteriorating further. Here are some facts:  19 villages have been burned down so far [words indistinct].  There are many dead and wounded. The exact figure cannot be  established. We have tried to establish an approximate figure  regarding the shelling and the victims, especially those of last  night's chemical attack. It has not been possible to do so  until now. We can only say that the number of victims is very  large.    I would like to draw your attention to one thing: Gorazde is  in this situation first of all because of the general situation  caused by the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are  now facing the situation in which the entire Podrinje area,  where Muslims constituted a majority, has been reduced to three  enclaves. Gorazde is just one of them. The international  community's arms embargo has deprived us of the capacity to  defend ourselves. Let's take a look at the specific actions of  UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. With its reports over the past  10 days in which it persistently repeated that nothing  spectacular was happening there, the UNPROFOR has in a way  lulled the international public and given false information to  those people who are expected to decide what should happen next.  It practically deceived [word indistinct].    When I mention the specific situation in Gorazde I am  referring to a peculiar mode of behavior by UNPROFOR, who have  -- in the last 10 days or so, since the attack began -- been  concealing the facts and giving incomplete information to the  public and [words indistinct].    You must have noticed total discrepancy between what we have  said about the situation in Gorazde, between our warnings that  the Serbs were launching all-out, well-prepared attacks for  which weaponry -- a large number of tanks -- and a large number  of people were being made available, and UNPROFOR's reports --  and we will see who is responsible for this -- to the world  public saying that nothing special was happening there, that it  was only a case of sporadic shelling, there were no new  movements of troops, and no large numbers of casualties.    Of course, the right decisions could not be made in the  centers of decision-making on the basis of such incorrect  reports.    And, before I conclude, let me just say that General Rose  reiterated yesterday that there were no new movements by the  chetnik units, and this at the time when they were in fact  advancing toward the Drina.    Let me just add that last night we sent an (?alarming)  letter  to the Security Council, demanding (?adequate measures).    [Moderator] Before this news conference Prime Minister  Silajdzic was in contact with some people from Gorazde. I would  like him to tell us about the situation there at the moment.    [Silajdzic] The radio contacts we had and this telegram  which  we received 20 minutes ago say more or less the same thing.    The situation in Gorazde is extremely dramatic, according to  the telegram. The shelling of the town center has been the  heaviest since the beginning of the war. Between 15,000 and  20,000 people have had to leave their homes. This is what the  telegram says.    I would like to add another point to what President  Izetbegovic has already said. I think that we have been told by  General Rose that he would call for air strikes if the  aggressor's forces were to advance toward the town. That is all.    [Moderator] Since we have heard reports of chemical weapons  being used in the attacks, I would like to ask General Delic to  tell us what he knows about this.    [Delic] Chemical weapons have been used several times during  the aggressor's offensive on Gorazde. I am speaking of the use  of chemical gases fired from artillery weapons. These are  mainly gases which cause short-term effects, gases such as  irritants. The valley of the Drina has just the right terrain  for the use of chemical gases.    I would like to remind you that international conventions  ban  the use of chemical gases. Chemical gases have been used  indiscriminately, both against the units of Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army and against populated areas, in particular the village of  Vitkovici. Yesterday alone 45 projectiles containing chemical  gases were used. We have heard reports that they were used this  morning as well.    According to some unconfirmed reports chemical gases which  cause long-term effects have also been used, such as  blister-causing gases. We do not know the number of casualties,  either among the civilians or among the soldiers, since this  number is large [as received]. All indications are that the  aggressor has used all prohibited means at his disposal in order  to destroy people in the area.    [Journalist] [passage indistinct]    [Izetbegovic] As you could hear from Silajdzic's statement,  General Rose promised this yesterday. He said that if the  Serbs continued advancing, he would use force to stop them. As  you know, he has not done it yet.    [Journalist] I would like to ask President Izetbegovic why  UNPROFOR is deliberately playing down the attacks on the  protected zone of Gorazde. My second question is what the state  of Bosnia- Herzegovina is doing internally and on the  international scene to stop the Serb aggressor's attacks on  Gorazde. My third question is for the prime minister. You said  that the aggressor is again using the tactics of negotiating and  attacking at the same time. What is the aggressor's aim now?    [Izetbegovic] Let me answer the first question (words  indistinct]. I cannot say what UNPROFOR's aim in doing that is,.  whether it is the worst option, to hand over Gorazde, or whether  they are simply shirking from their duty. I believe that this  is an attempt to avoid the use of force regardless of the price  our people will pay. I would like to stress now that UNPROFOR  had the mandate to use force, that is, to ask for (?air  strikes). There is a clear provision in the resolution [words  indistinct]. I would like you to ask General Rose the same  thing as soon as you see him.    As for your second question, I can tell you that the  government of Bosnia-Herzegovina has done everything in its  powers to help Gorazde, including the army, of course. You know  what we have done in the political field. Last night we sent an  urgent letter to the Security Council. That was one of our  latest actions. In the military field, we have taken resolute  measures to ease the situation on the Gorazde front. After  seven days of walking through snow and (?blizzard) the first  group of people, doctors and people carrying aid for Gorazde  arrived there last night. We are also taking military measures,  but I cannot disclose the details here. [passage indistinct]    [Siljadzic] The aggressor aims to force the international  community and us into having this situation, as it is, frozen  for some period of time. This also includes taking the right  bank of the Drina in order to secure a better negotiating  position. At the same time the aggressor is testing the  international community's resolve [passage indistinct]. In  other words, instead of one massive attack lasting for several  days which could possibly provoke a reaction on the part of the  international community, the aggressor has decided to negotiate  and attack at the same time so as to lull the international  community into believing that peace will be achieved through  negotiations.    I have to say that at the very beginning we cautioned  General  Rose about this tactics and we hope [passage indistinct].    [Journalist] [passage indistinct]    [Delic] At this moment it is difficult to say, it is  difficult to collect reports -- from the inferno which Gorazde  is experiencing -- in order to analyze what chemical weapons  were used. I stressed that [words indistinct] in one round of  fire yesterday 45 shells filled with chemical agents were fired  from artillery weapons. [passage indistinct]    Speaking about Serb paramilitary formations, the basic  problem is that they can at any time bring in reinforcements.  So if I say that 3,000 to 4,000 people are fighting, you can  take as [word indistinct]. This is only an example. However,  the problem is that they can replace and bring in fresh forces.  That is how they manage to have fresh forces all the time.  They can also bring in new equipment. On the other hand, the  defenders cannot do that. The same people have held defense  positions for 15 days. That is a difference in quality, rather  than the number of people fighting on the opposing sides.  [passage indistinct]    [Izetbegovic] In conclusion I would like to stress what  Delic  has just said. We believe that the international community --  with the Security Council as its head -- has the obligation to  take immediate measures to save the town. It should have done  that before. Tomorrow it could be too late.    I would like to stress one thing because we are often asked  this: We base this obligation on the fact that they have  deprived us of arms for self-defense. By imposing the arms  embargo, you practically tied our hands when we were attacked.  This is why they have no right to use any kind of pretext not  to protect Gorazde now, and Srebrenica in the future and so on.  If we had had weapons, we would not ask them to help us.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: ECGD puts sovereign debt up for sale THE UK's Export Credit Guarantee Department has put part of its Pounds 6.4bn (Dollars 11.32bn) of sovereign debt up for sale. This is its first attempt to sell off part of the portfolio it took on through debt reschedulings by lesser developed countries (LDCs). The ECGD, which refused to say how much of the portfolio it is trying to sell, said it had written to a number of financial institutions to seek offers for the debt. The sale of the debt was made possible by an agreement to forgive part of the debt of lower middle-income and very poor countries, prompted last year by UK prime minister John Major. This agreement, known as the 'Trinidad Terms', also allowed for a 'modest' proportion of the rescheduled debt to be sold. The ECGD's ability to sell off part of its sovereign debt is helped by its provisioning policy. In recent years it has been following the Bank of England's 'matrix', which was developed to direct provisioning by commercial banks. Unlike many continental credit insurers, the great majority of the ECGD's debt has already been fully provided for, so all cash raised by the sale of debt will trim the provisions it has to carry. The Trinidad Terms, adopted in 1991, cover 20 of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries, including Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines and Poland. Bankers active in the LDC debt market in London confirmed they had been contacted by the ECGD, but refused to comment on the size of the proposed sale. One commented that there was only a very thin market in the debt of most of the countries covered by the Trinidad Terms, implying that the ECGD could be offered far less than recent prices quoted in the market.</p>

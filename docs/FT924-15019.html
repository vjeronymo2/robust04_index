			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Pounds troubles blamed as Sanyo sheds jobs SANYO ELECTRIC Manufac-turing (UK), a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics group, said yesterday that the weakness of sterling against the yen had contributed to a decision to shed about 95 jobs - a third of the workforce - at its microwave ovens plant at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. The company, which buys some components from Japanese suppliers other than Sanyo, said the yen's relative strength and high interest rates had worsened problems caused by the recession. The 'difficult decision' to restructure at the Newton Aycliffe plant, which formed part of an Pounds 11m investment in the region announced only four years ago, was necessary to ensure it survived. Mr Ron Bell, assistant to the plant's managing director, said: 'We're trying to re-establish ourselves in a very competitive market.' The Newton Aycliffe plant has been selling 70 per cent of its output in the UK and the rest in continental Europe. Mr Bell said hopes of an imminent end to the recession had not been realised. The floating of the pound had not helped investor confidence, he added. The investment in the region, for which Sanyo received substantial UK government regional grant aid, was expected in 1988 to create more than 500 jobs. It was greeted as an example of the region's economic regeneration through Japanese investment. Sanyo employs 283 people at Newton Aycliffe and 24 at its magnetron plant at Thornaby-on-Tees, Cleveland, which is not affected by the job cuts. The EETPU section of the AEEU engineering and electrical union has single-union status at the Newton Aycliffe plant where a pendulum arbitration agreement - in effect a no-strike deal - is in force. Consultation with the union on the job losses has begun.</p>

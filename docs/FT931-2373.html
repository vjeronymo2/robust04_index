			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Warning on traffic congestion in London SIR ALASTAIR Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel, yesterday warned that if congestion in and around London was not tackled the rest of Britain would suffer. He told 250 senior managers from many sectors of the economy in Wakefield, West Yorkshire that congestion in London was 'a sickly thrombosis - it's a malignant one, almost cancerous.' Speakers at the conference, which was sponsored by IBM, discussed the problems that northern and Scottish companies have when trying to reach markets in continental Europe. Sir Alastair said that if London was crippled as a world-class capital city the rest of Britain would be harder to reach. Lord Healey, the former Labour deputy leader, said the north and Scotland had more than 30 per cent of Britain's road freight traffic but received only 16 per cent of the government's budget for new motorways and trunk roads. He added that rail freight charges had risen 36 per cent in the last year as a prelude to privatisation and more government investment was needed to improve speed of access to European customers.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Inglorious exit PRESIDENT CLINTON may think he has found a face-saving way to extricate US forces from Somalia by launching a fresh diplomatic initiative, while at the same time setting a March deadline for a US troop withdrawal. But he is deluding himself if he believes he is also saving Somalia. In setting a withdrawal deadline, Mr Clinton is responding to domestic pressures, but the policy may contain the seeds of its own failure. The warlords at the heart of the conflict are unlikely to take part in good faith if the most powerful sanction enforcing their good behaviour is of such short duration. In the unlikely event that an agreement does emerge, UN troops will be unable to enforce it without a powerful US component. The difficulties besetting the UN operation in Somalia result from the confused objectives of its participants. When President George Bush sent US troops there last December, the full implications of what was intended as a humanitarian mission were not taken into account. UN forces have been successful in feeding hungry Somalis and in restoring stability in many parts of the country. But Somalia remains deeply divided along regional and clan lines, and still needs international help to ensure its shattered society does not sink back into civil conflict. That necessitates a political negotiating framework with military support in disarming rival factions and creating a secure environment. President Clinton's call for a diplomatic initiative - in particular, for the resumption of talks between a broad cross-section of Somali groups that collapsed in Addis Ababa in March - deserves support, but comes perilously late in the day. If there is to be any chance of success, the UN force must first ensure the conference takes place in an atmosphere free of fear and intimidation. Gen Aideed and other military leaders will ultimately have to be present - but only after their armies have been assembled and disarmed under UN supervision. Such an effort requires a continuing US presence on the ground, and a clear UN strategy. In the past few days, however, the confusion surrounding US policy has only deepened. Washington has vacillated between pursuing its efforts to capture Gen Aideed and charge him with responsibility for the deaths of UN soldiers on the one hand, and accepting his shrewdly timed introduction at the weekend of a ceasefire on the other. The general's offer could yet provide an opportunity to salvage what has turned out to be a disastrous intervention - but only if President Clinton uses it as a means to accelerate political negotiations, not as a pretext for premature withdrawal.</p>

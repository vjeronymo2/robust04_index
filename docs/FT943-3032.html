			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / More aid for eastern Germany The German government yesterday said it would create a DM500m (Pounds 207m) fund to provide subsidised, long-term loans to eastern German companies. It also presented new tax incentives designed to encourage investment in eastern Germany. Companies selling stakes in German companies would not have to pay tax on their profits if they reinvested the money in eastern Germany, said Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, after industrialists and trade unions met Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss the state of the eastern German economy. While Mr Kohl insisted there were signs of the 'flourishing landscape' which he promised to create in the five eastern Lander, the opposition Social Democratic party accused the chancellor of 'resounding complacency' and of destroying eastern Germany's industrial base - which now produced around a third of what it did in 1989.</p>

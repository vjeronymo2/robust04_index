			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Luigi Irdi and Tonino Satta: "Will This Formula </F> Make Everyone Happy?"]    [Text] The free-market theories of the Right are going to  be put to the test. Health care for pay, private schools, and  more jobs (but for lower wages): This is the formula that the  government will use in an attempt to save Italy, amid a thousand  uncertainties.    Ladies and gentlemen, here is the first government of the  Right, at your service. After 50 years of a centrism that  oscillated from slightly on the right to way over on the left,  the 27 March elections signaled the triumph of laissez-faire  capitalism, postfascism, Berlusconiism (as a life style), and  Legaism.    Moreover, it is this mixture--which the Knight of Arcore  [Berlusconi] is attempting (with no little difficulty) to  compound--that will govern the fifth greatest industrial power  in the world during the coming years and profoundly alter even  the nation's constitutional principles.    It is impossible to know where all this will lead. L'EUROPEO  has attempted to ascertain the specific sectors in which the new  Italian Right will take its initial steps in the process of  governing.  <H5>  Ten Questions </H5>   1. The Right, which openly advocates free-market capitalism,  must necessarily make an in-depth investigation of the welfare  state. What measures might the government take initially with  respect to health care and pensions, for example?    Following an election campaign during which the victorious  coalition warned voters of the dangers of "Occhetto-style  statism," Silvio Berlusconi and his partners (friends?  comrades?) will be expected to provide immediate proof of their  allegiance to the free-market system.    According to the official programs, health care and pensions  are already targets of the government of the Right. In the  health care sector, the famous government-provided health care  "bonus" [preceding word in English]--which each citizen could  spend as he or she saw fit, either in hospitals or for a private  insurance policy--has become mere fiction. In terms of pensions,  the policy is to favor supplementary annuities and to raise the  age of eligibility.    "The transition will be difficult, exhausting, and long,"  says economist Carlo Scognamiglio, who Berlusconi would like to  have in his administration. There are other reasons for this  absence of haste. The constituency of the Right includes many  seniors, pensioners, and low-income public employees (one  probable member of the cabinet, National Alliance Deputy Publio  Fiori, based his career as an Andreotti partisan of long  standing precisely on these categories of the electorate).  Moreover, any abrupt cuts in social spending on the eve of the  June European elections--which the Right expects will serve to  confirm its approval rating--could be counterproductive.    "They will do nothing in the short term," predicts Emanuele  Macaluso, leader [preceding word in English] of the most  moderate wing of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. "The  government coalition will now consolidate its power by placing  its people in key positions in order to secure control and  establish new rules of the game. Then the dance will begin."    2. Could a government of the Right reopen the education  controversy by providing de facto support for private schools?    The "good education" issue is also on the agenda. Parents  will be able to decide whether to send their children to public  schools or to private schools (meaning in effect Catholic  schools, inasmuch as the overwhelming majority of private  schools are staffed by nuns and priests). Moreover, Berlusconi  attaches great importance to the support of the bishops and for  months conducted an all-out campaign to obtain it. He is now  beginning to harvest the fruits of that campaign, which range  from the enthusiastic statements of Cardinal Silvio Oddi to the  partial placet of CIVILTA CATTOLICA, the Jesuits' magazine.    As an item on the agenda, this issue will accordingly soon  affect the equilibrium of the coalition and likewise Silvio  Berlusconi's good relations with the ecclesiastical hierarchy  (the Church has never liked pure laissez-faire capitalism). It  is an obstacle that will not be easy to surmount, however.    The fact is that the Northern League actually envisions more  radical solutions, as for example schools owned by the teachers  themselves, who would operate them on a free-market basis ("It's  crazy," Labor Minister Gino Giugni, an inflexible supporter of  the public schools, exclaims. "How could teachers turn  themselves overnight into stockholders and managers?" [preceding  word in English]. For its part, the National Alliance remains  committed to an educational system operated by the state.    "In my opinion, public education is preferable," says  Domenico Fisichella, Gianfranco Fini's institutional theorist  and candidate for the cabinet post (Public Education) that at  one time was held by Benedetto Croce.    3. The Right has promised "lower taxes for everyone," but  how  can it keep this promise and simultaneously reform public  finances?    "Simple," explains National Alliance Deputy Maurizio  Gasparri. "The Laffer curve--which I could discuss at  length--shows that by lowering taxes you increase state  revenues. My butcher put it even more simply. In 1992," he said,  "the state asked me for 12 million lire, and in 1993 for 19  million. I didn't have it, and I didn't pay a single lira. If  they come for me, I'll be the needle in the haystack.'"    So this is the theory: Reduce taxes, and you will have fewer  tax evaders and a rehabilitated treasury. Here too, however, it  appears that no one is in a hurry to keep a promise. Speaking on  the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], General Luigi  Ramponi of the National Alliance--who formerly headed SISMI  [Intelligence and Military Security Service]--and Scognamiglio  found themselves in agreement. "Bad news on the fiscal front,"  the rector of Luiss University said. "The deficit is soaring,  and taxes can be reduced only if government spending is reduced  and economic recovery takes place." How so? Wasn't tax reduction  supposed to be the engine of recovery?    "With an average tax burden of 41 percent," Ramponi said,  "we  are within the European parameters, together with France and  Great Britain. Less than that...." What is he saying? Isn't this  the same argument that Luigi Spaventa, the Ciampi  administration's budget minister, used to make?    "I believe that the government of the Right will sooner or  later strike a surprise blow such as, for example, the  imposition of a substantial withholding tax on bank deposits,  passbook savings accounts, and checking accounts," Giorgio  Benvenuto, the former secretary general at the Ministry of  Finance, is willing to wager. "It will be a telling blow, one  designed to meet the financial requirements of the state."    Antonio Martino, the principal economist of Forza Italia,  denies the possibility of any such blow, however. He insists  that the government will issue its decrees within the first 50  days after taking office, and that the initial objective will be  to convert 4 to 5 trillion lire of direct taxes into indirect  taxes.    4. Expanded markets, more consumption, and more publicity:  these supply the oxygen that Berlusconi's business interests  breathe. But how will he be able to keep inflation under control?    "Berlusconi will take inflation to 10 percent," Giorgio  Benvenuto predicts. Lower taxes mean that families will have  more money; more money in circulation means increased demand for  consumer goods, which in turn means rising prices and therefore  inflation.    The plans of the future Berlusconi administration, however,  do make allowance for a rise of several percentage points in the  rate of inflation. "That would in no way be the end of the  world," Maurizio Gasparri continues. "Inflation is low today not  because it is controlled but because there is a recession."    On the other hand, Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson and Roberto  Artoni, professor at Milan's Bocconi University, foresee  absolute catastrophe. "There is the danger that Italy's economy  will be run in the Peronist manner," Samuelson warns, while  Artoni points out that "inflationary policies work to the  advantage of all debtors, public and private." Inasmuch as Italy  has a national debt of 2 quadrillion lire and will be governed  by an entrepreneur (Berlusconi) who is himself up to his ears in  debt....    Whether these doubts are valid or not, an inflation that is  under control and a public debt that is once again managed  rationally are conditions that Italy must fulfill in order to  remain within the European sphere following the Maastricht  treaty.    5. "One million jobs in two years." Is the Italian business  community ready--as Berlusconi maintains--to hire young people,  and under what conditions would it be able to do so?    "Let them try to fulfill their promise of 1 million jobs in  two years," Labor Minister Gino Giugni comments sarcastically.  "If they are lucky and the GDP increases to 3 percent, they will  barely be able to come up with 400,000 jobs."    The confidence manifested by Berlusconi's people is based on  the creation of a simplified and flexible labor market involving  tax relief for firms that hire young people; the possibility of  easier dismissals; term contracts; and lower entry-level wages  for entrants to the labor market (whose counterparts in France,  incidentally, formed the mobs of young people who in recent  weeks took to the streets in that country).    In his comment, Communist Renewal Secretary Fausto  Bertinotti  gives full rein to his skepticism. "Berlusconi and the other  groups of the Right are proposing things that already exist," he  says. "Apprenticeships have been in existence since 1955, and  labor training contracts for the past several years, but there  are still 3 million unemployed. Spain has every version of these  laws but continues to have an unemployment problem."    Moreover, if a businessman--in response to all these  incentives--decides to hire additional employees only to dismiss  them three months later and then perhaps repeat the three-month  hiring and firing cycle at some later date, does this represent  a genuine increase in employment or merely marginal adjustments  in the unemployment rate? Berlusconi's principal adviser,  Giuliani Urbani, was assigned the task of defending the  proposal. "Before we set this goal," he said, "we polled  thousands of businessmen to determine their availability."    6. Berlusconi's own business interests are one of the  obstacles facing his administration. For example, what  credibility will he have when--as a government official--he  appoints the heads of the big banks to which he himself is in  debt?    On this point--which is one of the most important of  all--Silvio Berlusconi has offered no convincing arguments other  than his personal assurances that he will conduct himself  honorably.    The Italian people do not actually appear to be very  concerned about this matter before the vote [for prime minister]  is taken; but it is clear that as prime minister, Silvio  Berlusconi will frequently find himself in an embarrassing  position whenever his government has to sponsor legislation in  many specific fields--such as telecommunications, antitrust  [preceding word in English], and construction--or obtain greater  financial disclosure by the companies that own soccer teams.    Here are two examples. The government appoints the heads of  the big national banks, and Berlusconi is in debt to half of the  Italian banking system. How dispassionately will he be able to  make decisions? And the fact that he is part owner of a TV  station in Germany (Telefuenf) and one in Spain (Telecinco)  creates an embarrassing situation whereby the Italian prime  minister will be in a position to influence the communications  media of foreign countries. This is not viewed with favor in  international circles.    "Only a mediocre person would allow himself to be influenced  by his personal interests," says Giuseppe Tatarella, leader of  the National Alliance deputies, "and you can say anything about  Berlusconi except that he is a mediocrity." "Under this  electoral system," National Alliance Deputy Gasparri adds, "if  you misbehave, the voters will send you packing at the next  election. That is your insurance policy."    7. In the euphoria of victory, tensions among allies are  attenuated. But when controversial matters are at issue--such as  reductions in force in the public sector and federalism--what  will happen within the ranks of the majority?    On the day following the elections, all observers doubted  that the Right would be able to form a coalition government, and  yet Berlusconi appeared certain to get Gianfranco Fini and  Umberto Bossi to reach an accord immediately. Not for nothing is  he a supersalesman of special deals ("three for the price of  two"), inasmuch as he even succeeded in palming off the National  Alliance on the voters of the north who had chosen Forza Italia  and the League, and in selling Bossi to the voters of the south  who were planning to vote for Berlusconi and Fini.    Although the euphoria surrounding the sensational electoral  victory made it possible to overcome many obstacles, it did not  dispel the tensions within the coalition.    Despite everything, Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Fini  continue tirelessly to snipe at each other. "The coalition  government will be formed, and it will be accompanied by an  accord with respect to programs," Tatarella says.    It can be assumed that an accord will be reached. None of  the  partners [preceding word in English] can afford to cause the  operation to fail: not Berlusconi, after spending many billions  of lire to form a new party and become prime minister and after  committing himself totally to this endeavor; not Fini, who is  seeing his comrades return to the government after 50 years  (someone pointed out sadly that the most recent fascist to have  passed through Chigi Palace [office of the prime minister]--the  former foreign minister of the Mussolini regime, Galeazzo  Ciano--ended up being shot, exactly 50 years ago, by his  father-in-law in Verona); and not Bossi either, who--if he gets  out of line--will be judged responsible (in the eyes of his  colleagues and his constituents) for wasting the opportunity to  govern. All three have the need to govern.    8. What will become of the kickback scandal and the  independence of the judiciary? Is a whitewash--disguised as a  "political solution"--really in the offing?    These are hard times for the judges. One cannot forget that  only a few weeks ago the probable new prime minister vehemently  denounced Gherardo Colombo--one of the leading jurists in the  Clean Hands pool [preceding word in English] in Milan--and that  Tiziana Parenti (Berlusconi's choice for the post of justice  minister) has attacked her colleagues with rancor and venom.    So far there has been no talk of a whitewash for the  bribetakers. "I do not believe they [the coalition government]  will do anything that would be so unpopular," says PDS Senator  Massimo Brutti. "We must wait and see, however, whether they  will really help the magistrates conduct all the trials with  dispatch, for that means money, personnel, funds, and  courtrooms--and the will to do what is necessary."    The other burning question relates to the independence of  the  judiciary. For example, the Right wants to "separate" the  prosecutors from the judges who have the task of rendering  verdicts. "This is one step away from subordination to the  government's office of public prosecutor," says the former  secretary of the National Association of Magistrates, Senator  Raffaele Bertoni, a progressive. "Even fascism regarded this  option as too risky," he adds.    But the new majority is determined to press forward on its  chosen course. "The two professions must be separated," is the  battle cry of Tiziana Parenti, who takes aim at a loftier  target, the Higher Council of the Magistracy. "Let's reorganize  the Council," Parenti says. "We've had our fill of politicized  judiciaries."    This brings us, in fact, to the second point that disturbs  the Left, namely the system for electing the Higher Council of  the Magistracy. If the government majority is as strong and  compact as predicted, it is already able--even without  reorganization--to select all of the 10 "secular" members of the  Council. In particular, this means that the government is  indirectly in a position to exert a decisive influence on the  selection of the heads of the most important judicial offices.    "The biggest unknown quantity is Berlusconi. The MSI  [Italian  Social Movement]-National Alliance and the Northern League have  consistently endorsed the work of the judges, but Berlusconi has  in fact never done so." [quotation marks as published]    9. For the first time in decades, the Interior Ministry--the  heart of the state--will be in the hands of the Right. Should we  fear that the police, the intelligence services, and the  prefects will be used against the opposition?    "This is a hypothesis that I do not even want to take into  consideration," PDS Senator Brutti says, "because we do not put  intentions on trial. We shall find out along the way." "Nothing  that is part of the state--including secret services and  security forces--may be placed at the service of anyone in  particular," Deputy Massimo D'Alema, leader of the PDS deputies,  notes. "Governments come and go, but the guarantees remain."    The Rifondazione Comunista people disagree. "The Christian  Democrats in the Palazzo Viminale [Interior Ministry] have  worked against opposition groups in the past, and such an  eventuality would therefore be nothing new," they say. "We do in  fact anticipate a climate of greater repression of the most  elementary rights."    The PDS people are cautious and the neocommunists of  Rifondazione are prepared for the worst, but the words of the  leading candidate for interior minister--the League's Roberto  Maroni--are reassuring. "The people who do have something to  fear," he says, "are those who during these past years have been  involved in cover-ups. If I go to the Viminale, I will open all  the closet doors and drag out all the skeletons: Piazza Fontana,  the Italicus massacre, the Bologna railway station, and Ustica.  We shall have the last laugh." We shall see.    Naturally, the closets that Maroni would like to open also  contain the skeletons of the intelligence services. Umberto  Bossi has never concealed his conviction that the intelligence  services have conducted operations against the League that  involved the use of unscrupulous tactics.    No matter who from the League becomes interior minister,  however, overall control of the intelligence services will  always be vested in the prime minister: that is to say, in  Silvio Berlusconi.    10. In the past, the opposition has even been able to  negotiate the choices of the majority. Now that there is genuine  bipolarity, how will the government deal with an intransigent  opposition?    "We need a genuine opposition," National Alliance Deputy  Giuseppe Tatarella says, "but I hope it will not be hard-line  and intransigent. The opposition should monitor the work of the  majority and contest it, but without any prejudices." In Great  Britain, for example, the Labor Party never conceded anything to  the Conservatives, but during the Falklands War it definitely  did not resort to any obstructionism.    The 27 March elections produced a phenomenon that was  remarkably in the Anglo-Saxon style. Deputies of the majority  glorified the role of the opposition, and members of the  opposition said: "We do not want so much as one committee  chairmanship in Parliament. They won; let them have all the  chairmanships."    In all of this fair play [preceding two words in English],  however, the guiding principle is that oversight should be the  province of the opposition. "We want the chairmanships of the  investigating committees and of the RAI oversight committee, the  intelligence overrsight committee, and all organs that enable  the minority to perform its functions," PDS Senator Massimo  Brutti says. "I agree," the MSI's Tatarella replies.    Although it has an ample majority in the Chamber of Deputies  (but a tenuous one in the Senate), the nascent government will  probably not renounce the ritual acts of seduction of the  vanquished.    In particular, the victorious coalition will assuredly try  to  win over the segment of the Popular Party (Rocco Buttiglione,  Roberto Formigoni) that leans toward the right. And as we have  already seen, the campaign of acquisition is also targeting  Mario Segni's Pact organization. For example, the tax consultant  Giulio Tremonti--a follower of the defeated leader [Segni] of  the referendum--might also be coopted into the Berlusconi  administration.</p>

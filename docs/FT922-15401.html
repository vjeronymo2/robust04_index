			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Trading places on Derby day - The battle for some key Conservative marginals NEXT door to the Tea Cosy tea rooms in the Derbyshire village of Codnor the Tory campaign headquarters for Amber Valley is preparing for another day on the stump. A Volkswagen van with two wooden garden seats bolted to the floor has been loaned as a 'battlebus'. Portraits of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and John Major stare down on the party machine - a schoolboy taking time out of lessons, a few stalwarts and a mongrel dog called Vom. His full name is Vomit and he belongs to Phillip Oppenheim who has been the sitting MP since 1983. A few miles away the process is being repeated as another group of campaigners marches out of the Labour party office in Ripley. The groups look much the same. Only the candidates differ in their dress; one wearing jeans, the other dressed quite stiffly in a buff-coloured military overcoat. It's the sort of coat that would get you past the doorman at the Carlton Club, and John Cooper, the Labour candidate, is rather proud of it. Tories can own mongrels and socialists can jut out their chins in John Major's classless society. Cooper, 33, is a barrister, playwright, and a product of comprehensive education. Oppenheim, the 37-year-old son of Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes, former minister for consumer affairs, comes from a long line of steel barons. He went to Harrow. The seat is one of a clutch of Derbyshire Tory marginals that could tumble if Labour's bandwagon is strong enough to effect an 8 per cent swing. Such a swing could also dethrone Edwina Currie in Derbyshire South and would almost certainly unseat Greg Knight in Derby North. John Beadle, Labour's veteran election agent for Derby North and Derby South (where Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, has a 3.5 per cent majority) has spelled out the importance of Derby: 'We will not get a Labour government without Labour MPs from Derby North and South.' To give Labour an overall majority at Westminster it must look a little further north to the Erewash, High Peak and Amber Valley constituencies, which all require a swing of around 9 per cent. The closeness of the race suggests High Peak and Erewash may be beyond Labour. But Oppenheim in Amber Valley is perhaps the most vulnerable of all the sitting Conservative MPs in the Derbyshire marginals, in spite of his larger majority. He, more than any of the Derbyshire Tory candidates, has enjoyed the benefits of a peculiarly Derbyshire phenomenon in the last two elections. It's called the Bookbinder factor and it is fast fading away. David Bookbinder, the man Mrs Thatcher described as her least favourite local government leader, stood down as head of Derbyshire County Council at the weekend, triggering a Tory wake and a huge sigh of relief from Labour activists as soon as they had mourned his passing. For years the Matlock-based council had waved a red rag at the Tories, starving police of resources, subsidising school dinners and closing branch libraries when faced with caps on spending. A local freesheet newspaper waged a relentless campaign against him and the taunts struck home. In a seat which Oppenheim never expected to take, he defeated Bookbinder in 1983 and increased his majority when he faced him again in 1987. How much of that vote was a reflection of Bookbinder's unpopularity with the electorate is difficult to guage but even Oppenheim concedes it must have counted for thousands rather than hundreds of votes. This time he faces a confident and purposeful candidate in Cooper, who could take the seat on a much smaller national swing to Labour. It makes Amber Valley perhaps the most vulnerable of the Derbyshire Tory seats. Its neighbour, Erewash, would need a slightly smaller swing to go to Labour. But Sean Stafford, the Labour candidate, is fighting with the handicap of being the deputy leader of the county council and with a pending court appearance on charges of making false expenses claims and perverting the course of justice which he plans to defend. The Derby Evening Telegraph has made sure that the electorate is fully aware of this local version of a double whammy. And how safe is Currie in Derbyshire South? Again, on paper it would take an 8 per cent swing to Labour for her to lose. But demographic changes in her constituency and Tory successes in the last local elections within her seat should ensure she gets back.</p>

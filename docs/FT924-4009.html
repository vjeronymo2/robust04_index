			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (3): Drawbacks of over-reliance on oil - The irony of an economy booming in the midst of political turmoil VENEZUELA represents one of Latin America's great puzzles. A country that for the last three years has enjoyed one of the fastest economic growth rates in the world is suffering political and social turmoil, two military coups in the space of a year, all supposedly because of an economic austerity programme. Yet there is little evidence of austerity. After growing 6.5 per cent in 1990 and 10.4 per cent last year, the Venezuelan economy will probably expand this year by more than 8 per cent. Growth from the third quarter last year to the third quarter this has been 10.6 per cent; in the first nine months of this year, the non-oil private sector grew by 13 1/2 per cent. President Carlos Andres Perez's first year in office, 1989, was indeed tough, with the economy shrinking by 9 per cent. Since then, however, growth has been impressive and not only to the benefit of the rich. There is strong evidence to suggest that Venezuela's poor have been significant beneficiaries too. Sales of processed foods in October were 24 per cent higher than in October 1991, and are predicted to continue to show strong growth. Unemployment has dropped by some 100,000 people on the last 12 months, to around 7.7 per cent of the workforce, ignoring an informal economy which is also said to be livelier. The government estimates that with the 170,000 people who joined the workforce over the last year, some 270,000 new jobs have been created, nearly all in the private sector. Real wages have been rising. According to the government, far from creating economic austerity, its economic reforms have unleashed the productive potential of the private sector. 'Three years down the road you can see the policy is paying off in generating higher living standards,' says Mr Ricardo Hausmann, minister of planning. These reforms - which have included the lifting of a raft of government controls on prices, foreign exchange, imports and credit - have yielded other benefits, such as a flow of new products into the Venezuelan market. Price controls, for example, discouraged pharmaceutical companies from introducing new drugs into the Venezuelan market. Now, able to set prices to make a profit, the companies are introducing new products into the country. Unsurprisingly, there are signs that the economy is overheating. Interest rates were sharply increased in October to prevent a run on the currency to levels likely to slow growth next year. The government is also behind others in Latin America in securing control over its own finances. This problem is not entirely of its own making, since it has not yet been able to secure support for tax reform proposals from a truculent Congress. A budget deficit of 3-4 per cent this year seems unlikely to be significantly improved upon next year. Although the government argues that the state oil company's borrowing should not be calculated as part of the government deficit, this is a factor which will make it difficult for the government to bring down inflation from its present level of nearly 35 per cent. Part of the problem stems from the country's historical overdependence on oil, which still accounts for four-fifths of exports and the same proportion of government revenues. As a result, the country's economic fortunes are too closely tied to the volatile oil market. This means, for example, that the government raises only 5 per cent of GDP in non-oil taxes, the rest coming from Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state oil company. So, when oil prices drop, not only does the current account swing into deficit but so do the government finances. In the 1970s, when oil prices were rising, the government used the state oil company as a milch cow; in the 1980s, it never got out of the habit. Now, however, it has some hard choices to make. The transfers to the government required of Petroleos de Venezuela threaten to become too high to sustain the company's investment programme, needed in part to ensure it is adequately equipped to meet tougher environmental standards for oil products in the US and elsewhere. The government's solution has been to slow PDVSA's investment programme, encourage more private investment in the oil industry, cut government spending in other areas and attempt to enlarge its tax take from other sources. The government has made some changes to the tax code - such as raising penalty rates for non-payment - and secured passage of a public credit law, which prevents the government from giving guarantees to public or private sector enterprises and stops the military from issuing promissory notes. Other tax changes (watered down from the government's original proposals) await approval from Congress, including a sales tax and a business assets tax. But, even if passed, most private observers say the government's estimate that the new taxes will raise 3 per cent of GDP next year is over-optimistic. It has also introduced other legislation, which would provide for a more independent central bank and speed the privatisation process, for example by allowing the sale of enterprises through capital markets. Government finances should be helped somewhat by the sharp devaluation in October of the bolivar: since much of its income is related to international oil prices, a devaluation boosts government revenues in local currency. However, partly because of the negative impact on inflation and on foreign investment (which held up remarkably well in the first half of the year despite the coup attempt), it does not provide a long-term solution. Ironically, such a solution might be simpler in Venezuela than in some other countries. Because the non-oil tax take is so low, increasing it significantly should be quite easy. Finance officials estimate that stopping tax evasion could almost double non-oil tax revenues; PDVSA reckons that charging Venezuelans international prices for gasoline (rather than the 6 1/2 US cents a litre they currently pay) would raise an extra Dollars 1.25bn a year for the oil company. The oil company estimates that fuel prices only account for 8 per cent of the cost of public transport, so the impact on the poor of a petrol price increase would be limited. If the impact on social equity was still viewed as important, subsidies for public transport - along the lines of the successful direct food subsidies for the poor that have mostly replaced generalised subsidies - could be introduced. Such solutions are, however, likely to be politically too hot to handle before next year's congressional and presidential elections.</p>

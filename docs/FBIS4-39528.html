			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/6/1994 -- "Moldovan  leadership's decision not to insist on the 14th Army's  withdrawal in the summer of 1994 during the ninth round of  negotiations is without doubt a positive fact," told BASA  Stanislav Khazheyev, defense minister of the self-proclaimed  Dniester Republic. General Khazheyev mentioned that it is unreal  for the withdrawal to take place by 1 July 1994. He said that  several years are needed for the 14th Army's withdrawal. He  also pointed out that Dniester representatives who take part in  the negotiations will have the possibility to make public their  position on this matter. Khazheyev said that he is confused  that the Dniester representatives took part in the negotiations  only as observers. "The Dniester Republic should take part in  the talks with full rights," he said. Khazheyev pointed out  that the Tiraspol Supreme Soviet's decision to pass the 14th  Army's property to Dniester will not be annulled.</p>

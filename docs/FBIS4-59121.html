			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem -- A press release issued yesterday by  Orient House [PLO headquarters in Jerusalem] says: The Israeli  authorities continue to pursue the fait accompli policy toward  Arab Jerusalem by reinforcing a series of practices aimed at  enhancing a growing settlement reality in the city at the  expense of the Arab presence. These authorities are trying to  exploit the so-called (Jerusalem day) to affirm these settlement  measures through statements that try to turn facts upside down  and ignore the reality on the ground.    Naturally, (Jerusalem day), which the Israelis celebrate,  means nothing to us other than an occasion for repeating  rejected Israeli positions that contradict the substance of the  peace process, based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338  and Resolution 252 issued on 21 May 1968. This resolution  affirmed the international community's rejection of Israeli  measures in Jerusalem and considered the city to be an integral  part of the occupied territories.    It has become obvious even to the Israelis themselves that  the political, social, and cultural reality which Jerusalem has  experienced during 27 years of occupation affirms the failure of  all Israeli attempts to unify and Judaize Jerusalem and  integrate its Arab residents. The few meters separating Arab  Jerusalem from West Jerusalem embody a vast distance as large as  the one separating myth from reality and unfounded historic  claims based on the principle of force from the brilliant  historic reality that affirms the Arab and Islamic character of  Jerusalem and the beating heart that it represents to the  Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nation.    The Palestinian side's commitment to the peace process and  the ensuing phased agreements necessarily obligates the Israeli  side to abide by the principles, steps, and measures relating to  the interim and final stages. It should stop the unilateral  Israeli measures that are liable to prejudice Palestinian  rights, especially those pertaining to Jerusalem, when the final  talks are launched. Jerusalem will be a top priority of those  talks as the political and historic capital of the future  Palestinian state.</p>

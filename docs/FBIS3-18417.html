			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Paul Edwards] </F>   [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today warned the  Serbs against any retaliatory action following the shooting down  of four of their attack aircraft.    Mr Rifkind said the action against the aircraft was sad but  the UN Security Council had given a clear warning that any use  of fixed wing aircraft for aggressive purposes would result in  that action.    Asked if he was concerned at any Serbian response, he  replied: "One has always been conscious of the fact that people  might be tempted to make any retaliatory incidents.    ``I think they should take into account that the United  Nations forces in general, and the British forces in particular,  have the means and military assets to defend themselves and  would have the full support of the British Government and the UN  as a whole if they needed to use them.''    Mr Rifkind was visiting the Royal Navy's weapons engineering  shore training establishment, HMS Collingwood, at Fareham,  Hampshire. Earlier, at the Portsmouth naval base, he met  Admiral Sir John Kerr, Commander in Chief Naval Home Command,  and other senior officers.</p>

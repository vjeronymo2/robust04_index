The Ministry, in its statement, supports all peaceful  initiatives to solve the problems on the Korean peninsula and  considers the solution of the North Korean nuclear inspection  question to be an important step toward the unification of the  Korean people.    The Ministry supports the international demand as stated in  United Nations Security Council Resolution 825 (1993) according  to which North Korea must allow international experts access to  all its nuclear sites.    The Ministry shares the concerns expressed in the IAEA  resolution of March 21, 1994 about North Korean violations on  March 13 and 14 of the agreement which had been reached on  February 15, 1994.    The Ministry finds North Korea's behavior in connection with  the inspection of its nuclear sites to be non-constructive and  serving to escalate tensions.    The Ministry supports the resolution of the resulting crisis  via negotiations, including if necessary other nations in that  region into this process.</p>

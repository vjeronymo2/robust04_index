			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Avonmouth's smelting credit Sir, In your item on the abandonment of the Pacific Zinc project at Hachinohe, Japan ('Japan zinc project is abandoned', August 10) it was stated that the imperial smelting process was developed in Australia. In fact the process was developed by our then parent company, Imperial Smelting Corporation, at Avonmouth, UK, and is now in use in 11 countries including Australia. It is used in Japan at the existing zinc smelter at Hachinohe and by Sumitomo Metal Mining at its Harima smelter. Roger Lee, Imperial Smelting Processes, Bristol BS99 7YR</p>

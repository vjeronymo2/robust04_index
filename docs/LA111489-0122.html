			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DENG TELLS VISITORS IT'S ALL OVER, BIDS GOODBY TO POLITICAL CAREER  </P> <P> Senior leader Deng Xiaoping told a visiting Japanese delegation Monday that it  was the last group of foreign visitors he will meet in his decade-old role as  China's top leader.  </P> <P> "I want to take this opportunity to formally say goodby to my political  career," Deng told the Japanese business group, according to the official New  China News Agency. "You are the last group of respected guests I will meet.  Retirement must be genuine so that new leaders will not feel embarrassment in  their work."  </P> <P> Deng, 85, formally retired Thursday from chairmanship of the Communist Party's  Central Military Commission, his last party post. Communist Party General  Secretary Jiang Zemin, 63, was named to succeed Deng in the important military  position, and Deng's comments Monday appeared to be a further attempt to boost  Jiang's political power.  </P> <P> "To practice genuine retirement, I will no longer meet visitors in the name of  the collective, the party or the state," Deng told his guests.  </P> <P> By virtue of his prestige and personal connections, Deng is widely expected to  remain China's most powerful leader for as long as he is in reasonably good  health. He also did not claim that he will no longer see foreigners under any  circumstances.  </P> <P> But Deng's statement Monday means that in meeting foreign dignitaries, he will  no longer be the official top representative of the Chinese leadership. He also  indicated that he will no longer greet foreigners at the Great Hall of the  People.  </P> <P> "It may be impolite if I refrain from meeting some old friends when they visit  China in the future," Deng said. "In that case, I can visit them at the place  where they stay. We will chat about friendship and non-political affairs. . . .  The party, government and army leaders should be given a free hand in their  work, and I will not meddle in their affairs. This is essential for their  growth and work."  </P> <P> Deng was speaking to a 35-member Japanese mission led by Ryoichi Kawai of the  Japan-China Economy and Trade Assn. The group, with representation from various  business circles, is the most high-powered Japanese business delegation to  visit China since martial-law troops were used to crush pro-democracy protests  in Beijing in early June.  </P> <P> Deng praised Jiang, an engineer and former Communist Party head in Shanghai who  was named national party chief in late June, as a "very capable man."  </P> <P> "As an intellectual, he is more knowledgeable than I," Deng said. "Of course,  he is less experienced than I because he is only 63."  </P> <P> Deng also offered a strong endorsement of China's year-old economic  retrenchment program. This program, now officially scheduled to last for at  least two more years, has been described by some foreign and Chinese analysts  as an attack on Deng's policies of market-oriented reforms.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, wire services quoted sources in Beijing as saying that the Communist  Party Central Committee has formally ousted former party chief Zhao Ziyang from  its ranks nearly six months after he was accused of supporting the student-led  democracy movement.  </P></p>

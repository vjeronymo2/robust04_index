			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Coles Myer may float NZ retail subsidiary COLES MYER, Australia's biggest retailer, is considering publicly floating Progressive Enterprises, its New Zealand subsidiary. Mr Brian Quinn, chief executive, said yesterday the company had retained C. S. First Boston as adviser for the sell-off, but Coles planned to remain the largest shareholder in Progressive. Coles acquired Progressive in 1988, and foreshadowed a public flotation at that time. The New Zealand company operates 58 supermarkets and controls about 30 per cent of that market segment in New Zealand's north island.</p>

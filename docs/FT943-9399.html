			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Unlikely asset in search for income growth  -John Gapper explains how banks' finance houses are assuming a new role, helped by structural shifts When Midland Bank's 3m credit card customers were told last month that they could lease a car for up to two years, and either return it at the end of the period or buy it for an extra fee, they were being offered more than a finance deal. It was a token of a significant change within their bank. Although the offer was made by Midland, it was structured by Forward Trust, the bank's finance house. It was the latest example of a Cinderella sector within banks assuming a new role. The results of such initiatives will be shown next Monday when Midland announces its half-year results. Forward Trust is expected to follow the lead of other bank subsidiaries which offer leasing and structured finance for personal customers and small businesses to show healthy growth in profits and assets. As banks complain of poor demand for other forms of loans, finance houses are growing in importance. Lombard North Central, National Westminster Bank's finance house, last week disclosed a 59 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 111m for the first half. This came after UDT, the motor finance house of TSB Group, reported that a 32 per cent growth in new business had helped to double interim pre-tax profits. Such figures mark a turnaround for operations which caused headaches at the turn of the decade. Lombard's profits on an Pounds 8bn book fell to just Pounds 3m in 1991. The finance houses have not only recovered from past problems, but now appear a valuable asset in banks' search for income growth. The problems of the finance houses at the turn of the decade were due to three factors: Broad-based finance houses involved in a range of operations, such as Lombard and Forward Trust, were heavily exposed to the froth of the last boom. They financed office equipment and plant leasing for smaller companies in the south-east. This meant that bad debts rose sharply in the recession. Finance houses tended to boost profits by mismatching assets and liabilities, using short-term variable rate money to fund long-term fixed rate assets. Interest rate rises in the late 1980s 'taught them they had to be a lot more careful,' says Mr Graham Picken, Forward Trust chief executive. The finance houses tended to be poorly-managed and focused businesses, which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s and allowed costs to escalate. Lombard has cut its staff from 5,500 to 4,000, in a restructuring that split its business into three operating sectors. Not all finance houses survived such travails. Mercantile Credit, Barclays' former finance house, was split in 1990 and the vehicle finance and personal sector arms were sold to GE Capital. A combination of asset re-pricing, cost-cutting and more cautious treasury policy has since enabled the survivors to re-build on a sounder footing. 'There was some re-grouping, which meant that competitive pressures lessened somewhat,' says Mr Brian Carte, chief executive of Lombard. This should logically be a good time in the cycle for finance houses, since they usually gain from small and medium-sized companies re-tooling for expansion. 'Naturally, as the economy comes out of recession, we are involved in forms of finance that go along with asset acquisition,' says Mr Carte. This effect can be seen clearly in motor finance, where the pent-up demand is emerging in higher fleet sales. Finance houses which have partnerships with big motor manufacturers have benefited. 'When the economy picks up, the car market is the first to grow,' says Mr John Davies, managing director of UDT. Yet the finance houses' success cannot simply be ascribed to a cyclical turn. Companies have been cautious about investing in new equipment, and industry figures show only a modest growth in business finance and leasing. Those involved say they are still straining to sell products. Mr John Callender, managing director of Barclays Mercantile, the bank's leasing arm, says companies are still cautious about taking on leases. 'Demand is flattish across the board, and companies are still talking about demanding higher returns before they can invest,' he says. However, finance houses appear to be gaining from some structural shifts. One is manufacturers' use of point-of-sale finance. Customers have been offered low and zero interest finance, where a finance house provides a loan, and the manufacturer pays the interest subsidy. Finance houses have started to build on this in the vehicle sector by devising structured deals similar to Midland's where customers can pay off the depreciation on cars rather than the capital sum. 'The more such deals are offered, the less banks can compete with straight loans,' says Mr Davies. Banks are happy to allow their own finance houses to offer such products, providing they can achieve a viable return. Yet they are having to strive harder to integrate the products that finance houses offer with the mainstream loans, with which branch managers are more familiar. At the moment, finance houses seem a useful asset for banks at a time when demand for most assets is slack. But there are signs of narrowing margins as the finance houses compete more strongly. 'We will probably see margins easing because there is an over-supply in the industry,' says Mr Picken.</p>

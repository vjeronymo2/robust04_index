Selman Daci was killed on the  Kosovo side of the high road, about one mile from the border  with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the centre said.    The centre also reports large-scale troop movements this  weekend by the Serbian-Montenegrin army in this southern  province of the former Yugoslavia.    In a statement sent to IRNA, the centre said that dozens of  units of the Serbian Army, including about 10 tanks and several  long-range guns walked into a village near the Kosovo capital of  Pristina last Friday, provoking the inhabitants. The units, the  statement said, were stationed in nearby hills.    The same day, heavy army units moved out of a barracks in  Prizren, near the Albanian border, while heavy weapons which had  been positioned nearby, were moved closer to the town. Other  units with 30-40 tanks and armoured vehicles moved to a village  near Podujevo, just north of Pristina, the same source said.    On Sunday afternoon, some 13 tanks, a dozen military trucks  and a large number of soldiers and officers were stationed near  the village of Komoran and there was much movement by the army  in several other places in Kosovo.    Following the abolition of the province's autonomy four  years  ago, Serbia keeps a large military and police presence to  maintain repression in Kosovo, where the population is 90 per  cent Albanian Muslim.</p>

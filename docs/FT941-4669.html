			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Arts: Monteverdi's 'Venetian Vespers' Trying to recreate the golden period of St Mark's, Venice is not easy more than three centuries later. In the 30 years Monteverdi spent there both he and the other composers wrote any amount of fine music that has come down to us, but the atmosphere of that thriving period is inevitably lost. As research delves ever deeper, so the desire increases to hear the sacred music performed within the context for which it was intended. Andrew Parrott and his Tavener Consort have been at the forefront of this movement. On Tuesday, at St John's, Smith Square, they gave what they claimed to be the first performance in modern times of the 'Venetian Vespers' set within a reconstruction of a religious service, as it might have been heard. This is not the famous Vespers of 1610, written for Mantua. Two collections were published of the church music that Monteverdi subsequently wrote in Venice, the latter in 1650 after his death. Parrott has turned to that posthumous publication and sought to fill it out with additional music to form a full Vespers service. The extra pieces include instrumental works by Cavalli, Fontana and Uccellini, and three diverse Monteverdi motets. A degree of informed guesswork is necessary to put all this in place. Suffice to say that the result is more varied than simply performing the 1650 Messa et Salmi as it stands. The concentrated thinking of the Monteverdi psalms is dispersed by light and flamboyant violin sonatas and the measured, restful sections of plainchant. Ever since the Tavener Consort's memorable recording of Bach's B Minor Mass one-to-a-part, it has been clear that Parrott favours private communing, not public celebration in the performance of religious music. His Monteverdi is naturally on the same lines (the music for Venice was written with small instrumental forces in mind). The solo singing among the Tavener Consort was modest; British singers often fail to respond to Latin languages and barely a word of the solo 'O quam pulchra es', for example, was intelligible. It is a shame that Italian musicians have played so little part in the revival of their great music. St Mark's is there, awaiting its own musical renaissance.</p>

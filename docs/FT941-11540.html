			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Sterling trades lower Rumours about the Bank of England trying to cap the rise of sterling caused the UK currency to weaken yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. The release of better than expected January UK official reserves appeared to be the cause for the pound falling below DM2.59 and Dollars 1.50 in early European trading. The currency regained some of its loss against the D-Mark, but stayed weaker against the dollar in London trading. There was little activity in the European Monetary System grid ahead of today's meeting of the Bundesbank council, which will consider whether to ease German monetary policy. With no statement forthcoming about the monthly monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, markets yesterday turned to UK reserves figures for direction. News of the figures, which were higher than forecast, pushed the pound below a key technical support level of DM2.5950, prompting further selling. One explanation for why the level of reserves caused sterling weakness was that traders saw it as evidence that the Bank of England had tried to cap sterling's appreciation. Analysts reasoned that the rise in the reserves, which are dollar denominated, showed that sterling had been sold. Mr Peter Luxton of Barclays commented: 'Although the bank says it has no formal targets for sterling, the figures do lend credence to the view that it is not happy with sterling going above DM2.60.' Others are sceptical about this explanation. Mr Gerry Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, noted: 'It may be a plausible account of why sterling weakened, but it is not a credible explanation about how the Bank behaves. I do not think the Bank believes it can influence the level of sterling for long. Also, if it wanted to talk sterling down, then you would not have Eddie George (governor of the Bank of England) going out and talking as he has been doing.' This is a reference to a speech made by Mr George on Tuesday evening, in which he said prospects for sustained output growth and gradually falling unemployment were 'better than at any time' in his 31-year professional career. Lunch-time rumours in the stock market of a possible base rate cut put further downward pressure on the pound. Few currency analysts, however, were expecting a UK rate cut to emerge from yesterday's meeting. It was noted that if Mr Clarke wishes to maintain his credibility, he needs more compelling evidence of an economic slowdown than is currently available, if he wants to justify easing rates. Mr Clarke's positive comments in recent weeks about the strength of the economic recovery have given no evidence that he wishes to reduce rates. Sterling finished weaker against all the main currencies. It lost a pfennig to close in London at DM2.5928 and was more than a cent down against the dollar at Dollars 1.495. In the absence of fresh data ahead of today's Bundesbank Council meeting, the D-Mark traded in a fairly narrow range. Opinion was evenly divided as to whether or not the central bank would relax policy. In a Reuters poll of 20 London and European-based analysts, 10 said they expected the German central bank to cut, while 10 saw no easing. Of those expecting a rate cut, seven forecast a 50 basis points reduction in both the Lombard and discount rates which, respectively, provide a ceiling and a floor between which the Bundesbank offers liquidity to the market. Mr Holtham said it would be unusual for the central bank to lower rates in the middle of annual wage talks. The Bundesbank has always taken pay negotiations as a key indicator of inflationary pressures. Although these are going well overall, the central bank is expected to wait for some higher profile unions, such as IG Metall and IG Bau, to settle before making its move. He went on to say that he did not believe German money supply figures, or perceived D-Mark weakness, were obstacles to easing policy. He noted that the dollar had fallen back from recent highs of DM1.76-77 and that there was insufficient momentum behind the currency to bother the Bundesbank. The dollar closed in New York last night at DM1.7333. After recent rises against the dollar, the yen weakened slightly yesterday to finish in London at Y108.050, from Y107.640 on Tuesday. It also ended in New York at Y108.05. Some evidence of the shape of the fiscal stimulus planned by the Japanese government emerged late yesterday. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, announced that the government proposed to implement income tax cuts totalling Y5.3trillion (million million), effective from the beginning of 1994. 'In the next three years we will see a tax revenue shortfall of Y18trn. This will increase household incomes and stimulate the economy,' said Mr Hosokawa. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 750m of late, unspecified assistance. Earlier in the day it put Pounds 219m of assistance into the market at the established rate of 5 3/8 per cent. A Pounds 300m upward revision in the expected shortage, from Pounds 900m to Pounds 1.2bn, in the early afternoon caused overnight lending rates to rise quite sharply. They climbed from the 5 1/2 - 3/4 per cent level seen in the morning to a high of 8 1/2 per cent at about 2.30pm.</p>

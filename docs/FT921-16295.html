			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: Backhanded compliments SOME there may be whose New Year resolutions revolve round weighty matters - mastering the finer points of the Maastricht summit, resolving the paradox of Schrodinger's cat or climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. Then there are those who plan to lose a stone or two, give up smoking, be a nicer person - you know the kind of thing. Me, I have just one simple resolution: I would like once, just once, to beat my husband at tennis. It is not that I do not get near to it. I do, very near. There I am almost home and dry, leading five games to one, with my serve to come, when from the other side of the net I am aware of something stirring. The unconsidered forehands, the casual cricket drives from inside the back line, the double-faults, the inadequately lifted lobs dry up - in their place comes a maddening array of what I call dirty tricks but could perhaps more sportingly be described as clever shots. There are balls hit deep to the backhand corner where they winkle out the inconsistencies in my new double-handed backhand, wicked little cuts to the front of the court that spin off side-ways and, most maddening of all, balls that stop dead in their tracks. In no time at all it is seven games to five  -to HIM. Again. With the second set he takes no chances and closes it out 6-1 or 6-2. As you can see, I need help. Two summers ago, HTSI readers may remember, I took myself off to the Pierre Barthes tennis school at Cap d'Agde where nice Alain took my game apart, pieced it together again and sent me back home. It was worth it - He with the beastly repertoire gets the odd fright or two and has to bestir himself to beat me, whereas it used to be a piece of cake. Who better to take my problem to than Roger Taylor, once the golden hope of British tennis, now sage and guru to tennis hopefuls of all levels? Chewton Glen, on the fringes of the New Forest in southern England, is the plushest of plush country house hotels. Having installed two splendid indoor courts to supplement its outdoor one it has started a programme of occasional tennis week-ends where Roger Taylor himself runs the clinics. You arrive as early as you can manage on a Friday afternoon but whatever you do try not to miss (as I did) the Friday practice session, which runs from 4 pm to 6 pm. I arrived just in time for a tip-top dinner and found some fellow pupils already discussing the finer points of each other's shots. On Saturday morning the real business begins. Four to a court, two courts in all, with Roger and Matthew Salisbury (the hotel's resident tennis supremo) in charge, the programme begins. In two groups of eight, we play for two hours in the morning, two in the afternoon. Forehand, backhand, cross-court, down-the-line, forehand, backhand, cross-court, down-the-line. Little games are played. Some points won, some lost. No white hopes of British tennis here but nor is anybody a real duffer. We all seem much of a muchness, tolerable club players all, and though I am not the best my mortal fear of being the one nobody wants to play with is not realised. Everybody is very, very keen. Nobody is there to fool about. Roger Taylor manages to seem interested in each and every one of us. Our little triumphs are greeted with delight, our difficulties taken seriously. As the weekend progresses every aspect of the game is tackled - from the proper grip for the serve (hold the racquet as if you were going to chop wood), how to add a bit of kick, where to stand in doubles. In between we head for the swimming-pool, dining-room, jacuzzi, gym, or we lie in the treatment rooms having our stiffness soothed away. The course is not cheap but then you are getting the expertise of a great player as well as the real luxury of Chewton Glen. There are, I suppose, cheaper ways of trying to improve your tennis but I cannot think of any that are more fun. And no, I haven't beaten him yet but I will, I will . . . The next two tennis week-ends at Chewton Glen with Roger Taylor will take place on February 14 and 15 and March 13 and 14. Write to Chewton Glen, New Milton, Hampshire, England BH 25 6QS. (Tel: 0425-275341.) Prices are Pounds 140 (exclusive of VAT) per person per day which includes rooms, breakfast, lunch, dinner and tuition.</p>

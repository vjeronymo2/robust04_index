			<p>BFN     [Text] Cochabamba, 19 Apr (PRESENCIA) -- The increasing use  of drugs is converting Bolivia from a producing country to a  consuming country because "drug addiction is unfortunately  consolidating itself in the country."    This comment was made by Rolando Camacho Pena, director of  the Council for the Comprehensive Prevention of Drug Abuse,  Treatment, and Rehabilitation, Copre. He stated that drug  addiction affects students in particular. He said: "For this  reason the greatest part of our effort and work is directed  toward that section of the population."    He reported that in 1990 a study was made on drug  consumption  among high school and university freshmen students. The study  revealed that the national average was 12.82 percent and that  the most affected departments were Santa Cruz and Cochabamba  with 16.39 and 16.35 percent respectively. He said: "This leads  to the conclusion that the prevention program at the school  level must be strengthened." The first Copre publication on  epidemiological studies explains drug addiction trends and  behavior patterns.    Camacho said: "Unfortunately the trend shows that drug  addiction among students is increasing. This means students are  consuming more drugs, they are more involved in drug  consumption."    The study, conducted by the Bolivian Red Cross in 1986,  showed that drug addiction was 10.32 percent. This increased to  12.82 percent in 1992. Habitual consumption [consumo habitual]  increased from 1.6 to 2.65 percent from 1986 to 1990. Camacho  added: "The problem is constantly increasing."    Camacho indicated that the studies will now be conducted  every two years because "the problem is so serious that we need  to study addiction trends and be alert for a possible epidemic  that could have catastrophic consequences for our students."    The drugs that are consumed most include the so-called legal  drugs -- alcohol and tobacco -- which form "a bridge" to the use  of other illegal drugs like cocaine and marijuana "which  seriously affect the health of the young."</p>

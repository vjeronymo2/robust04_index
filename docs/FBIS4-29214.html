			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by Minh Ha, </F> correspondent of the SAIGON GIAI PHONG, on relations between  Vietnam and Southeast Asian countries]    [Text] With the recent friendly official visit to Myanmar  [Burma] by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, our leaders have thus far  visited all countries in the Southeast Asian region, and have  laid an important foundation for a new period of cooperation  between Vietnam and countries in the region. On this occasion,  Comrade Nguyen Manh Cam, member of the Party Central Committee  Political Bureau and minister of foreign affairs granted SAIGON  GIAI PHONG an exclusive interview.    [Correspondent] Dear minister: Our leaders have visited all  countries in the Southeast Asian region, and many leaders in the  region have also visited us. Through all these high level  visits, what can we say about Vietnamese-Southeast Asian  relations, and particularly Vietnamese-ASEAN relations?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] The implementation of the foreign affairs  policy in the direction of diversification and  multilateralization has rapidly boosted our relationship with  countries in the Southeast Asian region and this will certainly  be developed even more rapidly in the period to come. The  recent visits exchanged between Vietnamese leaders and leaders  of ASEAN countries reflect the common aspiration of countries in  the region as well as ourselves to speed up the expansion of our  multifaceted cooperative relations.    The fine relations between Vietnam and Southeast Asian  countries are evidence that the current trend in the region is  cooperation for development. In parallel with the development  of bilateral relations between Vietnam and each of the Southeast  Asian countries, all ASEAN countries also wish that Vietnam will  soon become an official member of the ASEAN organization. On  our part, with positive support from ASEAN, we are taking  practical steps to prepare for full membership of ASEAN soon.  When Vietnam becomes an official ASEAN member, it will not only  consolidate and develop the bilateral and multilateral relations  between Vietnam and ASEAN, but will also contribute positively  to the trend of cooperation and development in Southeast Asia in  particular, and Asia-Pacific in general.    [Correspondent] How should Vietnam prepare to join this  organization?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] The cooperation among ASEAN members cover  many fields, not only economy and trade, but also science and  technology, culture, education, tourism, physical education,  sports, and so forth. We need to study the activities of each  of the committees and the features and magnitude of their  projects, and from there we can prepare suitable steps for each  field so that once we become a full member of ASEAN, we will be  able to integrate immediately into the smooth-running  cooperation mechanism of the organization.    We also need to study more thoroughly the operational  regulations of ASEAN in order to determine appropriate  cooperation methods that will ensure efficiency and benefits for  both our country and the countries in the region. In addition,  we should consult with and learn from the experiences of ASEAN  members -- from both their successes and failures during the  cooperation process and in the operation of national committees,  as well as the regulation and coordination of various domestic  sectors so that we can arrange our activities in accordance with  ASEAN requirements.    [Correspondent] Vietnam has become an observer of ASEAN.  What are the next steps from now until we become an official  member of ASEAN?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] Some ASEAN countries have suggested that  we  choose either one of the two following ways. The first option  is to gradually join in committees and cooperation projects, and  once we have joined all the committees and projects we would  become an official member. The other option is to join  selectively a number of committees and cooperation projects in  certain fields, then we would become an official member and  could continue to join in the remaining committees and projects.  Many friends in ASEAN countries have advised us not to pursue  perfection, and to choose the second option. I agree with that  advice.    So far, as an observer, Vietnam has joined six committees  and  five specific cooperation projects of ASEAN. We will soon be  able to officially join the organization and then we will  continue to join other cooperation projects.    [Correspondent] What will be the effects in the event of  Vietnam obtaining full ASEAN membership?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] The cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN  in general, and with each ASEAN member country, will become  closer once we become an official member of ASEAN. It will be  beneficial for both Vietnam and ASEAN, the development of our  country, and the region. It will also be an important  contribution to the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation  in the Asia-Pacific region.    [Correspondent] Is it true as somebody has suggested that if  Vietnam joins ASEAN in the current situation, it will suffer  some difficulties caused by the unequal development levels and  the different economic structures in Vietnam and ASEAN member  countries?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] It is true that there is an inequality in  economic development between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries,  but within the ASEAN organization itself the development levels  of member countries are also unequal. ASEAN member countries,  therefore, do not see it as an obstacle. In fact the  comprehensive cooperation will create conditions for  complementing each other, helping slow countries to catch up  with fast developing ones, thus boosting development in the  whole region. For that reason all ASEAN member countries have  made it clear that they wish Vietnam to become a full member of  ASEAN soon.    [Correspondent] ASEAN will become a free trade (AFTA) region  in the next ten years. How would that effect the Vietnamese  economy if by then Vietnam were still not a ASEAN member?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] When ASEAN member countries complete the  establishment of the free trade region (AFTA), all merchandise  exchanged among the countries concerned will be subjected to low  tax or be free of tax. The tax scale will be reduced to about 5  percent to nil. If by then Vietnam is still not a member of  ASEAN, we will not have those privileges, and our trade  activities will face certain difficulties as our exported goods  to ASEAN will be taxed at a higher rate, thus reducing their  competitiveness. If Vietnam is then a member of the free trade  region, the trade relations between Vietnam and ASEAN member  countries will benefit and expand speedily, thus contributing to  the development of Vietnam and other countries in the region.    [Correspondent] Dear minister, what is the role of ASEAN in  resolving common problems in the region?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] Honoring the principle of "unity in  diversity" the ASEAN member countries cooperate but respect each  other, implement joint decisions and work together but respect  the sovereignty of each country. Thanks to that principle,  ASEAN has become a regional organization, the voice of which has  carried more and more weight in international and regional  forums. It surely has a decisive role in resolving common  regional problems.    [Correspondent] Thank you, dear minister.</p>

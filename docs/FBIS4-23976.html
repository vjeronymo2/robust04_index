			<p>BFN     [Text] Returning to the country where there have been  developments in the formation of a new government following the  HCR-PT [High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament]  election of new transitional Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo, the  president of the Republic not only fulfilled his duty by signing  the ordinance to confirm the election of the new prime minister  within the deadline prescribed by the law, but he also held  private discussions with the reelected prime minister. Lumba  Nakapasa asked Kengo Wa Dondo a few questions:    [Begin recording] [Nakapasa] President Mobutu Sese Seko  received Prime Minister-elect Kengo Wa Dondo only 24 hours after  the head of state's return from Tunis. Accompanied by his only  bodyguard, the next tenant of the Hotel du Conseil spent two  good hours with Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko before sitting down to  table. These are sure signs that the heads of the two important  institutions of the transition are prepared to work well  together. Already, there is every sign that the Mobutu-Kengo  relations will be cautious and noncombattive. Kengo Wa Dondo  answers my questions:    [Kengo Wa Dondo] As you know, I was elected prime minister  on  14 June. Yesterday, the president's ordinance confirming my  election was made public. It was normal for me to meet him to  review the general situation in the country and examine the  prospects for the formation of the government of national union  that everyone is expecting.    [Nakapasa] So there will be a kind of cautious cooperation  between the two of you, cautious cohabitation, I mean.    [Kengo Wa Dondo] No, we constitute...[pauses] by recognizing  the strengths of everyone and asking for the three institutions  of the Republic -- president of the Republic, High Council of  the Republic- Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], and the  government -- to be able to cooperate. This cooperation must be  made through consultation and I think we have to respect the  provisions of the Constitution.    [Nakapasa] So when will the government be ready? After how  long? Can you give any date now?    [Kengo Wa Dondo] First, the peculiar arrangement entitles  the  political class to begin consultations at its level, then make  proposals to the prime minister. Politicians are busy holding  consultative meetings presently. We hope that over the weekend  the political parties will submit their first proposals. This  will enable us to hold discussions with everyone so that we can  successfully reach the necessary consensus on the formation of  this new government in which everyone will be involved.    [Nakapasa] This includes the ministers from what is known as  the radical wing?    [Kengo Wa Dondo] I have stretched out my hand since my  election. I will insist that everyone feel concerned about the  government. It is the only way to form a government that will  satisfy the public opinion. Where they is a will there is a way.  If there is the will, I think we will succeed.    [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, you know that the country has  suffered complete disaster. There is deterioration at all  levels. At which level will you start restructuring? In short,  what will be your priorities?    [Kengo Wa Dondo] First and foremost, I will try to restore  state authority. The state is not present everywhere. The  recovery of the economic and monetary situation depends, above  all, on state authority. The social aspect depends on the  economic one. We are first going to begin by reestablishing  state authority. We will then reorganize the economic,  financial, and monetary environments, and lastly, rehabilitate  the basic infrastructure.    [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, I can read a very great  assurance on your face. What can you do concretely in 12 months  of transition?    [Kengo Wa Dondo] I can do what the time limit permits. The  deterioration which you now deplore can be traced to the  beginning of the transition. If everything has been destroyed  in four years, then you must give minimum time to those who are  going to redress the situation. We will do everything we can to  ensure minimum recovery before the presidential, legislative,  regional, and local elections and install the institutions of  the Third Republic.    [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, to be successful, you need, I  think, the contribution of everyone at home and abroad. Is  external aid guaranteed? We know that at home for example, the  Union of Employers was very harsh about you. How is that going  to take place? Apparently, you cannot count on its support. We  can recall what everyone knows -- fiscal terrorism.    [Kengo Wa Dondo] Yes, yes, but well, actions are far from  words. We are going to invite everyone. The crisis has not  affected only a small part of the population. It has affected  everyone, and those who want to work in a sound environment must  hold dialogue with the government. The government is not  against anyone, much less the prime minister. If he wants to be  a man of consensus, he must cast his net wide. I would like to  be a man of consensus and so with everyone. We can hold  dialogue on issues on which we differ in order to reach a  compromise.    [Nakapasa] You are said to have external support. Is this  support simply imaginary or something concrete? What can be the  contribution of foreign countries by your current presence at  the head of the government of the country? What can we expect?    [Kengo Wa Dondo] First, the foreign countries can only give  us their assistance if we ourselves make an effort to ensure  minimum development and show seriousness in the management of  public affairs. Its assistance can only come as a support  afterwards. We have to make the greatest effort first. It is  our country. We must not look directly up to foreign countries.  This country is capable of being self-sufficient. Let us show  that we are capable of doing something to draw foreign countries  to our country, like it is done in other countries today.    [Nakapasa] What is the difference between the first  commissioner of state that you were and the prime minister that  you are going to be, or rather that you have become since the  presidential ordinance has been signed?    [Kengo Wa Dondo] Well, there is a lot of difference. The  prime minister is a coordinator of the executive, pardon me, the  first commissioner of state is a coordinator of the executive,  but the prime minister is head of the government and he has  special assignments that the HCR-PT member has conferred on him.  We expect to exercise all the prerogatives that the HCR-PT has  conferred on us. [end recording]</p>

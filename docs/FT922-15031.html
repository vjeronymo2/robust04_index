			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: London &amp; Manchester declines LONDON AND Manchester Group, the life assurer, yesterday reported a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 21.2m for 1991, after a Pounds 1.3m exceptional charge against losses on commercial property. The company also recorded a Pounds 15.9m extraordinary loss on commercial mortgages and property development loans - businesses which it has already withdrawn from. After tax relief Pounds 11.4m was provided in the accounts. Earnings per share were 12.87p (13.95p). As expected, the final dividend is unchanged at 9.144p for a total of 13.572p (13.32p). The percentage of the life fund allocated from policyholders to shareholders has been raised to 17.84 per cent., Mr Tom Pyne, group chief executive, said the results reflected a 15 per cent rise in net insurance earnings, the company's core business, offset by losses in commercial lending and other non-life businesses. Net new premiums rose 11 per cent, with most growth occurring from the sale of single-premium products, in line with the industry trend. However, annual premium business also recorded a modest rise. Reversionary and terminal bonuses have been cut by 3 percent on 10-year life products and by 7.5 per cent on 25-year products. The value of the life funds of London and Manchester Assurance Company, after paying bonuses to with-profits policyholders, was some Pounds 100m pre-tax in 1990 - that had grown by about 10 per cent this year. In mortgage lending, loan loss provisions for 1991 totalled Pounds 5.7m, up from Pounds 1.1m, and the operation incurred a small trading loss.</p>

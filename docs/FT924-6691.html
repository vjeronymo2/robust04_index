			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Business responds cautiously to currency flotation THE decision to let the krona float was received with surprising caution by hard-pressed corporate Sweden, with many executives worried about its long-term impact on inflation. However, industry leaders acknowledged the move would have a positive short-term effect on their exports and help them regain lost business in key markets. The fear is that Sweden will repeat the mistakes of previous devaluations and gain no long-term economic benefit. 'We must avoid the disastrous mistakes of the 1980s,' said Mr Magnus Lemmel, managing director of the Federation of Swedish Industries. He called on the government to keep in place measures to strengthen industry's competitiveness. Other industry leaders echoed his views, and suggested the high price of defending the krona might prove worthwhile if the measures adopted in Sweden's recent crisis packages wrought permanent change away from the old bias towards social welfare expenditure. Sweden's forest industry groups, badly affected by the flotation of the Finnish markka in September, will be among the main beneficiaries of yesterday's move. But Mr Jan Remrod, director general of the Swedish paper and pulp association, said: 'The important thing is that this does not lead to inflation or wage increases, and that it does not undo what we have already achieved in the way of improved efficiency.' Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said floating the krona would benefit the group, as 90 per cent of its sales were outside Sweden. He estimated that the move would result in an effective devaluation of 10 per cent. Norway's Finance Ministry and central bank responded to the Swedish crisis by standing firm on maintaining the exchange rate policy, adopted in October 1990, which pegs the Norwegian krone to the Ecu, Karen Fossli writes from Oslo. The domestic one-month money-market rate shot up to 45 per cent after Sweden's decision to float the krona, from 13.80 per cent earlier in the day. The Bank of Norway announced it was limiting overnight lending to banks from today. It said it would introduce a system under which individual banks' daily withdrawals would be limited to 50 per cent of the amount available for overnight lending. For withdrawals exceeding this amount, an extra interest rate of 40 per cent will be imposed.</p>

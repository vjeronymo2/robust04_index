			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Wellcome share offering could raise Pounds 4.5bn AN INTERNATIONAL offering of shares in Wellcome, the drug company best known for its Aids treatment Retrovir, that could raise more than Pounds 4.5bn at current prices is expected this summer. This follows a decision by Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, to sell part of its 73.6 per cent stake in the company. Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said last night that the sale would help investors who had experienced difficulty buying shares because of the limited number that were freely available. This view was echoed by Mr Paul Krikler, pharmaceutical analyst at Goldman Sachs, who said: 'This sale may well go some way to satisfying unfulfilled investor demand'. The trust may cut its stake to only 25 per cent, in which case the sale would raise more than Pounds 4.5bn. However, the offer is subject to market conditions and to the trust gaining permission from the High Court and the Charity Commissioners to reduce its holding below 50.1 per cent. The trust aims to retain at least 25 per cent of the company as a long-term holding. Wellcome yesterday confirmed market forecasts that its interim figures, to be announced on March 26, would show a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 181.2m to not less than Pounds 235m, on sales up from Pounds 731.5m to about Pounds 880m, a 20 per cent improvement. In its last financial year, to the end of August, the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 402.9m. Mr Robb said he believed the offer would enable Wellcome to build a shareholder register that more closely matched the international spread of its business. In its last financial year 44 per cent of sales and a higher proportion of profits were generated in North America, but less than 5 per cent of the shares are held there. The trust has decided that its stake in Wellcome, worth Pounds 7.1bn and providing 95 per cent of its income, is too great a concentration of its assets. Wellcome's shares yield only 1.2 per cent and the trust aims to reinvest the proceeds of the sale to earn a higher return, so making more funds available for research. The trust is budgeting to spend Pounds 100m on research this year. The trust had owned all of Wellcome's shares until the company was floated on the stock market in February 1986. At that time the whole company was valued at just over Pounds 1bn. On Friday's closing share price of 1,126p the capitalisation is Pounds 9.7bn. The shares have been boosted since flotation by Wellcome's development of Retrovir, the only widely prescribed treatment for Aids. Wellcome's biggest selling drug is Zovirax, an anti-viral drug used to treat herpes and shingles, which has just won approval in the US to treat chicken pox. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank which arranged the original flotation, has been appointed to act as global co-ordinator for the offer.</p>

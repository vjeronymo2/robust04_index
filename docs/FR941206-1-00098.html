			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The test methods and procedures described in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous section will be used to determine compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to meet the emission limits as measured by these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures would be an enforceable violation of the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits of the standard. When add-on controls are used,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring shall be capable of detecting deviations from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each applicable emission limitation or other standard with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient reliability and timeliness to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous compliance over the applicable reporting period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although the term ``continuous'' generally means at all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times, the Agency has determined that less frequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements or determinations of compliance can ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous compliance. The potential variability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions or parameters is a primary factor in establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the frequency of measurements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> G. Notification Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule would require affected sources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follow the notification requirements in &sect;&sect;63.9(a)-(d) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)-(j) of subpart A of the general provisions. In addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the initial notification requirements in &sect;&sect;63.9(b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3) of subpart A, sources would be required to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the initial notification: (1) the compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure(s) that they intend to use; (2) procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring compliance with the handling, transfer, and storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard; and (3) procedures for maintaining records. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are subject to the approval of the Administrator. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, they would be required to submit a notification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance status on a quarterly basis, with any exceedances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported on a quarterly basis. Following the first year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner or operator of a source that has had no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceedances for a full year (can be any year after the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year), may request Administrator approval to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency of notification to semiannual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> H. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule would require affected sources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follow the general recordkeeping and reporting requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;&sect;63.10(a)-(b) and (f) of subpart A of the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions. Sections 63.10(c)-(e) of subpart A do not apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless a source uses a control device to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards except for the excess emission report required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;63.10(e)(3) which applies regardless of how emissions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In addition, each owner or operator of an affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source would be required to certify annually that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel involved with coatings, thinning of coatings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keeping coating records, or handling/transferring VOHAP-containing materials have received the training required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulation. A record of the certification is required,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but no report is required. The purpose of the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to ensure that the training does occur at least once per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, and that documentation does exit for an enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official to review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Affected sources would be required to keep all records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed to demonstrate compliance with the standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including calculations and records of any Method 24 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternate VOHAP tests. All records would be compiled each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar month and compliance status determined every month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a source is required to report on a quarterly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis any exceedances to the EPA and to provide in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess emissions report the data needed to confirm and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantify the reported exceedance. All records must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained for a minimum of 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The quarterly report should include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  1. A summary of the number and duration of deviations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the reporting period classified by reason, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known causes for which a Federally-approved or promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption from an emission limitation or standard may apply;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  2. Identification of the data availability achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the reporting period, including a summary of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number and total duration of incidents during which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring protocol failed to operate in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design or produced data that did not meet minimum data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accuracy and precision requirements (classified by reason);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  3. Identification of the compliance status as of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last day of the reporting period and whether compliance was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous or intermittent during the reporting period;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  4. If, pursuant to (2) of this section, the owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator identifies any deviation as resulting from a known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause for which no Federally-approved or promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption from an emission limitation or standard applies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the monitoring report shall also include all records that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the source is required to maintain that pertain to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods during which such deviation occurred and:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  a. The magnitude of each deviation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  b. The reason for each deviation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  c. A description of the corrective action taken for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each deviation, including action taken to both minimize it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and prevent recurrence; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  d. All quality assurance activities performed on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> element of the monitoring protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=3 --> IV. Summary of Estimated Environmental, Energy, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economic Impacts of the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The nationwide impacts presented below are the impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed standards would have on existing facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of downsizing of military forces, no new major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources are expected to be built in the next five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, impacts on new sources are expected to be zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Number and Type of Affected Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Approximately 437 facilities (shipyards) are involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the construction and repair of ships nationwide. Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on industry information and data reported in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Department of Commerce's ``U.S. Industrial Outlook  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> '92_Shipbuilding and Repair'' (January 1992) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Maritime Directory Listings (June 1992). It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated that only 25 qualify as major sources of HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions and would be affected by the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

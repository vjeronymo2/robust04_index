			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 12, BNS -- The head of the Lithuanian  working group for talks with the CIS, Virgilijus Bulovas,  disagrees with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius that a  dialogue between Lithuania and Russia has been ruptured.    The prime minister expressed such a view at a press  conference in Vilnius last Thursday [7 April].    Allegations that talks with Russia broke off are unfounded,  Lithuanian TV quoted Bulovas as saying Monday.    The negotiator said Lithuanian and Russian experts, dealing  mainly with transportation problems, will be working in  Kaliningrad all this week. At the same time, an agreement on  employment of foreign citizens is being drafted and the  restoration of border between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad  region is underway. The sides also continue work on determining  the boundaries of economic zones in the Baltic sea, Bulovas said.    But Slezevicius said there has been no reply to any of his  letters to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and all  attempts to arrange a telephone conversation failed.  Lithuania's primary concern is a reciprocal agreement on the  most favored nation trade status, which is yet to be ratified by  Russia.    The Lithuanian premier said Russia carries out an aggressive  policy with respect to the Baltics. In his words, the new  Russian import-export regulations, which came into effect March  15, are "discriminatory."    The prime minister said Lithuania may respond with adequate  measures, which would primarily affect the Kaliningrad region.  Slezevicius said a possible retaliatory measure would be to  impose limitations on the supply of Lithuanian electricity to  the region.</p>

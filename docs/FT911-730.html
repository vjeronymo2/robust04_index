			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Sears warns of tough times ahead as profits drop 37% SEARS, the retailing conglo-merate, yesterday revealed a 37 per cent drop in annual pre-tax profits and warned that the difficult trading times were likely to continue. The company - which owns a host of high street stores including Selfridges, Freeman Hardy Willis, Olympus, and Adams - maintained its total dividend but gave strong hints that it would cut the pay-out this year unless the trading environment improved. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 231.4m to Pounds 146.9m in the year to January 31. Sales moved ahead marginally from Pounds 2.09bn to Pounds 2.16bn. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, the chairman, said the 'unbelievable' cost pressures in the retailing sector had worsened in the second half of the year. But rent, rates and wage pressures should begin to ease by 1992, he added. The decline in Sears' profits was mainly attributable to its withdrawal from housebuilding activities and a substantially reduced contribution from its footwear and menswear divisions. The latter two units were hit by the recession and continuing restructuring. Sears trimmed 140 shops and thousands of jobs from its footwear division and vacated 20 per cent of its floorspace. Sears said these measures had reduced the division's annual costs by Pounds 10m. Fifty shops and concessions were also cut from the menswear division, but Sears opened 139 sports and leisurewear outlets and 26 childrenswear stores. Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 75m (Pounds 95m) and Sears ended the year with 3,781 outlets. Mr Maitland Smith said real progress had been achieved by the company's womenswear, sportswear, childrenswear, home shopping, and continental European retailing operations. But in total, retailing and home shopping activities saw trading profits slip to Pounds 106.9m (Pounds 139m). Sears' property arm fell from Pounds 42.6m to Pounds 31m. Trading profits from Sears' jewellery and housebuilding activities fell sharply from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 1.7m. Sears benefited from a net exceptional item of Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 35.9m) stemming mainly from the surpluses on property disposals. But the company's withdrawal from housebuilding resulted in an extraordinary charge of Pounds 15.2m. Earnings per share fell sharply from 11.1p to 7.6p. The company proposed a final dividend of 3.83p, which leaves the the total pay-out unchanged at 5.355p. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Bangladesh to get Dollars 2.15bn Western aid donors yesterday pledged Dollars 2.15bn (Pounds 1.57bn) aid to Bangladesh, urging it to liberalise its economy further and do more to help the poor, Reuter reports from Paris. In a statement issued after a two-day meeting in Paris, donors praised Bangladesh's economic management but some had reservations about its human rights record, criticised in an Amnesty International report out yesterday. Mr Saifur Rahman, finance minister, said the aid - about Dollars 100m more than he requested - showed the donors' confidence in Bangladesh and said only one or two of the 14 countries at the meeting raised the human rights issue.</p>

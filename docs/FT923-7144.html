			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: GM plants to remain open until 1995 FIVE assembly plants in North America including two that were rumoured to be on GM's 'hit list', will remain open at least until 1995, Reuter reports from Detroit. GM officials told almost 18,000 employees affected by the decision that plants in Doraville, Georgia, Fairfax, Kansas, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and two facilities in Oshawa, Ontario, will get new products to keep them open until 1995. The Doraville and Fairfax plants were two locations that industry experts predicted GM would close as part of its massive restructuring plan announced last December. GM said the Doraville facility, near Atlanta, will convert operations in the summer of 1995 in order to build the company's next generation of minivans for the 1996 model year. It said the announcement does not protect the five plants from future closings. 'That's still an open question.'</p>

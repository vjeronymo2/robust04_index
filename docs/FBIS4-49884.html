			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China today expressed  its firm determination to take part in the world multi-lateral  trade system.    At the international symposium on China's strategy for  foreign economy and trade in the 1990s opened [as received] here  today, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said that China is  expecting to resume its status as a signatory country of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at an early date  and become a founding member of the World Trade Organization  (WTO).    In his speech, Li noted that China, along with other  countries in the world, will continue to make efforts to  strengthen a multi-lateral trade system in the world and  maintain an open world trade environment.    Li expressed his hope that on the basis of the multi-lateral  trade system, China will further its economic and trade  relations with other countries so as to make its due  contributions to the world economy.    In her report, Wu Yi, minister of Chinese foreign trade and  economic cooperation, said that China resolutely advocates the  multi-lateral trade system represented by GATT and is speeding  up negotiations on its re-entry into GATT, adding that China's  determination to re-enter GATT is firm and China has made great  efforts to this end.    In accordance with international trade norms and practices,  she said that China has conducted a series of reforms of its  foreign trade system such as the improvement of conditions on  market access and foreign trade transparency.    Wu noted that China's more open market plays an active role  in the world economy and trade, and through reforms this year,  China's economy and trade will be further brought in line with  international rules.    Wu expressed her thanks to most contracting parties who  support China for its re-entry into GATT.    Meanwhile, she hoped that some contracting parties can  realize their commitments and take action to support China in  the bid.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Branson expects to join rail-link bidder Mr Richard Branson is preparing to join one of the five consortia bidding to build the Channel tunnel high-speed rail link from London to Folkestone. He said yesterday he had been approached by all five consortia and would 'definitely' join one within the next four weeks. The winning consortium, to be selected next year, will run the British end of the joint venture with the French railway, SNCF, and the Belgian railway, SNCB. They will operate Eurostar train services from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam through the Channel tunnel. The five competing groups include consortia led by Hambros, GEC, Warburg, Salomon Brothers and Mowlem. Mr Branson said he saw 'big opportunities' for his Virgin group in operating rail routes to compete against short-haul European airline services. There were more promising opportunities for Virgin to expand in the European rail business than in the European airline sector. Speaking during his airline's inaugural flight from London to San Francisco, Mr Branson said Virgin's presence in the European rail market would complement Virgin Atlantic's long-haul airline business. 'Our idea is to be basically in the long-distance airline industry and in railway in Europe,' he said. His investment in the hotel being developed on the site of London's former County Hall building, near Waterloo station, was also tied to his ambition to enter the Channel tunnel rail business. 'County Hall is next to the new Channel tunnel terminal and would make an ideal base for our long-distance air travellers before connecting into the new Eurostar network,' he said. Mr Branson confirmed Virgin's intention to expand long-distance operations with services to Washington DC, Johannesburg, Singapore and Sydney. Virgin Travel Group, the airline's parent company, would show a small pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.5m-Pounds 3m on turnover of Pounds 405m in 1993, the company said.</p>

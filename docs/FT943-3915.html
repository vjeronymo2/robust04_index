			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Business service USAir is introducing a new service called Business Select for business-class travellers. Changes to the cabin will enable the airline to maximise revenue by converting economy-class seats into Business Select seats between flights if necessary. The size of the premium-class cabin can be expanded from the standard 10 seats to as many as 45. Business Select will go on sale on November 1. It will initially be offered on 210 daily flights serving 16 cities on the east coast of the US. USAir also announced that it will expand the size of the first-class cabin on its fleet of Boeing 737-300 long-range aircraft from eight to 12 seats.</p>

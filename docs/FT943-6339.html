			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / The FT Interview: TV thriller, back after the break - Barry Diller, chariman of QVC Barry Diller is saying No at the moment, frequently and clearly. In the past 18 months, entertainment executive Mr Diller has invested in an obscure US-based home shopping television channel called QVC and made nearly Dollars 100m. He has also failed to take over Paramount (the Hollywood studio) and has proved unable to make a merger with CBS (the US broadcaster) stick after a big QVC shareholder objected to the deal. Now, seeing no role for himself at QVC, he is about to be out of a job. Employment offers and ideas for possible deals are coming in fast and Mr Diller - for now - is saying No to them all. 'Things come up but I am trying to push opportunity away from me for at least a few months,' he says. He was being interviewed at at the Edinburgh Television Festival at the weekend - somewhere he would have preferred not to be, but he had promised to make a speech so he turned up. For the previous 10 days, Mr Diller, one of the most frenetic and forceful executives in the entertainment industry, took himself off to a beach house in California and put his career on hold. 'I want to . . . really learn from what I have just gone through,' says Mr Diller. 'The world has heard enough from me for a while. I want off stage. I want out of the light.' The reflective mood is striking from a man who has known little but success  -from creating the 'Movie of the Week' concept on US television as a young executive in the industry, to running Paramount for 10 years, to launching the Fox Television network in the US for Mr Rupert Murdoch. Now he has to come to terms with failure. 'While I have all the explanations in the world and I have learned a great deal, the fact of the matter is I did try to buy Paramount and in the end didn't, and I did merge with CBS and it got stopped and that's that,' says Mr Diller. He was more succinct in his first comments after the Paramount failure earlier this year. 'They won. We lost. Next]' he said then. But now Mr Diller feels that after a second blow - the loss of the CBS deal - it is not going to be so simple to move on. In particular, he feels he has to learn the lessons of the bruising experience of being involved in his first large-scale, hostile takeover. 'While I had been around Wall Street, I didn't really know anything about it  -about real playing and that kind of big-ticket investment banking and the arbitrageurs,' Mr Diller concedes. The 52-year-old executive, whose initial Dollars 25m stake in QVC has risen in value over the last 18 months to Dollars 118m, insists he could have bid high enough to take Paramount from Mr Sumner Redstone's Viacom broadcasting group, whose interests include the MTV channel. He simply refused to pay what he regarded as too high a price. 'I just looked at the assets and knew it wildly wasn't worth it,' says Mr Diller. He says he turned down, as too risky, a proposal to raise extra money by borrowing against QVC's future share price - which he would have had to guarantee. But the real turning point, he says, came in a meeting with 15 arbitrageurs who at the time held 30 per cent of Paramount. Mr Diller started to tell them about his plans for Paramount, but that was not what they were interested in. He remembers one saying to him: 'Stop talking to us. We don't want to hear your ideas. Give us a nickel more and we will all go home' - although, with Paramount's stock price then bouncing above Dollars 90 a share, the 5 cents was probably only a figure of speech. 'I am quite happy I didn't do it (Paramount). I am not happy with the CBS proposition,' says Mr Diller, referring to his subsequent attempt to merge with the television network in a deal that would have gone a long way towards fulfilling his ambition to run a big media concern. The main problem was that Mr Ralph Roberts, chairman of Comcast, a minority QVC shareholder, did not think a cable company such as his should be tangling with a network broadcaster. Mr Diller told Comcast that, if it wanted to stop the deal, it could always buy QVC. Mr Diller says he promised that, if it did, he would treat its bid with respect. 'They (Comcast) did. We did. Larry Tisch (chairman of CBS) walked out. It was over. Instantaneous,' says Mr Diller, in his best machine-gun delivery. Comcast was joined in taking over QVC by Liberty Media, another cable company. In his Edinburgh speech, Mr Diller managed to sum up his recent experiences with a measure of wit. With tongue firmly in cheek, he explained he was still secretly working for Mr Murdoch, and had been enormously successful in undermining the balance sheets of two major rivals, Paramount and Viacom. Getting into his stride, Mr Diller suggested in his lecture that he was 'clearly a tonic' to 'old men' in the US media industry. 'Sumner Redstone, Larry Tisch, Ralph Roberts . . . are all in their 70s, and there is no-one who can't say they haven't been rejuvenated by having me briefly in their lives,' Mr Diller said. Whose life Mr Diller will rejuvenate next is likely to remain uncertain for some time, but he has dropped two large hints about his intentions. First, he suggests that in the future he wants to be in overall charge of any project. He left Fox three years ago after telling Mr Murdoch that he wanted to be a principal and own stock in The News Corporation. Mr Murdoch said there could only be one principal in the group - himself. 'Will I or will I not work with other people?' Mr Diller asks. 'I will, or I won't . . . But one thing I doubt that I will ever do: I just don't think I will get myself in a situation where I can't prevail.' The second clue lies in his continuing interest in 'the truly radical transformation' taking place in the media industries. After leaving Fox he spent 10 months searching for a chance to exploit an undiscovered investment opportunity which ended, to the surprise of many, at QVC. He saw what no one else saw in a company that sold cheap jewellery and electronics to the US television viewer 24 hours a day - that it represented the convergence of technology that most people were only talking about. QVC uses television to stimulate consumers' interest, telecommunications to take 130,000 calls a day (and sometimes as many as 300,000), and computers to organise it all and handle the inventory and make sure goods get to customers on time. But QVC, where Mr Diller is contractually obliged to remain as chairman until December, has already begun to develop what he regards as a more powerful idea - 'smart agent technology'. This, Mr Diller explained to his audience in Edinburgh, would involve creating detailed computer profiles of the tastes and desires of individual consumers and matching the information with goods, services and information that they are likely to want. Developing such databases, he believes, will be a more effective way of trying to merge media industries and change how people behave than Hollywood studios, publishers and telephone companies trying to invade each other's territories without really knowing what they are doing. Given Mr Diller's current enthusiasm for the project it would be surprising if 'smart agents' did not pop up somewhere in his future plans - unless his period of reflection produces an even smarter idea. For now, Mr Diller will not be precise about his intentions. Apart from lying as low as possible to see what he can create from his experiences, Mr Diller is emphatic about only one thing: 'I don't know what I am going to make of it (his experience) but I hope I won't do the obvious.'</p>

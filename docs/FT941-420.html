			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dual voting system has harmful repercussions Sir, As demonstrated at last Friday's Lonrho annual meeting, even the most tin-pot dictator would be hard-pressed to come up with a voting system as undemocratic as that used by most UK companies. Using the present system, the board can choose to accept the vote at the meeting (taken on the basis of one vote per member) or to invoke the dead-weight of institutional proxies to win the vote on the basis of one vote per share. The dual voting system is a recipe for confusion and disillusion with the corporate governance process. It both disenfranchises small shareholders who know that institutional proxy votes can almost always outvote them on a poll, and dissuades institutions from exercising their votes in an informed manner independent of the board, since they know their proxy votes will remain undisclosed and unused except in the rare instances when a poll is called. In our view, the system needs to be rationalised so that one vote per share is the norm, as in the US. While this would favour institutions, the counting and disclosure of proxy votes should encourage them to develop - and publish - voting policies, as the Cadbury committee recommended. With a clearer responsibility for voting, institutional investors would devote greater efforts to scrutinising the board's proposals rather than acting as a rubber-stamp as is too often the case at present. If voting on a show of hands were abolished, small shareholders would lose some influence, but in practice their voting rights are already minimal, given the spectre of polls which can be called at the chairman's discretion. They could anyway still attend AGMs and question directors. Stuart Bell, research director, Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, Challoner House, 19-21 Clerkenwell Close, London EC1R 0AA</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Slovenia poised to clinch debt deal with banks Slovenia, the richest of the six former Yugoslav republics, is poised to reach an agreement with its commercial bank creditors on the share it will assume of former Yugoslavia's external debt. Three years after it declared independence, this is the last leg of Slovenia's struggle to disentangle itself from Yugoslavia. Negotiators from Slovenia's Ministry of Finance and central bank in New York last week met a committee of creditor banks, chaired by Chemical Bank. A deal is expected to be agreed in the next two weeks and announced at the World Bank meeting in Madrid. It must be ratified by Slovenia's parliament and banks holding the debt. Slovenia is already receiving funding from the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development but many western commercial banks are still reluctant to lend until the issue is resolved. Yugoslavia's last debt rescheduling agreement, in 1988, left the now defunct state with about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) of debt. But a debt-for-equity swap programme in 1989 and 1990 reduced this to Dollars 4.2bn of commercial bank debt and Dollars 300m of trade paper. Slovenia has already agreed to assume the part of the debt owed by Slovene banks and companies. The negotiations centre on about Dollars 1bn of non-identified debt - for which the borrower was the National Bank of Yugoslavia or another federal entity - and which cannot be traced to one of the six republics. Slovenia's negotiators want the banks to allocate the non-identified debt using the formula the World Bank employs when a country breaks up. Under this, Slovenia would assume just over 16 per cent of the non-identified debt. The creditor committee has been pressing for a higher percentage, because Slovenia and Croatia are the only two former Yugoslav republics able to restart payments.</p>

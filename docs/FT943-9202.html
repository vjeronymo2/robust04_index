			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Royal Insurance confirms recovery Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, yesterday confirmed the extent of its recent recovery when it posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 191m for the first six months, Pounds 139m more than last year. Royal's figures, which reflect buoyant trading conditions in the UK market, exceeded expectations. The insurer recorded an underwriting profit of Pounds 78m in the UK, where between 1990 and 1992 it was badly hit by heavy weather and recession-related losses. Mr Richard Gamble, group chief executive, said his company's performance was its 'best ever' in the UK, and the results were as good as those of competitors. 'We are back with the pack,' he said, adding that the group was 'better placed than ever before to maintain a disciplined approach to any change in market conditions'. UK underwriting profits from domestic (home buildings and contents) business amounted to Pounds 53m, with the company's operating ratio (claims plus expenses as a percentage of premiums) falling to 83.7 per cent from 101.5 per cent last year. In the US, Royal was hit by losses of more than Pounds 17m from the Los Angeles earthquake and a number of heavy weather claims. Total US underwriting losses were Dollars 185m (Pounds 119m) against Dollars 153m. Canadian underwriting losses fell to CDollars 32m (Pounds 15m) and the group broke even on its underwriting in other international territories. Analysts were encouraged by a higher than expected increase in the interim dividend to 4p, from 2.5p. The shares gained 6p to close at 265p. Mr Stephen Bird, an analyst with Smith New Court, said that despite this week's positive news from insurers, investors have shown little interest in the sector and still fear competition could damp profitability. Royal's worldwide general insurance premium income rose 3 per cent in underlying terms to Pounds 1.78bn. Long-term premiums fell 3 per cent to Pounds 607m. Total investment income showed a small reduction to Pounds 243m, against Pounds 245m. Worldwide new annual life premiums rose 3 per cent to Pounds 51m, with new single premiums falling 12 per cent to Pounds 282m. The group's estate agencies incurred losses of Pounds 6m and loan interest amounted to Pounds 16m. Lex, Page 14; Market, Page 32</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul anticipates easing of securities regulations Heavy arbitrage buying spurred by a stronger futures market boosted share prices, and the Nikkei index closed 1.5 per cent up, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index added 292.86 to close at the day's high of 19,633.53 after opening at a low of 19,400.58. Arbitrage linked buying supported the index, absorbing selling by institutional investors in the afternoon. Corporate profit-taking and position covering dampened buying around the 19,500 level, but continued arbitrage purchases supported the index, which closed at its highest since November 4. Volume rose to 370m shares from Wednesday's 282m. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 23.01 or 1.5 per cent at 1,545.02, while the Nikkei 300 advanced 3.84 or 1.4 per cent to 284.70. Rises led declines by 1,011 to 107, with 83 issues unchanged. Traders said that arbitrage buying both on the Nikkei 225 and Topix futures were being executed by a leading US investment house. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.23 at 1,281.60. Bank stocks were higher on arbitrage buying. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y40 to Y1,910 and Sakura Bank moved up Y10 to Y1,350. While the banking industry has been previously weak on fears of bad loans, some analysts predicted that they could perform more strongly next year on a rise in index-linked purchases. 'Stock picking is going to be harder than ever and many domestic institutions are likely to purchase the index,' said one Japanese broker. The rise in trading volumes supported brokerage stocks. Nomura Securities rose Y50 to Y2,070 and Nikko Securities added Y20 at Y1,080. Smaller houses were also stronger, with Sanyo Securities climbing Y25 to Y510. High-technology issues were bought as investors were encouraged by a stabilising currency market. Hitachi rose Y9 to Y969 on active buying by dealers and financial institutions, while Toshiba appreciated Y5 to Y704. Some drug companies, on the other hand, lost ground on profit-taking. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical and Daiichi Pharmaceutical each fell Y20 to Y2,050 and Y1,550. Japan Tobacco rose Y38,000 or 4.1 per cent to Y974,000, advancing for the fourth day and bringing its gain since last Friday to 7.3 per cent. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 231.83 to 21,327.86 in volume of 91.5m shares. Roundup On balance, share prices in the region ended on the plus side, some of them less firmly than they started. SEOUL climbed, anticipating the Finance Ministry's post- bourse announcement of measures to ease securities rules in capital markets, and the stock exchange's widening of the permissible daily band in which share prices could move, from 4.6 to 6 per cent. The composite index closed 13.34 higher at 1,040.20 as volume rose from 40.93m shares to 45.47m. The stock exchange also said it would scrap an obligation for institutions to deposit 20 per cent of the total cost when placing buy orders, effective from January 3. MANILA extended its advance to a sixth consecutive day, but profit-taking pulled back substantial early gains that followed New York's good overnight recovery. The composite index ended at 2,807.07, up 16.48, after hitting 2,834.75 at midsession. HONG KONG, too, was trimmed back by profit-taking, the Hang Seng index closing 81.10 higher at 8,412.66 after 8,460.35. Analysts said that investors, widely expecting another US rate increase in January, were unwilling to commit themselves beyond the short term. Mainland China stocks outperformed the market, the H share index rising 17.87 or 1.7 per cent to 1,087.56. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index topped 1,000, with an intraday high of 1,003.61, before profit-taking brought it back to close 12.17 or 1.2 per cent up on balance at 994.34. Brokers, however, thought that window dressing might allow the market to test the 1,000 level before the year ended. SINGAPORE saw the Straits Times Industrial index close 2.11 higher at 2,219.59 after early buying by Japanese investment trusts of blue chips took it to an intraday peak of 2,242.57. JAKARTA gained ground mainly on local buying as the JKSE index moved ahead 2.88 to 469.29. However, the market newcomer, Davamas Abadi, ended at Rp3,000 after Rp3,350, trading in more than 2m shares, compared with the IPO price of Rp3,300. KARACHI reported fresh buying, prompted by the arrival of Pakistan's president, Mr Farooq Leghari, and its prime minister, Mrs Benazir Bhutto, in the violence-plagued city. The KSE 100 index rose 27.62 or 1.4 per cent to 1,983.72. Dealers also said that reports of progress in peace talks between the government and the ethnic Mohajir National Movement had boosted investor confidence. WELLINGTON closed 1.4 per cent down in spite of Wall Street, and a Standard &amp; Poor's upgrade to AA of New Zealand's credit rating. The NZSE-40 index fell 27.22 to 1,911.05 in turnover of NZDollars 55.3m, dealers saying that a good deal of foreign selling had still been overhanging the market. Fletcher Challenge led the market down as brokers said a threatened strike in its Canadian operations could hit FCL earnings by NZDollars 10m a week. They added that there was the potential for a lengthy dispute. The shares ended 18 cents down at NZDollars 3.70. SYDNEY found enthusiasm for Wall Street's lead abating in afternoon trading, and the All Ordinaries index finished just 2.7 higher at 1,908.2 in turnover of ADollars 397.1m. A strong performance from the market leader, BHP, underpinned the market. The stock continued to find buying support following the release of strong half-year results last Friday, and finished 12 cents higher at ADollars 19.60. COLOMBO overcame year-end profit-taking. Institutional investors booked capital profits but the CSE index closed 9.13 points firmer at 979.84. TAIPEI ended below the 7,000-point level following active trade on profit-taking in textiles, the weighted index closing 44.92 lower at 6,965.68, after a day's high of 7,086.23, in turnover of TDollars 114bn.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> NO GAS OR FAST FOOD AT SITE OF NEW CENTER  </P> <P> The City Council has agreed to allow a shopping center planned for the east end  of the city to expand by 3.6 acres but refused to allow a gas station and  fast-food restaurant there.  </P> <P> The expansion of the center, which is expected to include a Ralphs market and  Thrifty Drug Store, was allowed in a 3-1 vote. Council member Henry W. Wedaa  was not present.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously against plans for a gas station and a fast-food  restaurant which, they argued, would bring commuter traffic into the city from  the Riverside Freeway.  </P> <P> "I will not vote for any gas station that invites commuters to stop and buy  gas," said Councilman Irwin Fried.  </P> <P> John O'Mara, a representative of the Costa Mesa-based Diversified Shopping  Center Inc., said that without the gas station and Carl's Jr. restaurant,  developers would "have to make some major changes to make this project fiscally  feasible."  </P> <P> About 30 residents appeared at the meeting Tuesday, and many agreed with Fried  and the other council members.  </P> <P> "These components will turn our neighborhood into a commuter pit stop," said  resident Leslie Boies.  </P> <P> But those who spoke in favor of the expansion said a large, well-planned  shopping center is needed at the corner of La Palma Avenue and Via Lomas de  Yorba East, because the nearest grocery store is more than four miles away.  </P> <P> Resident Ken Ryan said the city has a responsibility to make such amenities  available to those who live in the area. "If they weren't going to provide  these services, they shouldn't have allowed so many (housing) units in the east  end of town," he said.  </P> <P> O'Mara said the inclusion of the parcel next to the site is necessary because  it would give the center access to a side street, increasing convenience for  shoppers.  </P> <P> Councilman Mark Schwing cast the only vote against any expansion, stating that  an environmental impact report of the plans for the larger site should be  submitted to the council before any decision is made.

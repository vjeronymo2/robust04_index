			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Ruvinskiy] </F>   [Text] I have just come into the studio to report important  news to our listeners: The session of the State Duma has just  passed a resolution. According to this, four documents are  endorsed as a single package, including a resolution on an  amnesty for those who took part in the events of August 1991, 1  May 1993, and September-October 1994.    Some deputies, in particular from the Agrarian faction, the  Communist Party faction and the Liberal Democratic Party faction  have described this as the biggest occasion for celebration in  the history of the Russian state.    Other deputies, in particular those from the Russia's Choice  faction, said that this was the start of civil war in Russia.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Japan output fall points to frail economy JAPAN'S economy is bumping along the uneven bottom of the downturn which started about two years ago, according to official figures published yesterday. These showed that industrial production fell in April, reversing gains in the previous two months. Industrial output fell by 2.2 per cent in April from the month before, after rising in both March and February. Those gains had encouraged some Tokyo politicans and economists to predict the economy was starting to recover. The fall in production in April - combined with weak housing starts, which rose by 1.1 per cent from April last year, and the impact of the strengthened yen on export industries - suggest the economy remains frail. However, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry expects industrial production will start to recover from the autumn, largely because industry is finally making sustained progress in reducing its inventories of unsold products, In spite of the fall in production, inventories of unsold products fell in April by 1.7 per cent from the month before - to stand 4.9 per cent lower than April 1992. It was the fifth consecutive month in which inventories had declined. Housing starts weakened considerably from March, when they rose by 9.3 per cent, possibly influenced by the end of the financial year. April starts on houses by private individuals fell by 2 per cent from the previous month. Houses being built with loans from the private sector fell by 11.6 per cent, in part because home buyers expect mortgage rates to rise following the recent increase in the long-term prime lending rates of the long-term credit banks. Meanwhile, the Japan foreign trade council predicted that Japan's merchandise trade surplus for the year to next April would rise by 17.6 per cent from the previous year to Dollars 130bn (Pounds 83bn). Exports would rise by 6.9 per cent to Dollars 368bn, while imports would increase by only 1.9 per cent to Dollars 237.5bn.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 25 IN S. AFRICA CONSULATE PROTEST ARRESTED  </P> <P> A planned weeklong sit-in at the South African Consulate in Beverly Hills was  cut short Tuesday when a federal official placed 25 of the student protesters  under citizen's arrest for obstructing access to the facility.  </P> <P> Twenty-four juveniles and one adult member of the Los Angeles Student Coalition  were arrested shortly after noon by a member of the U.S. State Department, said  Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert P. Curtis. The protesters, who began their  sit-in Monday morning, were booked at the police station for investigation of  misdemeanor charges of obstructing a person's access to a public place, Curtis  said.  </P> <P> "When consul employees tried to enter the building, they were denied access. So  (the protesters) were advised if they did not allow them access they would be  arrested," said Curtis, who added that the students were told several times  before their arrest that they could leave the building. Instead, "they quickly  stood and blocked all the doorways," he said.  </P> <P> Although Beverly Hills police had been present at the consulate since the  sit-in began, the protesters were placed under arrest by Douglas Rosenstein, a  special agent with the Los Angeles office of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security,  after he was prevented from entering.  </P> <P> Robert Morris, special agent in charge of the bureau's Los Angeles office, said  he did not know whether consulate officials had asked Rosenstein to make the  arrest. The consulate declined to comment.  </P> <P> By 4 p.m. Tuesday, most of the juveniles had been released into the custody of  their parents, Curtis said. The one adult, Steven J. Hodges, 19, of Van Nuys,  was released on his own recognizance.  </P> <P> Coalition member Melissa Kievman said the arrests will not stop future  protests. "We'll be back. (We'll) return until the consulate is out of Los  Angeles."  </P></p>

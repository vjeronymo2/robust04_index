			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Societies battle First Option BUILDING societies are trying to fight back against the competitive threat offered by the First Option bond from National Savings, which is offering 6.34 per cent gross (4.75 per cent net) to those who invest Pounds 1,000 for a minimum period of a year. That return is beaten by the Portman society, which is paying 6.5 per cent gross (4.875 per cent net) for investments of more than Pounds 500. The rate is guaranteed for a year. Meanwhile, the Better Option bond from Bristol &amp; West, available from April 13, will guarantee 6.75 per cent gross (5.06 per cent net) for a year on deposits of more than Pounds 5,000. On amounts over Pounds 25,000, the bond will pay 7 per cent gross (5.06 per cent net); the First Option will pay 6.74 per cent gross on investments of more than Pounds 20,000. Some societies have warned that if First Option draws away their deposits, they will have to raise savings rates to compete. If that happened, mortgage rates would have to increase as well. But Ken Culley, Portman's chief executive, said: 'Both my own society, and others, are demonstrating that we are able to continue to offer attractive rates of return to savers, and talk of rising mortgage rates at this stage is premature.' A different fixed-rate option is available from Bristol &amp; West. Its escalator bond, available to those with Pounds 5,000, pays a rate of interest which is guaranteed to increase every year for five years. In the first year, the annual rate is 7 per cent gross (monthly 6.79 per cent); the second year 7.5 per cent (7.25 per cent monthly); the third year 8 per cent (7.72 per cent); the fourth year 8.5 per cent (8.19 per cent); and the fifth year 9 per cent (8.65 per cent). There is no early access, except in the case of the investor's death. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is closing its Best 90 account to new investors from April 17. The account guarantees to pay the highest 90-day rate of any top 10 building society (plus Abbey National) on amounts of Pounds 10,000, Pounds 25,000, Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 100,000. The guarantee extends until May 1994.</p>

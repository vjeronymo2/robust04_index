			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Michael Jansen in Damascus] </F>   [Text] In an interview, Dr. George Habash, leader of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), told this  correspondent why he rejected not only the Cairo Agreement on  security arrangements for the Palestinian self-rule area  concluded on Feb. 9 but also the declaration of principles  negotiated in Oslo.    The interview took place at his office in an elegant old  house in a quiet, residential quarter of this city. Dr. Habash,  well recovered from three serious strokes and sporting a  cheerful burgundy red cardigan, spoke in both Arabic and English.    The Cairo accord, which gives Israel full control of the  border crossings from Jordan and Egypt into the West Bank and  Gaza and full control of access roads to Jewish settlements with  the right to pursuit of Palestinian militants continuing their  resistance to the occupation, amounts to a "retreat for the  PLO", Dr. Habash stated, a "retreat" from its own longterm  policy of striving to secure "national rights,  self-determination, independence and the right of return" for  the Palestinian people. "The majority of Palestinians now  oppose" Mr. 'Arafat's policies, "including members of Fatah  closest to" him.    Dr. Habash's assessment of the Cairo agreement would seem to  be correct because on Feb. 10, the morning after it was signed,  a commentator on Israeli Radio said that Israel's main reason  for retaining control of the border crossings was to prevent  Palestinian expelees from exercising their right to return to  their homeland.    Mr. 'Arafat, he stated, "was being pushed by all the major  blocs and powers--Europe, the U.S., Japan--to offer more and  more concessions to achieve implementation" of the Oslo accord,  the signing of which led to the resignation of the PFLP from the  PLO Executive Committee. He was particularly critical of  Egyptian President, Husni Mubarak, who has been pressing the PLO  to make these harmful concessions, and the U.S. which, he said,  were acting "in their own interests" and not those of the  Palestinian people.    "'Arafat," Dr. Habash asserted, "had no chance to make gains  (for the Palestinian people) but could only make concessions...  all the world accepts Israel and all the world, except Israel,  accepts the right of the Palestinian people to  self-determination" but the pressure for concessions is on the  Palestinians not on Israel.    The Oslo accord, he went on, was seriously flawed because  "all the substantive issues--Jerusalem, fixing borders, the  Palestinian right of return, Israeli settlements--have been  postponed until the last minute. How long will it take to reach  agreement on these major issues when it takes so long to agree  on trivial issues."    "Even if (the Oslo accord) were to be implemented easily, it  would never solve our Palestinian problem" because it "will  never bring a just and comprehensive peace... We used to tell  'Arafat before he signed that agreement that he had to take  certain steps before signing. First, adopt a policy based on  implementation of the international legitimacy, by this I mean  the U.N. resolutions" on Palestine calling for "Israeli  withdrawal, recognition of Palestinian rights to repatriation  and compensation and so on. Second, work for Arab unity and  coordination, especially with Syria. Third, forge Palestinianian  unity and fourth, escalate the intifadah... to force Israel to  settle."    These steps, particularly his insistance on Arab unity, have  been part and parcel of Dr. Habash's strategy since he was head  of the arab nationalist movement more than 30 years ago.    Dr. Habash believed the Oslo accord would be undermined in  three ways; "the intrasigence of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin; the Likud taking power (latest polls show that it would  win an election) and development of the rejectionist camp," now  comprising ten groups based in Damascus and the occupied  territories. The main aim of this alliance is to "revitalise  the intifadah," restoring it to the high intensity of 1988-89,  concentrating on the Israeli economy when Israel suffered losses  of $3 billion. I regret to say, and I mean this, without the  armed struggle harming the Israeli economy, causing the Israeli  army physical losses, Israel will never respond to our demands."  He concluded by saying that no member of the alliance would  take part in elections to the self-governing authority scheduled  in July.    At the PFLP's office in the al-Yarmuk quarter which was once  a Palestinian refugee camp, Talal Ahmad, the official in charge  of information, stated that the rejection front, the "Alliance  of Palestinian Forces," was doing its "best to isolate 'Arafat"  and promote "democratic decision-making."    Mr. Ahmad said that the alliance had established an  executive  committee made up of one member from each group and had decided  to "reestalish a unified national command" for the intifadah and  set up a 100-member central council, comparable to that of the  PLO, consisting of two representatives from each group and  independents. Although each group would "act on its own" in the  resistance, this was "the first time we have been able to  establish such a broad coalition... previously Hamas and Islamic  Jihad refused" to cooperate with the secularists, he stated.    As long as the present confrontation between Palestinians  and  Israelis continues, the rejectionist forces would be able to  operate as usual in the territories, but, Mr. Ahmad asserted,  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord would "complicate" the  struggle because the Palestinian police would be a barrier  between the intifadah and the Israelis." This would require a  "new strategy" which was being developed.    He was not worried about the possibility that the Syrians  would curb the activities of the "alliance."    "They will keep us until the last moment" to maintain  pressure on Israel. "In any case," he went on, "we're  transferring our operational bases to the territories. We have  only our political and information offices here... our  effectiveness is not dependent on Syria,"--a point made  forcefully by the killing of two Israelis on 10 February by  Islamic Jihad and the killing of a member of an Israeli  undercover death squad by Hamas on Sunday.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Union Carbide to sell Indian unit UNION Carbide, the US chemicals group, plans to sell its controlling stake in the Indian subsidiary involved in the 1984 Bhopal poison gas disaster, AP-DJ reports. Part of the proceeds of the sale will go toward a previous pledge of Dollars 17m to fund a new hospital in Bhopal for victims of the disaster. The company said Union Carbide India, the nation's largest maker of dry cell batteries, was its last battery business. At the time of the Bhopal gas leak, it also produced chemicals for agricultural pesticides. One of those chemicals, methyl isocyanate, leaked from the plant, killing more than 3,000 people and seriously injuring 20,000. Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the company would seek 'a company or party that's in a better position than we to provide the battery business with new technologies and additional jobs.' Union Carbide said it was seeking permission from Indian regulators to sell its 50.9 per cent stake, or nearly 16.6m shares, at a price to be determined. It said a quarter of the Indian company's shares were publicly traded in Calcutta. In 1989 the company settled all civil claims in connection with Bhopal for Dollars 470m. Earlier this year, India set up five courts to process claims by the victims of the disaster. Union Carbide sold its Ever Ready/Energizer battery business in the US to Ralston-Purina in 1986.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANE MISHAP IN LONG BEACH HARBOR  </P> <P> You recently printed an article regarding an airplane crash in Long Beach  Harbor ("2 Rescued After Plane Crashes Into Ocean," Part A, June 17).  </P> <P> The author of this seems to have been misinformed; the aircraft never flew over  the beach at low attitude and swerved into the ocean.  </P> <P> The article also states that "Probert . . . told rescuers the plane may have  run out of gas. . . ."  </P> <P> I was the pilot on this aircraft and know exactly what happened -- That is, one  of the elevator control cables failed thus resulting in my having virtually no  pitch control of the aircraft. Also, there was a failure of the landing gear  system to retract as required prior to a water landing. The aircraft had 180  gallons of fuel on board upon entry into the water at Long Beach Harbor.  </P> <P> The decision to land in the water rather than continue to Long Beach Airport  was made solely upon the safety of others on the ground. That is to say, it is  better to attempt a landing in the ocean with only two lives at risk than to  fly over populated areas without assurance of not harming other people and  property.  </P> <P> RICHARD L. PROBERT  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

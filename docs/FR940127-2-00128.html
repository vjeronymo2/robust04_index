Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need to enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.

In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Service Payments made by a class under a Plan and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon written request to the Funds for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, and Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined and described in SAS No. 44 of the AICPA. The ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.

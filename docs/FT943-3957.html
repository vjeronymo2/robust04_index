			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Treasury to help axed staff on jobs The Treasury is setting up an outplacement counselling scheme to find new employment for staff made redundant in an impending shake-up. The results of a fundamental review into the Treasury's operations are expected to be delivered to Sir Terence Burns, permanent secretary, at the end of this month. It is expected to recommend staff cuts and a reduction in the Treasury's layers of management to reflect its changing role. The review, being handled by Mr Jeremy Heywood, a former principal private secretary to chancellors Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Norman Lamont, and supervised by Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, was announced in the Budget last November. Yesterday Treasury officials described as 'premature' a report that a third of its top 120 staff faced the axe. Mr Heywood has been investigating the organisation of staff and the allocation of resources inside the department. One particular challenge is to adapt the Treasury, which oversees the government's economic and budgetary policy, to decentralisation and delegation among the spending ministries. One of the aims is to place more emphasis in the Treasury on setting the agenda and getting the framework for policy right. But if this is achieved the department will be less involved in detailed supervision and second-guessing of other ministries, with the result that some officials will be surplus to requirements.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Gao Jin: "Cable TV Off Limits to </F> Overseas Firms"]    [Text] Overseas organizations and individuals will be  barred from setting up and operating cable television stations  in China, a government official said yesterday.    Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperatives in cable  television are also barred, according to Zhou Caifu, director of  the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television's cable TV division.    The ban has been stipulated in the ministry's new regulation  on cable TV management. A copy of the ruling was obtained  yesterday by China Daily.    Zhou said cable TV is an important part of the country's  radio and TV programming and should serve as the Party's and  government's propaganda tool while entertaining view. Some  foreign organizations and individuals have shown keen interest  in operating cable TV stations in the country. Their  applications have been rejected, Zhou said.    The regulation also contains stipulations on the  construction, management, technology, equipment, finance and  programmes aired by cable TV stations.    According to the regulation, no TV programmes from Hong  Kong,  Macao or Taiwan may be relayed and no satellite programmes may  be broadcast. Unauthorized overseas video tapes and movies are  forbidden on cable TV.    No reactionary, pornographic, violent programmes or  programmes harmful to the State security and social stability  may be aired.    Violators of the ministry's new regulation will face  warnings, stiff fines or punishment as stated by law.</p>

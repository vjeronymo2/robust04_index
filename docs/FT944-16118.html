			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Approval of Eli Lilly deal put off again Regulatory scrutiny of Eli Lilly's proposed Dollars 4bn takeover of PCS, a drugs distributor, was extended yesterday for a further two weeks, apparently signalling that the company and the Federal Trade Commission had failed to reach agreement on the terms of the deal, writes Richard Waters in New York. The waiting period for approval of the transaction under US anti-trust legislation had already been extended once. In a statement after the market closed yesterday, Lilly said the review would now be extended further, to October 27. 'Because of the complexity of the transaction, additional time is needed to complete the ongoing discussions between Lilly and the FTC,' it said. The regulators have been reported for some weeks to be taking a harder line on the Lilly/PCS deal than on two similar takeovers of distributors by drug manufacturers over the past year - Merck's acquisition of Medco Containment Services and SmithKline Beecham's purchase of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services. The earlier transactions received FTC approval.</p>

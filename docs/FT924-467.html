			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Switzerland There are some murky politics behind the row between Union Bank of Switzerland and Mr Christoph Blocher, the director it is trying to sack. Mr Blocher was an implacable opponent of Swiss membership of the European Economic Area which UBS actively supported in the recent referendum. But more than pride is at stake. The underlying issue is a fundamental one of corporate governance: the right of shareholders to influence corporate management. Mr Blocher's chief ally is BK Vision, the investment trust which speaks for 4 per cent of UBS shares. It was set up by Mr Martin Ebner, share analyst turned financier, who has already rattled the boards of such companies as Zurich Insurance and Roche. In choosing to fight Mr Blocher on his supposed attitude to regulation of mortgage rates and central bank independence, UBS may have chosen issues on which it can win, hobbling Mr Ebner in the process. Even so, a couple of years ago the dispute would have been unthinkable. Swiss investors are flexing their muscles more effectively than their German counterparts, who are only just beginning to clamour for shareholder rights. One reason may be Switzerland's stronger tradition of independent fund management. But companies have also - sometimes reluctantly - realised that they must become more friendly towards shareholders to attract investment capital in today's global market. Hence the fashion for abolishing non-voting participation certificates and more transparent financial reporting. The theory is that, as Switzerland falls more closely into line with international standards, its equity market could enjoy a revaluation. If anything, the no vote in the recent referendum, which has left Switzerland out in the cold, may even accelerate the process. Germany offers scope for similar valuation gains, but the need for change is less marked.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Russian officials play down size of Arctic oil spill Russian officials were yesterday divided on the seriousness of the oil spill in the Arctic region of Komi - though it now seems likely that first estimates of the size of the spill were exaggerated. Mr Alexander Shuval, press director of the Environment Ministry, said that 'This is potentially a very dangerous accident for the environment'. He said that 14,000 tonnes of oil (130,000 barrels) of oil had leaked from a ruptured pipeline in an oilfield near Uzinsk, in the north of Komi. However, in the Komi capital of Sektyvkar, Mr Anatoly Nyukin, head of the civil defence department - who also quoted the 14,000 tonne figure  - said he had not seen a single bird or fish affected by the oil spill. The effects of the oil leak had, he said, been confined to a 9km stretch of the River Kolva, which flows into the River Usa, which in turn flows into the Pechora River and thence to the Barents Sea. Mr Vyacheslav Bibikov, the republic's deputy chairman, said that 'the situation is localised and under control. We do not need any external help'. Mr Nyukin said that the very heavy rain which had burst the dam in which the oil had been held following the rupture of the pipe had spread the oil over 18 hectares of land. However, work on the polluted area had stopped its further spread, he said. US experts had estimated the leakage as up to 2m barrels (over 270,000 tonnes), ten times the Russian estimate. They also claim the rupture has not been properly repaired. Mr Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister for emergencies, said the leak had already cost Rbs62.2bn (Dollars 20.3m) to contain. A team of Russian experts has been prevented from reaching the site of the spill in the Komi republic, over 1,000 km (700 miles) north-east of Moscow, by bad weather. The pipeline, which carries oil from producing areas in the Arctic to refineries in central Russia, sprang a series of leaks in August. Western oil experts, charging that 10 per cent of Russian oil leaks away each year, said it was a disaster waiting to happen. 'Many of the (former Soviet) pipelines suffer considerable corrosion,' said Mr Egil Bergsager, of Norway's Rogalandsforskning Institute in Stavanger. 'I would not be surprised if we get more accidents like this.' The environmental group Greenpeace said Russian companies pumped oil down the damaged pipeline, although it had 'as many holes as a Swiss cheese'. The pipeline operator, Transneft denied the charge.</p>

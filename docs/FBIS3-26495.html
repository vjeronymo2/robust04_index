			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, February 8 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese delegate to  the 50th session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights stressed  here today the right to promote economic development and the  need to create a peaceful environment for development.    In his speech on the right to development, Pang Sen,  alternate representative of China to the meeting, which is under  way here, said the basic objective in realizing the right to  development is to promote economic development, particularly  that of the developing nations.    "In considering the question of the realization of the right  to development, the working group on the right to development  should face the reality of the current international economic  relations and the difficult situation of the developing  countries and should pay special attention to the development  needs of the developing countries," he said.    He noted that "the development of all countries in the world  is interrelated and the realization of the right to development  is important to both the developing and developed countries."    "With the growing interdependence of economies between all  countries, the universal significance of the realization of the  right to development is becoming more evident," he said.    The Chinese delegate also noted that given the past  experiences, the realization of the right to development is more  difficult than the universal recognition of such right.    "While the obstacles to the realization of the right to  development are various, more attention should be paid to the  elimination of the most important ones," he stressed.    "We are of the view that the working group should give  priority consideration to the elimination of those obstacles  affecting peace and stability in all countries, since economic,  social, cultural and political development of a country requires  a peaceful and stable domestic and international environment."    He pointed out that attention should be paid to the  elimination of those obstacles which affect cooperation among  states on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.    Judging from history and present reality, he said, the  unbalance in development between developing and developed  countries is mainly caused by the unfair and unjust  international economic order, while the attachment of  unreasonable conditions to economic cooperation and trade by  some developed countries has aggravated the difficulties faced  by the developing countries in development.    With respect to the relationship between democracy and  development, the Chinese delegate expressed the view that  development, democracy and human rights are mutually  complementary and mutually reinforcing.    "While political democracy, full respect of human rights of  people and perfection of rule of law are beneficial to economic  and social development, economic development could relieve  people of their poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, etc., thus  creating necessary conditions for the full and better enjoyment  of all human rights by the people," he added.    "Based on its own experience of reform and opening to the  outside world, China realizes that to achieve a steady and  sustainable development of the economy and ensure the full  enjoyment of the benefit of development by the people, a country  has to first of all maintain its national and social stability."    "It is only under this precondition can a country  concentrate  on developing its economy, raising the living standard of its  people, strengthening democracy and rule of law," he declared.    "Any unbalanced emphasis on one factor to the neglect of  another and any attempt to copy the development strategies and  political models of others which do not fit the conditions of  the country will bring unfavorable consequences to the  realization of the right to development and the full enjoyment  of various human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people,"  Pang said.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: A takeover line that hasn't found favour - Wall Street A QUESTION: how much is your house worth? Answer: What someone is prepared to pay for it. This economic saw has long been used to illustrate the laws of supply and demand in the real-world market place, and the limited use of fancy, theoretical valuations to determine what something will fetch. But it had some very contemporary relevance for Wall Street this week, in a case which rings another warning bell over the elevated state of the stock market. On Wednesday night many of America's finest brokers' analysts, as well as some prominent institutional investors, went into apoplexies over the sale of a company at a price far lower than their collective wisdom deemed it worth. The property is Centel, a big, Chicago-based local and cellular telephone company, which agreed to be taken over by Sprint, America's third largest long-distance carrier, which also has significant local telephone interests. The deal has a lot of industrial logic, for the US telecommunications industry is rapidly consolidating, thanks to technical, regulatory and financial change, as well as international competition. Smaller players, such as Centel, risk being left behind. But all this was drowned out in furious condemnation of the deal's terms. The idea is for Sprint to give Centel's investors 1.37 shares in it for every Centel share they own. Trouble is, on the basis of Sprint's price at the time the deal was announced, this values Centel stock at a mere Dollars 33.56. That compares with the Dollars 42.5 at which the shares traded immediately before the announcement. Some analysts estimate that the company could be worth more than Dollars 50 a share. Jack Frazee, the Centel chairman who put the company up for auction, at the start of this year, said in his defence that he had tried to get a better price, but this was all Sprint was prepared to offer. While other companies were interested in buying some bits of Centel, it appears no one else wanted the lot. Critics reply that no deal is preferable to one at this level, which they claim will benefit only Frazee, who stands to be combined group president. The battle is far from over. Centel needs the approval of more than half its shareholders for the merger, and they may well block it. Another, higher bidder could emerge, although the most likely candidate, local telephone group GTE, is already digesting two other large deals. It is not particularly easy for analysts to value local US telecommunications companies, partly because of the changing regulatory climate, and partly because the cellular telephone part of the business is immature, but growing rapidly. Even so, it is extraordinary for a company to be sold at a price so much at variance with market expectations, which suggests either that Centel's management is giving the company away, or that the analysts' sums arewrong. So far, Wall Street plainly believes its own: the prices of other local phone companies, particularly cellular ones, dropped after Centel's announcement, but not too sharply. This is only a storm in a telecommunications tea-cup, but it comes at a time when some of the more cautious analysts are expressing renewed concern about the fancy valuation of stocks generally - even as the Dow Jones industrial average flirts with an unprecedented 3,400. The price/earnings ratio on the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index stands at more than 25, high by historic proportions, although the ratio between the dividend yield on stocks and on 30-year Treasury bonds remains much more normal. The bull market is predicated on the assumption that the US economy is picking up steam. This week brought further evidence, in the form of strong figures for car sales and consumer confidence. Yet there are straws in the wind to suggest a market correction, or at least a marking of time, may be at hand. One is a spate of cancelled offerings of shares - albeit many of them in the troubled bio-technology sector - and the apparent acceleration of other flotations in case investors' appetites weaken. Bull market corrections sometimes occur when the interest rate cycle turns from easier money to tighter conditions, and leaks from the Federal Reserve suggest it has put on hold, at least for now, its former 'bias towards easing.' Couple that with growing Presidential election uncertainty, and there could be a considerable twinge of doubt about the real worth of the desirable property known as corporate America.

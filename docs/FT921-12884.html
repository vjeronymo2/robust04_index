			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Weakening oil prices hold BP over the barrel - The pressures behind the oil producer's cost-cutting campaign BRITISH Petroleum is poised to make substantial job cuts in its group headquarters staff as part of a cost-cutting drive. The move follows announcements late last year that the company is seeking redundancies in its chemicals and research and development divisions. The expected staff cuts come as the company is preparing to announce on February 13 its results for the fourth quarter ended December. They are likely to be the worst quarterly figures for years. If the trend continues, BP could report a loss for the current first quarter, its first such deficit. BP has been cutting jobs across the company as part of a cost reduction campaign initiated by Mr Bob Horton, chairman. But it has come under further financial pressure in the past few months as oil prices have weakened and show few signs of picking up for much of this year. 'We are looking at a number of actions this year in view of the oil price and redundancies are among them,' the company said. 'We are also looking at consolidating all of the headquarters staff in the Finsbury Circus building (BP's new HQ) and which activities can be done outside of the company.' Among the world's big oil companies, BP is one of the most exposed to fluctuations in the oil price. Mr Horton has said in the past that every Dollars 1 a barrel increase in world oil prices adds Pounds 200m to the bottom line. Oil prices have fallen almost Dollars 5 a barrel since November and look like remaining at current levels of about Dollars 18 a barrel as the industry moves into the traditionally weak spring period. 'The trouble for BP is that their whole strategy is based on the oil price moving to Dollars 25 a barrel by the second half of the 1990s,' said Mr Fergus McLeod, oil industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh, 'and that is now looking increasingly unlikely.' The weakness of the dollar against sterling has combined with the low oil price to make an even more dismal picture for BP's finances. The company sees most of its revenue in dollars, but faces rising sterling costs for North Sea operations. Sterling oil prices now stand at about Pounds 10 a barrel while the level for most North Sea operations to show a profit is Pounds 2 higher. With few signs of a rise in the oil price, Mr McLeod has cut his earnings estimate for BP this year by 48 per cent to Pounds 590m, based on an oil price forecast of Dollars 18 a barrel. The shares have fallen from more than 350p in October to yesterday's closing level of 288 1/2 p. The company's chemicals operations are looking to make cost-savings of some Dollars 150m (Pounds 83m) in the next two years and part of this will be achieved by a programme of redundancies. Similarly, BP Oil, the group's refining and marketing division, plans to save a like amount by the end of this year as part of a two-year programme which saw it reduce outgoings by Dollars 60m to the end of last year. Against this austere background, Mr Horton is finding that an expensive corporate staff of some 1,400 is becoming a heavy burden in spite of halving the headquarters' workforce in 1990 when more than 1,000 jobs were cut. BP is negotiating 400 job cuts among the 2,000 staff that work at its Sunbury research and development centre just outside London. It has launched a programme of voluntary redundancy in its chemicals division which fell into the red for the first time in 10 years in the middle of last year, amid a long-term downturn in the world chemicals business. In addition the company is rumoured to be considering job reductions and even the possible closure of its Glasgow office, which employs several thousand staff, as the centre of its European exploration activities. Low prices could push the debt-to-equity ratio higher than its current 78 per cent to 97 per cent by the year end, according to County NatWest. Cuts in cash flow could force the company to constrain capital expenditure and phase in some developments rather than invest too much up front. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimates that BP will report earnings from operations as low as Pounds 48m for the final quarter of last year, although this could be doubled by gains from asset sales. This compares with income of Pounds 456m in the fourth quarter of 1990, which received a boost from high oil prices at the onset of the Gulf conflict. In addition, the City has been revising downwards its forecasts for BP's earnings for the full year to below Pounds 1bn - a drop of between 15 and 20 per cent on 1990's level. BP earns 60 per cent of its revenues from crude oil production and suffers when prices are low. This year, the recession means that its chemicals and refining divisions will be equally hard-hit and not able to offset losses from lower crude prices.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (7): Buzzwords explained EDM: Engineering Data Management, also known as Electronic Data Management, or Engineering Document Management: a software tool to manage all product definition data (specifications, engineering drawings, analysis results, process plans, various image.) EDM helps in the passing of information between customers, suppliers, and vendors enabling various partners in the production chain to exchange any relevant data in a speedy, error-free format. CAD,CADD: Computer Aided Design, or Computer Aided Design and Drafting: these are software tools used for design for mechanical, electrical, architectural, mapping, and other such applications. SEATS: CAD installations are usually referred to as 'seats,' (eg a 10-seat system) because workstations are rarely used on a one-per-desk ratio: the 'seat' is generally a shared resource, being used by several different people within a workplace. CAM: Computer Aided Manufacturing software programs a wide range of shop floor machinery and plant to do actual physical tasks such robotic welding. This includes Numeric Control, which uses a tape of repetitive instructions to drive the machine, Computer Numeric Control, which allows for the use of variable data, and DNC, Direct Numeric Control, which is fully automated, allowing for the use of different tools in one complex task. CAPP: Computer Aided Process Planning, manufacturing methods operations times and production costs for each step in a product's manufacture, and forms the essential information links between design, capacity scheduling and production control. CAE: Computer Aided Engineering, is the process of applying software and computer tools to solve engineering problems, essentially engineering analysis, including optimisation, simulation, and other processes built on numeric calculations. CIM: Computer Integrated Manufacturing is the use of computers in every stage of the manufacturing process, where information is passed automatically from one function to another, for example, from a CAD design of a chair to the tool used to bolt its parts together, thence in to billing and financial systems, stock control, and even into user manuals. DXF: Drawing Exchange Format, Data Exchange Format, refers to the de facto standard among users of microcomputer based graphic systems, based on the AutoCAD product. IGES: Initial Graphic Exchange Specification was meant to be the standard for free translation of drawing between systems, but become too all-embracing to be easily implemented and used: many PC users find DXF more convenient. MRP: Materials Requirement Planning was one the earliest uses of production management and control, MRP II, Manufacturing Resources Planning, plans the complete logical sequence of production including the purchase of components from suppliers. PDGS: Prime Design Graphic System was developed by Ford and Computervision for the surface modelling of car bodywork. For further reading: see references on page 10.</p>

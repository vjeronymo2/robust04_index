			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: War of words erupts in Campbell bid for Arnotts ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday accused Campbell Soup, the US food group, of misleading shareholders in pursuit of its ADollars 8.80 (USDollars 6.28) a share hostile takeover bid. Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, released a letter to Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive, challenging Campbell's claims that it had provided advanced technology to the Australian company since taking a 32.9 per cent shareholding in 1985. Campbell is seeking a further 17.2 per cent shareholding, which would give it control of Arnotts, at a cost of ADollars 209m. The bid, which is subject to regulatory approval, values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn. 'Since Campbell Soup became a substantial shareholder in Arnotts, Campbell has given us no technology or other benefits of material assistance to Arnotts in its development either in Australia or internationally,' Mr Purdy said. Mr Purdy also dismissed Campbell's claims that Arnotts requires its assistance to expand into Asia. He said Arnotts had appointed representatives in three Asian countries, and was 'well advanced' in three others. 'We could undertake our Asian strategy with a range of partners. We are certainly not dependent upon Campbell Soup for our Asian strategy,' he said. Campbell, which yesterday released its official takeover document, said it intended to use Arnotts to penetrate Asian markets as part of its plans to build a global biscuit business. The group said it would assist the Australian company with technology, marketing expertise and infra-structure. The focus of the takeover battle shifts to a Sydney hotel today when Arnotts holds its annual meeting.</p>

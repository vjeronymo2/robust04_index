			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hickson focus pays dividends HICKSON International yesterday showed signs that its concentration on core chemicals manufacturing was paying dividends despite reporting profits down 14 per cent. After years of unfocused acquisitions, the Yorkshire-based chemicals group produced pre-tax profits for 1991 down Pounds 4m to Pounds 23.7m on sales down by 10 per cent at Pounds 367.4m. Earnings per share fell to 12.64p (16.42p) after last year's Pounds 70m rights issue and the sale of businesses. A proposed 5.15p final gives a maintained total payment for the year of 8p. In the latest revolving door board change, Mr Ken Schofield is stepping down as chief executive in May, after serving only 18 months in the position. An entrepreneur who sold his business to Hickson, he said he had completed the task of turning round the company and had never wanted to stay longer than necessary. He retains a 5 per cent stake in the company and is not being replaced directly. Mr Dennis Kerrison, who joined last year from Rhone Poulenc, is to become chief operating officer for the group. The group made a Pounds 2.44m exceptional charge that included an Pounds 11.7m gain on the sale of William Blythe. This was offset by a Pounds 6.56m provision to cover a potential Pounds 5m litigation relating to the supply of fire retardant chemicals in the US and a potential Pounds 1.1m cost for environmental clear-up costs in the Netherlands. Below the line, the group for the first time took a Pounds 12.7m extraordinary charge covering goodwill previously set against reserves. There were also Pounds 8.51m provisions against losses on the disposal of the Merchant Distributors division. COMMENT This year's accounts demonstrate just how dreadfully Hickson acquired businesses over the last eight years, only to have to sell them off at the bottom of the cycle. This unhappy spending binge is largely, if expensively, behind them, thanks to the efforts the new management team. Problems may remain in the applied chemicals division, which is to be split into two. But the company - which should be viewed as a growth stock starting from a smaller base rather than a recovery play - is heading in the right direction again. This year it will be helped by lower interest costs and a degree of cyclical recovery. But pre-tax profits of Pounds 35m, giving earnings of 14p and a prospective multiple of 13, suggests the group is fully valued.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The text of a letter from President Glavkos  Kliridhis to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali concerning  Rauf Denktas' second letter to the Secretary General was  released a short while ago. The full text of President  Kliridhis' letter is as follows:    Your Excellency: At 2:00 a.m. on 29 January, I received a  photocopy of a letter dated 28 January 1994 which Mr. Rauf  Denktas addressed to Your Excellency.    I would like to draw Your Excellency's attention to the fact  that the letter bears the letterhead Turkish Republic of North  Cyprus [TRNC], Office of the President, and the signature Rauf  Denktas, President.    Your Excellency is aware, of course, of Security Council  Resolution 541 of 1983 which, in paragraph one of its functional  section, deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot  authorities of the secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus;  in paragraph two it considers the declaration referred to above  as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal; and in  paragraph seven it calls upon all states not to recognize any  Cypriot state other than the Republic of Cyprus.    The Turkish side, completely ignoring Security Council  Resolution 541, not only has not withdrawn the secession action  but, what is even worse, Mr. Denktas, in complete contempt of  Resolution 541 and ignoring the Security Council, signs a letter  to the Secretary General as president of the TRNC. Mr. Denktas'  motive is obvious. He intentionally signs his letter to you as  president of TRNC in order to gain recognition of the secession,  knowing that by so doing he is violating Security Council  Resolution 541.    It is my steadfast view and position that Mr. Denktas'  letter  of 28 January 1994 constitutes another serious violation of  Resolution 541 and since I would not like to participate, either  directly or indirectly, in such a violation I must ignore  completely the existence of Mr. Denktas' letter of 28 January  1994 and its contents as well as any notification of any  information which emerges from this letter.    Therefore, I respectfully submit to you that, for the  reasons  I outlined above, the United Nations should handle Mr. Denktas'  letter dated 28 January 1994 in a similar manner.    Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of my highest  consideration.    Glavkos Kliridhis, President of the Republic of Cyprus.</p>

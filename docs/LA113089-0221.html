			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MIAMI OFFICER DEFENDS SLAYING  </P> <P> A police officer whose slaying of a black suspect set off three days of rioting  took the stand at his manslaughter trial today and said he fired because the  man was bearing down on him with his motorcycle.  </P> <P> "I turned my body to face the motorcycle. He just came straight at me with a  tremendous noise," said Officer William Lozano. "He was just aiming at me. I  was just able to turn my body, draw my gun and shoot."  </P> <P> The five-year veteran of the Miami Police Department said he thought he was  going to die and was briefly in shock.  </P> <P> After recovering, he said, he found no vital signs when he checked on the  motorcyclist. He said he noticed the man's injured passenger and radioed a  dispatcher.  </P> <P> The prosecution charges that Lozano acted with gross negligence when he shot  and killed the motorcyclist, Clement Lloyd, 23, on Jan. 16, sparking three days  of rioting in the community's black neighborhoods. The passenger, Alan  Blanchard, died the next day.  </P></p>

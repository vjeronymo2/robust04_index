			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Guilty Plea in Investment Scheme: A Venice man pleaded guilty Thursday in  federal court to bilking elderly investors out of more than $300,000 after the  stock market crash in October, 1987. Assistant U.S. Atty. David A. Katz said  John Ernest Giovanoli, 28, was soliciting investments in coins through a  "boiler room" telephone-sales scheme. After the crash, he persuaded investors  to send him their coins with a promise they would be sold at a profit in the  frenzied market. But Katz said Giovanoli pocketed the money.  </P></p>

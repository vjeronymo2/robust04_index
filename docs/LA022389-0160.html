			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING: IT WAS NO HOLIDAY FOR FISH: ANGLERS MADE HEAVY CATCHES  </P> <P> Presidents Day was no holiday for the fish.  </P> <P> Anglers who took advantage of the long holiday weekend caught a variety of fish  that put lumps into the sacks.  </P> <P> Halibut and sculpin made up most of the catches, with the deep-water rock cod  boats scoring limits on two-day trips.  </P> <P> Redondo Sportfishing's Sea Spray was drifting at Twin Roads and 18 anglers  reeled in halibut from 10 to 25 pounds.  </P> <P> Long Beach Sportfishing's Southern Cal fished Catalina Island for rock cod in  an area not fished for a month and within two hours anglers decked a limit of  cows and lings.  </P> <P> Fishing aboard the Annie B barge, Otto Koval of Long Beach was using a two-hook  leader with cut squid and reeled in two halibut.

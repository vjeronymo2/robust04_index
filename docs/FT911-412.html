			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pearson warns on first half LORD BLAKENHAM, chairman of Pearson, the publishing, banking and industrial group which owns the Financial Times, warned that first half results would be well down on the comparative period of 1990, when pre-tax profit came to almost Pounds 98m. Speaking at the annual meeting yesterday, he said trading conditions in the first quarter had been tough for the majority of the businesses.

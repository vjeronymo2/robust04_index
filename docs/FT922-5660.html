			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Nippon Oil slips despite big gain in net income NIPPON Oil, Japan's largest oil distributor, has reported a 5.9 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y44.1bn (Dollars 339.2m) due to rising personnel costs and a decrease in financial income. Sales fell by 7.5 per cent to Y2.029bn because of price cuts for petroleum products following the fall in crude oil prices. Net income, however, increased by 117.8 per cent to Y32.9bn due to the sale of a storage facility. Sales volume remained almost unchanged. Although the economic downturn weakened demand from the industrial sector, sales volumes for gasoline, kerosene and gas oil increased. Nippon Oil expects a further drop in pre-tax profits to Y40bn, while net profit will decline to Y20bn. Sales will be around Y2,000bn. Nippon Mining, the Japanese nonferrous metal processing and oil refining group, yesterday reported a 15.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y15.2bn for fiscal 1991. It said that earnings had fallen because of the sluggish performance of its metals business, which has been affected by low zinc and copper prices and the high yen. The mining division will be split off from Nippon Mining in the autumn as the company prepares to merge its affiliate Kyodo Oil and concentrate on petroleum refining. Nippon Mining said the sale of securities added Y5.3bn to the pre-tax result. Sales dropped 14.6 per cent to Y845.6bn, while net profit rose 12.09 per cent to Y9bn. It forecast that pre-tax profits would increase to Y21bn in the current fiscal year as a result of its merger in December with Kyodo Oil, while the net profit would grow to Y10.5bn. Sales are expected to climb to 1,060bn.</p>

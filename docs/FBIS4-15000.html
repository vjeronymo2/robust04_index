			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 06, BNS -- Latvia should decide on  joining to a new organization which will be formed on the basis  of the Coordinating Committee For Multilateral Strategic Export  Controls (COCOM), said Foreign Ministry official Iveta Sers, who  participated in a COCOM conference in the Hague.    The conference stated that the international political  situation underwent cardinal changes during the last years and  the cold war was over.    Consequently, COCOM states decided to alter their strategies  to sooner master the markets of ex-communist countries. But  they also intend to retain the control over the distribution of  weapons, strategic substances and technologies to the former  Warsaw Pact foes.    The old COCOM restrictions will remain in place until  September when the foundation of the new organization is  scheduled. Russia was mentioned among the main founders of the  new structure, Sers said.    The Latvian government has to decide on the participation in  this new organization yet, the Foreign Ministry said in a  statement Tuesday [5 April].    Latvia would be interested to join if the system promoted  its  foreign trade and foreign capital investment in high-tech  spheres like computer technologies and electronics.    Latvia should create its own system of exports control until  June in a bid to monitor exports of chemical, biological and  other strategic materials to prevent their abuse in military  purposes.    The implementation of the anticipated plan may be  commissioned to the Latvian Development Agency.</p>

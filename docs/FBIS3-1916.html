Before the fifth day  of the first moon was over, however, his clamorous voice once  again was heard from the southern hemisphere. It seems that  Patten has not been satisfied with his unbearable arrogance  toward the Hong Kong people and with his wanton disruption of  Sino-British cooperation. Now, he has gone so far as to issue  orders to all of Asia and has brazenly criticized the leaders of  Asian countries for committing mistakes and adopting a conceited  attitude. In fact, it is precisely Chris Patten himself who is  extremely insolent and arrogant.  <H3>  Being Extremely Dishonest for Criticizing Others Without Any  Reason </H3>   The speeches that Patten made in Australia were the same old  ones he made in the Hong Kong Legislative Council and the  British parliamentary hearing, and people once again can  perceive his dishonest character. He played with words, set up  targets for himself, made groundless criticisms, and then  extended the meanings by himself in order to refute others'  views. In his speeches, he criticized Asian countries for not  advocating democracy, and condemned this approach as "not only  erroneous, but bearing the color of pride and racial  discrimination." May we ask Mr. Patten: Which country in Asia  does not openly favor developing democracy? Is it India, the  Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Thailand, Japan, or  Singapore?    As a political system, the democratic system emerged in a  certain historical period and developed along with the advance  of society. Moreover, even in countries practicing a democratic  system, it can be different in forms. Take the Western  countries as an example. Up to now, the UK remains a  constitutional monarchy, under which the royal family not only  wields power in name, but in material life still enjoys  considerable privileges and is still supported by the taxpayers.  The United States, however, practices a presidential system.  As far as the presidential system is concerned, the one in  France is different from that in the United States, as there is  a prime minister in the French cabinet, while there is no prime  minister in the United States. With regard to the parliament,  both the UK and the United States have two houses, but the U.S.  Senate and the House of Representatives are different from the  UK's upper and lower houses in the composition of members and  possession of powers. The House of Lords in the UK, a so-called  democratic state, practices an appointment system, and only  those with titles of nobility can be appointed. Therefore, some  Asian countries' leaders -- such as Mr. Lee Kuan Yew of  Singapore and Mr. Mahathir of Malaysia -- all stressed the  different conditions in different countries, and the necessity  of practicing a democratic system that is suited to their own  countries. What mistake have they made? There are a great  variety of nationalities in the world, so differences in  politics, economics, culture, languages, and lifestyles exist  objectively among them. No one can deny this fact. What racial  discrimination is there if various countries practice the  political systems that are suitable to themselves in light of  their actual national situations? What right has Patten to make  such irresponsible remarks and unfounded charges concerning  other countries?    In his speeches in Australia, Patten once again played the  part of a human rights guardian. By quoting the remarks of  someone of his kind, Patten defended the Western countries'  interference in the internal affairs of other countries under  the cover of human rights issues. He said that "he would  recognize the sovereignty of every country," but "also would  worry about whether or not the rights human beings should enjoy  have been confirmed and respected." As the concept on human  rights is one relating to historical development, there are  varying concepts on human rights in different countries. With  regard to the concept on human rights in which people in the  West universally believe, it was founded in the "Manifesto of  Human and Civil Rights" adopted by the French Constitutional  Conference in 1789. The manifesto declares that all men are  born equal in terms of rights, which include freedom, possession  of personal property, security, freedom from oppression, and so  on. So we would like to ask Mr. Patten: Has your homeland ever  respected such rights in the past and does it do so at present?  It is not necessary to mention ancient times. Since 1789, how  many overseas colonies has Britain founded? What rights of  freedom, security, and freedom from oppression could the people  enjoy in these regions under the British colonial rule? What  were the human rights given by your ancestors, who traded in  slaves and opium? How many people did your ancestors kill in  India in the surging national independent movements in the 20th  century? How many Indians and Pakistanis were slaughtered when  you practiced "divide and rule" in India and Pakistan?    How many people have you killed in Cyprus? Will Mr. Patten  please go to have a look at the bronze statue of the independent  warrior in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia! He will complain to  you about the price the Cypriots have had to pay in striving for  independence, freedom, and human rights! Please go to visit  their museum, built in memory of their national independence!  There you can see the gallows used by the Britons to suppress  the fighters who resisted colonial rule in the name of national  independence. Please go to see Beijing's Yuanming Garden. It  will condemn the plunder caused to the most magnificent garden  in China!.... These are the human rights you have been talking  about! If you still want to argue that those were done by your  forefathers rather than by yourselves, then please see how your  own country is now treating the people of Northern Ireland who  call for the reunification of north and south. When the people  of your country took to the streets to protest the introduction  of the poll tax, how did your mounted police dash into the  crowds to trample on the masses? Again, by what virtue did you  come to Hong Kong to take up the high position, issue orders,  and receive an annual salary of several million Hong Kong  dollars, yet without paying a cent in taxes? When Patten's pet  dog was lost, he even asked the Hong Kong Police to look for it.  Now he has gone to Australia with the money of Hong Kong  taxpayers to talk a lot of nonsense! Are these what he calls  rights of equality?    Patten's dishonesty also is shown in repeatedly claiming  himself to be a guardian of Hong Kong people's interests and a  defender of their rights and freedoms. The ridiculousness of  this really is beyond description! Obviously, he is the highest  representative of colonial rule, yet he poses as a civil servant  of the people! He is obviously a dictator who concentrates all  powers in himself, (in this regard, even Martin Lee Chu-ming,  who always gives himself the airs of a democratic fighter, also  admitted this when he recently pointed out that if the political  reform package adopted by the Legislative Council fails to suit  Patten's taste, he will refuse to sign his approval and will  dissolve the Legislative Council). Patten also pretends to be a  benefactor and defender of democracy! In fact, Mr. Patten had  better give up his tricks! We need not enumerate the facts one  by one, but just read the memoir written by Mr. Graham, former  governor of Hong Kong between 1947 and 1957, in which he wrote:  "I know the officials in the Colonial Office were working  sincerely, but it was just their work. When they handled the  business of this colony, they did not feel they belonged to the  place and were in no mood for being loyal to the local people.  Although they tried their best to do their work, naturally, they  still pledged allegiance to Britain. Should a conflict of  interest arise in the critical juncture, they would sacrifice  the interests of the colony." The disclosure was made by Mr.  Graham because he was opposed to the governorship in Hong Kong  being put under the jurisdiction of the British Colonial Office.  However, no matter which office it belongs to, it is the  interests of the British empire that a Hong Kong governor will  represent. Is this not a distinctive fact?    Asia is the largest continent in the world; its land area  accounts for 28.4 percent of the land on earth, and its  population accounts for approximately 58 percent of world  population. It is the origin of the world's ancient civilized  countries (including China, India, Babylon, and Assyria). The  Asian people have made tremendous contributions to world  development and the progress of history. Now, Asia is also the  region where the economy is growing most rapidly in the world.  The governments and people of various countries in Asia are  completely capable of handling their own affairs, and they do  not need any of Patten's lectures. Patten's ideas are those of  the 17th or 18th centuries, as he even openly called on other  countries to join him in interfering in the internal affairs of  Asian countries, repeatedly sowed dissent among Asian countries  and countries in Europe, Latin America, and Africa. His  insolence, arrogance, and ignorance are, indeed, seldom seen in  the world! In fact, when Patten went to Europe in the winter of  1992 to seek support from the European countries, a leader of a  certain country said that Patten was a low-grade politician and  did not merit people's support. So what is the use of his  sowing dissent among these countries!  <H3>  Throwing Dirty Words on Others Only To Betray His Own  Ugliness </H3>   Patten admitted that he did not come to Australia by  invitation. Then why did he go and talk a lot in Australia at  this time? Apart from his usual practice of talking glibly to  mislead public opinion and persisting in his political stand of  confronting China, it is because he has been widely criticized  by Australia's public opinion recently. In particular, Mr.  Malcolm Fraser, former Australian prime minister, hating to see  him impervious to reason, has written three articles, one after  another, to criticize him. Having resented Fraser's criticism,  he not only refuted Fraser by contributing articles to  Australia's newspapers in the form of "letters from readers,"  but also made an excuse of "evading the Chinese New Year" and  went personally to Australia to throw dirty words on others.  This did not bring any honor to him except for betraying his  baseness.    He was not officially invited to visit Australia, but  requested a meeting with the Australian prime minister. Later,  he begged for support for his so-called political reform  package. When his demand was rejected, he said he had not  cherished the wish for the people's support, and that he was,  therefore, not disappointed. Such "spirit of Ah Q" is really  ridiculous [reference to Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q,"  about a peasant who interprets his defeats as moral victories].  Of course, as Patten knows nothing about Chinese literature, he  has no idea of what the "spirit of Ah Q" means.    In order to call Fraser names, Patten had no alternative but  to make use of the media in Australia. In this way, he accepted  an interview one moment and made a speech the next. However,  none of the Australians seemed to express appreciation for him.  The press also gave him the cold shoulder, and some  publications even successively criticized and sneered at him.  He was supported only by a handful of his bosom friends and the  like. It is all the more ridiculous that Patten went so far as  to attack China's investment environment in an attempt to stop  Australian businessmen from investing in China. Indeed, Patten  has resorted to every conceivable means to confront China.  Nonetheless, the entire world is very clear about the  investment environment and the market potential in China. Can  this be played down by these remarks of Patten's? As everyone  knows, the economy of Hong Kong is almost merged with that on  the mainland. Hong Kong has made considerable contributions to  the mainland's reform, opening up, and economic construction,  and in turn, the rapid economic development on the mainland has  given impetus to Hong Kong's economic growth. Thanks to this  China factor, Hong Kong's economy has been able to maintain  powerful development momentum, given the economic slowdown in  the West over the past two years. Not only is Hong Kong  optimistic about China's prospects, but the industrial and  commercial circles in the United States, Japan, and Europe --  including France, Germany, and even Britain itself -- all  express optimism about mainland China. Patten's intention of  relying on his glib tongue to defame and disrupt China's  economic construction can show only his ignorance and arrogance.  His disruption of Sino-British cooperation and his infringement  on the interests of the British industrial and commercial  circles have been condemned by people in these sectors. That is  why Patten took this opportunity to vent his anger by defaming  the economic construction in China.</p>

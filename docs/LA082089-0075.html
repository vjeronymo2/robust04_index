			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS OBJECT TO NOISE, USE OF SPRAYS AT NURSERY  </P> <P> Martha Holliman retrieved a white gallon bottle of bleach from behind her  washing machine and pointed to the thick layer of dust that had accumulated  near the cap.  </P> <P> She said she has recently been having coughing fits after being out on the  enclosed patio of her home along Stevely Avenue near Carson Street. "When I  dust out here, I have spasms," she added.  </P> <P> For 30 years, Martha Holliman said, she and her husband, James, lived  comfortably in the shady, peaceful neighborhood. Then in January, a wholesale  nursery expanded into the lot behind their back fence, an area that had been  used only as a right of way for high-voltage power lines.  </P> <P> Since then, Holliman said, the dust has been so bad that she must cover her  interior and patio furniture with plastic sheets. She said the drift from  pesticide spraying has twice nauseated her.  </P> <P> The nursery "has caused so much stress that my husband and I don't even want to  live here anymore," she said.  </P> <P> Other residents have similar complaints. One woman believes that rashes on her  face are from the pesticide; a couple, fearing that their children will be  exposed to pesticides, limit playtime in the back yard.  </P> <P> Residents said nursery workers have created dust, sang or played loud music,  honked truck horns and generally made so much racket that back-yard barbecuing  has been curtailed. Residents recently told City Councilman Les Robbins at a  community meeting that the nursery should be evicted from the right of way.  </P> <P> Robbins, whose district includes Stevely Avenue, said he will suggest Tuesday  that the full City Council request the right of way owner, the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power, to declare the nursery expansion a nuisance and  remove it.  </P> <P> But Robbins acknowledged that Los Angeles County agricultural and health  officials have found no evidence of illegal or improper practices at the  nursery. Officials have determined that the nursery uses approved pesticides  and proper spraying procedures, according to documents received by Robbins.  </P> <P> And a county Department of Health Services toxics specialist found that  Holliman's nausea "was not a true pesticide poisoning, but rather a  physiological response to an obnoxious odor."  </P> <P> The nursery's owner said he is making every effort to be a good neighbor and  has changed many operating procedures.  </P> <P> "We're willing to work with the neighbors, and we're being unfairly treated by  the councilman so he can get his name in the paper," said David Sasuga,  president of Sunrise Growers. "We're just getting a lot of bad publicity, and  we're getting unfairly persecuted here."  </P> <P> Sunrise has occupied the east bank of the San Gabriel River, just north of the  Police Pistol Club of Long Beach, for seven years. But the disputes with the  neighbors started only in January, when the nursery leased several more acres  on the west bank from the Los Angeles city department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Labored Late Into Night  </P> <P> Residents said workmen started appearing a few feet from their back fences and  labored late into the night. Some said they could actually see the vapor from  pesticide spraying wafting over their back-yard fences.  </P> <P> "It just concerns me," said Ricardo Menchaca, who lives in his Stevely Avenue  home with wife Donna and their sons, 3 years and 8 months old. "I don't know  what those chemicals can do. Without any scientific study, there is a margin of  error. What is the margin of error, and does it put children at risk?"  </P> <P> Donna Menchaca said she limits her children's back-yard activities to times of  day when she can see there is no pesticide spraying.  </P> <P> "Here we have a home, and we can't have full use of the property," she said.  </P> <P> Isabelle McBeth said that the spraying causes breathing problems and that her  sister, with whom she lives on Stevely Avenue, developed facial rashes. She  also complained about noise and dust.  </P> <P> "People can't go out and enjoy their back yards," she said. "They are seeing a  big conglomerate business out there."  </P> <P> Although many residents signed a petition against the nursery operation, owner  Sasuga said some residents have told him that they like the pretty flowers over  their back fences. He said his crews removed truckloads of debris from the  empty lot before converting it to a nursery.  </P> <P> Pesticide spraying has been cut back, a 20-foot buffer has been established  between the beds and neighbors' back fences and crews have been told not to  work late at night and to be quiet, Sasuga said. Indeed, the loudest noises in  the neighborhood Thursday morning were gunshots at the police pistol range.  </P> <P> The Department of Water and Power lease to Sunrise Growers is part of a  successful program to find suitable uses for land under power lines, said Frank  Kobashi, senior real estate officer for property management.  </P> <P> The leases not only generate revenue but keep the land free of weeds and trash,  he said.  </P> <P> "We don't intend to remove them (the nursery). They're good and competent," he  said.  </P> <P> He said Stevely Avenue residents may be so used to having the vacant lot behind  their back fences that "they consider that to be their property."  </P> <P> But department officials have decided to reject a nursery plan to expand again  to another section on the river's west bank, Kobashi said.  </P> <P> When told of the decision to limit further expansion, Sasuga said he was  disappointed. He said he intends to try to be a good neighbor, even if it means  contacting each Stevely Avenue resident and asking what he can do to allay  concerns.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>   [Text] Shijiazhuang, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- With the advent of  the Spring Festival, Chen Junsheng, head of the State Council's  Leading Group for the Economic Development of Impoverished  Areas, visited an old revolutionary base in Hebei's Fuping  county to extend his regards to local people and cadres, and to  investigate and study the problems involving economic  development in the impoverished mountainous district. He  stressed: To enable a vast, poverty- stricken, mountainous  area, particularly an old revolutionary area, shed poverty and  achieve prosperity, we must carry forward the glorious tradition  seen in the warring years of hard struggle and fearlessness in  making sacrifices, mobilize the people, change our attitudes,  recognize our superior position, lay down a sound foundation,  pay attention to education, reduce childbirth and promote  quality birth, and continually try to achieve new economic  construction success.    From 1 to 3 February, State Councillor Chen Junsheng and his  party visited Fuping County -- which in the past served for a  long time as the headquarters of the party, the government, and  the military in overseeing the border in Hebei Province -- to  call on extremely poor households and relatives of the Red Army,  and investigate work toward supporting impoverished areas in the  county. He affirmed the achievements and efforts made by local  people to banish poverty and attain prosperity. He said: The  old revolutionary area made sacrifices in building the new  China, and performed much meritorious service. While we  currently face the arduous task of transforming our landscape  and extricating ourselves from poverty, we must make further  contributions with the spirit of self-reliance, building  enterprises through big efforts and hard work. This applies to  the old revolutionary area as well as to an extensive tract of  impoverished land across the country.    Touching on problems concerning cadres in poor mountainous  area, Chen Junsheng stressed: A number of contingents of  leading cadres in the county and rural areas who are united,  progressive, and relatively stable constitute a guarantee that  the backward-looking attitude of poverty-stricken mountainous  areas will change. Only when the leading groups are stable and  powerful can we earn the confidence and arouse the enthusiasm of  the people, and only then can we concentrate on clearly  discerning our superior position, correctly choosing our own  path, formulating medium and long-term plans and earnestly  implementing them so our economy moves forward steadily and  systematically. Toward this end, various localities establish a  realistic incentive mechanism to encourage cadres to steadfastly  carry on the frontline work of supporting development of poor  areas.    Referring to efforts to improve basic production conditions  in poor mountainous areas, Chen Junsheng said: Our country is  intent on basically solving, by the end of the century, the  problem of supplying food and clothing for more than 80 million  poverty-stricken people. To do this, we will have to start with  the most basic work of moving mountains, changing the course of  rivers, and leveling the land. We must be determined to sweat  it out, to toil and moil to terrace the slopes of the land, and  to try to achieve between half a mu and one mu of terraced land  per person to become self-sufficient in grain and basic  subsistence. It is highly important that poor, mountainous  areas develop forestry, and plant forests in mountain districts.  Strenuous efforts must be made to grow grass, plant trees, and  change the ecological environment; and we must emphasize the  development of an economic forest and convert barren mountains  into green banks that will lead the people to prosperity.    Economic development of mountainous areas is inseparable  from  village and township enterprises and the export of labor. Chen  Junsheng said: To develop village and township enterprises we  must not overreach ourselves and choose grandiose projects. We  must proceed after considering local conditions and market  needs, strive to make a success of every project we start,  develop a representative product for each village and township,  and establish our own superior features and key products. To  develop village and township enterprises, we must mobilize the  local labor force and integrate it with appropriate exports of  labor. This will enable mountain people to improve their  knowledge, change their attitudes, and become information  transmitters, liaison personnel and salespeople.    Talking about departmental efforts to support the  development  of impoverished areas, he praised highly the drive by the  Peoples' Liberation Army General Logistics Department, the  Ministry of Agriculture, and the State Council's Government  Offices Administration Bureau to mobilize cadres, staff members,  and workers to donate large quantities of clothing and other  everyday items to the old revolutionary area in Fuping County,  saying that, to the people in the area, the efforts to provide  timely help to the needy and poor were like offering them  charcoal in snowy weather. He emphasized that, in addition to  providing help with "hard items" such as cash and materials,  various departments concerned must pay special attention to  providing support with "soft items" to help people to prospect  for and explore resources, design plans and systems for the  training of cadres and qualified technical personnel, and to  steadily enhance the cultural quality of workers in mountain  districts. These represented the fundamental tasks which were  crucial for generations to come.    Accompanying Chen Junsheng on the visit to Fuping County  were  Liu Jimin, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Yang  Zhong, deputy head of the State Council's Leading Group for the  Economic Development of Impoverished Area; and Li Yucai, member  of a party organization under the Ministry of Forestry.</p>

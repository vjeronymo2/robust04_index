			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Damascus: Khaddam and </F> al-Shar' Meet With Hamas Delegation"]    [Text] Damascus -- Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, representative of  the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Damascus, has told  AL-HAYAH that a Hamas leadership delegation headed by Dr. Musa  Abu-Marzuq yesterday met with Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim  Khaddam and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' separately.    Hamas sources said that the meetings, which were also  attended by Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, Political Bureau  Member Muhammad Nazzal, and Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, "covered the  latest developments relating to the Palestinian question as well  as Arab developments." The sources said that both meetings were  "warm and serious. We expressed our appreciation of the Syrian  position."    In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa said the  two  meetings dealt with "the current situation and the role of the  vital forces in facing what is going on. We heard their  (Khaddam's and al-Shar''s) views and they heard ours. The views  were responsive." He added that Hamas considered itself "to be  in a confrontation trench as an organization and considered it  (Syria) to be in the same trench as a state."    He said that the delegation of the Movement, which is  opposed  to the Oslo agreement, and al-Shar' "made a political assessment  of the current phase, future possibilities, and the position of  Hamas inside [the occupied territory]." He added: "We  explained the position of the Movement inside accurately." He  said that the discussions also broached the meeting of the 10  [Palestinian opposition] factions held yesterday evening. "We  acquainted the Syrian officials with the picture and with  possible developments. There is a clear Syrian interest in the  continuation of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces (opposed to  the Oslo agreement) and the reactivation of its role." But the  Hamas representative added that Khaddam and al-Shar' pointed out  that "the matter is up to the Alliance."    Meanwhile, sources in the Democratic Front for the  Liberation  of Palestine, led by Nayif Hawatimah, have told AL-HAYAH that  the meeting of the Central Command of the Alliance held  yesterday evening "was devoted to discussing the latest  developments in the occupied territory in light of the various  interactions taking place in Gaza and Jericho, and the role of  the opposition forces there." They added that the conferees  also discussed "the question of the municipal appointments in  the occupied territory and practical moves to foil these  appointments."</p>

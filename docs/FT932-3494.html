			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Letter: Call for a royal commission on manufacturing industry Sir, Zeneca's current difficulties with its share issue ('Dealers concerned at Zeneca outlook', June 11) is just the latest example of the chronic short-termism that plagues British industry. Here is a company at the leading edge of scientific innovation, in an industry which requires long-term investment in R&amp;D, but which also produces long-term rewards, struggling to find the capital it needs. Contrast this with the recent stock market feeding frenzy in property where investors have been fighting to get a piece of the action. How much longer are we going to have to put up with our future as an industrial nation being undermined by the operation of a completely inadequate financial system? How much longer are we going to see the share of Britain's gross domestic product produced by manufacturing continue to decline? While some sectors of our manufacturing are rightly admired, overall it is now simply too small. This is a long-term problem that requires long-term solutions and a change in attitudes. The emerging consensus on the importance of manufacturing now needs to be turned into practical action to support and sustain our industries. It is for this reason that MSF has recently proposed to the prime minister the establishment of a royal commission on manufacturing industry. Its task would be to investigate and report on the role that government can and should play in supporting manufacturing industry; lessons to be learned from abroad; structural changes needed to overcome the dominance of short-term thinking in the link between finance and productive industrial investment; establishment of an industrial system based on partnership between management and employees; and the most effective means of turning innovation, research and development into manufactured goods. There has been a large number of royal commissions this century, but not one on manufacturing - the foundation of Britain's national wealth. It is time this was remedied.

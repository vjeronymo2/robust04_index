			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / People: Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management Less than three weeks after announcing he was on the jobs market after leaving Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester stockbroker, David Adams was yesterday named private client executive director of Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management. He will start next Tuesday. Adams will oversee a network of 21 offices scattered throughout Britain's most affluent pockets and be responsible for advising and investing around Pounds 3bn on behalf of UK and international private clients. Capel acquired the network, which has 470 staff, from the National Investment Group in 1990. John Henderson, chief executive, who has been fulfilling the role himself for the past six months, says: 'We are very pleased to get someone of his calibre. We expect David to do the job in a much bigger way.' Adams, who is 50, played a central role in Manchester's emergence as a regional financial centre by offering competitive services against London firms. Now he is changing sides by moving to London - and away from Manchester for the first time in his career. But since some of Capel's offices are scattered along the M62 corridor in Cooke territory pioneered by Adams when chief executive, the north has not seen the last of him.</p>

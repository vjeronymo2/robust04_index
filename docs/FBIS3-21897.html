			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Cayman Islands Chamber of Commerce has embarked  on an ambitious new programme to assist police in the war  against drugs.    Citing drugs as the "single largest contributor to crime in  the Cayman Islands," Chamber President Mr. Roy McTaggart  announced Wednesday morning that the Chamber is going to assist  the RCIP Drugs Squad in 1994 with a minimum of CI$15,000 in  donations.    The funds will be for payments to persons providing  information leading to the arrest of drug offenders and as  additional monies (outside of government funds) for the Drugs  Squad to purchase equipment that will assist them in combating  drug traffic and traffickers.    Mr. McTaggart said the Chamber would be soliciting  contributions from its members and the general public during  1994.    To get the new programme started, Mr. McTaggart presented  Drugs Squad Chief Superintendent Trevor Cutts with a cheque for  CI$1,000 for additional equipment.    Mr. McTaggart also announced the Chamber will be encouraging  members to "establish firm drug policies for the workplace," in  1994. Results of similar programmes have shown anti-drug  measures lower employee turnover, decrease absenteeism and  result in fewer work-related accidents.    He called upon Chamber members and the public to support  police and the war on drugs.    Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts said he was not at  liberty to discuss new types of equipment to be purchased  because "I don't want to give comfort to drug dealers..."    The equipment to be purchased with the extra funds will  "help  me and my men do the job," said the Superintendent.    One piece of equipment not on the purchase list is an  Ionscan  machine. The machine is now in use by Customs and drugs squads  at most major airports in North America as a means of detecting  drugs, guns and dangerous chemicals in luggage or carried by  passengers. Superintendent Cutts said while the machine is  something he believes in, it's more suited to Customs operations  than for drugs.    But one item on his `wish list' is more officers. While many  believe drugs is the number one crime problem in Cayman, the  Drugs Squad operates with just 14 full-time personnel --  including the two superintendents -- and two uniformed officers  on loan. That's 16 people working an average of 19 hours a day  with no overtime pay. And those hours create a lot of stress on  the handful of dedicated officers on the Squad, he said. But  working hard against drugs "is the right thing to do," he added.    The Superintendent has requested an additional 10 officers  and he'll be happy with five. RCIP Commissioner Alan Ratcliffe,  however, said there is "no chance in the immediate future," that  more men will be assigned to the Squad.    The Commissioner did note that the soon-to-be formed Special  Task Force (STF) will be available for drugs squad operations if  needed.    Superintendent Cutts acknowledged the help of the Chamber is  just a start. "I'm grateful to the Chamber but I need more help  from people."    By people help, he means more information from persons in  the  districts. He needs confidential information and he deals in  confidential sources and anonymity on a full-time basis. "If we  get help from the public, we can make a dent this year" on drugs  and drug use.    The number of drug dealers in Cayman is very small and  "People know exactly who is dealing in drugs," he said.    Commissioner Ratcliffe praised these latest efforts by the  Chamber of Commerce in the fight against crime and drugs, saying  "we appreciate what the Chamber is doing."</p>

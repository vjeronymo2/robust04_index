			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Pension plan trustees scheme found wanting ONLY 3 per cent of pension schemes have appointed an independent trustee and only 7 per cent have disclosed the appointment of an independent custodian of assets, according to a survey of pensions schemes published yesterday. Forty per cent of schemes have only directors and senior employees as trustees, and only 16 per cent explicitly state that no self-investment of assets in the company's own shares takes place. The analysis covered 134 pension schemes with 2.8m members and was conducted by Clark Whitehill, the accountancy firm. It shows that 93 per cent of pension funds do not disclose whether investments are registered in the name of outside nominees in spite of a recommendation from the Commons pensions committee that they should do so. Almost 25 per cent do not distribute either full or summary accounts to members unless requested to do so. Mr Zahir Fazal, a partner with Clark Whitehill, said: 'All the evidence tends to suggest that the use of independent custodians is fairly limited.' No scheme disclosed the fees paid to professional advisers such as actuaries and auditors, or whether those advisers also served the employer. None disclosed the quorum for meetings of trustees or the majority required to reach decisions. Clark Whitehill calls for the appointment of independent trustees, clearer and more informative pension accounts and greater disclosure. Survey of Pension Scheme Accounts.

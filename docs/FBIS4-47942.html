			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 5 SAPA -- Temporary voter's cards  were issued to 3.5 million people, the South Africa Free  Elections [SAFE] fund said in a statement on Thursday [5 May].  The cards were issued by 1,500 teams of the Temporary Voter's  Card Task Force established by SAFE and the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC], assisted by the Department of Home  Affairs and the management consulting firm Xcel.    "The Department of Home Affairs had maintained that most  potential voters already had their identity documents and that  only approximately 500,000 people would need to obtain temporary  voter's cards prior to the election," the SAFE statement said.  "Representatives from SAFE, however, after investigations in  several regions, urged the IEC to focus on this issue and  predicted that millions of South Africans would be shut out of  the elections if an extraordinary effort to issue temporary  voter's cards was not made."    SAFE, a US-based organisation, said it had provided  personnel, 700 cameras and 20,000 rolls of film to the task  force. It had raised R30 million [rand] for the elections and  supported 52 voter education programmes.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: INXS' HUTCHENCE REJECTS ROCK STAR IMAGE  </P> <P> "This is what I think of rock stars," said Michael Hutchence, lead singer of  the Australian band INXS. In a gesture of disgust, he mimed spitting on the  floor of the elegant pool-side patio at a swank Beverly Hills hotel.  </P> <P> A passing waitress, apparently thinking he had actually spit, looked strangely  at him as she walked past. "She probably thinks I'm some crude rock star,"  cracked Hutchence, who probably works harder than any other rock figure at not  being like a star.  </P> <P> When Hutchence was not venting his wrath against his dreaded peers, he was  explaining why he's working with another Australian band, Max Q, whose first  album, "Max Q," has just been released on Atlantic Records -- also INXS' label.  </P> <P> Part of the time was spent clearing up misconceptions about Max Q, which plays  quirky, sociopolitical, cerebral rock that seems to be going in several  directions at once. It's not the kind of funky, danceable, straight-ahead rock  INXS is noted for. If it weren't for Hutchence's identifiable vocal style,  you'd never associate Max Q with INXS.  </P> <P> "It's not my new band, I'm still with INXS," Hutchence said. "We'll be  recording at the end of the year. The Max Q album is something I wrote and  produced with my friend Ollie Olsen and some other Australian musicians. Max Q  is a one-shot deal. The band isn't going to tour and doesn't exist beyond this  album."  </P> <P> The patio, sizzling in the afternoon sun, was empty. If it had been crowded,  Hutchence would have undoubtedly been recognized -- just like any other  high-profile rock star. That would have really made him angry.  </P> <P> "I don't get recognized much, thank God," said Hutchence, 29, who's one of  those handsome, moody, mercurial types who seem to be a magnet for women.  "That's because I don't ask for it. Rock stars walk around with an entourage of  bodyguards, supposedly to protect themselves from the fans. Actually, they're  looking to be recognized. Rock stars are the saddest people in the world.  </P> <P> "They're neurotic idiots -- jerks. They're adolescents who never grew up. If  the kids really knew what these people were like, they wouldn't idolize them,  they'd throw up. These are decadent people. I've lived a more decadent life  than I've told anybody, but decadence isn't a way of life for me. Rock stars  are horrible people. Being a street cleaner or a baker are more honorable  professions."  </P> <P> Max Q came about as the result of Hutchence meeting Olsen during the filming of  the 1986 Australian movie "Dogs in Space." Hutchence was the star and Olsen the  musical supervisor. A single from the sound track, "Rooms for the Memory," an  Olsen composition that Hutchence sings, was a hit in Australia, and they  decided to work together again later on.  </P> <P> Hutchence didn't have time until earlier this year, following the INXS world  tour promoting the band's last album, "Kick," a multimillion seller that  elevated INXS to superstar status.  </P> <P> In Max Q, Hutchence is matched with Olsen and some of his underground rock  friends -- just the kind of unpredictable and unexpected combination that  Hutchence relishes.  </P> <P> "Ollie isn't supposed to hang around with pop stars and I'm not supposed to  hang around with punk types," Hutchence said. "The band is made up of rowdy  friends from Melbourne. These guys are good musicians who've never had a  chance. Most of them have never even been in a studio. These are real  underground people who don't have any money. Some of them have never been on a  plane before. They were worried that working with me, they'd lose their  underground status.  </P> <P> "This album is a meeting of the alter egos. Ollie is this underground musician  living out his pop fantasy. That's his alter ego. I'm getting a chance to do  something totally different, working with underground musicians. That's my  alter-ego thing."  </P> <P> Hutchence started the project with his own money, but Atlantic decided to  release it. According to Hutchence, label executives were skeptical after they  found out his name wouldn't be part of the title and his picture wouldn't be  prominently displayed on the album. (The Max Q face on the cover is a composite  of the faces of the band members). He is barely in the video for the first  single, "Way of the World." From what Hutchence said, Atlantic's approval of  the project was, to a large degree, the label indulging one of its biggest  stars.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, before starting the project, he didn't inform the INXS members.  "I just did it," he said. "I forgot to tell them about it. They were busy doing  other things. It didn't occur to me. When they found out they might have been a  little nervous at first. But they found out I'm not looking to tamper with  INXS.  </P> <P> "And fans shouldn't worry. INXS is safe. Looks like I'll have to be a rock star  a little while longer."  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: The Pixies, Bob Mould and John Doe form a triple bill at the  Hollywood Palladium on Oct. 27.

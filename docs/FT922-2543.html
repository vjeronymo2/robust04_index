			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Observer: Vocation Whatever official dates John Major may have to keep as prime minister, he is apparently mystically bound to one in the coming weeks. Inhabitants of the Castilian village of Candeleda have no doubt that he will grace them with his presence again this summer after they put up votive candles at the local shrine and prayed for his return. The recipient of this miraculous piece of news is reliably reported to be none other than Catali, the Spanish wife of Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister whose country home was lent to the Majors last summer.</p>

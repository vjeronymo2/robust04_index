			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Cross-border alliances between banks fell last year THE number of cross-border alliances formed between European banks and financial services companies fell last year as the French banks, which have been the most active in such deals, were affected by recession, John Gapper writes. A bulletin article analysing 247 cross-border financial alliances over the past six years finds that 74 partnerships were initiated by French companies against 36 by UK companies and 35 by German. The most common form of alliance came from large companies buying stakes in smaller ones. Outright acquisitions or the purchase of a majority stake accounted for 46 per cent of deals, and joint ventures only 8 per cent. German and UK institutions favoured buying entire business units or majority stakes, while most French and Italian ventures took minority stakes. Last year French alliances dropped from 23 to three. Deals by UK companies fell to two from a consistent rate of between six and nine a year.</p>

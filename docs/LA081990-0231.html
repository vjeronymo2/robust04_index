			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-TITAN ABBOTT LOSES KICKING JOB TO NELSON  </P> <P> Former Cal State Fullerton kicker Vince Abbott's hopes of returning to the NFL  were dashed when the San Francisco 49ers signed former Ram Chuck Nelson to  handle kickoffs in Monday's exhibition game against the Denver Broncos.  </P> <P> Abbott and Nelson had tryouts last week at the 49ers training camp in Rocklin,  Calif. The 49ers had been seeking a kicker since Mike Cofer missed last  Saturday's exhibition against the Raiders because of a pulled left hip muscle.  </P> <P> Nelson, 30, was the Rams' fourth-round draft choice in 1983. He kicked for the  Bills in 1984 and the Vikings from 1986-1988. STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

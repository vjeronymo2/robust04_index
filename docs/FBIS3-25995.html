			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Adhuresidi (7093 0008 6757 3583 6007 2251), deputy chief </F> of Xinjiang Public Security Department: "Stability Must  Overwhelm Everything"]    [Text] An important concept in volume three of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" is "stability stands above all  else." To adhere to the party basic line for 100 years without  wavering, it is imperative to consolidate and develop the  political situation of unity and stability. Without political  stability, reform, opening up, and economic construction would  all be out of the question. Furthermore, the results already  gained would also be lost. To consolidate and develop the  stable political situation is not only the objective need of  social and economic development but the aspiration and basic  interest of Chinese people of all nationalities.    Xinjiang is located on the motherland's northwestern  frontier, sharing its border, which stretches some 4,000 km,  with eight neighboring countries. With the deepening of reform  and the expansion of opening up, Xinjiang's economy has become  increasingly prosperous with each passing day and it has become  an important part of the Eurasian continental bridge. However,  with the tremendous changes in Eastern Europe in recent years,  the ambition of hostile elements from outside our borders in  their attempt to separate Xinjiang has expanded with each  passing day. Those separatist forces openly clamor: "Oppose  socialism" and "religion stands before Marxism-Leninism," in an  attempt to separate the motherland and Xinjiang and to sabotage  nationality solidarity. Consequently, their reactionary nature  has been fully revealed.    This being the case, it is imperative for us to further  strengthen the struggle against separatism, sternly crack down  on various criminal activities, and adhere to doing two types of  work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both. We  must adhere to the four cardinal principles, resolutely  eliminate all factors which lead to confusion, and even turmoil,  to safeguard social stability and ensure the further in-depth  development of socialist economic construction. The stability  of the political situation is the prerequisite for rapid  economic growth. In turn, economic prosperity will inevitably  promote social stability.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Vice President Victor Hugo </F> Cardenas by FIDES NEWS AGENCY, ANF, in South Africa "after  Nelson Mandela's inauguration"]    [Text] La Paz, 10 May (ANF) -- The victory of the struggle  against a racial and segregationist policy that culminated in  Nelson Mandela's inauguration as the first [as published] South  African president is the strongest evidence that Bolivia and  South Africa are building a multiethnic, multiracial, and  multilingual democracy, strongly based on national unity and  social wellbeing.    These remarks were made by Vice President Victor Hugo  Cardenas during a telephone interview with FIDES NEWS AGENCY's  central offices at Government House. The vice president is  heading a national delegation in Cape Town. The mission  participated in Nelson Mandela's inauguration together with 150  other missions and nearly 5,000 world rulers and personalities.    "What we are doing in Bolivia, (the reforms), through much  pain and sacrifice, is very important for the future. The  entire world, not just Bolivia, is working to build  multicultural democracies where different ethnic groups,  cultures, and customs form part of the fabric of democracy,"  Cardenas said.    During his two-day visit to South Africa, Cardenas held  short  meetings with representatives of various countries. He met with  U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Hilary Clinton. He also met  with Cuban President Fidel Castro Ruz, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat,  and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize  winner.    "The central issue of all dialogues with these important  world leaders was the outcome of South African democracy and  improving relations with that nation," the vice president  explained.    "Bolivians must think very seriously about normalizing  relations with South Africa and opening a Bolivian special  mission in this country," Cardenas said, stressing the  importance for Bolivia of the changes that are being experienced  by one of the African continent's more powerful nations.    At 2000 (Bolivian time) on 18 May, Victor Hugo Cardenas will  have "an exclusive meeting" with President Nelson Mandela to  discuss issues relative to the democratic process and the ethnic  factor in both nations.    Cardenas said there is full awareness that the change  process  in South Africa was very painful and full of sacrifice, "but  there is also the fact that Bolivia can participate in the  construction of a multiethnical and multicultural democracy,  that this is no longer a dream."    Cardenas said some South African countries "are interested  in  details of the recent reforms introduced by Bolivia through laws  on popular participation, capitalization, and education reform.  They are very interested in the Bolivian case, a country where  people from many ethnical backgrounds have integrated."    The vice president said that during his short meeting with  Cuba's President Fidel Castro, the two leaders recalled the  outstanding moments of the Cuban participation in Sanchez de  Lozada's inauguration last August. "Castro again thanked the  Bolivian people for their affection and warmth during his  historic visit."    Cardenas said that during his meeting with Vice President Al  Gore, the U.S. official said he felt gratitude and happiness  over his visit to Bolivia last March. "The wife of the U.S.  president, Hilary Clinton, told us that Mr. and Mrs. Gore are  really happy, particularly after visiting Lake Titicaca and the  adjacent settlements."    The vice president said: "Bolivia is remembered by these  distinguished friends. They asked about the capitalization  project, education reform, and people's participation."    "South Africa is building a multiethnic, multicultural, and  multilingual democracy, just as Bolivia. These are common  aspects from which Bolivians can learn a lot. We must be  grateful because the process of change has not left as many  victims in Bolivia as in South Africa where the wounds are still  fresh," the vice president said.</p>

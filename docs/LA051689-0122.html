			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: THE WIND-BLOWN UMBRELLAS OF NEW YORK  </P> <P> This is the season of the blown-out umbrella and the endangered eye. Late last  week a violently windy rainstorm hit Manhattan, where the sidewalks are hardly  large enough to accommodate the daytime pedestrians, let along pedestrians  wielding umbrellas.  </P> <P> Not even in London do I remember encountering so many umbrella-jams: walkers  having to stop and disengage their entangled bumbershoots, usually by changing  the elevations, so the sidewalks from a little distance look like erratic  fields of black mushrooms.  </P> <P> The gusty, lion winds left over from March blew from all directions,  capriciously. The umbrella that was being pushed into you was suddenly pulled  away, and what seemed like hundreds of umbrellas simply weren't up to it. They  turned inside out, fabric sundered from the metal ribs.  </P> <P> I found four dead umbrellas jammed into a single trash can. Others were tossed  in alleys or dropped in the gutters, where, to use another image, they  resembled large, bizarre insects whose brief life spans had ended.  </P> <P> The West Coast difference, I suppose, is that rain is what you more often see  through windshields. Given the native irascibility of New York life, you'd have  expected the umbrellas to be used as assault weapons, but the walkers were  surprisingly even-tempered. This may be because it is hard to be aggressive  when you look ridiculous trying to tame a flighty and fragile device that is  supposed to keep you dry.  </P> <P> The remembered springs of a small-town boyhood were always liberating and  renewing, rewards for long winters and perhaps a young person's earliest  positive reminders that life has rhythms and cycles.  </P> <P> It struck me this time, as it has before, that spring in the steely, gritty  metropolis has an added edge. It is liberating and renewing, but spring also  somehow seems an act of defiance, as if to declare that a soft and gentle  beauty can indeed prevail against the city's hardness, clangors and fumes. Not  for long, obviously, but every year nature tries, and the results are quite  miraculous.  </P> <P> The rain this spring was borne with particular patience here because the East  has been having its own drought crisis, with restrictions on lawn-watering and  car-washing and water in restaurants by request only. But the rains, almost a  third ahead of the seasonal norm, have restored the reservoirs to something  like 85% of capacity and some of the restrictions are being lifted.  </P> <P> The welcome rain adds to the optimism and the hopes that bloom along with the  daffodils in the tiny spaces in front of the brownstones and in the window  boxes and on the rooftops. Those penthouse plantings always seem faintly  ridiculous because they are so improbable, but in spring, newly green, they are  their own kind of defiance. They defy the acrid vapors of the late and humid  summer air. And, quite obviously, they grow, because there are evergreen trees  visible that would never fit in an elevator.  </P> <P> In the words of a song Gertrude Lawrence used to sing, "It ain't all honey and  it ain't all jam." On a lovely, hazy Sunday morning, a line of homeless men,  hundreds long, snakes around a corner and up tony Park Avenue, waiting for a  meal at one of the great midtown churches. The homeless are everywhere, like  the visible wounds of a society that has still not got its act fully together.  </P> <P> The gulf between the thrusting new constructions of midtown and the decaying  warrens only a relatively few blocks north, west or south is enormous, and  there are angers as well as despairs to be felt and found. Some parts of the  city's school system is in a corrupted chaos and there is growing evidence that  the basic structures by which the city is governed are in need of overhaul.  </P> <P> Yet, despite the cracks and the flaws and the accusing presence of the  have-nots, the prevailing tone is of an impatient, horn-honking vitality and a  crucial, striding confidence that New York is a place to get ahead.  </P> <P> Especially when it's spring.  </P></p>

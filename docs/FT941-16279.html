			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Christmas sales up 11% for Signet Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, defied rumours circulating last month of poor Christmas trading to announce an 11 per cent sales increase in December. Mr James McAdam, chairman and chief executive, said the rise in like-for-like sales - excluding store openings and closures - in the crucial Christmas period and a 6 per cent like-for-like increase for the 11 months to December 31, meant Signet was likely to return to profit after a Pounds 40.1m loss last year. Signet shares gained 3 1/2 p to 31p. Mr McAdam said the group had maintained the improved gross margin of about 57 per cent achieved in 1992. 'We didn't break ranks and start discounting,' he said. 'The sale didn't start until after Christmas.' That, combined with a further reduction in operating costs of about Pounds 30m, in addition to Pounds 50m the previous year, was 'driving the bottom line hard'. Most analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m for the year to January 29, although restoration of the dividend is unlikely for some time. The group performance was boosted by a strong showing by its Sterling chain in the US, which now accounts for 55 per cent of group turnover, and 928 of its 1,645 jewellery outlets. Sales were up 19 per cent on the previous December, compared with single-digit rises among most competitors. In the UK, like-for-like jewellery sales were up 6 per cent in December, including a 12 per cent rise at Ernest Jones, and 5 per cent at H Samuel. But sales in the Ratners chain, which now comprises only 100 stores, were flat. Mr McAdam said the chain would shrink to 60 stores by the middle of this year, through further conversion of Ratners stores into the H Samuel format. Ratners stores already converted have enjoyed sales increases of about 20 per cent. The remaining 60 stores will be converted to a new format, and may be renamed. Mr Mc-Adam said the format was likely to be based heavily on experience gained from 'very encouraging' tests of trial outlets, called Equa, in Swindon, Norwich and Peterborough. The 186 Salisburys handbags, luggage and fashion accessories stores continued to perform badly, with sales down 24 per cent in December. Signet said a new management was looking at ways of turning the business round. Lex, Page 18</p>

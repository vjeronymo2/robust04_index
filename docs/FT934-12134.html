			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Fall in SIB fraud referrals likely THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, referred 23 cases of investment business fraud to the police or Serious Fraud Office for criminal investigation in the six months to the end of September this year, Alison Smith writes. This brings the total number of referrals since the Financial Services Act 1988 to 196, but suggests that the total for 1993-94 could be below the record 60 cases in 1992-93. Investigations have now been completed in 134 cases, and the subsequent trials have so far led to 98 convictions and 14 acquittals. The statistics show that 16 of the 23 cases referred for criminal investigation are of so-called 'authorised' groups that have passed the tests of 'fitness and properness' needed for membership in a self-regulatory body.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market bolstered by corporate deals - Market report Another burst of corporate activity, plus renewed gains in gilts, helped to galvanise a London equity market showing signs of strain after a week of outperformance against US and European markets. The day's big events were British Aerospace's launch of a Pounds 535m rights issue to help fund an increased offer for VSEL, the submarines maker and the sale by LVMH, the French luxury goods manufacturer, of a 4 per cent stake in Guinness. They captured the market's attention at the outset. And UK fund managers refused to be panicked by a strong upward revision in domestic gross domestic product for the third quarter, which some analysts said increased the chances of an early move to higher interest rates in the UK to help stifle inflationary pressures. The FT-SE 100 index closed a net 3.5 higher at 3,131.0, extending the rise on a highly successful week to one of 55.1, or 1.8 per cent. The second-liners once again underperformed the leaders, with the FT-SE Mid-250 index finally 1.0 off at 3.575.6; over the week the 250 index has risen 39.1, or 1.1 per cent. Mr Rob Buckland, market strategist at NatWest Securities, said the UK market had overcome one hurdle in the Fed move to increase rates, but that he was yet to be convinced the Fed had done enough to convince markets. 'The UK market wants to go up but the US bond market remains the key. Mr Roger Barker, equity strategist at UBS preached caution; 'The budget could contain more dangers than positives for the market than it thinks,' he said. There was general satisfaction around the City's dealing desks with the recent sharp increase in turnover levels following the spate of special one-off deals. Turnover yesterday expanded to 750.8m shares, with double counting of LVMH's sale of a 4 per cent holding in Guinness accounting for 146m shares and another substantial series of bed and breakfast, or tax-related trades at the outset responsible for over 32m shares. The 100 index began the session around 5 points easier and looking queasy after another uninspiring performance by Wall Street overnight; an initial bullish response by the Dow Jones Average and Treasury Bonds to Tuesday's 75 basis points increase in the Federal Funds rate, has given way to a mood of depression in the US with equities and bonds under persistent selling pressure. But with institutions said to have been queueing up to buy the Guinness stock on offer - LVMH's move has been expected for many weeks - the market quickly gathered itself and moved into plus territory as soon as the placing, worth Pounds 329m, was completed. The deal was executed by UBS, the Swiss-owned stockbroker, via a bought deal which was said to have earned the broker just over Pounds 3m. The timing, but not the content, of British Aerospace's increase bid for VSEL came as a surprise - dealers said any move was not expected until next week. GEC is now expected to return with a potentially knockout blow. VSEL shares raced higher in anticipation of the gathering bid battle, but Aerospace suffered from the fund raising move. For the rest of the session the market was content to mark time, shrugging off the poor opening by Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Average was down around 20 points shortly after trading commenced. Two hours after London closed the Dow Jones Average was showing a fall of more than 40 points. Dealers in London were not overly worried by the losses across the rest of world markets: 'As long as gilts are ok we should be fine,' said a trader at one of the big European securities houses in London. The head of trading at one of the UK securities houses said he expected a sell-off in the futures markets to attempt a sell-off on Monday.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Executor finds job too tough to handle SOME THREE years ago, I agreed to be the prospective executor of an elderly woman relative. From information gleaned, it did not appear that there should be much difficulty in handling her estate (around Pounds 25,000-Pounds 30,000), a task I had previously carried out without undue problems. The woman recently died and, while I have obtained papers for a personal probate application, a quick assessment of the papers would clearly indicate that I was not provided with the full facts when I accepted the task. There are indications that there will be much more complication than anticipated due, in no small part, to the role played by those concerned in assisting the woman in the management of her affairs in the last year or so. Additionally, being a senior citizen of some 'vintage,' my own health has given grounds for concern and I now feel unable to undertake such an open-ended commitment. A bank account in my and the deceased names was opened three years ago; from this, I have paid funeral expenses and will continue to ensure that all such will be met. If necessary, I will fund any shortfall from my own resources. No application has yet been made for probate and I would like to divest myself from this responsibility, but am unaware of the procedure. The beneficiaries being family, I am advising them of my views and that I am in contact with you for advice. Does one have to go to a solicitor with the considerable expense involved? I hold the original will (and copies) detailing me as executor. A person who has been nominated as an executor in a will has a right to probate or administration. He may renounce that right either before probate has been granted or simultaneously with an application for grant. The renunciation must be absolute and in writing. It takes effect from the signature. The letter of renunciation must be witnessed by a disinterested person. The renunciation, together with the original will, are then filed in the district registry. A separate renunciation of administration must be made if the executor is also entitled to a grant of administration. If an executor has intermeddled in a deceased's estate, his renunciation will not be accepted. Any act in relation to the testator's property, which indicates an intention to take on the executorship, constitutes acceptance of the office of executor. You state in your letter that you have paid the funeral and other debts of the deceased. This may not amount to intermeddling provided the payments were not large and provided you have not otherwise dealt with the property of the deceased. You may therefore, still be in a position to renounce the executorship. It may be useful to approach the local registry and discuss the matter with them. There is no need to brief a solicitor to do this on your behalf. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountants Stoy Hayward.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 May (MENA)--Official sources of Egypt's  political parties across the political spectrum have denied  allegations that they have declared their solidarity with the  Egyptian Lawyers Association in connection with the events of  the past two days.    The sources, speaking for the leaders of the political  parties, denied issuing a statement attributed to them earlier  today. The sources said it is really frightening that some  people can go to such lengths, fabricate statements, and falsely  attribute actions to political parties that are carrying out  their roles and performing their responsibilities with total  freedom within our current system of democracy.    Several political party leaders have exposed the facts about  the "alleged statement". They said that a few lawyers, with  well-known sympathies and linked to illegal groups, issued this  statement and attributed it to the political parties.    The leaders affirmed that the entire statement is a mere  calumny that contradicts the facts.</p>

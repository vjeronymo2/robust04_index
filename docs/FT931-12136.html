			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: KHD plans rights issue to pay for restructuring KLOCKNER-Humboldt-Deutz, the German diesel engine and industrial plant manufacturer, yesterday announced plans for a substantial capital increase through a one-for-two rights issue. The company plans to raise its capital to DM477m (Dollars 318m), an increase of DM159m, with the sale of an additional 3.18m shares. The issue price will only be fixed on March 1. The issue will be underwritten by a banking consortium, headed by Deutsche Bank, which is a 41 per cent shareholder. Mr Werner Kirchgasser, the chief executive, said the capital issue had long been planned to underpin the drastic restructuring programme under way at KHD, including a new DM600m diesel engine plant in the Porz district of Cologne. Although the company has not paid a dividend since 1986, he forecast a good take-up of the shares, which would be competitively priced. He dismissed market speculation that a recent boost in the company's share price was the result of an unidentified potential takeover. The company would expect any such buyer first to make an approach for a friendly takeover, he said, and no such approach had been received. The capital issue would make any such move in the future more difficult. Mr Kirchgasser said that the company's operating profit for 1992 would be 'clearly positive' on the basis of a 10 per cent drop in turnover on 1991. The KHD group had managed to hold its own during the past year, against the background of a depressed world economy: orders were slightly up at DM3.7bn. The best performance in the group came from the industrial plant division, including cement plants, raw material processing plants, and sewage treatment plants: turnover was up 10 per cent, and orders up 32 per cent on 1991.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (13): Profits have surged - Profile: Saab-Scania Saab-Scania, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, is at last starting to produce the sort of returns that its owners, the Wallenbergs, must have hoped for when they bought the group in 1991, reports Christopher Brown-Humes. Profits have surged this year, after two dismal years in 1992 and 1993, driving the broader recovery of Investor, the key Wallenberg holding company which wholly owns the group. In the first nine months, Saab-Scania achieved an operating income of SKr2.3bn, a spectacular increase from only SKr108m in the same 1993 period. Spectacular, perhaps, but a performance nevertheless which mixes 'wine with water,' according to Mr Lars Kylberg, Saab-Scania chief executive. The 'wine' is Scania, the world's fifth-largest truck group, which has benefited from a strong revival in demand and soaring sales. The 'water' is the group's commercial airline business which has suffered heavy losses amid plunging sales and orders. The commercial aircraft division is, undoubtedly, the group's immediate headache because this year it is only likely to sell 15 of its turbo-prop aircraft, against the 50 which it needs to sell to break even. The group produces two airliners, the Saab 340, which can seat 20-39 passengers, and the Saab 2000, a newer model seating 40-59 passengers. General market overcapacity has caused problems not just for Saab-Scania, but for many of its competitors. Indeed, it is this general state of distress that leads Mr Kylberg to believe that a far-reaching solution - nothing short of an European Airbus-type consortium in turbo-props - might be possible. 'If I had a single New Year wish, this is what I would really like to happen in 1995,' he says. The members of Mr Kylberg's mini-Airbus consortium would be Saab-Scania, British Aerospace, ATR, the French-Italian group, and Germany's Deutsche Aerospace. Forging a collaboration would provide Europe with real clout in its battle with overseas competitors such as Canada's Bombadier and Brazil's Embraer, he argues. But there is a long way to go and even if agreement can be reached between the four parties, the European competition authorities may not like it. If the venture fails, Mr Kylberg maintains that Saab-Scania can still soldier on on its own, although it is not a prospect which he relishes. Apart from anything else, he feels the group is at a competitive disadvantage because it cannot offer some of the export credits and other soft financing mechanisms that its rivals can. Saab-Scania is also seeking to build a strong international alliance for its fighter aircraft, the JAS 39 Gripen. The project has been hit by delays and cost-overruns, and last year suffered the trauma of a high-profile crash during a Stockholm air display. The group has a healthy order book from the Swedish air force for the aircraft, a multi-purpose reconnaissance and attack fighter, but full commercial success will only come with export orders. That is why Saab-Scania wants an overseas partner. The company in question is almost certain to be British Aerospace. The two companies have talked for more than a year and a final agreement in the form of a sales and marketing joint venture is likely to be announced during the spring. BAe has a strong historic position in a number of the markets which Saab-Scania would like to penetrate, including Middle Eastern and Far Eastern countries. The British group's help in producing an 'export' version of the aircraft, which could be adapted to local conditions, is also being sought. Saab-Scania is definitely not seeking a partner for its Scania bus and truck division, which has consistently proved to be one of the world's most profitable operations in this field. Scania has a number of basic strengths, including modular construction (using the same core module for different truck models) and a strong dealer organisation. In the past year these advantages have been enhanced by the weakness of the krona and recovering demand and the group has been able to take market share. European production has doubled to 140 trucks a day from 70. Underscoring the upturn, Scania's sales surged 34 per cent to SKr18.8bn in the first nine months while its order intake jumped 61 per cent to 29,100 trucks and buses. The unit's operating margin reached 14 per cent, about twice the level of Volvo Trucks, a highly-regarded competitor. Scania's achievements are the more remarkable for the fact that it has not produced a completely new model for many years, contenting itself instead with a gradual refinement of existing models. Mr Kylberg declines to discuss industry rumours suggesting a new model may come as early as next year. Scania's present production and sales strongholds are Europe and Latin America. It has consistently shied away from the North American market, saying its sixth manufacturing plant - it has three in Europe and two in Latin America - is likely to be in Asia. 'We see Asia as our third region,' says Mr Kylberg. Saab-Scania retains a 50 per cent stake in Saab Automobile. This is essentially a financial investment because management is carried out by the other joint owner, General Motors. There have been rumours that Saab-Scania will sell out, but Mr Kylberg denies it. 'We have a good co-operation with GM and wish it to stay like that,' he says. Besides, the group is at last earning money from Saab, which will make its first profit for six years in 1994. Mr Kylberg does not believe the group is spreading itself too thinly by operating in so many sectors with huge capital requirements. He says vehicle-making is the group's traditional business - Scania is 100 years old and Saab is more than 50 - and that is where its expertise lies. In other words, he is happy with the basic structure of the group. The only difference is that by the year 2000 he hopes to have several strong international partnerships in place to share some of the burdens.</p>

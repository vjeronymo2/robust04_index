			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Debtors may add Pounds 21 to community charge POLL TAX bills in England and Wales could be increased by more than Pounds 21 because of non-payers, according to a survey. In inner-city areas the extra burden could amount to nearly Pounds 32 a person, said the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa). The survey, for Radio 4's Today programme, reinforces Labour claims that the poll tax could become a crucial issue in an early election. Budget-setting debates take place in councils in February and March, with bills being sent out in April - around the same time as the earliest likely election date of April 9. The estimates, which Cipfa says could be conservative, come just days after Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, admitted that many bills are likely to overshoot the government's average forecast of Pounds 257 by up to Pounds 15. The survey asked local authorities to give estimates of the surcharges forced by non-payment. Some 144 councils - just over a third of all local authorities - responded. The average increase due to uncollected bills for the current financial year was put at Pounds 21.37, rising to Pounds 31.97 in metropolitan districts.</p>

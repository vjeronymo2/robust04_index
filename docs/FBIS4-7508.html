			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zorana Suvakovic: "Fable and Bosnia"] </F>   [Text] General [Bertrand] de Lapresle was quite bewildered  and surprised when questions started showering upon him in the  International Press Center in Belgrade about the Turkish return  to the Balkans.    It is a credit to the French general that, in less than a  week since he took up the command over UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces], he came to visit Belgrade, minding the praiseworthy  international procedures. As he nicely put it, he is a general  assigned to deal with partners, rather than with enemies, a  general who does not aspire to accomplish a personal victory,  but rather to give support to his partners so they can find a  peace settlement. Hardly any of the former UNPROFOR commanders  has ever given such a precise definition of the essence and role  of UN peace missions.  <H5>  Fatal Mistake </H5>   No sooner did UNPROFOR start to recover, under the political  leadership of the wise Akashi, who has a refined sense for most  diverse currents, winds, changes of moon, high-tides, and  low-tides in the Balkans, when the decision came from New York  that Turkish blue helmets are to be sent to Bosnia. That is  certainly not the first time that the international organization  and community has complicated the already complicated-enough  Balkan situation, and make the goal of its own mission even more  difficult to achieve. That many of the 54 UN Security Council  resolutions are absolutely unfeasible on the ground was  stressed, more or less openly, by all the former military and  political officials of the UN mission in Bosnia, because of  which many of them consciously put an end to their careers. The  mistakes made by the international community were subsequently  assessed by many former foreign ministers, UN officials, and  co-chairmen of the conferences on former Yugoslavia. The  deployment of Turkish troops in the Balkans is one of those  moves that confirm the theory about the intentions of making the  conflict even more complicated at the moment when certain signs  of its forthcoming conclusion have appeared.    There are many reasons for believing that the deployment of  Turkish UN troops in Bosnia is a great mistake.    Five centuries of Turkish government left many traces all  over the Balkans, and many people believe they are an indirect  cause of the ongoing conflict. It seems that since the  disintegration in former Yugoslavia began, the Balkan countries  encumbered with a Turkish heritage have never been so unanimous  as they are now, that the arrival of Turkish troops might cause  the blaze of the conflict to spread to the entire region. The  reactions of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, and the FRY [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia] have been almost identically severe,  calling this decision a complete nonsense, a fatal mistake, and  even the surrender of the United Nations to Turkish strategy.    How undoable is the knot intertwining history and the  present  could best be seen in Athens, where the news from New York came  in on a Greek national holiday. The celebration of the historic  date of the Greek uprising against the Turkish dictatorship, and  the decision that was made in New York on the Turkish  reappearance in the Balkans, are a clear illustration of the two  opposite ways of reasoning, two ways of thinking.    It is not clear why the United Nations has given up the  principle that it itself established as a basic guideline for  its peace missions throughout the world. Notwithstanding the  explanation that the Turkish troops will be wearing blue berets,  by which the latest decision is being justified, the decision  still violates the UN rule prescribing that the troops of  neighboring countries, or countries that are historically  discredited in a conflicting region are not to be sent for peace  missions.  <H5>  It Will Be Difficult to Close the Door </H5>   The participation of Russian troops in the UN peace mission  is hardly comparable with the participation of Turkish troops.  Russia, since recently called by the international news  agencies "the traditional orthodox ally of Serbia and Greece,"  is neither a neighboring country, nor discredited in the Balkans  as an occupying force. For that reason the Russian battalion  has been participating in UNPROFOR from the very beginning,  while their presence in the UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] has  never elicited any protests or criticisms on the part of the  international public.    Once the door is opened, it will be difficult to close it  for  other questionable guests: Italians, Austrians, Germans,  Hungarians... and to keep them away from the yard where the  historic curse allows too little tolerance, even for its  inhabitants.    It is now difficult to guess why and how Akashi and Butrus  Butrus-Ghali have given up the prescribed rules. The  insufficient number of peacekeeping troops for the hazardous  operation in Bosnia is stated as one of the most decisive  reasons. Why was then the good idea of deploying the Turkish  troops in some other, more distant sites of UN operations,  thereby leaving space for the deployment of some more neutral  troops, abandoned so easily? What is the reason for stepping  back on the path that leads to a dead end precisely at the  moment when, for the first time, the international factors have  discerned some light at the end of the tunnel?    Encouraged by the favorable winds blowing from the East  River, the Turkish Government has offered three times as much  troops. Most probably, the number of troops will amount to  2,700, in contrast to the initially endorsed 1,000 troops.  Ankara will spare neither men, nor means to reappear in the  Balkans in as impressive numbers as possible.    Does not the fact that all other nations are quite reluctant  to commit their troops to the Bosnian adventure, while Turkey is  so eager to take the risk, provoke suspicion and doubts? It  does, and even the most extreme suspicions, such as that  expressed by a Greek minister, who compared the deployment of  Turkish peace keeping troops with a wolf used for guarding  sheep. All in vain, since nobody is paying attention to the  morals of so many Bosnian fables, stories, poems, proverbs, and  above all riddles dating back from Turkish times.</p>

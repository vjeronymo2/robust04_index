			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  KKE Seeking Alliances </H6>   The 20 December ELEVTHEROTIPIA reports that Communist Party  (KKE) honorary chairman Kharilaos Florakis has declared that his  party will seek alliances for the next municipal elections and  will attempt to gain representation in the European Parliament  in the June 1994 Euroelections. Florakis did not specify which  political groups will be approached by the KKE, but stressed the  need for any alliance to reach "agreement on a minimum program."  <H5>  New Coalition Chairman </H5>   N. Konstandopoulos was elected the new chairman of the  Coalition of the Left for Progress at a 19 December meeting, an  article in the 20 December ELEVTHEROTIPIA reports. This marks  the first time the Coalition leader was elected by a party  congress rather than by the central political committee.  According to the report, Konstandopulos, who was born in 1942,  was a member of the Democratic Defense organization during the  junta period and was arrested by the junta in 1969. He was  released in 1973. Konstandopulos was a member of PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] until 1973, when he was  expelled because of his disagreement with PASOK policies. He  ran in the June 1989 election as a Coalition candidate and  served as minister of interior in the Tzannetaki multiparty  government. He has been a Coalition at-large deputy since April  1990.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Nudge-nudge, wink-wink ..: Philip Stephens provides a guide to the speculations and subtleties of pre-Budget fever Chancellors are kind to journalists. Mr Kenneth Clarke is no exception. For several months each year they allow us to fill the newspapers and airwaves with guesses, leaks and speculation (informed and otherwise) about the Budget. The latest occupant of No 11 Downing Street is an instinctively talkative politician. He has abolished purdah, the two-month period before Budget day, during which past chancellors have observed a monastic silence. But Mr Clarke has not altered the practice which provides essential grist for the media mill. All tax changes are decided by Treasury ministers and their mandarins in conditions of the utmost secrecy. This absurd rule guarantees that every nod, wink and raised eyebrow before the first 'unified' Budget on November 30 has the potential to fill one of those front page slots with a speculative certainty. Readers and listeners are left with the awkward task of disentangling fact from fiction, genuine hints and leaks from well-packaged inven-tion. So what follows is a guide to pre-Budget fever - a few broad rules against which the scare stories should be tested before they are believed. The first thing to remember is that crucial decisions on the overall tax burden - known in the trade as the Budget judgment - will not finally be taken until mid-November. Those late August stories (known more appropriately as 'flyers') asserting that the chancellor has already decided to slap 2p on income tax and abolish mortgage interest relief can safely be ignored. Mr Clarke already has a fair idea of his overall aim. He wants government borrowing to fall at a faster rate. He has already set tough targets for public spending which will be unveiled alongside tax changes in the first 'unified' Budget bringing together the revenue and spending sides of the government accounts. But he will wait until the last moment before deciding whether to announce, say, a net increase in the tax burden of Pounds 5bn or Pounds 10bn, or whether to opt for a more neutral package. (You can rule out a net 'giveaway'). A premature judgment could too easily be overtaken by subsequent economic developments. His assessment is complicated further by the deferred tax increases, due in 1994 and 1995, put in place by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor. Everyone knows that Mr Lamont imposed value-added tax on domestic fuel and heating. But his March package included 49 other measures ranging from tougher rules for relocation expenses to a new exemption for outplacement counselling (whatever that is). There are other time bombs Mr Lamont left ticking in his successor's battered red box. Among them are a 1-point rise in National Insurance contributions, as well as restriction of mortgage interest relief and married person's allowance to the 20p income tax rate from next April. For every measure announced, the chancellor will discard up to half-a-dozen other options. And since every occupant of No 11 wants to be known as a 'reforming chancellor', Mr Clarke will examine closely upwards of 200 possibilities. Keeping track of all these options is impossible. But some clues can be gleaned from representations by powerful lobby groups like the Confederation of British Industry and from kite-flying by Whitehall departments. The interventionist duo at trade and industry and at employment - Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr David Hunt - will want, for example, measures to promote a pro-industry image. Extra help for exporters must be a good bet. Mr Clarke's self-image as a 'people's chancellor' means the charity, low-pay and welfare lobbies should get a fairer hearing than in some previous years  -always remembering, of course, that he does not have cash to throw around. But what of the big decisions - on income tax, VAT, excise duties, and company taxation? Here the important point is that Mr Clarke is operating within two sets of, often overlapping, parameters - economic and political. The most obvious is the economic. Everyone knows he must cut the public sector borrowing requirement. So some further increase in taxation is a reasonable prospect. But beware. Though they would never admit it publicly, few Whitehall officials believe that the borrowing requirement will actually reach Pounds 50bn this year. The economy, and with it tax revenues, are growing faster than the Treasury expected. The best guess of those in Whitehall who know about these things is that Mr Clarke may well get away with a net tax increase of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 6bn. Optimists say the range is from zero to Pounds 4bn. The few remaining pessimists say Pounds 10bn. Here we come to the politics. Mr Clarke's first priority will be to ensure that whatever he announces on November 30 will come as a relief. So do not worry about the inevitable explosion of pre-Budget doom-mongering. An increase in the basic rate of income tax from 25p is off-limits. Even if Mr Clarke wanted it, Mr Major would not accept it - nor would the restless Tory backbenches. An increase in the 40p top tax rate is more plausible, but would still smack of total retreat from the low-tax 1980s. Unless he is overruled by his Downing Street neighbour, Mr Clarke will not abandon even the second stage of the phased introduction of VAT on domestic fuel. Chancellors cannot afford to retreat once measures are on the statute book. Nor should anyone pay too much attention to the speculation - judiciously encouraged by the chancellor - that he is planning wholesale extension of VAT to other zero-rated items like food and public transport. Newspapers, maybe even books and magazines, could be a target. If the technical obstacles could be overcome, the exemption from VAT of financial services (at a cost of Pounds 3.3bn a year) might be another. But Mr Clarke is smart enough not to follow up Mr Lamont's tax on warmth with others on baked beans and bus rides. Much easier, despite his own liking for more than the odd pint of beer and small cigars, would be to slap a few pennies on the price of alcohol, tobacco and petrol - though even here he will have to watch the impact on the inflation rate. Industry looks set to escape lightly. There are many in the Treasury who believe companies did too well out of corporate tax reforms in the 1980s. But a chancellor who applauds publicly the real people who make real things can hardly follow up with a kick in the teeth for Midlands manufacturers. None of this leaves much room for manoeuvre if Mr Clarke does decide he needs to raise more than the odd billion or two. But here we come to perhaps the safest bet. He could raise more than Pounds 1bn by freezing the main income tax thresholds. A whacking Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn could be had from restricting the personal income tax allowance to the 20p rate of income tax. Adjusting allowances would have the advantage of being perceived to be fair. The high-income middle classes would suffer most. Some of the money could even be given back to those on low incomes (the elderly defectors to the Liberal Democrats in Christchurch) by extending the 20p tax band to, say, the first Pounds 5,000 of taxable income. A package like that - dressed up with a few other clever Treasury wheezes - would have a distinctly Clarke-ish feel to it: tough but equitable. But then all this, of course, is speculation.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Big business ways 'trickle downward' SOME of the financial benefits of new management techniques, such as just-in-time manufacturing, are gradually trickling down from large companies to small businesses, according to research by Manchester Business School. A regular six-monthly survey of 5,000 companies in north-west England shows that 31 per cent of small businesses have increased their stock turnover since the spring. This compared with only 24 per cent in the previous survey. The increase is attributed to a knock-on effect from larger companies, which had reported faster stock turnover during the first six months of this year, benefiting from the improvement in the economy. The research also shows that big companies use their muscle to manage working capital more efficiently at smaller companies' expense. One in 10 large companies collects debts in less than 30 days, compared with 5 per cent of smaller ones. Business confidence has fallen sharply in the Midlands amid growing fears that the recovery may be faltering, the Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday.</p>

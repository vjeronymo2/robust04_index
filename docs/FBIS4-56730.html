			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 6 May (AFP) -- Several bus lines and the  Caracas subway, which carries 1 million passengers daily,  suspended operations for several hours today after students took  to the streets to protest Thursday's killing of a fellow  student. To prevent acts of vandalism, hundreds of police  officers were deployed along the city's main streets.    Nevertheless, an official VENPRES report indicates that  students from the Santos Michelena and Rafael Urdaneta high  schools unleashed their anger on the San Jose police station,  throwing stones and bottles that destroyed glass doors and  windows.    Thursday morning, student German Sotillo Rodriguez, 17, died  from three gunshot wounds during disturbances staged by students  from the Fermin Toro High School near the Miraflores  presidential palace. The students were protesting a refusal by  city bus drivers to honor preferential student fares.    Authorities have confirmed that the student was killed by  Raul Izea Bohorquez, a metropolitan police officer, who will be  turned over to the courts.</p>

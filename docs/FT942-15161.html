			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rate cut hopes drive equities sharply higher - Market Report Good news on UK inflation, coming hard on the heels of the cut in German interest rates and encouraging economic news from the US, raised hopes of another reduction in UK interest rates yesterday. This set the scene for a strong performance by the London stockmarket. The FT-SE 100-share index, which laboured in early trading as UK institutions held fire ahead of the crucial inflation news for last month, took some time to get into gear but moved into overdrive during the final two hours of trading. Towards the close, it was helped by a good showing by Wall Street and a number of trading programmes on the buy side during the final hour of business. Adding to a general air of euphoria as the market closed was the announcement that the Bank of England intends to auction government stock maturing between 1997 and 2001 against expectations of stock maturing between 2004 and 2006. Fuller details of the auction are expected early next week. By the close the FT-SE 100 index had sprinted ahead to end the session 36.6 higher at 3,168.3, extending the rise on the week to 47.5. The second-line stocks also attracted sustained buying interest, with the FT-SE Mid Cap 250 index closing 32.5 firmer at 3,824.6. Gilt-edged stocks were always in positive territory with the long-dated issues up a point and more at best, responding to growing hopes that another UK interest rate cut may come sooner than previously expected. The market began the session in subdued fashion, with the FT-SE 100 index up just over seven points and turnover restrained by lingering fears about the inflation numbers. In the event the retail price index news showed inflation slowing to show an annualised gain of only 2.3 per cent. This was below forecasts and provided the spark for both gilt-edged and equity markets. The former raced higher, shrugging off a sluggish performance by German bunds, as talk of another UK rate cut gripped the market, while equities surged higher amid suggestions that institutions had moved in to buy a market short of stock. Dealers reported increasing demand for the leading FT-SE stocks during the afternoon and the 100-index reached a day's peak of 3,168.6 just before the official close. The head of market-making at one leading UK integrated securities house said the market was looking in 'fine shape' as it closed for the weekend. 'It was a dullish day to begin with but was looking very strong towards the close when there was some sizeable institutional buying. The UK inflation news was very well received, we've had the expected German rate cuts and the US markets are looking healthy.' The oil sector, which has outperformed the wider market in recent sessions, was again strongly supported as crude oil prices topped Dollars 15 a barrel and leading international brokers forecast average oil prices in excess of Dollars 16 a barrel for the year. Turnover in equities reached 698.8m shares, slightly up on Thursday's total. The value of customer business transacted on Thursday was Dollars 1.39bn. The bank sector of the market performed well with the exception of HSBC where the shares were affected by suggestions that the bank's fixed-interest trading arm had suffered after the extreme market turbulence following the shift in US monetary policy.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TEENS AS CHARITABLE AS ADULTS  </P> <P> Despite their sometimes being stereotyped as selfish and self-centered,  American teen-agers do voluntary charitable work at about the same rate as  adults, a study reported today.  </P> <P> And, between trips to the mall and the movies, teen-agers also dig into their  pockets to do good, with 48% contributing money to causes last year.  </P> <P> The average total donated was $46.  </P> <P> The findings, by Independent Sector, an umbrella group of voluntary, nonprofit  groups and big donors, come on the heels of a mid-November survey that found a  marked increase in giving and volunteering by the "baby boom" generation.  </P> <P> The survey of American teens found that 58% volunteered in 1989, compared to  54% of adults. Teens averaged 3.9 hours of volunteer time each week, and more  than one-fourth of the teen volunteers gave five or more hours each week.  </P></p>

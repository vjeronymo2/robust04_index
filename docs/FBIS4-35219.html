			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 30 (AFP) -- The Muslim fundamentalist  group Hamas on Monday [30 May] refused to hand over militants  who killed two suspected collaborators in Gaza to the  Palestinian police.    It charged that the two men had been "planning to  assassinate  Hamas and Fatah leaders to stir up trouble and provoke fighting"  between the fundamentalists and the PLO's main group.    "We refuse to hand over our militants and hope that the  Palestinian police can carry out its role of pursuing  collaborators. If so, it will save Hamas having to do it," the  group said in a statement released in Damascus.    It warned police chief Nasr Yusuf to handle "this delicate  situation" with care "so as not to provoke reactions which would  not be in the interests of our people and their unity."    On the autonomous Gaza Strip, Yusuf issued a stern warning  to  Islamic fundamentalists after Hamas executed the two suspects on  Friday and demanded that the killers be handed over.    Hamas announced Sunday it would stop killing collaborators,  but only temporarily to see if the police could do its job.    Almost 1,000 Palestinians have been murdered by fellow  Palestinians since the intifadah erupted in December 1987, but  Israel maintains that fewer than 40 percent were collaborators.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DECISION TO ALLOW BOOKS IS PRAISED  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach school board is to be commended for unanimously rejecting  efforts to ban a series of grade-school readers at its meeting on Feb. 6.  </P> <P> As a parent and a former elementary school teacher, I am aware of the process  involved in choosing books for our children.  </P> <P> I am also aware of the difficulties experienced today when we try to instill a  love and excitement of reading in people of all ages. I would urge the parents  who formed the Coalition of Concerned Parents to read to their children. If  there are areas of conflict in any reading material, they have a perfect  opportunity then to help their children as they form opinions and explore other  points of view. What better way to increase exposure to an understanding and  tolerance of the myriad of ideas available to us as we grow and mature? If we  raise our children with only one, narrow view of life, what chance does the  world have? How much better to trust them to choose their own beliefs as a  result of having been excited and stimulated by the choices we are privileged  to have available to us.  </P> <P> Parents have the right to request alternative reading texts and, of course, to  enroll their children in schools that reflect their views. I hope those who  fear open communication of ideas and creativity will do just that. I will  always want our public schools to reflect as much diversity as possible.  </P> <P> I, too, will remember the decision of the Redondo Beach school trustees when  election time rolls around.  </P> <P> FLORENCE MOORE  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

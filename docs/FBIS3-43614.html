It is so far the only  point under discussion and it seems as if it will continue to be  discussed for some time. UNITA is presently examining the  organic composition of the national police so that it can then  present its views. Reporter Joao Ligio reports.    The Lusaka II peace talks resumed today with only a meeting  of an ad hoc commission established to carry out plenary  sessions without disruption. The face-to-face meeting which took  place today did not last long. The meeting began at 1000 and  two hours later it had already ended with another request for a  break.    The session began with the government giving detailed  information on the national police law, as requested by UNITA.  UNITA then immediately asked for another break to study the law.  Since there was no time limit for studying the law, the next  session will depend on the speed with which UNITA studies the  law, which it says was approved by a parliament in which it did  not take part.    This is another step backward by the Black Cockerel's men,  who are trying to gain time, since so far, they have not reached  a common negotiating stand within their ranks. It has also been  learned that UNITA negotiators received serious warnings,  because of UNITA's intransigence, during a meeting they held  with U.S. Congressmen yesterday at Victoria Falls, 473 km from  Lusaka, along the border with Zimbabwe.</p>

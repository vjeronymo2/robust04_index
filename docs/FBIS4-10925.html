			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann, dated 9 March] </F>   [Text] It is both tragic and comic to read what Sergio  Ramirez says in an interview published in EL PAIS and now  circulating concerning the armed struggle in Nicaragua today.    Sergio threatens to withdraw from the Front if, among other  unlikely happenings, the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front] announces at its next special congress "that it is going  to take up arms to overthrow the government."    I had always thought that I knew Sergio well and, in  addition  to having great affection for him, have always respected his  ideas and proposals. Now I sincerely no longer know what is  happening. I cannot understand him. I wish someone would  convince me that I have misunderstood his proposals, that they  are not as opportunistic or "vote-seeking" as they appear.    Shortly after Sergio said in the aforementioned interview  that he would withdraw from the Front if the congress should  announce that we are going to take up arms to defeat Violeta  Chamorro, Helena Ramos, who was conducting the interview,  correctly reminded him that no one here is proposing a guerrilla  war, that the issue is the struggle in the streets, the strikes,  and so on. That reminder from the reporter to the statesman is  what is tragic-comic for me.    The journalist was very politely urging Sergio to come back  to earth, to reality. Ramos asked Sergio to give his opinion  about the civil struggle. I think that is the best part of the  excellent interview and the six ensuing paragraphs deserve to be  read very carefully so that we realize once and for all that the  basic problem is ideological, even if Sergio continues to deny  it. In addition to the ideological aspect, Sergio's comments  also naturally contain a healthy dose of manipulation and  demagogy. If they do not, let someone else give me a better  label for Sergio's attempt to make people realize that there is  a very real danger of a decision being made at the FSLN's  special congress to take up arms to overthrow the government.    It was served to him on a silver platter, as they say, but  Sergio was unable to take advantage of the opportunity to  express the Sandinist thought on the civil, trade union,  nonviolent struggle that is possible today in Nicaragua for the  precise reason that we had 10 years of revolution. This, among  other things, enabled us to create a police force and army that  are unquestionably the most respectful of citizens' rights of  any on the American Continent. I do not deny that they have  occasionally been guilty of excesses which we must not minimize  or let pass without taking appropriate measures, but it is a  fact that, with respect to repression, our people are in a  position of clear privilege compared with other nations in Latin  America and the United States itself.    We cannot forget that Martin Luther King was assassinated  and  that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI acted in a criminal fashion to  neutralize him, that history is repeated every day against  Father Roy Burgois, Brian Wilson, and many other distinguished  followers of Dr. King in the civil struggle for peace and  justice.    However, it is also true that here in Nicaragua, the  revolution gave us areas in which we may resort to a civil,  nonviolent struggle in order to achieve justice without having  to face tanks. When a Sandinist leader is asked about this--and  even if he is not asked--the most appropriate response is to  explain how we must make use of such opportunities for the civil  struggle.    Sergio's responses are totally unsatisfactory because Sergio  actually clearly opposes the people's struggle, any  struggle of the people, not just the armed struggle. His recent  statements on the subject lead one to conclude that Sergio  believes that members of Parliament and high-ranking party  leaders are the only persons qualified to fight for justice in  Nicaragua.    It therefore follows that if the people's organizations  become involved in the fight, instead of making a contribution,  they would only hinder the great achievements that the "elite"  groups always say they are "on the verge of obtaining."    Why such contempt for the rank and file? Why must we think  that only those at the top may control the reins of our nation's  fate instead of recognizing that the fight to improve and  develop our country must be waged from all three trenches: the  party, Legislature, and the people's organizations? Every one of  these three trenches has its own methods, rhetoric, and way of  articulating things. They are different but complementary and it  is a serious error to try to exclude any one of them from the  struggle.    All three of these trenches are important, but the most  important one of all--because it is the only one that is  indispensable--is none of the ones at the top! The most  important trench from which the war must be waged has to be the  people's organizations, whose main actions of persuasion do not  take place in air-conditioned halls, but in the streets, the  sun, often causing disturbances and sometimes unfortunate and  even condemnable incidents. And yet, this is no reason to  abandon the civil struggle. We must perfect our methods to make  them more effective.    On 22 May 1991, when we in the Communal Movement summoned a  demonstration in front of the National Assembly in order to put  pressure on the government of President Violeta Chamorro to turn  over titles to the beneficiaries of Laws 85 and 86, and when,  instead of the 3,000 persons that we expected, nearly 40,000  thronged to the square, I recall Sergio's great concern when he  learned that we were approaching the National Assembly building.  It was then that I began to notice Sergio's great distrust of  the people. I do not know whether he also distrusts Tono Lacayo  and the Alfredo Cesars.    Sergio admitted in the EL PAIS interview that in countries  such as France, transportation strikes manage to close the  highways and even isolate Paris. He does not oppose such strikes  because, he says, they are trade union rather than political  strikes. However, what distinguishes a strictly trade union  strike from a political strike is the goal it pursues rather  than those who support it.    Transportation strikes in developed countries could bring  down governments, which would not necessarily be antidemocratic.  In the case of Nicaragua, I do not think that anyone doubts that  the FSLN has done more than any other opposition force would  have done to prevent the government from growing any weaker and  falling. I believe this was the right thing to do.    However, while it is true that we would not like to see the  government fail, we should be even less happy to see a "renewed"  Sandinist Front, a "Feeble Front" with more of an interest, at  this point, in keeping the government from falling than in  helping the people channel their civil struggle toward a  positive path in order to achieve the fulfillment of their more  than legitimate demands. Such a civil struggle would not be less  democratic if, because of it, the government were to become  unstable and even fall.    In a real confrontation between official policy and the  interests or rights of the people, we must decide whether we are  on the side of the people or the government. The Sandinist Front  is and will always be on the side of the people. Even if some  would like to change that identity, the vast majority of the  FSLN, now aware of the danger, would never permit it.    Managua, 9 March 1994</p>

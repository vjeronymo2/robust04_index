			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBIN ELSON MURDER ACQUITTAL  </P> <P> I have read the article on Robin Elson, and have a tremendous feeling of rage  and anger with regard to her neighbors who were so busy watching her husband  brutally attack his family but too cowardly to call the police. Had they done  so, this woman may have been spared God knows how much cruelty, to say nothing  of what her children have suffered.  </P> <P> There is no way on earth a jury could have found her guilty, if there is any  justice left.  </P> <P> Shame, shame, shame not only on the dead man but on the neighbors who saw small  children treated with such inhuman cruelty and did nothing.  </P> <P> I wonder how those uncaring neighbors sleep at night. Not too well, I hope.  </P> <P> MARY E. BURR  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Approval of SLMO labor market areas and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting proposed wage indices would be announced in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule. The proposed rule would include the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index under the current labor market areas (including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of reclassification) and under the SLMO labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Hospitals participating in the SLMO would be able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to withdraw support for the SLMO during the 60-day comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period following publication of the proposed rule. If one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more hospitals withdraws support for a labor market area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the SLMO, the SLMO would not go into effect in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following fiscal year. To withdraw from the SLMO, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating hospital would submit a letter to HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referencing the appropriate proposed rule and stating its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the SLMO labor market area is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Absent any withdrawal of support for labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas under the SLMO, HCFA would announce labor market areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and wage indices under the SLMO in the prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system final rule (published by September 1 of each year).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The labor market areas under the SLMO would be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect for at least 1 Federal fiscal year following approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by HCFA. The SLMO labor market areas would be automatically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewed for following years unless a participating hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed HCFA in writing of its decision to withdraw.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Special Issues Affecting the SLMO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are considering the following policies that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the effects of special situations on the SLMO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New Hospitals_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a new hospital is established in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SLMO labor market area after its approval, the wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the new hospital would be determined as it is under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current system for the remainder of the fiscal year. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order for the SLMO labor market area to be renewed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following fiscal year, the new hospital would have to inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA in writing of its support for the SLMO labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ownership Changes and Hospital Mergers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _If there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an ownership change or hospital merger during the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the SLMO labor market area is in effect, the SLMO would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in effect for the remainder of the fiscal year. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order for the SLMO labor market area to be renewed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following fiscal year, the new ownership would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inform HCFA in writing of its support for the SLMO labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will accept comments on the SLMO until August 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994. These comments should be sent directly to: Lana  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Price, Director; Division of Hospital Payment Policy; 1&hyph;H&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> East Low Rise; 6325 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, Maryland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21207. Responses to these comments will appear in the FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 prospective payment system proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the inception of the prospective payment system, we have repeatedly solicited comments concerning how labor market areas used to construct the wage index should be defined. In recent years, we have also solicited comments concerning specific proposals to modify or replace our current use of MSAs. For example, we have offered for public comment the reclassification criteria used by the MGCRB and alternatives to the MSA-based system such as ProPAC's nearest neighbor proposal and the options outlined in the present rule. In essence, therefore, we have been engaged in a continuing dialogue with the public concerning whether it is appropriate to use MSAs to define labor market areas to construct the wage index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 30, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget announced the revised definitions for Metropolitan Areas (MA) to reflect the MA standards published on March 30, 1990, and the demographic data drawn from the 1990 Decennial Census. In that bulletin, OMB stated that in cases where an agency is publishing for comment a proposed regulation that would use the MA definitions for a nonstatistical purpose, the agency should seek public comment on the proposed use of the MA definitions. As indicated above, we are not proposing the options outlined in sections III G and H at this time. However, consistent with OMB's bulletin and as part of our continuing review of the definitions used to define labor market areas for wage index purposes, we are soliciting comments on the use of MSA definitions as incorporated in the options described in this document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

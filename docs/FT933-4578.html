			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Croda recovery continues with 29% rise to Pounds 18.5m SHARES IN Croda International rose by 19p to 330p after the speciality chemicals and coatings group reported a continuing recovery in profits. At the pre-tax level they rose by 29 per cent, from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 18.5m, in the six months to June 30. Turnover was 13 cent higher at Pounds 207.3m (Pounds 183.7m). Currency translation boosted both the profits and sales figures by 8 percentage points. Mr Michael Valentine, chairman, said chemicals increased trading profit from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 18.7m, which represented 82 per cent of the total. Sales rose from Pounds 122.8m to Pounds 134.7m. He said: 'All our major UK operations performed well and a key factor in this good performance was the growth of our exports.' Substantial capital expenditure in recent years in the UK plants continued to pay off, with better products being produced by fewer people. The UK workforce fell by 130 to 2,528. Overseas operations also performed well, particularly in the US, Japan and Singapore. Trading profits from the group's coatings division were flat at Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.3m), reflecting competitive pressures in the industrial paint and ink markets. Sales grew from Pounds 42m to Pounds 52.8m. The Australian and New Zealand operations improved profits, but the US inks business disappointed. Cosmetics and toiletries, which increased sales from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 19.8m, made a small trading profit of Pounds 500,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 200,000 last time. However, customer demand remained weak on both sides of the Channel. Mr Valentine said trading outlook continued to be encouraging with clearer signs of recovery in many markets, although not yet in continental Europe. However, he believed that while the failure of fixed exchange rate parities in Europe might increase competition, 'we shall benefit overall from improvements in economies which have for some time been artificially held in recession.' Earnings per share rose by 31 per cent to 9.4p (7.2p). The interim divided is lifted by 7 per cent to 2.95p (2.75p). COMMENT Croda is reaping the benefits of heavy investment, recovering markets and a market shift towards higher purity and more natural chemicals, which the group has positioned itself to benefit from. The small cosmetic and toiletries division is languishing and coatings has been under pressure, but overall Croda can look ahead confidently to increasing demand. The share price has nearly doubled in the past year and forecast full-year profits of Pounds 38.5m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 17.2. That 8 per cent premium to the market does not seem unjustified, but the shares have had a good run recently and look due a period of consolidation.</p>

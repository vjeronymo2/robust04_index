			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (12): Fledgling market's spectacular rise - Christopher Bobinski visits the Warsaw stock exchange 'THE WORD went out that there was money to be made, so the cash flowed in.' That is how Mr Janusz Piekarski, an early investor and regular attender at the Warsaw Stock Exchange, explains the reason for the fledgling market's spectacular 175 per cent rise over eight weeks after Easter, before the laws of economic gravity reasserted themselves. But even as prices began to come down at the beginning of June hopeful investors continued to crowd into the banks to buy shares in two new issues which, when quoted on the WSE, should bring the number of stocks traded at its three sessions a week up to 21 by the autumn. The surge in prices marked the exchange's first big boom since it was set up almost two years ago in the communist party's old headquarters. The flood of money brought price/earnings ratios up to an average of 10 from about three, at which stocks had stagnated for most of last year. Average turnover per session rose from 30bn zloty to 350bn zloty as some 19,000 Poles opened accounts with brokers, enabling them to buy and sell shares. Newcomers to the market brought the number of active investors up to around 100,000. The impetus for the boom came from two sources. One was the dip in bank interest rates in the early spring, prompting savers to find a new home for their money. The other factor was an influx of foreign investors whose steady buying orders at the height of the boom were, according to official estimates, responsible for a quarter of the turnover, giving the market its upward momentum. Foreign investment included five funds led by Invesco's CEAM fund, an early entrant on the exchange. That brought the smaller, and some large, investors in off the streets as they became aware there was a 30 per cent untaxed profit to be made buying available stocks. Despite the madness the market did tend to favour the 'better' shares such as Wedel, the chocolate manufacturer controlled by PepsiCo, Mostostal, a building company and Electrim, the trader in power and telecommunications equipment. Electrim is particularly well-placed to benefit from modernisation of the country's infrastructure. Recent developments have delighted Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the WSE chairman. But even with recent price rises, WSE capitalisation, which reached some Dollars 800m at its peak, still accounts for little more than 2 per cent of the population's total savings. The exchange, modelled on the French order-driven system, where prices are allowed to move by 10 per cent up or down per session, has stood up well in the new business rush. Next year, Poland's mass privatisation programme should see the transfer of up to 600 enterprises into the hands of foreign-managed investment funds. Shares in these funds are to be available at a nominal fee to all adult Poles. These will then become tradeable. The plan is to establish an over the counter system before the funds are transferred to the WSE. Thousands of employees are to be granted 15 per cent of the equity in the companies managed by each individual fund. An important dampening factor on the WSE's performance is the series of strict rules on the disclosure of results by publicly-quoted companies which many Polish companies - and some foreign companies operating in the country  -remain wary about.</p>

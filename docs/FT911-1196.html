			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Putting a floor under the North Sea FT-SE Index: 2,540.5 (+17.8) Oil exploration companies have been singularly out of favour since October last year. Sentiment will doubtless improve if Enterprise confirms a joint venture with Elf of France to buy the North Sea assets of Occidental. Whether this will signal a fundamental change for the sector is unclear. The least that can be said for any Enterprise/Elf deal is that at around Dollars 1.4bn it would work out roughly 40 per cent more per barrel than Lasmo paid for Thomson North Sea two years ago, which should put a floor under the price of similar assets. Given that stocks which normally trade at a premium are languishing at discounts to asset value - shares in Lasmo and Enterprise are at discounts of 13 and 35 per cent respectively - this would be a boost of sorts, but scarcely constitutes grounds for a re-rating. If the sector was clearly expensive last year, it is not self-evidently cheap at today's low relative level. Any deal with Elf over Occidental will probably include a resolution of the French company's 25 per cent stake in Enterprise, perhaps by a swap for a share in the Nelson field. This would certainly satisfy the politicians. The removal of that overhang, plus the cash flow benefits of the asset swap, would only be a significant fillip for Enterprise if it can avoid tax complications on the Elf stake. Investors who believe in the continuing fecundity of the North Sea will doubtless stick with Enterprise until it diversifies. Judging by BP and Shell's recent international finds, prospects might be better further afield, in which case Lasmo and Ultramar probably have the edge.</p>

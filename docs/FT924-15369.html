			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / The risk of a triple dip President George Bush hailed the marginal decline in unemployment last month as a sign that the economy was on the mend. He was grasping at straws. The jobless rate fell only because the labour force shrank faster than employment; it was not a sign of strength. Recent economic data, in fact, are quite alarming - the economy appears to be losing what little momentum it had during the summer. On Wall Street there is even talk of a 'triple dip' recession. This will irritate many optimists who deny that the economy ever suffered a second dip. Gross domestic product has grown every quarter (albeit very sluggishly) since the spring of last year when the contraction phase of the recession ended. But the economy most definitely dipped late last year; a host of indicators - including employment and industrial production - declined sharply, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by a full point in an effort to revive confidence. For a while, the stimulus appeared to work wonders; consumer spending surged in the first quarter of this year, prompting an increase in production and some rebuilding of corporate inventories. The ever-sanguine US forecasting fraternity promptly assumed that the 'recovery' was finally underway. The previous year's forecasts of 3 per cent growth were dusted off and issued as 1992 projections. Yet it has become apparent that something is amiss. Consumer spending ran ahead of incomes and did not generate enough new employment to become self-sustaining. By mid-year it was clear that the economy was growing at an annual rate of only about 1.5 per cent; consumer confidence, meanwhile, was again beginning to erode. With the outlook for exports also deteriorating because of depressed markets in Europe and Japan, business confidence began to wobble. Instead of hiring, companies began firing, further undermining consumer confidence. The upshot is that the economy is now in almost as fragile a condition as this time last year. GDP appears to have grown in the third quarter, but at a declining rate. The employment figures released on Friday were a catalogue of woe for the second month running. Non-farm payroll employment declined 57,000 last month and figures for August were revised sharply down to show a decline of 128,000. After allowing for the distorting effects of the federal summer jobs programme, employment has registered an average monthly decline of about 19,000 for the past three months, marking a sharp break with the modest gains recorded in the second quarter. The average work week also contracted, indicating further pressure on personal incomes. Nearly every recent economic statistic has been significantly weaker than predicted. But the biggest shock was delivered last week by the nation's purchasing managers - unsung executives whose collective ear tends to be close to the ground. The Purchasing Managers' Index, a barometer of conditions in manufacturing industry, plunged last month, falling below 50 per cent for the first time since January when the economy was recovering from a second dip. Readings below 50 per cent indicate the manufacturing sector is contracting. The sharp fall, moreover, mainly reflected a collapse in the component of the index measuring corporate order books; historically this has been one of the more accurate leading indicators. The housing and construction industries, normally the first to benefit from lower interest rates, are also flashing amber. Home sales and construction outlays have fallen sharply recently despite the lowest interest rates for nearly three decades. Analysts are alarmed by signs that non-residential construction is again collapsing, having appeared to stabilise earlier this year. With corporate giants such as IBM announcing big staff cutbacks, an early firming of demand for office space, which remains in chronic excess supply in nearly every American city, seems improbable. The economic outlook is much worse than most forecasters - certainly the White House - ever envisaged. But it would be wrong to exaggerate the risks. If a triple dip materialises at all, it is likely to be similar to last year's mini-downturn - a stalling of growth in which some, but not all, sectors and regions slip temporarily into recession. But even this degree of discomfort may be avoided if the Fed opts to cut interest rates again after next week's meeting of governors and regional presidents. The betting on Wall Street is that interest rates will be reduced, despite the risks of turbulence in foreign exchange markets and the proximity of a presidential election. At the margin this will help revive confidence, although it is hard to see the current level of rates as a binding constraint on economic growth. The odds that a new president will authorise a fiscal stimulus next spring have also shortened, although it is far less clear that additional borrowing would offer net benefits. The 3 per cent growth forecasts that keep surfacing will eventually be vindicated, but only when structural factors depressing the economy, such as high consumer and corporate debt ratios, glutted real estate markets, and the secular decline in defence spending, have loosened their grip. How long the adjustment will take is still anybody's guess. In the meantime the economy is likely to make erratic progress.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Observer: Last ditch? Peripatetic Canadian-born currency economist Paul Chertkow, has surprised even friends by his decision to ditch Citibank to join UBS in London as head of global currency research, a newly created post. True, he is well known not only for jumping off, but for landing on his feet. In just over five years, his currency forecasts have dropped on clients' desks from addresses as diverse as Hongkong Bank, Security Pacific Hoare Govett, Drexels as well as, until a few days ago, Citi. Even so, since that last move gave him a perch with the pre-eminent force in global foreign exchange, the 44-year-old currency specialist had been sounding as if he had at last found a home. Not so. Now, with yet another new challenge accepted, he says he intends 'to retire at UBS'. (Observer undertakes to remind him of that forecast if necessary). 'I've been paid well for quite a while,' he adds, explaining that the breadth of the job, not money, was the decisive issue. The arrival of Chertkow, no shrinking violet, may well put noses out of joint. Already Malcolm Roberts, head of bond research, and chief UK economist Bill Martin are not known for the harmony of their views. So despite Chertkow's claims that they're all old and very good chums, territory could be an issue. While the new boy will no doubt rise above such things, it's a fair bet some delicate egos will be jostling for attention soon. Perhaps it is fortunate that the recent UBS edict, meant to stop equity analysts wasting time talking to the press, doesn't extend to the economics department.</p>

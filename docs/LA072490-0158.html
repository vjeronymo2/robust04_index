			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NUN DIES IN N. IRELAND BOMBING  </P> <P> A huge bomb exploded today on the outskirts of the border city of Armagh,  killing a Roman Catholic nun and three policeman, police said.  </P> <P> The murder of the nun was thought to be the first time a nun has been killed in  21 years of sectarian violence in British-run Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion immediately fell  on the Irish Republican Army. The killing of a nun would be seen widely as a  grave embarrassment to the mainly Catholic IRA.  </P> <P> The bomb, planted in a drain beneath a road, blew apart an unmarked police car,  instantly killing the three officers traveling in it. The nun, who died later  in hospital from severe injuries, was traveling with a woman social worker in a  separate car caught in the blast.  </P></p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Virgin makes sale to Blockbuster Blockbuster Entertainment, the US video rental group which owns 19.9 per cent of Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE), a British video software developer, is to take control of the company by buying a further 55 per cent stake from Mr Richard Branson, owner of the Virgin group, and other shareholders. Blockbuster said yesterday it intended to sell its entire VIE stake on to Spelling Entertainment, the Hollywood film production company in which it has a majority stake, in return for Spelling shares valued at Dollars 165m. This will boost its stake in Spelling from 70.5 to 77 per cent. Virgin will get around Dollars 125m in cash from the deal and retain a 10 per cent stake in VIE. Hasbro, the toy manufacturer, holds the remaining 15 per cent. VIE, with sales this year of around Dollars 200m, develops, publishes and distributes video games for leading consumer hardware systems, including Nintendo, Sega and CD-ROM. Its titles include The Seventh Guest - a hit CD-ROM game last year - and it is also releasing games based on Walt Disney cartoons. Blockbuster is diversifying from video retailing into a broad-based entertainment conglomerate. It bought its initial 19.9 per cent stake in VIE in January, when the British group was contemplating a flotation in the US. Mr Robert Devereux, who will continue to head VIE under its new ownership, said Virgin had decided to sell a majority stake, rather than float, partly because of poor stock market conditions but mainly because of its view of the future of the games industry. Virgin believes that the next two or three years will sort out 'the companies that dominate the business for the next 10 years'. An alliance with Blockbuster, with its marketing and distribution strength, would help secure VIE's position. Blockbuster has 4,250 retail outlets around the world. Spelling produces television shows, such as the teenage soap opera Beverly Hills 90210, and also has a film and television library which could be used in interactive games. Blockbuster and Virgin already have a joint venture to build music megastores.</p>

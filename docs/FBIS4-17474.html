			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>   [Text] Lvov 25 April TASS -- "Statements by Yuriy Meshkov  [president of the Crimean Republic] about the Crimea's secession  from Ukraine are poorly thought-out," Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk said in an interview with the world service of Radio  Ukraina this morning.    "All the Crimean decrees contravening the Ukrainian  Constitution and laws will be abrogated in future too. I do not  speak about decrees on economic reform. In this case, there can  be appropriate variations and additional possibilities for the  economy's liberalisation," the president noted.    "I see Ukraine as a unitarian country," Kravchuk stressed.  "Meshkov's statements that Ukraine should leave the Crimea, are  not serious. The Crimea is a Ukrainian territory recognised by  all countries in the world. If Russia has now bases in the  Crimea for its Black Sea Fleet, it is impossible to force it to  leave the bases.    "We should come to agreement with Russia, which signed  appropriate documents providing for a lease of bases on the  Crimean territory for a definite period of time till this issue  is settled on a broader scale."    Kravchuk underlined: "I'm against aggravating the problem of  the Black Sea Fleet beforehand. On the basis of a preliminary  understanding, a meeting of ministers or delegations, we shall  abide by understandings which are incorporated in the four  documents signed by the Ukrainian and Russian heads of state.    But neither Russia nor Ukraine should dictate or demand a  unilateral advantages. It is a complicated problem, and it  should be settled reasonably and quietly in order not to quarrel  and not to bring the situation to a conflict."    Kravchuk said that he had a telephone conversation with  Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin who suggested that meetings  should be held at the level of the cabinet heads or the  presidents and that a decision should be taken on the Black Sea  Fleet.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> KRONOS PLAYS AT UC RIVERSIDE  </P> <P> Before flying off to Europe next week, the Kronos Quartet stopped Thursday  night at UC Riverside to launch its 1990-91 season in Southern California.  </P> <P> For fans of the pioneering, controversial and peripatetic San Francisco-based  ensemble, that isn't much of a season. Besides its appearance Thursday, the  quartet plays south of Bakersfield only two more times in this concert year:  Jan. 12 at UCLA and Jan. 15 at UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> In Riverside, there were consolations, not the least of which were visual:  Kronos now travels with both an audio engineer (Jay Cloidt) and a lighting  designer (Larry Neff). At this performance, Neff provided atmospheric,  ever-changing, unobtrusive lighting.  </P> <P> The promised first hearing of a work by the West African composer, Foday Musa  Suso, had to be put off -- Suso has not finished the piece, violinist David  Harrington announced from the stage. But the scheduled world premiere  performance of Peter Apfelbaum's "Lanterns and Cathedrals" did take place.  </P> <P> Apfelbaum's often dissonant, sometimes neo-Renaissance score, 13-minutes in  length and dense with activity, signals, like many of the works produced  recently for Kronos, a resurgence of interest in basics: dancey rhythms,  aerated instrumental textures, a blunt approach to form. It is both attractive  and disturbing.  </P> <P> Also disturbing and invigorating, John Zorn's recent (also 1990) "The Dead Man"  grips the listener through discrete, grating, abrasive and hallucinatory sound  events punctuated by dead silence. The four members of Kronos -- violinists  Harrington and John Sherba, violist Hank Dut and cellist Joan Jeanrenaud --  proved, as always, capable of specifying exact musical and technical  differences between each of these works.  </P> <P> Justinian Tamusuza's, "Mu kkubo ery omusaalaba" replaced the unfinished Suso  piece at the top of the program, and blithely; it is a brief and buoyantly  rhythmic work clearly and charmingly in the key of G.  </P> <P> The program closed with a fully realized, wondrously detailed, tight and  impassioned revival of Alban Berg's Quartet, Opus 3. After that, there were  encores, pieces by Kevin Volans and Jay Cloidt.  </P></p>

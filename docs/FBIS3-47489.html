The resumption apparently means that Ozawa has agreed to  Shinseito officials' requests that he meet with reporters.    "We hope to respect and understand each other by resuming  the  press conferences," the office said.    Ozawa had refused to hold press briefings since early  November as negotiations between him and the media organizations  deadlocked over his ban of journalists of two major dailies --  the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and the SANKEI SHIMBUN -- from his  press meetings.    Ozawa, a powerful figure of the coalition government led by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in late October began  excluding the two papers' reporters from his news conferences,  saying their news coverage on him had been inaccurate.    Ozawa's office said the two papers will be allowed to attend  the Monday meeting.    The Monday meeting will be held for the first time since  November 8, when Ozawa held a press conference to tell reporters  that he had accepted 5 million yen from scandal-plagued Kajima  Corp. as a legal political donation.    The Tuesday edition of the South Korean daily TONG-A ILBO  carried an interview with Ozawa, in which he was quoted as  saying that the Japanese mass media are mean and inhuman hordes  that only criticize.</p>

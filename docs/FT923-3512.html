			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Erith reports losses of Pounds 229,000 Despite 'a further deterioration in the trading climate' Erith, the builders merchant, achieved a slight improvement at the pre-tax level in the six months to end-June. Losses were Pounds 229,000, compared with Pounds 332,000 in the second half of last year and profits of Pounds 356,000 at the interim stage last time. Turnover fell by Pounds 657,000 to Pounds 33.5m. The company said the promised uplift in demand for building materials following the general election in April had evaporated, while losses arising from bad debts had once again been a large cost feature, amounting to more than 2 per cent of turnover. Losses emerged at 0.34p (0.55p earnings) and the interim dividend is 0.35p (1.3p).</p>

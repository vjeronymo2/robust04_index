			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bosnian ambassador to Tehran has termed the fall  of Gorazde a pre-planned Western plot. In an interview with our  reporter, Mr. Omar Bahman emphasized that the UN and Security  Council member countries, including Britain, France, and Russia  were directly responsible for the massacre of Gorazde Muslims.    In reference to activities of the UN secretary general, he  said: Butrus-Ghali and other UN officials are receiving huge  salaries from the international budget to guard the interests of  powerful countries.    The Bosnian ambassador also called on Islamic countries to  show greater movement toward solving the Bosnian crisis. Mr.  Omar Bahman said: Islamic Conference Organization resolutions,  much like UN resolutions, have remained as paper documents. He  said that a number of Islamic countries, in particular Arab  governments, which are similar to Western countries and act to  deceive public opinion, support Bosnia only in words.    Thanking Tehran for its stance, the Bosnian ambassador said:  The practical support provided by the people and government of  Iran for the Bosnian nation was an appreciated reality.</p>

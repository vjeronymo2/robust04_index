Shiryayeva,  All-Russian Mikrob Antiplague Scientific Research Institute,  Saratov; UDC 576.8:575:616.981.452]    [Abstract] The discovery that the  Ca[.sup]2+[/]-dependence plasmid is the necessary inversion  genome element for imparting virulence prompted a study in which  biologically active pCaD loci were cloned and their functions  subsequently examined. In particular, the fifth HindIII fragment  of PCaD and hybrid plasmids containing small functionally  significant segments of this fragment are investigated.  Altogether, a bank of HindIII, EcoRI, and PstI fragments of the  Ca[.sup]2+[/]-dependence plasmid of Yersinia  pestis, strain 358, is constructed, and restriction pCaD  charts are plotted by means of restriction analysis using these  fragments as probes. The findings demonstrate that the study of  the mutation versions' expression of an intact pCaD plasmid or  even its small fragments is probably not justified in some cases  due to the complicated and little-known regulatory relationships  among this plasmid's individual genes. An animal study also  reveals that two subfragments of the fifth HindIII fragment are  capable of ensuring the pathogenic and invasiveness properties  of avirulent strains of Y. pestis, Y.  pseudotuberculosis, and E. coli while the full  nucleotide sequence does not exhibit such properties. The issue  of the reasons for the absence of protective effect from  immunization with E. coli strains pSM2[.sup]+[/]  and pSM3[.sup]+[/] remains unclear.

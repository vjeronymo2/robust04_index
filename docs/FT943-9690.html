			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / BHP set to seal death blast mine Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) and its workers' union yesterday decided to seal a pit at Moura, central Queensland, entombing 11 coalminers killed in a big underground explosion on Sunday night. The decision was taken after a second big explosion yesterday, followed by several smaller blasts causing fires inside the mine. It was hoped that sealing the mine would put out the fires. The open-cut section, producing most of the coal, will keep operating. A mixture of methane gas and coal dust caused Sunday's explosion, trapping the workers in a tunnel 265m underground, and 3km from the mine entrance. The explosion is the third in 20 years to hit the BHP Australia Coal operations in Moura. In 1986, 12 men died in the Number Four mine, and in 1975 13 died in the nearby Kianga mine. The Moura mine is 80 per cent owned by BHP Australia Coal and 20 per cent by a Japanese company. It has an annual production capacity of 2.1m tonnes of coking coal and 2m tonnes of thermal coal.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Peace dividend at risk of draining away: The audit office accuses Whitehall of costly defence spending errors DEFENCE ministers, contractors and civil servants are wasting tens of millions of pounds of the peace dividend through mismanagement, political interference in procurement decisions and foreign exchange errors, according to an independent government report. The National Audit Office's Statement on Major Defence Projects, published today, lists errors that have cost tens of millions of pounds and are leaving part of Britain's navy unable to defend itself. The report comes less than a week after publication of the defence white paper that detailed measures to make Britain's armed forces 'smaller but better'. It is the more sensitive for being a first: until this year, its contents were largely classified. The report will make uncomfortable reading for Mr Malcolm McIntosh, the new head of defence procurement, and his bosses, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, the minister for defence procurement. The audit office is a government watchdog that examines the financial performance of public bodies. Perhaps the most serious of the audit office's accusations is that in 1987 Sir George Younger, then defence secretary, overruled Mr McIntosh's predecessor, Sir Peter Levene, by insisting that a contract worth Pounds 130m was placed with the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside. Sir Peter had advised that that 'the prudent and economical course' was not to accept the Swan Hunter bid to build the second of two auxiliary oiler replenishment vessels. He wanted a competition for the contract. The audit office says privately that the government decision to give the order to Swan Hunter 'was political rather than economic': the yard had just been sold by the government to its management. The decision was one of a series of errors with the oiler contract that have left the project almost three years behind schedule. The oiler is an essential part of Britain's post-cold war naval defences, supplying fuel, stores, maintenance and ammunition to ships at sea. Two have been ordered by the MoD, the first from Harland and Wolff in Northern Ireland, the other from Swan Hunter. Both projects are now late, with Harland and Wolff so far behind schedule that the ship has been sent to another yard, Cammell Laird, to be completed. Exasperated at the delays, the MoD suspended payments to Harland and Wolff in 1990 and 1991, but the audit office says: 'None of the sanctions imposed by the department appears to have had a significant impact on the rate of progress'. The original four-year timescale to completion has slipped to almost seven years, with the first of the ships due to enter service at the end of this year. The ships are also over budget: the original target price for the contract was Pounds 122m a ship, and the MoD estimates that total Harland and Wolff costs so far amount to Pounds 172m. The audit office says the MoD had been 'over-ambitious' in awarding the contract to Harland and Wolff, which had 'limited recent experience of warship building'. Audit office officials say privately that Harland and Wolff should never have been given the business because it had been late on previous defence contracts. The Swan Hunter deal is also criticised: the MoD decided to award the contract too soon after Harland and Wolff had started work. The Northern Ireland yard had not yet drawn up its construction plans and the MoD was forced to pay up to Pounds 13m to Swan Hunter for another set of plans. It had to accept a delay in the delivery date as a result. Furthermore, says the audit office, neither ship will be able to defend itself when launched over the next two years. The specification called for the ships to be fitted with vertical-launch Sea Wolf missiles, developed by British Aerospace and GEC-Marconi for protection against incoming missiles and aircraft, and EH101 anti-submarine helicopters made by Westland with Agusta of Italy. The EH101 is not expected to enter service until 1998, five years late. While the Sea Wolf is ready, the ship cannot make use of them until its command system becomes operational in 1996. 'These difficulties call into question the wisdom' of MoD procurement policies that include new defence systems in a ship procurement contract, the audit office says. The MoD argues that it is only partly to blame for the delays in the oiler construction projects. The department defended itself yesterday over the oiler problems by saying contracts with suppliers were tightly drawn so that contractors, not the ministry, would bear cost overruns. But the audit office lists several examples where the department had to pay more than the contracted price to Swan Hunter for items such as rewriting of software. The report concentrates on difficulties with the oiler contract but also lists eight projects worth more than Pounds 250m that have had suffered cost overruns of more than 5 per cent. The mid-life update of the Tornado fighter aircraft and development of the Type 23 frigate will have cost up to a third more than planned. Another four projects will be more than 5 per cent cheaper than anticipated, largely due to cuts in the size of orders. Other losses include a Pounds 36,000 shortfall in foreign-exchange dealings as a result of an omission in a contract with McDonnell-Douglas, the US defence manufacturer. The watchdog does not provide a total figure for the losses it has identified because of inconsistencies in the way the figures are calculated by the MoD and the Treasury. Nor did it give an overall view of how much a typical project was delayed, this time blaming 'a lack of consistency in the definition of in-service dates'. The army and air force, for example, had different definitions for the entry dates of the British Aerospace Rapier surface-to-air missile. The audit office says such inconsistencies give 'a misleading impression that equipment is universally in use by front-line forces and performing fully to specification'. The government is not likely to respond in detail to the report until October, when parliament returns. Some responses should emerge when Mr McIntosh gives evidence to the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee or the Commons defence committee. When he does so depends on when he is called by the committees.</p>

Thirty-four years after the discovery of the first laser,  another generational shift in high-efficiency lasers is again  approaching with the transition from tube technology to  semi-conductor technology, or from gas laser to diode laser. In  the areas of entertainment electronics and communications and  information technology, the replacement of tube technology with  semiconductor technology has already made possible and produced  revolutionary developments.    It is expected that a similar major advance in technology  and  development in [the area of] high-efficiency lasers will  fundamentally shape future laser equipment technology and open  up new fields of application. The German government intends to  support this development with the joint Laser 2000 program,  which Federal Minister of Research and Technology Paul Krueger  has now introduced in Bonn.    Preparing the generational shift in technology with  high-efficiency lasers is the object and goal of the pilot  project, already started at the beginning of the year, on  high-efficiency diode lasers and diode-pumped solid-state  lasers. It has to do with developing a small, compact,  high-efficiency, low- maintenance laser. It is expected that  such an generation of lasers will open up broad markets.  Materials processing in particular is being considered in this  context, as well as using laser technology for television.    Substantial work was already done on the high-efficiency  diode laser in the second half of the 1980's in America under  the strictest secrecy in the Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory within the framework of the former SDI program. One  important field of application which stands in the forefront is  automobile manufacturing. The German government is hoping that  with the current Laser 2000 program the present lead by the  United States will be overtaken. So the project will be oriented  toward the needs of industry. A project advisory council was  formed representing Siemens, Janoptik, Rofin-Sinar, Haas Laser,  Adlas and Baasel [as written] Lasertechnik. The pilot project is  currently made up of three joint projects in industry and four  joint research [projects].    Parallel to this, the four joint research projects will deal  with basic research themes such as the preliminary research in  securing technical scientific alternatives--for example, new  technologies for high-efficiency diode lasers and new  ytterbium-base solid-state lasers.    The work of the four joint research projects is being  financed with about 30 million German marks through the Federal  Ministry of Research and Technology. For the three joint  industry projects, financing in the amount of 35 million German  marks is being projected, to which the Federal Ministry of  Research will contribute around 19 million German marks.</p>

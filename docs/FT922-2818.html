			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Hopes for relief flights depend on Serb ceasefire THE WARRING sides in Bosnia-Hercegovina signed a new ceasefire agreement yesterday, raising hopes that aircraft might be able to fly relief supplies to the republic's besieged and starving capital, Sarajevo. In New York, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, is today expected to advise the Security Council on whether Canadian troops should be deployed to Sarajevo airport so relief flights can land there. His decision depends on whether a ceasefire takes hold. The truce is due to come into force at 6am today. The ceasefire agreement was signed by Serb paramilitary forces and their opponents - who include not only Moslems and Croats but also rival Serbs. With hostility running deep, the opposing sides signed separately in the UN peacekeeping forces' headquarters in Sarajevo. A unilateral ceasefire had already been foreshadowed last Friday by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serb irregulars who have blockaded the airport and bombarded the city since early April. They are opposed to the republic's proclaimed independence from the Yugoslav federation. Pressure has mounted on Serbs to end the war since the UN imposed sanctions on Serbia and its ally, Montenegro, two weeks ago. In the latest sign of discontent among Serbs, Patriarch Pavle of the Serbian Orthodox Church led thousands of people on a peace march through Belgrade yesterday. Thousands more gathered at the Yugoslav parliament to demand that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic resign. Over the weekend, General Lewis Mackenzie, head of the UN mission in Sarajevo, reached an agreement with the Bosnian presidency, and Mr Karadzic, to exchange liaison officers with all sides. The officers will try to monitor the demilitarisation of the airport. French airport security technicians, who are already in Sarajevo, were due to go to the airport yesterday to supervise the process of de-militarising it and the surrounding areas. Once this is achieved, Mr Boutros Ghali will recommend to the Security Council whether to send 1,000 Canadian troops already deployed in Croatia as part of the UN peacekeeping operation there. Sarajevo radio yesterday reported a lull in the fighting, but said snipers had repeatedly fired on engineers who had been trying to restore the water supply after the city's generators were bombed. It said 17 people were killed in fighting at the weekend. The war in Bosnia will be discussed in Luxembourg today by European Community foreign ministers, Portuguese officials said yesterday. They said the future status of Macedonia, Croatia's involvement in Bosnia, and the potential threat of war spreading to the Serb-controlled southern province of Kosovo - where tension between ethnic Albanians and Serb police rose sharply yesterday after a Serb soldier was killed - would also be on the agenda.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Personal equity plans: how safe is your money? - Shares in Peps are held in nominee companies which do not neatly fit existing compensation rules, as Scheherazade Daneshkhu explains PERSONAL equity plans have become one of the more popular ways of investing, partly because public interest in equities is reviving now that UK interest rates have fallen and partly because of their much-advertised tax efficiency. A Pep allows investors to hold shares (or unit trusts) without paying income or capital gains tax, subject to an annual investment limit of Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep but with the option of an additional Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep. In order to get the tax break, Peps must be managed and administered by an Inland Revenue-approved registered scheme manager. For this reason, the Revenue does not allow shares held within a Pep to be registered solely in the shareholder's name. Instead, most plan managers use a nominee company - one formed specially to hold shares on behalf of a third party - to register them. Nominee services are not an authorised activity under the Financial Services Act (FSA). This means that, technically, they fall outside the scope of the investors' compensation scheme (ICS), which will pay up to Pounds 48,000 of a loss when an authorised company or person defaults. However, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the regulatory body for the financial services industry, has said that stock held in a nominee name usually will be eligible for compensation under the ICS rules. This is not a legal obligation, though, and some readers have voiced concern about the safety of their Peps. But Pep-holders probably are better off than other investors with shares in a nominee account. 'The best reason for regarding nominee accounts as safe is that the government regulations say that stock held in a Pep must be held by a nominee,' says David Langshaw, from the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers. The regulations also say that even though the shares must be registered in the name of a nominee, the 'beneficial (or true) owner' is the investor, not the nominee company. The Pep manager himself, as head of a Revenue-approved body, has to be authorised under the FSA. 'The Pep manager has responsibility for the clients' money. If he were to go under, the investor would be entitled to compensation through the authorised entity,' says David Cresswell of SIB. Pep-holders who are worried can take further measures to protect themselves. Most managers operate a pooled nominee service where shares belonging to investors are batched together for registration in the nominee company's name. This is the only name that then appears on the stock exchange's register. Some plan managers - usually those running a self-select Pep, where the investors choose their own stock - operate designated nominee accounts where the shares are registered jointly in the name of the nominee company with a specific account number or sets of initials which can be used to identify the individual shareholder. A further advantage for investors in a designated nominee account is that they would receive the annual reports of those companies in which they have shares. Stockbrokers prefer pooled nominees, however, because of the ease of administration. If, for example, a broker had 1,000 clients with ICI shares in the name of a pooled nominee, there would only be one dividend cheque to handle. With a designated nominee, the broker would have to administer 1,000 dividend cheques. 'I have no doubt that nominee accounts are robust although, it has to be said, they have never been tested very seriously,' says Paul Killik, of Killik &amp; Co., a stockbroker which runs designated nominee accounts for all its Pep clients. One test occurred in 1991 with the collapse of Diameter, a low-cost stockbroker. The liquidators found that the firm had neglected to buy all the shares for which its clients had placed instructions. These shares could not be located in its nominee company. Affected investors were compensated by the ICS on the ground that the authorised company, Diameter Stockbrokers, was guilty of wrongdoing. So far, 483 such investors have been paid but the process has been lengthy. This kind of delay is less likely to occur if the plan manager runs a designated nominee account in which the shares and owners can be identified readily. Investors cannot sell their shares until this reconciliation process is over. Managers running pooled accounts are required to keep up-to-date records identifying all the investors and the shares they hold. Audits have to be done every six months and the Securities and Futures Authority makes regular spot checks. If a Pep manager loses his status - which would happen automatically if he became bankrupt or the business was wound up - investors have the right either to transfer their plan to another manager or to close it. 'In the case of involuntary withdrawal or revocation of approval, the person appointed to terminate the scheme should perform these duties,' says Martin Dodd, of the Pep Managers' Association. The Revenue says that if compensation is paid to investors under the ICS, the money will be treated as a Pep transfer if it goes directly to a new plan manager. In this way, the tax-free status of the money built up in the Pep would not be jeopardised.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Yeltsin threatens broadcasting ban President Boris Yeltsin yesterday warned that Russian politicians who attacked his draft constitution could have their free air-time for party political broadcasts confiscated. Mr Yeltsin urged candidates 'not to sling mud at each other' and to campaign in a 'more civilised way'. His comments showed a combination of paternalism and a more authoritarian streak as he attempted to dictate the content of political debate. The constitution will be put to a referendum on the same day as parliamentary elections on December 12. Mr Yeltsin - in a reference to the bloody crushing of a parliamentary uprising - said the price paid for a constitution to be submitted to the people had already been too high. His legal department also issued a statement saying it was absurd for candidates to run for parliament while calling for a boycott of the constitution, which would make the elections null and void. His request for a clean campaign was echoed in 'recommendations' issued by the special arbitration court which is supposed to monitor media coverage of the elections. It said that the prime duty of candidates was to tell voters about their programmes so they could decide whom to vote for. The court also said candidates should not slander each other. It cited an insinuation by Mr Stanislas Govoriukhin, a film-maker running for the Democratic party, linking Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia's Choice, with the theft of billions of roubles from the state mint during the October 3 uprising. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic (neo-fascist) party, was criticised for 'whipping up ethnic hatred'. The court also suggested that candidates should devote more time to debate among each other rather than using free television time for monologues. Mr Yeltsin revealed that he wanted parliament to be housed in the former Comecon building - home to some of the Moscow mayor's offices and international organisations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Comecon skyscraper is next to the White House, the old parliamentary building which will become government offices. Moscow to condemn nationalism, Page 2</p>

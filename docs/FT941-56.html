			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Stakis on the acquisition trail Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, yesterday capitalised on its recent recovery by announcing a Pounds 67m rights issue to fund its acquisition strategy, writes James Buxton. It also announced the purchase of two hotels for a total of Pounds 15.5m and disclosed that it is close to concluding the purchase of a further hotel and a casino for a total of Pounds 13.1m. The rights issue will reduce Stakis's gearing from 46 per cent to 20 per cent. Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said it would enable the company to take advantage of opportunities in the hotel and casino sectors 'quickly and efficiently'. The Glasgow-based company which came close to collapse in 1991 because of ill-managed expansion, has reorganised its banking arrangements, cutting the number of its banks from nine to four, leaving Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale. It has obtained a new Pounds 30m facility over five years at a lower rate above Libor than previously, on top of the existing facility of about Pounds 140m. Drawing on this facility Stakis has bought the 132-room Coburg Hotel in the Bayswater Road, London, for Pounds 9.5m. The three star hotel was in receivership after a Pounds 3m refurbishment in 1990 and was put on the market by KPMG, the receiver. The company has also bought the 108-room Airport Ambassador Hotel at Norwich airport for Pounds 6m. The four star privately owned hotel was making annual profits of about Pounds 1m. The rights issue, which is fully underwritten by Schroders and Noble Grossart, involves the issue of 95.5m new shares on a 1-for-4 basis at 72p each. The shares closed down 1p at 84p yesterday. Latest time for acceptance of the new shares is April 30. Stakis forecast a total dividend for the year to October 1994 of not less than 1.5p, against 1p last time. It said it was too early to forecast the results for the full year, but Sir Lewis said there had been 'an encouraging start with some, if limited, signs of recovery in demand in the hotel division and stable, satisfactory trading in the casino division.'</p>

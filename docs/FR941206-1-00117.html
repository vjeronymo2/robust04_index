			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (h) Section 201&hyph;3.204 paragraph (a) is amended to update the phone number for the Government Printing Office (GPO) Bookstore.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) In &sect;&sect;201&hyph;4.001 and 201&hyph;39.201, the definition for outdated FIP equipment is revised to shorten the period for determining when FIP equipment is outdated. The FIRMR defines outdated FIP equipment as any FIP equipment over eight years old, based on the initial commercial installation date of that model of equipment, and that is no longer in current production. This definition has been in existence since 1986 when the product cycle of computer equipment was four years. Since that time, the product life cycle has decreased to about three years, and industry spokesmen state that this figure is decreasing even more. When microcomputers are upgraded, the product cycle may be even less since typically they are upgraded by replacing internal computer equipment has little or no market value. In recognition of these faces, the definition for outdated equipment is being revised to shorten the time interval from eight to six years after the first commercial installation at which point equipment no longer produced is considered to be outdated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Section 201&hyph;4.001 is amended by adding a new definition for ``Records management. The FIRMR discusses records management in subpart 201&hyph;9.1, but has never included a definition. The definition added is the same as contained in OMB Circular A&hyph;130. Also, the existing definitions of ``application software'' and ``common-use software'' are designated (a) and (b) respectively of the larger term, ``Software'' for consistency of format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Section 201&hyph;4.002 is revised to include the following new acronyms: CBD, FED-STD, FSTS, GAO, GSBCA, IRPMR, MIL, OAC, and POTS. These acronyms were used in the FIRMR index, but previously were not defined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Section 201&hyph;4.003, Applicable OMB Circulars, is being added. In order to avoid future changes to FIRMR text caused by revisions of OMB Circular titles, this new section is added to include the current titles of all OMB Circulars referenced in the FIRMR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Section 201&hyph;6.001 is revised to add a new item (a)(5) to more closely reflect the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, as well as address matters raised in OMB Circular A&hyph;130. These include improving service delivery, dissemination of information, increasing productivity, improving quality of decision making, reducing fraud and waste, and reducing the information processing burden. Section 201&hyph;6.001 is also revised to redesignate the previous item (5) as new item (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) A series of revisions are being made due to Pub. L. 102&hyph;569 October 29, 1992), which amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 broadening the scope of accessibility for individuals with disabilities. These revisions capture more thoroughly the intent of Pub. L. 102&hyph;569. The previous version of the Rehabilitation Act only required that GSA ensure those with disabilities can access ``electric office equipment.'' The revised statute recognizes that while equipment accessibility is important, that alone is not sufficient because an agency's applications software and user interfaces can impede the functional use of a computer if they do not have features permitting use by individuals with disabilities. The revised statutory provision emphasizes that all individuals must be able to use technology to accomplish the same end objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new &sect;201&hyph;6.002(g) is added to include as a predominant consideration in the management and use of information and records, the importance of ensuring that individuals with disabilities can produce information and data, and have access to information and data, comparable to the information and data, and access, respectively, of others. Section 201&hyph;6.002 is also revised to redesignate the previous item (g) as new item (h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the insertion of &sect;201&hyph;6.002(g), discussed above, other provisions of the FIRMR pertaining to accessibility by individuals with disabilities are being revised to incorporate the statutory intent of Pub. L. 102&hyph;569. These other FIRMR provisions are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _201&hyph;17.001(j)_Predominant Considerations in the Management and Use of Federal Information Processing (FIP) Resources;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _201&hyph;18.001(e), which generally describes the Federal Government's statutory responsibility to foster accessibility for individuals with disabilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _201&hyph;18.002(c), which pertains to adoption of accessibility guidelines in agency IRM plans; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _201&hyph;20.103&hyph;7(a), which requires agencies to incorporate accessibility requirements in their acquisitions of FIP resources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (o) Section 201&hyph;7.001 paragraph (b) is revised to delete a reference to canceled OMB Circular A&hyph;3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (p) Section 201&hyph;7.002 paragraph (c) is revised to clarify when information needs are determined. The existing text suggested that information needs were to be determined before conducting a requirements analysis. The revised text reflects that determining information needs and analyzing requirements are frequently concurrent activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (q) Section 201&hyph;9.202&hyph;1 paragraph (b)(9) is revised to update the current mailing address for the Supply Management Division.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

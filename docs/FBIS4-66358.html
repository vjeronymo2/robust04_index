			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Gong Dafa [7895 6671 4099]: "Geheyan </F> Hydropower Station Construction Proceeding Quickly; Two  Generators Placed Into Operation Within One Year"]    [Text] At 2045 hours on 2 December 1993 the No. 2 generator  at Geheyan Hydropower Station on the Qing Jiang smoothly passed  72 hours of trial operation and was formally placed into  operation to generate power, creating a good level of placing  two generators into operation in one year in China's  construction of 1,000MW-grade large hydropower stations over the  same period.    Geheyan Hydropower Station will be composed of four 300MW  generators. Installation of the No. 2 generator began on 5 April  1993, and assembly of the entire generator and static debugging  were completed on 19 November 1993. The trial operation was  successful on the first attempt and its maximum load reached  300MW. During the process of installing the No. 2 generator, the  engineering and technical personnel created another new record  in China's large water turbine generator installation and  debugging: they took just 38 days to install the rotor of the  No. 2 generator, 53 days less than No. 1. They took just nine  days from full water debugging to the first connection to the  grid, one day faster than the No. 1 generator which attained an  advanced international level. After the No. 1 generator was  placed into operation and began generating power ahead of  schedule on 4 June 1993, they took only one-half year for the  No. 2 generator to begin generating power ahead of schedule,  which was 6 months and 29 days ahead of the original design  power generation construction schedule.</p>

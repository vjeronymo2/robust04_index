			<p>BFN     [Text] After 30 months of crisis, the deadlock among the  Haitian factions looks complete, while the list of victims of  repression and of the embargo grows longer everyday. A  hypothetical negotiated solution was further postponed by a vote  on 10 April for implementation of Article 149 of the  Constitution by one of the antagonistic blocs in the Senate.  This Senate bloc is not acknowledged by the international  community. The article they propose provides for the appointment  of a provisional president and new general elections, which must  result in the installation of a new president on 7 February 1995.    Washington has already warned that this kind of solution is  not acceptable. The United States and the United Nations is  still supporting a parliamentary compromise inspired by the  Governors Island agreement and widely approved by the moderate  deputies supporting President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, by the  socialists, and the centrists.    President Aristide has rejected this plan. Despite  parliamentary and diplomatic pressures, the Senate bloc  acknowledged by the international community and presided over by  Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, who is close to the  president-in-exile, has so far not approved it, provoking a  vacuum that is being exploited by the bloc of adversaries of the  president headed by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq. The latter spoke of  a letter from the military high command acknowledging him as  legitimate president of the Senate. This document has so far not  been made public. Neither has the Army taken an official stand  on this parliamentary issue. Its chief, General Raoul Cedras,  has always, since the beginning of the crisis, found a way out,  allowing the military institution to save face and to preserve  its unity.    While awaiting a solution in which fewer and fewer Haitians  believe, the gruesome detailed accounts by victims of  repression, partisans of Father Aristide, and victims of the  international sanctions, are increasing daily. According to the  latest figures, communicated to AFP by the international  civilian mission in charge of ensuring that human rights are  respected in the country, 111 cases of extrajudicial execution  and suspicious death were recorded in Port-au-Prince between  February and March. Six similar cases were already recorded  between 1 and 10 April.    The mission has also denounced the existence of clandestine  detention centers and cases of rape of a political nature. For  the same period, the Haitian Platform of Human Rights  [Plateforme Haitienne des Droits Humains], PHDH, which  encompasses several organizations, has reported 162 people  wounded by gunshot or beatings; 153 illegal arrests, and 297  cases of illegal search or destruction of property belonging to  individuals or organizations. The civilian mission and the PHDH  accuse civilian police auxiliaries; members of the Revolutionary  Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, the main  neo-Duvalierist formation, which has rejected these accusations;  and the Armed Forces.    A doctor, who wishes to remain anonymous, told AFP that an  average of 12 people are admitted to the Port-au-Prince general  hospital with gunshot wounds (?per day), where the sanitary  conditions, previously precarious, are now disastrous. Half of  these survive surgical operations, according to this doctor.    The victims of the international commercial embargo,  effective since October 1991 and intensified in 1993 by an oil  embargo that has quickly affected the most deprived members of  the least advanced country in the American hemisphere, have  added to this assessment. The sanctions have created over 10,000  victims within the most vulnerable groups, including women,  children, the elderly, and the ill, according to independent  religious and humanitarian organization officials who wish to  remain anonymous. One of them, a priest working for 34 years in  peasant circles, has denounced the tragic continuation of a  collective punishment for the poorest of people, and the morally  inadmissible use by the international community of the suffering  and death of thousands of children for political ends.</p>

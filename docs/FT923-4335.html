			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Coalition feels the strain over beef: Irish government says it is business as usual IRELAND'S so-called beef tribunal resumes today after a summer recess, with the prospect of the country's present and immediate past prime ministers appearing on the witness stand in the next few weeks. Government spokesmen insist that the atmosphere in the coalition cabinet of prime minister Albert Reynolds continues to be one of business as usual, but it is clear that the coalition came under increasing strain before the summer as the tribunal started to hear testimony from key witnesses. That strain could reach breaking point this autumn. Last month the Supreme Court granted an injunction to the attorney general which in effect prevents the tribunal from investigating past cabinet decisions relating to the beef industry. It did so just as key witnesses such as Mr Reynolds and former prime minister Charles Haughey were due to take the witness stand. The Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry was established in June last year as a parliamentary inquiry to investigate allegations of fraud, malpractice and political favouritism in Ireland's multi-million pound beef industry. Many of the allegations have focused on Goodman International, a private company headed by Mr Larry Goodman, and Europe's biggest beef processor. The allegations had been made in parliament and in a TV documentary screened earlier in 1991. Then prime minister Mr Haughey described them as 'one of the most persistent and venomous political campaigns ever waged in an attempt to discredit the government over the affairs of the Goodman companies. . .' Mr Haughey has since been swept away by a wave of scandals, some of which are still the subject of official inquiries. A number of political careers remain on the chopping block, not least that of Mr Reynolds. He was industry minister at the time of the alleged wrongdoings and is likely to be called to the witness box within the next two weeks. The proceedings have provided an intriguing insight into the process of decision-making in the Irish civil service and the way in which powerful business interests have helped shape government policy and decisions involving hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money. The question of whether the influence that was exerted lay within the bounds of normal commercial practice lies at the heart of the inquiry. The tribunal has heard of official documents being altered, apparently by civil servants, statistics from different government departments flatly contradicting each other, ministers making statements to parliament on the basis of erroneous information provided to them by their department officials, and apparently key meetings taking place between ministers and businessmen for which no official minutes were kept. A report published in the Irish Times last weekend that 70 per cent of the beef sold to Iraq under insurance cover was in fact sold out of EC intervention stocks has added a further twist to the saga, and a new point of attack for Mr Reynolds' opponents. He said on local radio yesterday: 'It was a revelation to me.' In July, the first cabinet minister gave evidence to the tribunal - Mr Des O'Malley the industry minister, and the leader of the Progressive Democrat party which is in coalition with Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party. He made clear he believed Mr Reynolds had exhibited serious errors of judgment in allegedly going against civil service advice in approving up to IPounds 325m of export credit insurance to Goodman companies for beef exports to Iraq in 1988, while curtailing the availability of insurance cover to other companies in all sectors of Irish industry. It all squares rather poorly with the promise of open government made by Mr Reynolds when he took office last February. That promise helped keep the coalition together immediately after Mr Haughey's demise. The tribunal is due first to investigate contributions made to political party funds by the beef industry before Mr Haughey and Mr Reynolds are called to give evidence later this month. It is perhaps no coincidence that insistent rumours of an early general election, perhaps before next spring, are circulating in Dublin's corridors of power.</p>

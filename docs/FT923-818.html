			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Books: Cold steel in a hand of passion - The private life of Bertrand Russell BERTRAND RUSSELL: A LIFE by Caroline Moorehead Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 572 pages IN THE 17 years since Ronald Clark's biography of Bertrand Russell, much new material about Russell has appeared, making a new biography both possible and desirable. Clark wrote largely about the public Russell; for the private man Russell's own story had to be accepted. Now Caroline Moorehead has given us a marvellously revealing new portrait of Russell which takes us deep into his personal life. Russell was a Victorian aristocratic inhabiting the 20th century. He was the grandson of a Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, and was raised and privately educated in the austere atmosphere of his grandparents' house. In 1890, aged 18, he went to study mathematics and philosophy at Cambridge. There he experienced for the first time the exhilaration of intellectual companionship and personal freedom. So began an extraordinary career. It lasted until Russell's death in 1970 at the age of 97 and ranged from abstract work in logic and philosophy to CND demonstrations in Trafalgar Square. Russell twice went to prison: in the First World War for his pacifism, and in 1961, aged a sprightly 88, for demonstrating outside the American Embassy in London. He lectured in China and America, wrote many popular books on social, political and educational issues, and because of his views on sex was regarded as an ogre by puritans everywhere. As a result, in 1940 he was banned from lecturing in New York, on the grounds that he was likely to corrupt the morals of the young - exactly the same charge levelled at Socrates. His greatest intellectual achievements were his work on the foundations of mathematics, and his development of logical techniques in philosophy. Both have contributed hugely to the character of analytic philosophy. But he was equally, if more diffusely, a force in the liberalisation of social morality in Britain and elsewhere. Changes in attitudes since 1945 stem in no inconsiderable part from his unwearying assaults on humbug and moral conservatism. Starved of affection in youth, Russell married early and unwisely. His first wife was a Quaker older than himself, from whom he soon became estranged. His first genuine experience of love came when he met the flamboyant Lady Ottoline Morrell in 1911. 'You have released in me,' he told her, 'imprisoned voices that sing the beauty of the world.' Russell was 40 years old, and the experience changed him fundamentally: thereafter he had relationships with many women, and married three more times. His last and longest marriage, to Edith Finch, was happy; but most of his relationships ended bitterly, and some of Russell's children seem blighted by his overwhelming and sometimes icy effect on their lives. Yet he was also capable of charm and fun, and no-one who met him could disagree with Virginia Woolf's comment, 'I should like the run of his headpiece]' Moorehead recounts all this with great skill and readability. She is a talented biographer, and writes especially well of the people and relationships in Russell's life. The story unfolds with a compelling narrative richness, explaining the historical events which prompted Russell's political work, and making vivid the great throng of supporting actors around him. A life so huge in so many ways is difficult to write, but Moorehead does an admirable job, distilling from a mountain of sources a remarkable and absorbing story. Her portrait of Russell is unflinchingly just: she illuminates both the best and worst of him as a man, never exaggerating or extenuating, and in consequence brings the engaging, sometimes disagreeable, elfin figure - in his own words clutching 'cold steel in a hand of passion' - strongly to life. There are, however, two flaws in Moorehead's book. The more serious is that her understanding of Russell's logical and philosophical work is hopelessly inadequate. If she can get something wrong, she does; the book is dotted with (mercifully brief) examples of the worst sort of scratchy undergraduate essay, cobbled without understanding from cribs. A second edition must put this right; for the time being readers are advised to ignore the philosophical bits entirely. The second flaw is a characteristic one for Sinclair-Stevenson books: sloppy editing. Russell, Moorehead says, sought to "balance a life of action with one of scholasticism'; she means "scholarship', of which scholasticism is a degraded species. Ludwig Wittgenstein appears disguised as "Ludwig von Wittgenstein'. And so on for many similar careless slips which editors - at least in other publishing houses - are paid to help authors avoid. But these cavils should not be allowed to detract from the praise otherwise due to Moorehead for her achievement. This is a fresh, thorough and perceptive account of an extraordinary life, the best we have on its subject to date. It richly deserves to be read.</p>

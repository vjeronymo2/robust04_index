Clinton  will first attend the NATO summit meeting in Brussels and will  then visit Prague and meet with the leaders of the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland. From 12 to 15 January,  he will visit Moscow and meet Russian President Yeltsin. Then  he will visit Minsk and meet the leaders of Belarus. Finally,  he will go to Geneva to meet Syrian President al-Asad.    Europe was the focus of U.S. foreign policy for a long time.  However, in the year since Clinton took office, he has mainly  paid attention to domestic affairs. In the diplomatic field, in  addition to attending the G-7 summit in Tokyo, meeting with  Russian President Yeltsin in Canada, and attending an informal  meeting with APEC leaders, Clinton has been busy coping with  regional conflicts and has had no time to deal with European  affairs. However, it is also a pressing matter to readjust the  United States' relationship with Europe and with Russia in the  new post-Cold War situation and thus maintain the United States'  "leading position" in Europe and the whole world. This is the  main purpose of Clinton's current visit to Europe.    With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the  Cold War, the precondition for a U.S.-European alliance against  the Soviet Union did not continue to exist. The dissolution of  the Warsaw Pact even brought about a deep split in the  longstanding security ties between the United States and Europe.  Disagreements over various European security issues, especially  the function and scope of NATO, increased between the two sides.  On the issues of settling the conflicts in Bosnia and Somalia,  the United States could not effectively influence other  countries. U.S.-European conflicts over economic interests also  increased, and trade friction between the two sides caused the  Uruguay Round of trade talks to stagnate for a long time. In  addition, as the United States attached greater importance to  the Asia-Pacific region and proposed the establishment of a "New  Pacific Community," this caused much speculation about a shift  in the focus of U.S. foreign policy. In such circumstances,  Clinton's current trip to Europe is aimed at reiterating  Europe's importance for the United States' global interests and  emphasizing that the United States will continue to undertake  its commitments to NATO and will continue to strengthen its  cooperative relationship with Western Europe in the security  field, thus maintaining the United States' domination of  European affairs through NATO.    The NATO summit meeting in Brussels will mainly discuss how  to strengthen security cooperation with the former members of  the Warsaw Pact. In consideration of their own security  interests, some East European countries, which were formerly  members of the Warsaw Pact, are eager to join NATO. Some NATO  member countries also hold that the "security vacuum" brought  about by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe  should be filled in good time and that the East European  countries should be admitted to NATO. However, Russia is opposed  to the admittance of the East European nations into NATO. In  view of Russia's stance, the Clinton administration holds that  hasty action could endanger NATO's own interests. In addition,  the victory of the Liberal Democratic Party headed by  Zhirinovsky in the recent Russian parliamentary election made  the United States and Europe feel that the rise of nationalist  sentiment in Russia could weaken the United States' influence in  Russia and that the situation could become unfavorable to both  the United States and Europe. Therefore, the United States put  forth a new proposal on establishing a "partnership for peace"  with the former members of the Warsaw Pact so that military and  security cooperation between the West and the East European  countries will be advanced in a steady, prudent, and gradual  form and will not agitate Russia excessively. Public opinion  here holds that Clinton will persuade his NATO allies and the  East European leaders to accept this proposal during his visit.    In the past year, Clinton gave great support to Yeltsin in  weathering two major political crises inside Russia. It is  expected that the meeting between the two leaders will be  focused on how to help Yeltsin maintain the momentum of reform  after the Russian parliamentary election and to win support from  the public. At the same time, the two sides will also discuss  the issue of controlling nuclear weapons and preventing nuclear  proliferation.    Middle East peace will continue to be a key point of U.S.  foreign policy. When meeting with Syrian President al-Asad in  Geneva, Clinton will urge him to quicken the pace of  Syrian-Israeli talks and thus further advance the Middle East  peace process on the basis of the historic peace agreement  concluded last year.    Public opinion holds that Clinton's visit to Europe at the  beginning of his second year in office obviously shows that he  intends to accomplish something in the diplomatic field in order  to change the Democrat administration's domestic image of being  "incompetent in foreign affairs."</p>

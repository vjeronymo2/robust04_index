			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- Celebrities from all  walks of life and social organizations in Hong Kong today  published comments welcoming China's publication of the facts  concerning Sino-British talks, and they expressed the belief  that the Chinese document can help Hong Kong residents  distinguish between right and wrong. They pointed out: The  facts have amply testified that the Chinese side made tremendous  efforts at the talks. The essence of the Sino-British dispute  is not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong,  but one of whether to act in good faith and whether to converge  with the Basic Law in the three aspects so as to realize a  smooth transition in Hong Kong. In the face of the iron-clad  facts, Britain can hardly shirk its responsibility for the  rupture of the talks.    Fan Xu Litai and Li Zetian, members of the Preliminary  Committee, said: China's publication of the facts concerning  the talks is a good thing which can help the public in Hong Kong  understand the truth. The facts show that during the talks,  China made considerable concessions over the three preconditions  set by Britain, that is, "lowering the voting age, abolishing  appointed membership, and implementing the system of single  seat, single vote." China also agreed to the British proposal  concerning elections of the two municipal councils and the  district board. China only requested that discussion of the  single seat, single vote system in the Legislative Council  elections be left to a later stage. However, Britain used this  as a pretext to suspend the talks. This move by Britain shows  that it has no sincerity whatsoever in the talks. Fan Xu Litai  said: It is China's consistent goal to maintain Hong Kong's  smooth transition, prosperity and stability. China had hoped  the talks would be successful; the responsibility for the  breakup of the talks lies with Britain.    Li Liansheng, a deputy to the National People's Congress,  said: Since Britain has unilaterally published the tailored  contents of the talks, it is only natural that China has been  compelled to make a corresponding response by making the facts  public. In so doing, Hong Kong residents can distinguish right  from wrong and will not be misled by the British-orchestrated  public opinion. He added: The British unilateral publication  of the White Paper is an attempt to take the initiative to  misguide Hong Kong residents and make them believe that  responsibility for the rupture of the talks lies with China.  The facts prove that the essence of the Sino-British dispute is  not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong, but  one of whether to abide by the agreements reach between the two  countries. The Chinese and British Governments long ago reached  a series of agreements and understandings concerning the  arrangements for Hong Kong's political system. The unwarranted  dispute has been started by Britain's inconsistency and failure  to honor its commitment.    Hong Kong affairs advisor Chen Wanxian welcomed China's  publication of the details of the talks, and deemed the document  as helpful for Hong Kong residents to draw a fair judgment. She  said: By using the promotion of democracy to cover up its  failure to honor the Sino-British agreements and understandings,  Britain's ultimate objective is to perpetuate its vested  interests in Hong Kong beyond 1997.    Hong Kong affairs advisor Tang Yizhu pointed out: The facts  show that Britain, devoid of sincerity in the talks,  unreasonably brought up at the negotiation table the demand to  discuss issues falling within the scope of China's sovereignty  and manipulated the Hong Kong's Legislative Council to discuss  the "constitutional reform package." Obviously Britain wanted  to use the talks to cover up its efforts to peddle the so-called  "constitutional reform package." He added: As we understand,  in order to reach agreement with Britain on electoral  arrangements for the district board and the two municipal  councils, China repeatedly made concessions during the talks and  proposed a compromise which took into consideration the stand of  both sides and which would skirt the differences between the two  sides. However, Britain raised obstacles which led to the  rupture of talks.    The Hong Kong Federation for Democratic Construction,  Association of Freedom and Democracy, Liberal Party, Focus,  Association for the Advancement of Democracy and the People's  Life, and many other political parties and social organizations  in Hong Kong also published commentaries, giving a "big welcome"  to the Chinese publication of the facts concerning the talks. A  few of social organizations believe that the contents released  by China are "comprehensive," while those in the British version  are "selected and prioritized." China's move can help the  residents better understand the truth that Britain's  faithlessness led to the failure to reach a Sino-British  agreement on electoral arrangements.    Yang Yaozhong, a representative of the Hong Kong Educators'  Association, said in a commentary: The contents of the details  of the talks released by China can ensure a correct  understanding of the facts. In the face of the facts, Britain  cannot shirk its responsibility for the rupture of the talks.  In more than a century of colonial rule, Britain has never  promoted democracy in Hong Kong. Now it is holding the banner of  democracy. The essence of this is to maintain Britain's  influence on Hong Kong after 1997.</p>

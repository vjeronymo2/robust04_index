			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S MOST VIOLENT GANG-RELATED SHOOTING IN HANDS OF TWIN JURIES;  </P> <P> TRIAL: DEFENDANTS DIDN'T CARE THAT 4-YEAR-OLD WAS KILLED, PROSECUTOR SAYS IN  CLOSING ARGUMENT. 'THEY WANTED TO GET EVERYBODY.'  </P> <P> A 4-year-old boy was killed in the La Bonita Avenue shootings last September  because the three defendants from the 5th Street gang didn't care whom they  killed in an escalation of gang warfare in Orange County, a prosecutor told  jurors this week.  </P> <P> "It made no difference to them," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef. "They  wanted to get everybody and they wanted to make an impression -- that they were  macho."  </P> <P> Avdeef, who completed his closing arguments Tuesday in a unique two-jury trial,  argued that the county's worst shootings were a pay-back because a nephew of  Louis P. Valadez, 28, one of the defendants, had been killed in an earlier gang  incident.  </P> <P> On trial with Valadez are Robert P. Figueroa, 20, and Roman G. Menchaca, 19.  They are charged with the murders of Frankie Fernandez Jr., the little boy, and  Miguel (Smokey) Navarro, 18, and the attempted murders of six other people who  were wounded in the Sept. 16, 1989, shooting.  </P> <P> Witnesses said that as a pickup truck moved slowly down the street just after  dark, two young men in the back began firing at random toward the people on the  sidewalk and in cars in the 13000 block of La Bonita Avenue, just north of  Westminster Avenue in Garden Grove. The La Bonita address is considered turf  for the 17th Street gang, a longtime rival of 5th Street's.  </P> <P> Three young women who dodged bullets that night identified the three defendants  and a juvenile, who is in custody and will be tried separately, as the  assailants. The three women said they broke the gang code of silence and agreed  to testify because of the little boy's death. Two of the women were his  cousins.  </P> <P> Several other victims said they could not identify the assailants but could  identify the truck -- a red pickup with a unique rack of amber lights on the  cab. Avdeef introduced evidence that Valadez owned a truck like the one  identified.  </P> <P> Valadez was identified by one of the three young women as the driver; Figueroa  by two of them as a passenger in the cab. All of them identified Menchaca as  one of the two shooters riding in the back of the pickup.  </P> <P> But the three defense lawyers hammered away at inconsistencies in the women's  versions about what happened, calling them all liars. One lawyer argued that  the three women only assumed it was Valadez and his two friends because they  thought they recognized the truck.  </P> <P> One of the young women said she saw Figueroa before the shooting began, then  later said it was afterward, when the truck had passed. Figueroa's attorney,  Julian W. Bailey, argued to the jurors Monday that "Superman couldn't have  identified anybody in that truck" because the cab's back glass was black. All  the defense lawyers argued it was too dark and the witnesses were all too busy  dodging a hail of bullets for them to see anything.  </P> <P> Valadez's attorney, David Zimmerman, argued that it was nonsense to believe  Valadez would have used his own truck, with its unique front, if he were going  to be involved in the shooting. Zimmerman asked his client to stand up.  </P> <P> "Does Louis look naive? Does Louis look dumb to you?" Zimmerman asked the  jurors.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour ordered two juries to hear the trial -- a  unique situation in Orange County, but already done elsewhere in California --  because of a last-minute decision to include Menchaca as a defendant. He was  about to be granted a separate trial because his attorney, C. Thomas McDonald,  had a scheduling conflict. When that was resolved, Seymour ordered a second  jury to hear the trial and decide only on Menchaca's case.  </P> <P> The two juries sat in on the trial together until the end. A split in strategy  between McDonald and the other two defense attorneys led the Menchaca jury to  hear evidence the other lawyers didn't want their jury to hear.  </P> <P> McDonald boldly announced to jurors he would name the real killers, and put on  evidence to show that a nephew of Valadez's and two of his friends had  Valadez's truck that night. Valadez's attorney didn't want his jurors to hear  that because that would be a tacit admission that his client's truck was indeed  involved in the shooting.  </P></p>

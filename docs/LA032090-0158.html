BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SEABROOK IN START-UP PHASE  </P> <P> Operators at the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant began start-up  procedures early today that will bring the $6.5-billion reactor to full power  in about three months, a plant spokesman said.  </P> <P> The controversial plant's reactor was started at 3:59 a.m.  </P> <P> Seabrook received its full-power license Thursday after a federal appeals court  rejected a request for a stay by plant opponents.  </P> <P> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to approve a full-power license for  Seabrook on March 1.  </P> <P> "Operators today began the process of bringing the reactor up to the 3% power  level for initial testing of plant systems," said Ron Sher, spokesman for New  Hampshire Yankee, which operates the plant.  </P> <P> Sher said after testing is completed at the 3% level, plant operators will  gradually increase the reactor power levels in increments to 30%, 50%, 75% and  100% power over the next two or three months.  </P></p>

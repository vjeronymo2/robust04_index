			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL SET FOR SON OF EVANGELIST CERULLO  </P> <P> The son of San Diego evangelist Morris Cerullo will go on trial Oct. 12 on  charges that he tried to steal an air-conditioning unit from a store.  </P> <P> Mark Stephen Cerullo, 33, the minister's youngest son, pleaded not guilty to  burglary and attempted grand theft charges Tuesday in San Diego Superior Court.  </P> <P> Cerullo almost had a warrant issued for his arrest Tuesday, as he didn't appear  on time at his scheduled arraignment.  </P> <P> A prosecutor asked Judge David Gill to issue a warrant, but the minister's son  arrived about 45 minutes later. Gill told Cerullo to appear in court on time  next time.  </P> <P> Cerullo, who is free on $4,000 bail, declined to say who bailed him out of jail  after his July 29 arrest or to comment about the case to reporters.  </P> <P> The Rev. Morris Cerullo, who is planning to buy the PTL ministry left by Jim  and Tammy Bakker, said earlier this month that he was not going to post bail  for his son.  </P> <P> Neither parent appeared at the arraignment.  </P> <P> Cerullo is accused of posing as a Home Depot employee at the Sports Arena store  and trying to leave with an air-conditioning unit without paying for it.  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Piper Alpha claim is overturned A WORKER who witnessed the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster from a rescue vessel was not entitled to claim damages for the psychiatric injury he suffered, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday. Three judges overturned a High Court ruling that Mr Francis McFarlane, a painter from Alloa, near Stirling, could claim because he had been in fear for his life and safety and the fear had caused the shock which led to his injury.</p>

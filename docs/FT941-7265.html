			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Granada poised to clinch LWT Granada looked set to win its Pounds 750m hostile bid for LWT yesterday after Mercury Asset Management accepted the offer for its 14.2 per cent stake. The decision by Mercury, which has been widely seen as crucial to the outcome of the battle, means Granada goes into the final day of the bid with 42.2 per cent of LWT's shares. Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, said: 'It is extremely unusual to have received such a high level of acceptances at this stage and we are confident of success.' Although LWT put on a brave face, most independent observers dismissed its chances of remaining independent. 'It has been on a knife-edge but I think Granada has got it now,' said one analyst. Apart from Mercury, Granada's final offer has gained the backing of a further 8 per cent of LWT's shares. It entered the bid with about 17.5 per cent and received acceptances for its first offer from around 2.5 per cent. LWT said: 'We are very encouraged because it means that since the new bid was announced they have been able to persuade only 7 per cent of the non-aligned shareholders. We are confident that the genuine LWT shareholders will see the case for independence and stay with us.' Clearly disappointed by Mercury's decision, LWT suggested it had been influenced by its 16 per cent stake in Granada, whose shares would be likely to fall if the bid fails. However, Mercury has a policy of treating such stakes separately, as they will be spread between clients. LWT also said that by accepting before the final day Mercury was trying to influence other shareholders. It is understood that Mercury found the decision difficult but was swayed by the need for further consolidation among ITV companies. LWT's management appeared to admit as much by its attempt to form an alliance with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and Anglia. LWT is believed to have the firm backing of shareholders with about 26.5 per cent of the equity, including its management and staff, and Warburg Pincus, the US institution represented on the board. Other large shareholders include Fidelity, AMP and Henderson Administration. It was unclear last night which, if any, of these had accepted the bid.</p>

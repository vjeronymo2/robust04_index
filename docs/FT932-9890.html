			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Japan mounts offensive on trading rules JAPAN has fired a potentially explosive shot into the ongoing battle over trade with its main trading partners by accusing them of unfair trade practices in a report released by the government yesterday. The report from Japan, which is often on the receiving end of criticism about its trade practices, aims to counter a widespread perception that it is a frequent violator of international trade rules. It highlights the extent to which Japan's top 10 trading partners, which are members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also resort to unfair trade practices. The US, which recently identified construction, architectural and engineering services as areas in which the Japanese government discriminates against foreign suppliers, comes in for heavy criticism for its tendency to take unilateral action in retaliation for what it considers unfair trade practices. This, Japan says, is counter to the spirit of multilateral trade forums and counter-productive. 'The US is without parallel in imposing measures that force its trading partners to abide by unilateral judgments,' the report states. 'In our view, the unilateral approach often only impedes the settlement of problems that are appearing. . . in the international economy.' 'The US and the EC are both guilty in particular of misuses and abuses of the Gatt provision on anti-dumping duties. 'In the case of the US, arbitrary calculation methods of dumping are used which either 'create' dumping where it does not exist or magnify its scale.' The US is also guilty of blaming dumping for injuries caused by unrelated factors, the report states. The EC, meanwhile, has its own peculiar practices with regard to anti-dumping which abuse the Gatt provision. In particular, the EC calculation of price comparisons in the home market and in the export market inflates the dumping margin. The report prepared by the advisory committee to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is the most comprehensive official response by Japan to recent criticism by its trading partners of the country's massive trade surplus and the underlying suggestion that the surplus is due to practices that do not conform to international rules. The report also contains a strong rebuttal of the new US administration's position that Japan's stubborn trade surplus can only be reduced by seeking measurable results in opening its markets to foreign products. A results-oriented policy not only lacks objectivity, it mistakenly links trade imbalances directly with inadequate market access, the report states. The report concludes that multilateral forums and internationally accepted rules are the best way to resolve trade disputes.</p>

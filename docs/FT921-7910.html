			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Caltagirone wins Cementir bid CALTAGIRONE, an Italian construction group, yesterday beat consortia including representatives of both the Ferruzzi and Agnelli groups in the race to win a controlling stake in Cementir, Italy's third-largest cement manu-facturers. Caltagirone is believed to have offered around L480bn (Dollars 388m) for the 51.78 per cent share in Cementir, which was put up for sale last year by IRI, the Italian state holding company, as part of the country's sporadic privatisation programme. The price represents a premium of almost 100 per cent over the stake's current stock market value, and will come as a welcome shot in the arm for IRI, which is suffering severe financial difficulties. Its holding in Cementir had a book value of L307.5bn, while the sale price is also well above the L340bn estimate by SIGE, the Italian merchant bank which valued the holding. Cementir had sales of L426bn and produced 3.85m tonnes of cement last year. The company, which has almost 1,400 employees, had around 9.5 per cent of the Italian cement market, trailing Italcementi and the Agnelli-controlled Unicem group. After a long process, the number of bidders was whittled down to six and then three, prior to yesterday's final choice. However, the last stage in the battle maintained the auction's reputation for controversy. The consortium led by the Ferruzzi Calcestruzzi building arm angrily criticised a lack of transparency in the adjudication process. Shares in Cementir, which were on Tuesday suspended pending the outcome of the auction, will resume trading today.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Books: Thwarted dreams of perfection - Fiction SIGNALS OF DISTRESS by Jim Crace Viking Pounds 15, 277 pages FREELAND by JDF Jones Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 293 pages Signals of Distress is the fourth novel from the highly-talented Jim Crace, but the first which could be said to be realistic. The setting is Wherrytown, a miserable fishing village on the Cornish coast, and the time is the 1830s. Enter an American sailing ship with a slave aboard, and a London freethinker and emancipationist, Aymer Smith. The impact of these arrivals on the chapel culture of the village leads, inevitably, to conflict. Aymer Smith is the novel's fulcrum. His utopianism is a fraud; everything he does - while ostensibly for others - is in fact done to enhance his self-esteem. Vanity and self-love lie at the root of his deeds. The author's portrait of this spindle-shaped, boring windbag, who spies on his fellow guests as they make love and is totally and irredeemably unlovable from start to finish, is fantastically achieved, a tour de force. It is also strangely unsatisfying because Aymer at the end knows nothing more than he did at the beginning. In short, Aymer is a cipher who belongs in the canon of revolting men to which the writer Ian McEwan and the film maker Peter Greenaway, for instance, have contributed many examples. Ostensibly, their creations, who are men at their very worst, are intended to satisfy a liberal, pro-feminist constituency; in fact they are anti-male. After 270 pages in Smith's company, I was left with the feeling that this horrible character, and the fact of having created him warts and all, is ultimately less a comment on an autonomously created character than an intended reflection of the author's integrity. But putting aside this reservation, there is no doubt that he can write brilliantly and move his enormous cast around with formidable panache. Some of the themes of Crace's novel - notably that mankind's imperfect nature will always sabotage aspirations to utopianism - are explored in JDF Jones's first novel Freeland. Both works are also mercifully free of the trickery and verbal showing off so common in novels today. The Freelanders of the title are a motley band of idealists who intend to settle in the Kenyan highlands and establish an ideal and just society, crime free, with collectively owned property. But to get where they want to go they must first pass through Lamu, an island off the East African coast and an ancient landfall for mariners on the Indian Ocean. The place is half-Arabic, half-black, civilised, corrupt, corrupting and every bit as confusing and dangerous as the European cities which they have left behind. As the narrative unfolds it becomes clear that our dreamers are hopeless at holding onto their beliefs amid the whore houses, the transvestites, and the slave traders of Lamu; they become ensnared in local plots and most never even get to Africa proper. To point up the unbridgeable gap between the dream and the sordid facts of human nature, every chapter begins with a quotation from the silly Utopian novel of the movement's founder. Freeland is part of the long tradition in literature whereby Europeans dumped in tropical climes behave foolishly, dangerously or criminally and thus reveal that their civilisation is only skin deep. The most sublime example of this form is Lord of the Flies. The cast in Freeland is very large, for besides our 20 or so settlers, there is also the local Arabic ruler and his clan, the local British administrator, and an Englishman of dubious provenance who joins the visitors in order to spy on them. The author does not always move them about gracefully. He is also somewhat inclined to salt the letters of his characters with asides to the effect that everything is falling apart, rather than revealing this fact. Yet there is much pleasure in this book for readers who like their fiction straight up, unadorned, without linguistic flights of exhibitionist fancy and no gratuitous mise en scene designed to expose either the reader's queasiness or the author's bravery in reporting on the disgusting. A decent read.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Bosnia peace 'needs 25,000 UN troops' THE international community will have to make an exceptional effort to ensure that any peace settlement in Bosnia is effectively implemented. That conclusion emerges from a report to the United Nations Security Council on the latest negotiations on Bosnia by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general. The international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, told the Security Council their peace package was enforceable, but would require 15,000 to 25,000 UN troops. Some military experts say that is a very conservative estimate. Admitting the many past failures of ceasefire and other agreements in the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen implied that this was a weakness which needed further consideration in the mediators' plan. Mr Vance and Lord Owen hope that problem will be addressed by the US administration in its own proposals for a peace settlement, due to be announced shortly. Specifically, they want the US to make a substantial contribution to the peacekeeping forces. The US is likely to propose modifications to the map dividing Bosnia into semi-autonomous provinces to give the Moslems more territory, a more robust relief efforts to overcome the Serb militias' harassment of aid convoys, and tighter sanctions against Serbia. President Bill Clinton is also reported to be considering the appointment of a special US envoy to work in co-operation with the mediators. The mediators, according to Mr Boutros Ghali's report, have told the warring parties that an enforceable 'no-fly' ban would be required after a ceasefire to give teeth to the control of heavy weapons. Aircraft used for enforcing the air exclusion zone might also be empowered to strike at any heavy weapons not declared to the UN Protection Force. The mediators also urged the Security Council to establish awar crimes court to try people accused of grave breaches of international law in the former Yugoslavia. One striking conclusion of the report is that it blames the Bosnian Moslem government, represented in New York by Mr Haris Silajdzic, the foreign minister, for refusing to discuss the proposed map during the talks in New York. This, along with the demand by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, for referendums on the proposals in the contested areas, were the main obstacles to an agreement. It remains to be seen whether the intense pressure on Mr Karadzic during the past 48 hours by Russia and Serbia to accept the map will bear fruit before the US proposals are announced. So far, the argument that it is in his interest to do a deal in advance of the more pro-Moslem stance expected to be adopted by Washington, has fallen on deaf ears.</p>

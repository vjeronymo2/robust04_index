			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSMAN GUILTY IN MONEY LAUNDERING  </P> <P> A businessman has been convicted in federal court in Los Angeles of laundering  $24 million through Santa Barbara-area banks for an organization prosecutors  contended was run by a reputed Orange County drug kingpin.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge A. Andrew Hauk said he found Stefan von Metzger's  explanation for the source of the money "poppycock" after the 65-year-old Santa  Barbara businessman was found guilty on 36 counts.  </P> <P> The defense had contended that the money in question came from a plastics  manufacturing business owned by von Metzger's brother-in-law in Venezuela and  brought into the United States legally to purchase supplies.  </P> <P> "I've never seen such a bunch of baldfaced lies," Hauk said. "It's incredible.  I feel sorry for Mr. von Metzger that he got mixed up in this thing."  </P> <P> Sentencing was set for June 12. Von Metzger was allowed to remain free on  $600,000 bail.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. John Gordon contended that von Metzger laundered money for  an organization run by suspected drug kingpin Jose Miller, formerly of Mission  Viejo and now a fugitive. Convicted cocaine trafficker Carlos Ortiz testified  during the trial that he delivered boxes of money to von Metzger on three  occasions.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shi Qingbin (2457 3237 1755)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 24 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According  to a report published a few days ago, the land value-added tax  will not be collected this year and several senior taxation  officials at the provincial level also think that detailed rules  for collecting land value-added tax will not be promulgated this  year. A ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE reporter interviewed Dong Shukui  on this. Dong Shukui is deputy director of the Foreign-Related  Taxation Department of the State Administration of Taxation and  is visiting Hong Kong. Dong Shukui said: At present, detailed  rules for collecting land value-added tax are being formulated  in earnest and they will certainly be published this year.    Dong Shukui pointed out: Detailed rules for collecting the  land value-added tax will soon be promulgated. They may be  promulgated in the first half of this year and their  promulgation will probably not be delayed until the end of the  year. The detailed rules will certainly give full consideration  to the issues which real estate investors are concerned about.    It is known that collection of land value-added tax will  only  begin after the promulgation of detailed rules for collecting  land value-added tax.    Vice Construction Minister Li Zhendong disclosed not long  ago  that detailed rules for collecting land value-added tax  tentatively state that no land value-added tax should be levied  on real estate projects whose contracts were officially signed  before 1 January 1994, and all real estate projects whose  profits do not exceed 20 percent of the cost should also be  exempted from land value-added tax. Land value-added tax should  be levied on real estate development projects investing in  ordinary residential housing and other low-profit housing only  if profits exceed 40 percent of costs.    Li Zhendong also said that detailed rules for collecting  land  value-added tax would be promulgated in the near future.</p>

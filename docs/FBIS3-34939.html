			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 16 February 1989, the Arab Cooperation Council  [ACC], grouping Iraq, Egypt, Jordan, and Yemen, was launched in  Baghdad. The ACC set a good example for promoting joint Arab  action in the interest of the Arab nation and its fateful causes.    The launching of the ACC was an enlightened and rational  response to the challenges and dangers facing the nation,  particularly after the intensification of military conflicts in  the region and after the pan-Arab and national security of ACC  members was jeopardized, not to mention the growing inclination  of world states to establish economic groupings to protect their  national interests.    The announcement launching the ACC was widely welcomed and  supported by the Arabs. People maintained that Iraq's ACC  membership, given its powerful national and pan-Arab weight,  would prompt the ACC to take a serious course in joint Arab  action. That is why the obstruction of the ACC work was one of  the objectives of the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist conspiracy, to which  Iraq was exposed. The Egyptian regime's announcement to suspend  Egypt's ACC membership has confirmed the U.S. desire to thwart  the ACC's noble pan-Arab objectives. The Egyptian regime's  decision was met with extensive and broad opposition in Egypt.  This opposition was reflected in the arguments exchanged by the  Egyptian People's Assembly members when they debated the future  of the ACC on 8 February 1994. The Assembly's debate on the  issue showed a massive support for Iraq. The deputies condemned  the embargo, and urged Arab states to lift the embargo on Iraq.    A large number of Egyptian parliamentarians urged support  for  Iraq so that it may confront plots, and so that it may become,  once again, the mainstay of pan-Arab resurgence. The National  Progressive Unionist Grouping [NPUG] is one of the parties that  expressed support for Iraq. NPUG representative Khalid  Muhyi-al-Din asserted that the embargo is aimed at destroying  Iraq and destabilizing the Arabs.    For his part, Fikri al-Jazzar, speaking for independents at  the People's Assembly, urged the Arab states to shoulder their  pan-Arab responsibilities, and to wage a battle to lift the  embargo imposed on Iraq.    Hence, the positions of the people's representatives were  made clear when they debated the future of the ACC. They  emphasized that the role of the ACC must be rehabilitated at the  current phase, particularly since it constitutes a nucleus for  Arab unity. They added that foreign pressures must be shunned,  because foreigners deem any Arab grouping a threat to their  interests and evil objectives. This was explained by  Diya'-al-Din Dawud, secretary general of the Nasirite Party, who  asserted that if it revokes its ACC membership, Egypt will  confirm that this will be in response to foreign and colonialist  dictates, which aim to isolate Egypt from the Arab homeland.</p>

Sergio Caramana, coordinator of the International  Commission of Support and Verification-OAS (CIAV-OEA), confirmed  the postponement to ACAN-EFE. Caramana is participating in the  talks that will lead to the disarmament of the FN 3-80, which  comprises mostly 400 former contra fighters.    Recontra leader Jose Angel Talavera, alias "El Chacal" asked  that this first direct meeting with the government to be  postponed until next week. The meeting will define the  disarmament process for the rebels operating in the northern  region of the country. According to official sources, "El  Chacal" justified his request by indicating that there is still  a heavy Army presence in the northern regions bordering Honduras  where the recontras focus their operations and where the first  negotiation meeting was to be held.    The redeployment of Army forces from these areas, where  heavy  fighting occurred in January, was one of the rebels' demands for  talks to begin. The recontra leader also said there were other  minor reasons for postponing the talks, including a lack of  communication with the rest of the FN 3-80 high command. An  official source told ACAN-EFE that Talavera is asking for six  more days because he has been unable to contact all of his  forces, and therefore they do not know enough about the  government's disarmament proposal.    The meeting between the government and the recontras was  scheduled to take place in Ciudad Antigua, near Honduras, with  the presence of a mediating commission composed of  representatives from the Catholic Church and the OAS. Caramana  said: "We are all working to try and overcome these last minute  glitches." He added that despite the postponement it is the  express will of the government and the rebels to bring the armed  conflict, that continues to harm Nicaragua, to an end.    Sandinist Deputy Carlos Gallo, president of the  Congressional  Human Rights Commission, told ACAN-EFE the rebels have presented  last minute demands for their disarmament. According to Gallo,  the "recontras" demanded the creation of a safety zone or  enclave and the concentration of military forces in 12 northern  municipalities to be located in Nueva Segovia, Esteli,  Matagalpa, and Jinotega. All of these communities are located  along the Honduran border.    The rebels also said talks will begin seven days after the  military redeployment process is complete. Gallo, speaking with  ACAN-EFE, said this new element brings the talks to a  standstill. An official source explained that members of the  mediation commission were discussing the new conditions with the  government and a formal response to the recontra's proposal will  be released shortly.    The Army and the rebels each called their own cease-fire on  10 February to allow the disarmament negotiations to begin. The  recontra problem surfaced in 1990, shortly after President  Violeta Chamorro took office. Several thousand of the 22,000  demobilized contras took up their weapons again because the  government failed to fulfill the demobilization agreements.    According to official sources, approximately 800 rearmed  rebels, including recontras, former Sandinist soldiers known as  recompas, and common criminals, are operating in the north and  central regions of the country.</p>

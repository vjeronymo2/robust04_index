			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at 8:00" program] </F>   [Text] Beijing is sending signals that Sino-British  relations over Hong Kong may be thawing. A local delegation  visiting Beijing has been repeatedly assured by senior Chinese  leaders and officials that the time has come for cooperation.  Linda Lee reports.    [Lee] The message came from the Chinese vice premier and  foreign minister today. Qian Qichen was receiving a delegation  from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions at the Diaoyutai  State Guest House. The tone of the Chinese vice premier was  much milder than last year, when Beijing lashed out at Governor  Chris Patten's political reform proposals. Qian was quoted as  saying that the failure of the political talks last year is a  thing of the past; now is the time to cooperate on economic  issues. The Chinese vice premier also told the delegation that  there has been good progress in recent defense land talks and  negotiations on the new airport.    Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Director Lu  Ping revealed that the Sino-British Airport Committee will meet  again sometime later this month, but he did not specify any  dates. Lu hinted the gap between the two sides is narrowing.    [Begin Lu recording in Mandarin with English subtitles --  processed from the Mandarin] From the angle of financial  arrangements, we should say there is no difficulty; the British  Hong Kong Government should inject more funds into it and reduce  the size of debts. A solution can be found to that issue, and  there should not be any obstacles. The gap between the two  sides is narrowing. We are striving to resolve the issue as  early as possible.    [Lee] On the pension scheme for civil servants, Lu told the  federation that the $7 billion proposed by the Hong Kong  Government is not sufficient. China will raise the issue at the  next Joint Liaison Group meeting.</p>

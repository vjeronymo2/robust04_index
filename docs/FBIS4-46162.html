			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Maximise U.S. Terrorism Report"] </F>   [Excerpts] Those who have faulted President D.B. Wijetunga  for his references to the terrorist problem that Sri Lanka faces  in the north will be well advised to study the U.S. State  Department's latest annual terrorism report which has in clear  unambiguous language described the Liberation Tigers of Tamil  Eelam (LTTE) to be what they are -- a terrorist organisation  which stops at nothing.    While it is gratifying that countries like the United States  of America are exposing the Tigers in official publications,  identifying their front organisations and presenting  authoritative information on the LTTE's far-flung networks, we  cannot escape the reality that the LTTE is still able to  continue maintaining offices in many western countries and pour  their propaganda into receptive ears.    The question we must ask ourselves is whether our diplomatic  and security apparatus is strong enough to seize opportunities  such as the publication of the State Department's terrorism  report and ensure that the Tigers are driven out of some of  their lairs in Europe and North America. It is essential that  Colombo lobbies the various concerned governments to ensure that  the LTTE finds themselves less comfortable in some of the cities  where they have entrenched themselves.    Much of what appears in the U.S. report is not new. It has  been fairly well known that the Tigers use both overt and  illegal methods for their weapons procuring and fund raising;  that they are into drug trafficking in Europe; that they have  also set up a finely orchestrated propaganda machine to suggest  that the Tamils in Sri Lanka are a besieged people. The fact is  that those Tamils who are besieged are those living in areas  under LTTE control. That is why tens of thousands of people  living in the Jaffna peninsula want to get out of there if they  possibly can.    While many governments are well aware that the Tigers extort  contributions from Tamils working in their countries, very  little has been done to stop such activity. The LTTE, no doubt,  is able to ensure that there are no complaints. It will be a  brave man or woman who would dare blow the whistle on the Tigers  anywhere. But with some effort Colombo will be able to persuade  the concerned governments to at least ensure that asylum  applications of people known to be engaging in illegal  activities are not sympathetically considered.    This is why it is essential that our foreign missions are  properly staffed with trained and effective diplomats. [passage  omitted] It is essential that all our missions work hard at  making life as uncomfortable as possible for Tigers abroad by  turning the heat on wherever possible. They must, among other  things, develop contacts with the security agencies of the host  countries and keep tabs on arms buying and other activities of  the LTTE.    We do not know how much our missions abroad are assisting  the  security effort at home. We hope that a useful input from  Colombo was available to the authors of the U.S. terrorism  report and that this publication will be used to maximum  advantage in all countries in which Colombo maintains diplomatic  representation.    The war against the LTTE cannot be fought only on the battle  field. It has to be fought on many fronts and with different  kinds of ammunition. Washington's latest report has provided  several opportunities which must be seized. It is significant  that the American government has branded the Tigers to be behind  many killings, including those of Rajiv Gandhi, Ranasinghe  Premadasa and Lalith Athulathmudali that the LTTE has denied.  This must be noted by our own people in the context of various  uninformed allegations that we hear in Sri Lanka itself.</p>

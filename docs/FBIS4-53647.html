			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Hypocrite Unmasked" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The recently exposed  concealment of 70 kilograms of undeclared pure-powder plutonium  in Japan has brought into a glaring light the true color of  Japan as a hypocrite trying to deliberately fool the world,  while producing and stockpiling a large quantity of plutonium,  says MINJU CHOSON today.    The analyst continues:    The Japanese reactionaries, captive to the desire to convert  Japan into a nuclear power, have promoted the introduction,  deployment and stockpile of nuclear weapons behind the spurious  curtain of "three non-nuclear principles." They are now stepping  up nuclear armament, raising a hue and cry over "the nuclear  suspicion" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and  its "nuclear issue."    It was the first time that undeclared plutonium was  discovered in Japan. But nobody can tell how much plutonium is  concealed in Japan.    The recently exposed concealment of plutonium makes us cast  doubt on the impartiality of the International Atomic Energy  Agency in its inspections.    The IAEA arbitrarily branded the fledgling peaceful nuclear  activities of such small countries as ours as "nuclear  development", while conniving at the dangerous nuclear  activities of Japan. This is obviously an undisguised  application of a double standard.    The Japanese reactionaries must stop the despicable nuclear  gamble, open to the public the quantity of the concealed  plutonium and behave themselves.    The United States and the IAEA would be well advised to pay  due attention to Japan's nuclear armament, adhering to the  principle of impartiality.</p>

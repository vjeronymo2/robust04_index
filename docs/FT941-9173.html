			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / People: New chief at Symonds Jim Symonds, a distant relative of the founder of Symonds Engineering, has been appointed group chief executive of the Cheshunt-based precision engineer with immediate effect. Symonds joined the board of the company only last February as a non-executive director, and became production director in June. Before joining Symonds he was the manufacturing director at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, where he worked for 26 years. The change at the top follows the appointment in July of Rod Ackrill as chairman, replacing Jim Ruggles who remained md. Now Ruggles is resigning from the board and as md after 39 years with the company, pending his early retirement on April 1. Ackrill says he is confident that Jim Symonds would be instrumental in developing the group into a broadly-based engineering company. In December, the company reported that its pre-tax losses halved from Pounds 256,000 to Pounds 126,000 in the six months ended September 30, because of improved margins and cost-cutting.</p>

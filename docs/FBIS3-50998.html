			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Julia Elena Alvear; from the "Telemetro Reports" </F> newscast]    [Text] Amid the political agitation the country is  experiencing, the first political attack was perpetrated against  the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] headquarters located in  Juan Diaz.    An explosive device went off during the predawn hours at the  PRD offices in Juan Diaz. As this video shows [video shows  policemen gathering evidence from explosion site, iron door  open, PRD office glass door], the device was apparently placed  outside the building, and the blast only reached the front light  of the building and smeared the walls and side wall with a gray  substance.    Specialized units of the Explosive Department of the  National  Police appeared at the explosion site. They gathered the first  evidence to determine what kind of explosives was used, although  it is presumed it may have been industrial-type explosives.    PRD members blamed progovernment parties for the attack and  termed the blast as a threat.    [Begin recording] [Ricardo Vega, member of the PRD Political  Commission] Evidently it seems that this is a clear expression  of threats affecting an electoral process, which we hope would  be clean. This is the first attack perpetrated against a PRD  office, and we believe this is the beginning of an escalation of  attacks that will occur amid the electoral atmosphere.    [Baltazar Aizpurua, PRD prosecutor] We know and are sure  this  is the result of the goverment's desperation over the victory  the PRD will obtain on 8 May. [end recording]    This is the first attack against a political party--less  than  four months away from the elections.    The Electoral Tribunal described the attack as  reprehensible.    [Begin Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado recording] We have  not confirmed the point yet; that is the fundamental point I  want to make. Second, I want to state strongly that it is  reprehensible, from every point of view, that Panamanians have  not learned yet to settle our differences civilly, like brothers  and members of a single national family. No matter from where  the attack comes, it is inconvenient and unfair to use our hands  to hit each other instead of using them to progress.</p>

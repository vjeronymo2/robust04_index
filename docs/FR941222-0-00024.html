			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The vendor analyzed the DSC and the HSM for rigid body response (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sliding and overturning) to seismic accelerations. The resultant peak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horizontal ground acceleration is 0.37g and the peak vertical acceleration is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.17g. The margin of safety against sliding is 1.35. Similarly, the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seismic force will not cause the HSM to tip over because the stabilizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moment of the HSM is greater than the seismic overturning moment. The margin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of safety against overturning is 1.26. Thus, no sliding or overturning of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HSM or DSC will occur from the design earthquake.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the pad is not considered a safety-related item, a specific pad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design is not being approved in this rulemaking for the Standardized NUHOMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters had questions pertaining to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of and procedures for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inquired whether just one module of the Standardized NUHOMS could be purchased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a utility, or whatever number of modules desired could be procured and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easily added like singular casks. One commenter expressed concern about snow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal procedures to prevent blockage of the bottom vents by drifting snow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter wanted NRC to establish a procedure and criteria for dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates discussed on pages A&hyph;15 and A&hyph;16 in the draft Certificate of Compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters noted that a procedure for opening a storage cask and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing the fuel has not been tried before nor documented in the rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They were also concerned that unloading of a cask would place workers at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC Certificate of Compliance does not permit or limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of NUHOMS modules that may be purchased by a general license. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC does not regulate the commercial arrangements between the cask vendor and the users including any provisions on the number of casks that can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased or added to the Standardized NUHOMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.3, the user of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS (general licensee) is required to conduct a visual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance of the exterior of air inlets and outlets. If the surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shows blockage of air vents, they must be cleaned in accordance with proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. These procedures will minimize the potential impact to the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and safety of workers. The daily temperature measurements indicate proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermal performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Certificate of Compliance requires each licensee to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to implement the dose criteria prescribed on pages A&hyph;15 and A&hyph;16.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On page A&hyph;15 of the Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.26, the dose rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria to be met is equal to or less than: (a) 200 mrem/hr. at the top  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shield plug surface at centerline with water in the cavity; and (b) 400  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mrem/hr. at the top cover plate surface at centerline without water in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cavity. On page A&hyph;16 of the Certificate of Compliance the dose rate criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is less than or equal to: (a) 400 mrem/hr. at 3 feet from the HSM surface;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) 100 mrem/hr. outside of the HSM door on center line of the DSC; and (c) 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mrem/hr. at the end shield wall exterior. Each licensee is required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop its own procedures to implement these criteria. In addition, each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee must develop operational procedures for the ISFSI for workers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiation exposure to be ALARA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Standardized NUHOMS, removal of spent fuel from the DSC is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in Chapter 5 of the SAR and in Chapter 11 of the SER. The process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is essentially the reverse of loading operations and would be performed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reactor license radiation protection program. The Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance requires each user to develop written procedures for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations and includes precautions to be considered for unloading. ALARA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be addressed by 10 CFR Part 20. Specification 1.1.6 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance requires that pre-operational testing and training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercises include the opening of a DSC and returning the DSC and transfer cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the spent fuel pool. The Certificate of Compliance also requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training program to include off-normal events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter, citing the May 1993 study prepared for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC by the Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses of San Antonio,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas, questioned the relatively higher temperature consequences of dry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage on fuel cladding. The report states that, ``the dry environment has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential of producing such problems as further fuel cladding oxidation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased cladding stresses, and creep deformation as a result of rod internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure *&blank;*&blank;*. These possible spent fuel and cladding alteration modes could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quite accelerated under dry storage conditions, since temperatures are much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher than in wet storage.'' The commenter does not believe that NRC is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfilling its obligation in 10 CFR 72.122(h) to see that ``spent fuel cladding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be protected during storage against degradation that leads to gross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rupture.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

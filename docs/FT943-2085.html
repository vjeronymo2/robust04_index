			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Technology: Not in my back yard - Non-whites are more likely to live near toxic waste Non-whites in the US are more likely than whites to be living in an area with a commercial hazardous waste facility, according to a recent US study. The disproportionate exposure to pollution of blacks and Hispanics was first acknowledged 10 years ago, but research shows that the problem of 'environmental racism' is worse today. Yet the waste management industry is a vocal part of the emerging consensus of businesspeople, environmental activists and government who agree that 'environmental racism' is a trend that must be reversed. But African-American researchers say the problem continues to grow in spite of the consensus and support for environmental justice in the Environmental Protection Agency. The study, Toxic Waste and Race Revisited, was sponsored by the Centre for Policy Alternatives, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) and the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice. It analysed 530 commercial 'off-site' hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facilities operating in the early 1990s and compared them with demographic profiles of postal code areas in the 1990 census report. It showed that last year non-whites were 47 per cent more likely than whites to live near a toxic waste site. In 1990 it was nearly 31 per cent; in 1980 it was 25 per cent. Ben Goldman, one of the authors of the report, acknowledges that the study does not explain the causes of the growing inequality, but says its findings are a 'disturbing setback that is all the more disturbing because of all the attention being paid to environmental racism'. The term was coined by Benjamin Chavis, former NAACP executive director, after an environmental demography report in 1987 showed evidence of a persistent link between toxic waste sites and ethnic communities. Last year, Irma Hunter Brown, a black representative in the Arkansas state legislature, who lives near a toxic waste facility, pushed through the Environmental Equity Act, which prohibits a new incinerator or toxic waste facility within 12 miles of an existing site unless approved by the affected community. In the Albuquerque area of New Mexico, the South West Organising Project, a non-profit environmental group, has been campaigning against the disproportionate impacts of groundwater contamination and industrial air pollution on the state's Hispanic communities. Business leaders in waste management, who might be expected to dismiss environmental racism as part of the same economic system which fails to distribute wealth evenly, echo the environmentalists. Charles McDermott, government affairs director for WMX Technologies, the global environmental services company, says: 'Our society has not done enough to ensure environmental equity.' However, he disagrees with Goldman's methodology and says the Toxic Waste and Race Revisited survey renders 'skewed results'. McDermott argues that using large and irregular postal code areas as measures of community give an inaccurate picture of the whole. To provide a meaningful study, he suggests using census data that give smaller boundaries of 4,000 people as a community. Research using this method at the University of Massachusetts claims treatment, storage and disposal facilities are more likely to be located in predominantly white, industrial, working-class neighbourhoods. Although McDermott endorses the University of Massachussetts research, he agrees that 'environmental justice is a very real and serious problem'. He points to the EPA's 1992 study on lead poisoning which found that in low-income families, 68 per cent of African-American children suffer lead poisoning, double the percentage of white children affected. Another piece of EPA research, he says, has shown that in comparison to the white population, a higher proportion of African-Americans and Hispanics live in areas where air pollutants exceed federal limits for carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and lead. But McDermott cautions delicacy in dealing with the 'complex problem'. In particular, he believes that dealing with the problem locality by locality is the best way to protect America's communities. Rather than blanket regulation industry by industry, he wants state licensing for waste facilities to include requirements to assess the cumulative effects of sites emitting pollutants over a single area. The suggestion is shared by several prominent people on Capitol Hill. The Environmental Justice Bill, which has yet to come to committee in Congress, includes provisions to make permits for waste facilities issued by the federal Environmental Protection Agency contingent on tests for cumulative damage in the area. The Clinton administration, which counts itself a member of the environmental justice movement, pre-empted the legislation by issuing an executive order last February to address environmental justice in minority and low-income populations. The EPA's environmental justice office has invested in education for non-white communities to 'help them make better choices', but it shies away from suggestions of siting regulation. Bob Knox, deputy director of the Office of Environmental Justice at the EPA, says the road to environmental equity, on which they have been travelling only two years, is a long one. Discrimination and pollution were endemic for many generations. 'Remember that the voting rights act was only 1965 and a lot of sites were placed before that,' he says. There is also debate over which is more important in contributing to the problem: whether blacks are moving into low-cost housing areas where there is already a build-up of polluting industries, or whether industry is locating polluting factories in areas where there is a relatively high proportion of non-whites.</p>

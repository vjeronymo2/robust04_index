			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises on unexpected good news Wall Street US SHARE prices rose across the board on some unexpected good news on the economy, as investors calmly awaited today's presidential election, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 35.93 at 3,262.21, its high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 4.07 at 422.75, while the American SE composite firmed 0.98 to 382.70 and the Nasdaq composite bounced back from early losses to end a net 2.40 ahead at 607.57. Turnover on the New York SE was heavy at 203m shares, while advances led declines by 1,091 to 734. Prices opened slightly weaker in thin trading, but rose strongly after the National Association of Purchasing Management announced that its index of manufacturing activity had risen from a September level of 49.0 per cent to 50.6 per cent last month, and the Commerce Department reported a 1.3 per cent rise in September construction spending. Both increases were larger than analysts had expected, and provided some investors with an excuse to purchase stocks. Price gains were further boosted by a round of program buying in mid-morning, and by a further burst of demand in the last two hours of trading. Otherwise, the political situation remained the dominant influence on the market. The latest polls have shown a slight widening in Mr Bill Clinton's lead over President George Bush, but because the market has fully discounted a Democratic victory the changes had no effect on prices. Many analysts pointed out that the stock market has rallied on the day before 14 out of the last 16 presidential elections. General Motors rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 after Mr Jack Smith was appointed chief executive of the car manufacturer at a special board meeting in New York. Citicorp edged Dollars  1/8 higher to Dollars 16 3/4 , possibly drawing comfort from reports that the Federal National Mortgage Association had agreed to buy Dollars 1bn of the bank's mortgages on a non-recourse basis, an indication that credit quality at Citicorp's troubled mortgage unit may be improving. The Gap fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 5/8 in busy trading on reports that analysts at Goldman Sachs had lowered their earnings estimates for the clothing retailer. US Surgical dropped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 after Oppenheimer, the broking house, had removed the stock from its recommended list and downgraded it from 'buy' to 'market performer'. On the Nasdaq market, after opening weaker on profit-taking some leading stocks rallied strongly, including Microsoft, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 89 5/8 , and Intel, Dollars  1/4 firmer at Dollars 67 3/4 . Apple, off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 52 1/4 , and Sun Microsystems, down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 33 7/8 , remained under selling pressure all day. Canada TORONTO stocks were sharply higher after moderately active trading. The TSE 300 index finished 42.9 ahead at 3,379.0, while rises outnumbered declines by 319 to 225. Volume came to 29.2m shares. Nova Corporation, up CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 9, reported third-quarter net of 11 cents a share, against a net from continuing operations of 1 cent a year earlier.</p>

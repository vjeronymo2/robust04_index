			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Regional Desk: "Battle lines drawn in </F> Marrakech"]    [Text] Asean states are gearing up for an 11th hour  showdown with the United States and Europe over Western efforts  to introduce a "social clause" into the Gatt trading pact which  will be signed in the southern Moroccan city of Marrakech next  Friday.    Alarm over the clause, which would link trade and labour  standards, reflects deep suspicions by nearly all developing  countries that the West is seeking to levy additional duties on  the exports of countries which enjoy cheap labour advantages  when the new World Trading Organization (WTO) takes over from  Gatt to police global commerce.    Many Asean officials fear that such a link would turn out to  be a disguised form of protection against imports from economies  with lower labour costs. Asia-Pacific nations, whose economic  growth has been powered by their low-cost exports, are  particularly concerned and have vowed to fight the link.    At last week's 50th annual session of the Economic and  Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap), executive secretary  general Rafiuddin Ahmad led a chorus of denunciations about  attempts by "countries which might impose neo-protectionism."    In a national speech on March 21, Indonesia's President  Suharto criticized unspecified world powers which sought to  impose their own views of human and labour rights as a condition  for economic cooperation.    He said that industrial nations were pushing developing  countries on such issues as raising the minimum wage because of  their troubled economies and declining competitiveness.    "No country has the right to dictate their own concepts or  views to another country... Let alone to force their will as a  condition for international economic cooperation," he said.    Speaking at last week's Pacific Economic Cooperation Council  (PECC) conference, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai  Phanitchaphak acknowledged that the US efforts to include a  social clause in a global trade treaty were not new and go back  to 1987. But he cautioned that "The proposal could lead to  market impediments for goods from less-developed countries."    At the same forum Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed  charged that the West was trying to weaken developing nations by  imposing minimum wages.    Manila also declared it would resist attempts by the United  States to insert a social clause in any trade agreement,  particularly on issues affecting workers' rights.    Antonio Buencamino, director of the Philippine Bureau of  International Trade Relations, said "the Philippines opposes any  attempt to include social clauses or workers rights in trade  talks."    "Our labour is cheap, but that does not mean it is  exploited," Buencamino said, noting that workers in the export  industry often earned much more than the mandated minimum wage.    Despite the uproar in Asia, chief US trade negotiator John  Schmidt, declared before leaving for Morocco that Washington  would not accept the Marrakech declaration or documents related  to the WTO preparatory committee "without some language" on  labour rights.    In a bid to quell the row before it erupts into a damaging  North-South split, Gatt chief Peter Sutherland called a meeting  of trade envoys yesterday to seek a compromise.    Observers said much would depend on how hard the United  States presses the issue.    The United States wants a ministerial declaration in  Marrakech to accept that the WTO would deal with the link  between trade and labour. Developing countries have refused to  consider any reference to the issue in the declaration.    Washington, is expected to get its strongest backing from  France which has been pressing the European Union to enact  regulations against "social dumping" -- selling goods produced  with cheap labour under poor working conditions.    US and French officials argue that the WTO, which will be a  more powerful watchdog than Gatt, should enforce a connection  between trade and labour conditions.    France wants the body to apply standards that will prevent  countries from exploiting children, prisoners and bonded workers  as a way of gaining trade advantages.    Gatt officials are further worried that the introduction of  the controversial social dimension would divert attention from  work that needs to be done to ensure that measures to liberalize  world trade contained in the Uruguay accords are sealed and  actually applied.    Washington, however, argues that it accepts the existence of  a "natural comparative advantage", including wage rate  differentials, linked to a country's degree of development.    The United States submitted at the beginning of the Uruguay  Round in 1987 a paper listing a set of five internationally  recognized standards it saw as trade-related.    The five points were freedom of association for workers,  freedom to organize and bargain collectively, freedom from  forced or compulsory labour, a minimum age for employment of  children, and "minimum standard" for working conditions,  including occupational health and safety hazards.    Many members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and  Development (OECD), including Switzerland and the Nordic  countries, concede that these problems will, sooner or later,  have to be faced.    But most feel it would be more timely to raise such issues  when the WTO preparatory committee gets down to work. Any  member would then be free to take up any topic.    Officials said the European Union was proposing a wording  stressing that the committee was free to tackle "new issues",  without any specific reference to labour rights.    More than 120 countries are to gather in Marrakech for the  signing of the new pact, which will encompass for the first time  services, intellectual property, agriculture and textiles.    The scale of the agreement, which once fully operative, will  bring an estimated additional worldwide growth of between $230  billion and $270 billion over a decade, helped build a momentum  that brought together Gatt members after seven years of marathon  negotiations.    This same pressure makes most observers confident an  agreement will be signed. Gatt officials, quoted in Marrakech,  said that while they were worried that the row triggered by the  United States might "spoil the atmosphere" of the meeting, they  were confident it would not sink the Uruguay Round.</p>

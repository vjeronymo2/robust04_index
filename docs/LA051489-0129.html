			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BILLION-DOLLAR SUMMER;  </P> <P> MOVIE STUDIOS PLOT THEIR STRATEGIES IN BOX-OFFICE WARS, DREAMING OF MEGA-HITS  IN A SUMMER OF SEQUELS  </P> <P> Meet James Bond -- and enjoy a fabulous weekend getaway for two to Key West,  Fla. All you have to do is win the "License to Thrill Weekend" sweepstakes --  part of MGM/UA's promotion for its upcoming James Bond picture, "License to  Kill."  </P> <P> It's one of countless ploys to lure moviegoers into theaters this summer. In  coming weeks -- and months -- studios will spend tens of millions of dollars in  a marketing, promotion and publicity battle to sell some three dozen pictures  scheduled to open in the 15 weeks between the Memorial Day and Labor Day  weekends.  </P> <P> To some, that kind of money spent on promotion must seem shockingly wasteful.  But with the collective budgets of this summer's movies topping $500 million,  studio marketers are attempting to cover a huge investment.  </P> <P> But won't so many titles, however glitzily promoted, flood the market?  </P> <P> Art Murphy, longtime industry analyst for Daily Variety, maintains that a burst  of exciting movies expands the marketplace. Studio marketing and publicity  executives echo that sentiment. But they also talk nervously of "the  competition," and of "strategies." Some even take shots at the competition.  </P> <P> "It is a kind of war," acknowledged one publicity chief, while declining to  reveal strategic details about the promotion plans for her own films.  </P> <P> The studios with the biggest summer entries at first refused to discuss their  upcoming campaigns, partly, they said, because they didn't want to appear  self-promoting. But as details were leaked to a reporter, they ultimately all  cooperated -- to varying degrees -- openly worried that the competition might  get more coverage.  </P> <P> The cries for attention will clearly be loud, plentiful and even, at times,  clever. Among the stunts you'll be seeing:  </P> <P> * Kids: Stay tuned to Nickelodeon for details on how you can win a trip for you  and your family to Tasmania. The picturesque island (south of Victoria,  Australia) happens to be one of the settings for Warner Bros.' new film, "Young  Einstein."  </P> <P> * Want to know more about "Great Balls of Fire"? It's inevitable. Orion  Pictures publicity staffers are making plans to take 300 VIPs, including lots  of movie and music journalists, on a publicity junket to Memphis. That's the  home of Jerry Lee Lewis, subject of the film, who'll be on hand to talk, along  with cast and crew.  </P> <P> * Columbia Pictures is also planning a big junket for "Ghostbusters II," to be  held in New York City. And a glitzy benefit premiere party at the Hollywood  Palladium. Decor will include props from the movie, such as the Ectomobile, the  ghostbusters' equivalent of the Batmobile.  </P> <P> * Speaking of which: An ominous batsymbol has been materializing on outdoor  billboards in 10 major cities. One looms over a theater in Westwood. Countless  others have landed on bus stop billboards across the city. In Manhattan, a  gigantic batsign watches over Times Square.  </P> <P> Industry analysts and marketing executives are predicting that this year's  summer box office, which traditionally represents 38% to 40% of the annual  income generated by movies, could be worth as much as $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> Some believe it could go higher.  </P> <P> Veteran film marketer Gordon Weaver of the independent entertainment marketing  firm the Gordon Weaver Co. summed up the possibilities: "There's a point beyond  which no one can project. Anticipation is so high, the question this summer  seems to be, how high is high?"  </P> <P> The high hopes are directly related to the coming attractions, which include  big stars, big budgets and a slew of sequels to monster hits.  </P> <P> Kicking off the summer: Paramount Pictures' "Indiana Jones and the Last  Crusade." Opening May 24 in more than 2,000 theaters, it has already been  singled out by industry analysts as one of three big potential blockbusters.  </P> <P> Consider: The last "Indy" installment was largely critically assailed, but  still sold $175 million in tickets and set an opening weekend record of $33.9  million over four days. (In an interview in the June issue of Premiere  magazine, director Steven Spielberg says one of the reasons he made "III" was  "to apologize for the second one.")  </P> <P> Mega-business is also expected for "Batman" and "Ghostbusters II," the sequel  to the most successful comedy of all time. (The 1984 title grossed $220  million.)  </P> <P> "Batman" may be a non-sequel, but it has a built-in recognition factor -- a  50-year legacy as a comic book hero that is currently being merchandised to the  hilt. (See accompanying stories on summer merchandising on Page 29 and history  of "Batman" on Page 30.) With 10 sequels due in what has been dubbed "sequel  summer," titles with audience recognition will have an instant edge over the  competition.  </P> <P> According to Phil Garfinkle, executive vice president of Entertainment Data  Inc., which tracks box-office performance on a daily basis, the summer's big  sequels could account for $600 million to $800 million of the summer ticket  sales. (This figure does not encompass "Batman.")  </P> <P> To the great relief of many marketers -- especially those who are not in the  sequel sweepstakes -- the titles will arrive in waves, not all at once.  </P> <P> The first inundation includes "Indy," the Clint Eastwood picture "Pink  Cadillac" and "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier." Plus "Road House," which  sneaks into summer on Friday.  </P> <P> The second assault begins in mid-June, with the release of "Ghostbusters II"  and "Batman." Then comes "The Karate Kid III" and "Great Balls of Fire."  </P> <P> The third wave begins in early July and includes "Lethal Weapon 2," "License to  Kill" (No. 16 in James Bond's never-ending adventures) and "The Abyss," the  James Cameron-directed underwater thriller.  </P> <P> A final skirmish is due in August with titles including "A Nightmare on Elm  Street V: The Dream Child" (scary thought: the last Freddy Krueger entry  grossed $50 million), "Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan," "The  Return of the Musketeers" and "Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives." A  theatrical flop, the original "Eddie," was resurrected by cable and  videocassette.  </P> <P> Interspersed with all of the aforementioned will be comedies, and even  occasional "serious" titles which will grow in number in the second half of the  summer.  </P> <P> "It's as if the carnival has come to town. I believe it's going to send people  from one theater to another," said Charles O. Glen, executive vice president of  marketing for Orion Pictures.  </P> <P> Devised many months ago, at the top echelons of the studios, the campaigns now  in motion are the result of intricate studies aimed at targeting specific  markets.  </P> <P> The studies not only help shape how a film will be released, but also when it  should be released, and in how many theaters.  </P> <P> "Ghostbusters II" and "Batman" will each open in more than 2,000 theaters. But  the less-known "The Abyss," which lacks star names, will open slowly --  beginning with only two cities.  </P> <P> Some of the results of the campaigns are currently on display in theater  lobbies -- where large promotional stand-ups, called standees, vie for space.  </P> <P> The one for "Great Balls of Fire" has Dennis Quaid playing a piano that has  burst into light-up flames. The "Ghostbusters II" standee includes light-up  phaser guns and appearances by the cute trademark ghost.  </P> <P> Soon-to-arrive: a "Batman" "glider," which will hang from the ceiling.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, "teaser" trailers -- some of which debuted at Christmas -- are being  replaced by official trailers with film scenes.  </P> <P> The one for "Indy" began running a few weeks ago, auspiciously attached to  Paramount's surprise spring hit, "Pet Sematary." "Batman" trailers are due  Memorial Day weekend. At the same time, between 5,000-6,000 trailers will  surface for "The Abyss."  </P> <P> As for product tie-ins: There's an "Indiana Jones"-Pepsi Cola sweepstakes and  "Roadhouse" contests involving La Batt's Beer and a men's apparel line.  </P> <P> To tap into the family audience, Disney's "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" will have  a McDonald's promotion. The studio's reissue of "Peter Pan" will have tie-ins  with Peter Pan Peanut Butter and Wonder Bread.  </P> <P> There'll be "Ghostbusters II"/Coca-Cola promos. (Columbia is 49% owned by  Coke.) And the film will have tie-ins with the Hardee's fast-food chain, Fuji  Film and Ralston Purina.  </P> <P> "You don't want to over-commercialize," stressed Buffy Shutt, president of  marketing for Columbia. "The idea isn't to meet someone who says, 'Well, I  bought the cookware, but I don't want to see the movie.' "  </P> <P> "The key is to make your movie accessible," declared Barry London, president of  distribution and marketing for Paramount's motion picture group.  </P> <P> For instance:  </P> <P> * Orion is touting "Great Balls of Fire" for its rock 'n' roll heritage.  (Enthused Glen: "Rock 'n' roll was Jerry Lee Lewis, and Dennis Quaid is Jerry  Lee." ) Indeed, Sam Phillips, who founded the legendary Sun Records, Lewis'  early label, is involved in the film's publicity.  </P> <P> * MGM/UA is stressing that this year younger audiences can relate to "a more  realistic" James Bond. "It's ('License to Kill') not as far-fetched," said  Barry Lorie, senior vice president of marketing. "This time, the bad guy is a  drug dealer."  </P> <P> * Warners chose to lasso the country market for its Eastwood film, "Pink  Cadillac," by wining and dining some 100 country music disc jockeys earlier  this week at Harrah's in Reno, Nev.  </P> <P> According to Joe Hyams, senior vice president for special projects, the plan --  which included a screening and a chance to talk with Eastwood, co-star  Bernadette Peters and some of the sound-track artists -- was similar to one  that proved a success for Eastwood's 1978 film, "Every Which Way but Loose."  </P> <P> * For "Karate Kid III," Columbia is taking stars Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita  on a tour of some 20 key cities. (This film series may promote a benign  philosophy, but it's proven a box-office killer -- with combined grosses of  $214 million. "II" also has the distinction of having outgrossed the original  "Karate Kid.")  </P> <P> * Paramount Pictures regularly stays in touch with Trekkies -- the better to  promote its "Star Trek" series. Three weeks ago at a Trekkie gathering in  Denver, none other than executive producer Harve Bennett showed up to talk  "Star Trek V."  </P> <P> For audience awareness, it would seem hard to top "Ghostbusters II" and  "Batman." In fact, a showdown is looming, since the films open just one week  apart. ("Ghostbusters II" has a one-week jump on "Batman.")  </P> <P> Both films are currently grappling for major national magazine covers. Both  films will have music and video tie-ins. Both even have hot cars! (To that, a  Warners rep quipped, "Yeah, and we'll race them any day.")  </P> <P> Briefly, here's how the promo bout looks:  </P> <P> In the "Ghostbusters II" corner:  </P> <P> It will be hot pop/R&amp;B star Bobby Brown doing songs for the "Ghostbusters  II" sound track (on MCA Records), along with Run-D.M.C., who will do a rap  cover version of Ray Parker Jr's. infamous "Ghostbusters" theme, "Who You Gonna  Call?"  </P> <P> There will be MTV "Ghostbusters II" promos -- including a giveaway in which  someone will win the Ectomobile. (The winner has to make it driver safe.)  </P> <P> Plus the junket -- which will be attended by the entire Ghostbusters gang.  </P> <P> And "lots of TV things that we'd like to keep quiet about, for now," said an  informed spokeswoman, who added, "You really do want to watch your competition,  and not tell them too much."  </P> <P> (If Columbia appears to be exhaustively promoting "Ghostbusters II," it's  because the studio has seemed to be asleep this past year. Its top-grossing  title of 1988, "Punchline," earned a measly $21 million at the box office.  "Ghostbusters II" along with "Karate Kid III" could revive one of Hollywood's  legendary studios.)  </P> <P> As for the "Batman" corner:  </P> <P> It will be Prince doing songs for "Batman," on the Warner Records sound track.  Also from the Purple One: "Batdance," an original song with dialogue from the  film that is his "ode to the movie" (but not included in it).  </P> <P> MTV will do a "Batman" promo throughout the month of June -- complete with  contests in which someone will win, yes!, a replica of the Batmobile. (It does  not have a drive train.)  </P> <P> An air date also will be announced for a "Making of Batman" documentary -- "a  hotly contested item," claimed Rob Friedman, president of worldwide advertising  and publicity.  </P> <P> There will also be a big publicity junket; Jack Nicholson -- a.k.a. The Joker  -- will be the only principal who won't participate. (He's at work on "Two  Jakes.")  </P> <P> And a gala Westwood premiere -- with the Batmobile on view.  </P> <P> During interviews for this story, several executives at competing studios  expressed concern about Warners' "Lethal Weapon 2."  </P> <P> And Warners' Friedman did some gloating.  </P> <P> The reason: "Lethal Weapon 2" scored amazingly high in early testing. It is  also generating "buzz" throughout the industry for being better than the  original -- "more accessible."  </P> <P> Said one executive (who did not want to be named, "because I'm not about to let  my name be used to promote another studio's film"): "The first film was such a  huge cassette picture. That's a tough thing to fight."  </P> <P> According to Alexander &amp; Associates, a weekly tracking service, from  October 1987 to the present there have been more than 26 million rental  transactions involving "Lethal Weapon." And that is just a U.S. figure; it does  not include Canada. Moreover, that figure reflects households. Additionally,  there have been about 250,000 units sold.  </P> <P> All of which could mean a secret weapon in the summer line-up.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> Easily the major curiosity of the season, Fox's "The Abyss" was filmed under  super-secrecy at the never-completed Cherokee Nuclear Power Station outside  Gaffney, S. C. An estimated 40% of the live-action principal photography takes  place underwater.  </P> <P> James Cameron is the writer-director; Gale Anne Hurd is the producer. They're  the critically admired duo responsible for "The Terminator" and "Aliens."  </P> <P> Heading the ensemble cast: Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael  Biehn, in a story about a team of divers whose work on a manned underwater  oil-drilling habitat leads them to an alien presence.  </P> <P> But two previous underwater films -- "Deep Star Six" and "Leviathan" --  recently flopped.  </P> <P> Do moviegoers really care about what lies fathoms below?  </P> <P> "I could only draw one analogy to that -- and that's 'Big,' " said Tom Sherak,  president of domestic distribution and marketing at 20th Century-Fox.  </P> <P> (A runaway hit for Fox, "Big" was the fourth in a series of "body-switch"  films, following "Like Father, Like Son," "Vice Versa" and "Eighteen Again.")  </P> <P> Added Sherak: "Look, it's going to be hard this summer for any picture that's  not a sequel, and that doesn't have big stars.  </P> <P> "So we're not going to overdo it. We're going to open the film slowly,  beginning with L.A. and New York."  </P> <P> He didn't want to talk marketing tactics: "But we just may decide to call our  movie, 'The Abyss II.' "  </P> <P> Walt Disney Pictures will release "Dead Poet's Society," a drama starring Robin  Williams as an inspirational teacher, opposite "Star Trek V."  </P> <P> "We are clearly counterprogramming," said Bob Levin, director of worldwide  marketing.  </P> <P> Disney is counting on Williams' popularity, and his Oscar-nominated performance  in "Good Morning, Vietnam," to be a come-on.  </P> <P> With a nod to "Bull Durham," the adult-themed film from Orion, which grossed  $50 million last summer, Levin added: "I think there's been ample proof that  some moviegoers want something fresh. There's no question that what we've got  is going to be different from the norm."  </P> <P> The most serious title on the summer slate? Undoubtedly Columbia's "Casualties  of War." A Vietnam drama directed by Brian De Palma, it stars Michael J. Fox  and Sean Penn.  </P> <P> So how will Columbia sell it?  </P> <P> For starters, said a studio source, "We aren't going to pull any punches. Our  campaign is going to reflect the film." A trailer is now being made: "It will  convince you that Michael J. Fox can have extraordinary credibility as a  serious actor.  </P> <P> "The next step will be getting audiences to want to 'see serious.' "  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> Marketing may get moviegoers out to opening weekends. But at that point, the  movie itself becomes the marketing tool.  </P> <P> For better or for worse.  </P> <P> As Art Murphy put it: "Once you get your big crowd, it's up to them.  </P> <P> "If they like what they see, you'll have an army our there working for you. If  the movie disappoints, you've got an army of guerrilla terrorists working  against you."  </P></p>

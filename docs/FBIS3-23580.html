			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA commentator Senior Lieutenant </F> Serhiy Zhurets: "`They've STARTed'--But It's Still a Long Way to  the Non-Nuclear Finish Line"]    [Text] There is certainly no other topic to which  politicians, diplomats and especially the mass media, both at  home and outside the borders of our country, have devoted as  much attention. It is a worthwhile topic: A closed session of  the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine voted 254 in favor and nine  against to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known  among specialists as SNO-1 and christened by journalists as  START. Ukraine, in accordance with this START, will cut back 36  percent of the overall number of missiles and 42 percent of the  nuclear warheads. So the Ukrainian parliament has taken the  first step toward common sense, contrary to which these terrible  weapons were built, placed and serviced on our Ukrainian soil  for many long decades.    A press conference was also devoted to the ratification of  START-1 by the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, with the participation  of Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Vasyl Durdynets,  Supreme Soviet Commission on Questions of Defense and State  Security Chairman Valentyn Lemish, Vice Prime-Minister Valeriy  Shmarov, Minister of Defense of Ukraine Colonel-General Vitaliy  Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko.    Deputy Vasyl Durdynets indicated that the decision made to  ratify START was preceded by an almost year-long review and  diligent collective analysis of possible military-political,  economic, ecological and social consequences of the fulfillment  of this treaty by our state, a treaty that took shape at one  time without the participation of Ukraine. And they approached  this important decision both with the noble intention of our  country to be a non-nuclear state in the future, and with the  idea of the inviolability of our borders and a regard for other  national interests. The deputies addressed their principal  attention in the course of discussion toward such serious  factors as the role of nuclear weapons as a factor of restraint,  the economic capabilities of our state to meet to the full the  obligations that arise from the treaty, and the capabilities for  ensuring ecological and nuclear security during the cutback and  elimination of nuclear weapons.    I would especially like to emphasize, said Vasyl Vasylovych,  that in the context of the decision made the attitude of the  Supreme Soviet and the leadership of Ukraine toward the future  non-nuclear status of our state has not changed. We have hoped  and tried in our activity to convince the international  community, and first of all the nuclear and other influential  states of the world, of the necessity of reciprocal steps on  their part with regard to granting Ukraine solid guarantees of  security, the receipt of adequate financial assistance for the  reduction of these weapons and compensation for the nuclear  warheads, including tactical ones.    Times are such today, however, that it does not pay to be an  optimist. Kiev cherishes the hope that it is now the turn of  Moscow and Washington to display trust. But as they say, trust  in God, but... You know the rest.    So it is understandable why the decree of the Supreme Soviet  of Ukraine ratifying START has thirteen stipulations, only after  the fulfillment of which the treaty, or more precisely the whole  great series of political, economic and military-technical  components of this document, will begin to be realized. Here are  just a few of them.    "Ukraine as a state possessing nuclear weapons is moving  toward non-nuclear status, and will gradually get rid of the  nuclear weapons deployed on its territory, provided it retains  sound guarantees of its national security, in which the nuclear  states assume the obligation never to employ conventional armed  forces against it and will not resort to the threat of force,  will respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of the  borders of Ukraine, and will refrain from economic pressure with  the aim of resolving any disputed issues."    The current crisis state of the economy of Ukraine is taken  into account among the other stipulations--the granting of  sufficient international financial and technical assistance.    The leadership of Ukraine, by the way, has emphasized all of  this repeatedly. But words remain words, and promises promises.  And it is becoming more and more understandable that we will  have to guarantee our own security and inviolability, first and  foremost with our own resources. Even the signing of the  framework agreement between Kiev and Washington, in accordance  with which Ukraine could receive 175 million dollars (moreover  not monetary, but rather in the form of specific programs and  hardware purchased not at our prices, but at significantly  higher world prices) does not fundamentally resolve the problem  of finances. The 2.8 billion we need sometimes elicits only  pessimistic smiles in the West. The attempts to conduct  negotiations with Russia on receiving compensation for the  tactical arms removed from Ukraine, about 5-6 billion dollars,  are already reaching a dead end.    So who can we count on? The West? Russia?    Certainly, on ourselves first of all. The more so as  Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov, answering a question on who should  give us financial assistance, answered quite concretely, "No one  should. None of us has the idea that someone will be coming to  us with money, and we will start spending it. Although we do  need assistance. And I hope that after the ratification of the  treaty there will be a suitable attitude toward Ukraine as well."    Frankly speaking, by the way, may we be mistaken in counting  on a suitable attitude toward Ukraine, as Valeriy Shmarov says,  or in the words of Vasyl Durdynets, on reciprocal steps on the  part of the nuclear powers? On the very same day that the  Supreme Soviet ratified START, after all, the WASHINGTON POST  wrote that the Ukrainian parliamentarians had put forth so many  stipulations that the voting was more a political gambit than a  final decision. That reaction is understandable; the conclusions  and the results of the discussion by the Ukrainian  parliamentarians affirmed in the document on the further fate of  nuclear arms is not quite what they were counting on outside the  borders of Ukraine. Thirty-six percent of the warheads, after  all, is not 100 percent, as they wanted very much in Washington.  And the seven years over which the cutbacks will take place are  not the 24 months that the Russian delegation was seeking at the  negotiations at Masandra.    It clearly suits neither Russia nor the West that our  parliamentarians made the stipulation that Ukraine does not  consider Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, ratified along with  START and signed in the name of Ukraine on 31 June 1991, binding  on it. That article states that "Ukraine is obligated to become  a non-nuclear state as soon as possible, and to join the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty in that quality."    You will ask, is it really and truly just a matter of  Ukrainian nuclear ambitions, as Kiev has already been hearing  for a whole year, and not only from the Russian minister of  foreign affairs?    No, it is not a case of ambitions.    First of all, Ukraine could not make a claim to the  components of the nuclear arms as their property in the case of  joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. All scientific and  industrial activity in Ukraine that is associated with the atom  would moreover become illegal today. And what then would happen  to our power engineering, which today relies almost a third on  AESs [nuclear electric-power plants]?    Second, the recent partners in the negotiations on nuclear  arms are forgetting something that is already known and has been  repeated more than once: "We can," feels Supreme Soviet Deputy  Chairman Vasyl Durdynets, "provide for cutbacks and reductions  only of that quantity of nuclear weapons that corresponds to our  financial and economic capabilities."    So it is still too early to put the period to the history of  nuclear arms in Ukraine. And time will tell how it will be in  the future. But one thing is clear now--after the ratification  of START, there are no fewer problems in Ukraine. A difficult  path to non-nuclear status and heavy and crucial work lie ahead.  Both for the politicians and for the military. Neither domestic  nor foreign journalists at the press conference, by the way,  were interested in the fate of the servicemen of the 43rd Army.  Until the diplomats agree, responsibility for security connected  with the strategic arms--from ecological to military--rests with  the people in uniform.</p>

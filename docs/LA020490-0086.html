			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Thanks a lot, NBC, for moving "Dear John" from Thursday to Wednesday nights  opposite "Anything But Love."  </P> <P> It was perfectly placed on Thursday nights just before "L.A. Law," and now  you've put it on at a time where it will get lost. I just don't understand the  networks or why they do what they do. Can't they just leave things alone and  let us enjoy what we have come home to watch at the end of a busy day?  </P> <P> Toni Jacobson, Los Angeles  </P></p>

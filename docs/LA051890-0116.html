			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL IN L.A. IS NO DEFECTOR, CHINA SAYS  </P> <P> Reports that China's former top representative in Hong Kong is seeking  political asylum in the United States were discounted Thursday by the Chinese  government, which depicted Xu Jiatun's sojourn as simply a vacation.  </P> <P> China's declaration concerning Xu, who is believed to be in the Los Angeles  area, contrasted sharply with press accounts that he is eager to defect because  of continuing pressure over his sympathy toward the pro-democracy movement that  was crushed in the bloody military crackdown on student protesters at Tian An  Men Square last June.  </P> <P> Xu, as bureau chief of the Beijing-controlled New China News Agency in Hong  Kong, had been China's de facto ambassador to the British colony from 1983 to  last January. If reports of his defection prove true, he would be one of the  most senior Communist Party members to defect since the party's rise to power  in 1949.  </P> <P> Xu was believed to be staying with a Hong Kong businessman in the Los Angeles  area.  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Richard Boucher on Wednesday would neither confirm  nor deny knowledge of Xu's intentions, in conformance with a long-standing  policy of secrecy concerning the asylum process. Boucher confirmed that Xu had  been issued a tourist visa and "our understanding is that he is now visiting  the United States."  </P> <P> One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "I don't really  think he wants to be tracked down. I don't think he wants to talk to the press.  I think he wants to be quiet."  </P> <P> China's official statements Thursday represented its first reaction regarding  Xu since speculation about his intentions began circulating earlier this week.  "Xu Jiatun is in the United States for travel and a rest," a Foreign Ministry  spokeswoman told reporters. She declined further comment.  </P> <P> However, a Japanese newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, on Wednesday quoted Xu, 74,  as saying that he left China because of continuing pressure from Communist  Party officials over his opposition to the use of force against student  demonstrators last June than left about 800 people dead.  </P> <P> Xu was also quoted as objecting to government interference with his authority  over two Communist Party-controlled newspapers in Hong Kong, Wen Wei Pao and Ta  Kung Pao. After Xu left for the United States, several of his colleagues in the  Hong Kong news bureau were recalled to Beijing.  </P> <P> Xu, known for his fondness for Western lifestyle and customs, applied for and  received a tourist visa to the United State in Hong Kong rather than Beijing --  an action considered highly unusual for a member of the Communist Party. Some  reports suggested that several family members, as few as three and as many as  10, are traveling with him.  </P> <P> The Japanese newspaper quoted Xu as saying that Premier Li Peng's government  was preparing a political reprimand against him for his praise of capitalism  and his close ties to former party chief Zhao Ziyang. Zhao was dismissed from  his post last June and accused of several transgressions, including support for  student protesters.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jim Mann in Washington contributed to this report.  </P></p>

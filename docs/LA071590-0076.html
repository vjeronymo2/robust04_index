			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PEANUT OIL BREAST IMPLANTS COULD MAKE SURGERY SAFER  </P> <P> A breast implant filled with peanut oil could mean safer breast enlargements  for thousands of women who have the surgery each year, a radiologist says.  </P> <P> Because the oil is transparent, the new implants do not interfere with X-ray  mammography for breast cancer the way silicone breast implants can, said Judy  Destouet, head of the mammography unit at Washington University's Mallinckrodt  Institute of Radiology.  </P> <P> "They appear like the fat in the breast -- you can see through it," Destouet  said.  </P> <P> Destouet and Leroy Young, associate professor of plastic and reconstructive  surgery at Washington University School of Medicine, are heading the  development of the new implant.  </P> <P> The most common implant now is filled with silicone gel, which appears as dense  as bone in X-rays and therefore can hamper early detection of breast cancer,  Destouet said. Others are filled with saline, or a combination of silicone and  saline.  </P> <P> "I think many women need (breast augmentation) for self-esteem, and I think  that we should have the freedom to do what we want for our bodies," Destouet  said.  </P> <P> "We hoped to develop a better product that would allow women to augment their  breasts but won't take away the benefits of state-of-the-art mammography. We  feel that we have something that really can be a safe alternative."  </P> <P> Breast augmentation is one of the most popular cosmetic surgery procedures  available, according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive  Surgeons Inc. in Arlington Heights, Ill. About 72,000 women undergo breast  augmentation each year, said spokeswoman Cathleen Coyne.  </P> <P> But some doctors disagree that implants interfere with early cancer detection.  </P> <P> Studies by Dr. Garry Brody at the University of Southern California followed  3,000 women in the Los Angeles area who have had breast augmentation.  </P> <P> "Thus far, the delay is theoretic only. It's certainly a possibility, but when  we look at the statistics, we can't find the delay. Their cancer seems to be  picked up at the same stage as the unaugmented population."  </P> <P> The American Cancer Society estimates that one woman in 10 will develop breast  cancer in her lifetime.  </P> <P> Carolyn Cline, a plastic surgeon and psychologist in San Francisco, said she  discourages women with a family history of breast cancer from having the  surgery. "But the average women, I don't feel -- given the improvements in  radiological techniques -- that it is a major issue," she said.  </P> <P> The Washington University researchers have spent the last year conducting tests  on rats and rabbits to make sure their implants have no adverse effects, such  as allergic reactions or extreme scar tissue formation.  </P> <P> "So far our animal studies are very favorable," Destouet said. "There really  are no side effects."  </P> <P> Once the researchers get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, the  implants will be tested in women. They could be available commercially in about  two years.  </P> <P> Destouet said the researchers came upon peanut oil as a safe implant filler  when they turned to their chemistry books to find which substances would allow  X-ray penetration, and which of those substances were not carcinogenic.  </P> <P> The implants still use a thin silicone shell to hold the peanut oil.  </P> <P> "We need a better envelope too," Destouet said. "You can't invent everything at  the same time."  </P></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York raw SUGAR prices were broadly lower by midsession on sentiment that Monday's sharp rise might have been overdone. The market, already poised for an advance after Friday's firm close, soared on news that Cuba's crop and mills might have been damaged by the weekend storm which swept up the eastern US. But analysts said uncertainty about the extent of the damage was paring the gains. New York COFFEE prices were down at mid-day, weighed down by lack of news in the physical market, large consumer stocks and little chance of renewed ICO export quotas. GOLD edged ahead on the London bullion market, but was meeting stiff resistance at Dollars 330 a troy ounce on Comex at midday. London dealers said gold still had to overcome downward pressure from producer sales with the South African rand gold price approaching record levels. Both PLATINUM and PALLADIUM were weighed down in London by Japanese selling as the dollar slumped against the yen. Compiled from Reuters</p>

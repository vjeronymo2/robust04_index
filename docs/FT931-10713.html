			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Collecting: Old Masters fail to make an impression - Optimism gives way to disappointment at New York sales - and buyers must now face the deterrent effect of a new 15 per cent premium fanned assiduously by auction houses and dealers alike - was that Old Masters, traditionally a subdued market in the United States, were about to come into their own. Both Sotheby's and Christie's had successful sales which featured a range of quality paintings - well above the New York auction average - and shoals of Italian dealers, outbidding their London and New York rivals, jostled with each other to snap up bargains. At The Art Show (showcase of the Art Dealers' Association of America) this time last year, Colnaghi, Rosenberg and Stiebel, Otto Naumann and other dealers exhibited some very serious pictures, while the International Antique Dealers' Show in October re-christened itself the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers' Show. This was intended to stress that there was to be a stronger emphasis on paintings: the fabulous Bellotto exhibited at the show by Bruno Meissner was evidence that the new title was justified fully. A certain optimism prevailed, therefore, when it came to last month's Old Master sales in New York. Alas, results proved disappointing. At Christie's, 40 per cent of the 176 lots on offer were bought in; and at Sotheby's, where quantity (almost 300 lots) was the order of the day, 36 per cent of the paintings remained on the block. The high point at Sotheby's was a late-15th century portrait of the Flemish composer Jacob Obrecht. This was catalogued as 'School of Bruges' (although the catalogue pointed out it could be by Memlinc) and its pre-sale estimate was Dollars 400,000-600,000. There was some surprise when the hammer came down at Dollars 2.4m. The purchaser turned out to be the wealthy Kimbell museum in Fort Worth, Texas - an institution which appears more regularly in the New York salerooms as vendor than purchaser. In the same Sotheby's sale, a Dutch 17th century still life by Jan Davidsz de Heem went well above its estimate of Dollars 350,000-450,000 to reach Dollars 1.5m; and an early-16th century Netherlandish crucifixion (by Jacob van Amsterdam) went for Dollars 607,000 (estimated Dollars 250,000-350,000). These results, however, represented the good news. The bad was that published pictures by Isenbrant, Breughel, van Goyen, Flinck, Gentileschi, Guardi, Vernet and others - all with high estimates - failed to sell. Apart from the usual sprinkling of American museums, the principal vendor at Christie's Old Master sale was a Neapolitan medical doctor, Carlo Corce. who lives in Philadelphia, His collection of about 60 Italian baroque pictures seemed to have been assembled fairly recently, and most were bought on the open market in New York and in London. Although the catalogue covered the collection in a cloak of scholarship, this turned out to be a shroud and quantities of the pictures were bought in. Those that did sell just scraped above the low end of the pre-sale estimate. As there was hardly a really good picture among the group, their rejection by the market was heartening. Sales of Old Master drawings the same week - traditionally a much stronger market in New York - fared much better. Although neither auction house managed to sell more than 75 per cent of the total lots on offer, the items left on the block were, with one or two exceptions, very minor. Among the top prices for the day at Sotheby's were three separate sheets by Guercino (which descended from the artist's heirs), while a finished Guardi rendering of the Grand Canal also did well (Dollars 77,000). Christie's had success with Fragonard when a wash and chalk view of a garden with figures went for Dollars 343,500 (estimate Dollars 150,000-200,000). Other French drawings in this sale, notably by Greuze, also brought strong prices, with American private collectors active in the bidding. The next hurdle for the New York market is 19th century European paintings: the big sales are at Sotheby's on February 17 and Christie's the following day. The steamy nudes of Bouguereau were among the first pictures in this area to attract attention early in the 1980s - when prices began to soar above the Dollars 1m mark - but they were soon followed into the limelight by the works of painters like Tissot, Alfred Stevens, Gerome, Jean Beraud and, occasionally, the English artists Albert Moore, Lord Leighton and Alma Tadema. As in other areas of collecting, the mood of late has been more cautious when it comes to these Salon pictures - which at least have the merit of being well-made and entertaining - and prices have dipped accordingly. In the coming auctions, Christie's is hoping for the best with Bouguereau and Tissot; but an indication of the present state of affairs is that all of the works by these artists included in the sale (three by Bouguereau, two by Tissot) were bought by their vendors in the past decade. Only one, a saucy Tissot of a woman singing in church, went through the saleroom (rather than the trade) when it fetched Dollars 165,000 in 1987: it is now estimated at Dollars 300,000-500,000. Gerome, whose record is above Dollars 2m, is nowhere to be found in Christie's sale but a painting by his contemporary, Cabanel, of Cleopatra practicing poisoning is the next best thing. It is estimated at Dollars 500,000-700,000. Meanwhile, Sotheby's is auctioning four major works by Tissot from the well-known Toronto collection of Joey and Toby Tannenbaum. All were bought in the 1970s and each carries an estimate of about Dollars 1.5m. The effect of the new 15 per cent buyer's premium at both Sotheby's and Christie's might not yet have registered with collectors who, latterly, have favoured auctions above dealers when it comes to buying. But it is very unlikely to go unnoticed and is almost certain to act as a deterrent fairly soon. From this point of view, the fifth annual Art Show (February 25-March 1) in New York - more than 60 dealers showing paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture and photography - will be monitored closely. While the variety of works on offer always appears bewilderingly wide-ranging - this year, a 16th century Italian Madonna and Child at Richard Feigen; Matisse and Warhol elsewhere; and video installations at Carl Solway's booth - the show has an excitement of its own. Joining the fray this time round will be Agnew's with a display of (what else?) Old Masters. There could be no further confirmation that all has changed with the New York art market.</p>

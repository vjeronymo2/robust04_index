			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): US elections subdue Pacific Basin equities Volume stayed low ahead of the US mid-term elections, and share prices declined marginally, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average lost 10.20 at 19,609.02 after moving in a narrow range between 19,637.93 and 19,543.71. Activity was dominated by cross-trading, companies and banks seeking to realise profits on their shareholdings. Traders said many investors expected a further fall in share prices and had tried to unload their holdings in advance. Volume amounted to 210m shares, against 182m. Analysts said daily average trading value and volatility, although improving, remained subdued. On the first section, the ratio of daily turnover to market capitalisation was at a 40-year low, said Mr Alan Livsey, a strategist at Kleinwort Benson. 'It is much worse than the bear markets in the 1960s and in 1973-74,' he added. Mr Livsey went on to say that corporate and institutional investors were still in the process of liquidating their investments and that overseas investors, who had bought shares earlier this year, had reduced their activity; so market turnover and volatility, he reckoned, were unlikely to pick up soon. The lack of investor participation was highlighted by the margin balance released by the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday. The outstanding buying balance fell for the 15th consecutive week, by Y5.9bn to Y2,030bn, while the balance of stocks sold short increased by Y17.7bn to Y437.3bn. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 5.14 to 1,550.27 and the Nikkei 300 eased 0.49 to 283.92. Losers led gainers by 728 to 227, with 214 issues unchanged. The ISE-Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.71 to 1,272.86. Profit-taking hit pachinko, or Japanese pinball, related shares. Nakabayashi, an office equipment maker, fell Y25 to Y953 and Sailor Pen dropped Y47 to Y889. Steels and electronics companies met profit-taking. Mitsubishi Electric, the most active issue of the day, slipped Y2 to Y699 and Nippon Steel Y9 to Y388. Hitachi declined Y5 to Y969 and NEC Y10 to Y1,170. Japan Tobacco, the partially privatised tobacco and salt monopoly, shed Y40,000 to Y1.01m, down 30 per cent from its initial offering price of Y1.438m. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone receded Y5,000 to Y892,000 and East Japan Railway was off Y3,000 at Y478,000. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 125.83 lower at 21,684.17 in volume of 41.5m shares. Roundup Activity around the Pacific Rim was generally muted. HONG KONG eased in extremely thin trade, preoccupied by expectations of an increase in US interest rates next week. The Hang Seng index finished 18.22 down at 9,416.09 in turnover estimated at HKDollars 1.80bn, against Monday's revised HKDollars 2.30bn. Looking to the year ahead, Baring Securities expected interest rates to rise further over the next two quarters at least, with no reversal in the trend before late 1995. SEOUL registered another record close in active trade, after a late buying spurt of primary blue chips outweighed earlier selective selling. The composite index closed 5.76 firmer at 1,138.75. Trading companies were in demand on hopes that they would benefit most from the government's plan to lift its ban on investment in North Korea. Samsung and Hyundai rose by their daily upper limits of Won1,300 and Won1,000, to Won36,400 and Won25,700. SINGAPORE was lower in cautious trade, the Straits Times Industrial index losing 4.65 at 2,327.01. The multimedia company Aztech Systems rose 5 cents to SDollars 1.45 in heavy volume of 10.8m shares on news that it had bought into the US-based Reveal Computer Products and had entered a joint venture in Indonesia. KUALA LUMPUR picked up from the day's lows after a session which saw speculators selling stocks in the absence of fresh buying incentives, and the reallocation of share portfolios by institutions. The composite index finished 12.18 down at 1,057.96 in turnover of 156m shares. MANILA saw heavy selling on the rise in the peso against the dollar. The composite index lost 41.43 at 3,006.51. The peso's rise and PLDT's Dollars 3 decline in New York overnight drove the telephone stock's local price 5 per cent lower to 1,315 pesos. PNB fell 3.7 per cent to 327.50 pesos. WELLINGTON was undermined by weakness in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge, down by 6 and 5 cents respectively to NZDollars 5.32 and NZDollars 4.39. The NZSE-40 Capital index retreated 22.02 to 2,085.64. FCL suffered some profit-taking in spite of reporting at its annual meeting that its current year earnings, before tax and abnormal items, should substantially exceed those seen in 1993-94. BZW in London recently published a bullish assessment of the New Zealand equity market, commenting that it offered 'one of the more exciting prospects longer term', and suggested that a more optimistic outlook for US bonds, which have a marked effect on the market's performance, could signal an upgrade from the current neutral stance. SYDNEY weakened in thin turnover after the start of trading was delayed by more than an hour due to technical problems with the stock exchange's automated trading system. The All Ordinaries index dipped 12.0 to 1,967.3, its lowest since July 11. Westpac slipped 7 cents to ADollars 4.29 after reporting 12-month earnings at the lower end of expectations.</p>

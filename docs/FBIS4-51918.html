			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- Foreign media denounced  the U.S. hostile policy of stifling the DPRK.    The Czech paper NASE PRAVDA No. 14 said U.S. propaganda  media  spread the rumor that North Korea was "developing" nuclear  weapons, "threatening" South Korea, but it is contrary to fact.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused by the  United States as it introduced many nuclear weapons into South  Korea, the paper said, contending that if the nuclear issue is  to be solved, the United States must withdraw nuclear weapons  from South Korea.    The Iranian paper KAYHAN APRIL 5 said the U.S. acts of  shipping into South Korea Patriot missiles and sophisticated  military hardware and moving there its nuclear carriers and  various kinds of warships show that it is weak, and they signify  a victory of North Korea. It is the consistent position of  North Korea to answer strength with strength, dialogue with  dialogue, the paper said, and added: The United States cannot  stifle North Korea.    The Swedish magazine RIKTPUNKT No. 6 said although the  United  States is claiming "observance" of the Nuclear Non-proliferation  Treaty, pretending to be a "defender" of world conscience, it  has virtually deployed nuclear weapons in many parts of the  world and is constantly developing dangerous new weapons.</p>

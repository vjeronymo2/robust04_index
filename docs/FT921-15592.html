			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Yugoslav army chief quits amid helicopter row GENERAL Veljko Kadiejevic, Yugoslav defence minister in charge of the federal army, resigned yesterday, the day after a Yugoslav jet shot down a helicopter carrying European Community monitors. Gen Kadiejevic, citing his deteriorating health, said he had formalised an earlier decision to step down, but western diplomats says his resignation signals an open feud between factions within the federal army. The Defence Ministry in Belgrade, quoted by Tanjug, said army chief-of-staff, Gen Blagoje Adzic, a Serb nationalist and hardliner, would take over until a permanent replacement was found. The resignation of Gen Kadiejevic comes at a critical juncture in peace negotiations being conducted by the United Nations and the European Community, and just over 24 hours after federal army jets shot down the the EC helicopter, killing all five passengers. Gen Kadiejevic had been expected to attend the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia which reconvenes in Brussels today. It is unclear who will now represent the army. A career officer committed to the idea of retaining the Yugoslav federation, he had in recent weeks become more pragmatic and accommodating towards the deployment of UN peacekeeping troops in Croatia. But Gen Adzic is likely to be far less compromising. He is likely to shift the federal Defence Ministry much more towards the nationalist and anti-Croat wing. This could increase the pressure on Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, who faces a rift among Serbs in Croatia who want the federal army to remain there and protect them. Under the terms of the UN-forged ceasefire, the federal army agreed to pull out of Croatia, denying the Serb nationalist minority military support. The UN Security Council last night unanimously approved a resolution to send 50 UN military observers to Yugoslavia 'to promote maintenance of the ceasefire'. If the truce continues to hold, the Council is expected to follow up with the despatch of a 10,000-member peacekeeping force. The advance team, the first UN peacekeepers to be deployed in continental Europe, are expected to be deployed before the end of the week. Meanwhile, the Yugoslav military has set up an inquiry into the downing of the EC helicopter. Colonel Zvonka Jurjevic, head of the air force, and a Croat, was suspended after the incident. EC monitors have asked to take part in the inquiry and the 170 EC monitors have temporarily suspended activities until they obtain guarantees of security. The move means that a trilateral meeting scheduled for today in Hungary, and aimed at shoring up the ceasefire, has been postponed.</p>

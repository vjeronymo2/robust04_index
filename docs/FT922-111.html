			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Opening shots' in coffee pact talks please delegates DELEGATES INCHED along the road towards a new international coffee agreement at talks in London last week, but once again left the world markets unimpressed. The hopes of producers that transitional measures could be put in place to curb the slide in world prices to the lowest levels for more than 20 years remained unfulfilled. However, both producers and consumers left the meeting seemingly well satisfied with the tiny amount of progress made. 'The negotiations for a new international coffee agreement are under way,' said Mr Arnoldo Lopez, chairman of the International Coffee Organisation negotiating group. 'Nobody in their right mind would have thought that in a week we could reach an agreement,' said Mr Myles Frechette, head of the US delegation. 'We've had the opening shots in a dialogue.' The New York September arabica futures contract rebounded from a lifetime low of 56.8 cents a lb on Friday to close at 59 cents after an upbeat radio interview by Mr Jorge Cardenas, general manager of Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation, who said: 'I would say the outcome is very good.' But this still marked a fall of 1.8 cents on the week. In late trading yesterday the price eased to 58.9 cents a lb. The London robusta market rose yesterday, with the September contract closing at Dollars 700 a tonne. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London broker, said that yesterday's steady markets reflected the fact that the sell-off on lack of progress at the ICO talks had already taken place last week. Mr Lopez' final statement said a new coffee pact would be oriented towards the market and 'provide for suitable means of access to the different types of coffee as required by the consumers, with price stability being a medium and long-term objective'. Working groups have been set up to go further into detailed proposals and will meet at the end of next month. The statement reflects the determination of the US, the biggest consumer, to get the next agreement fully thrashed out and ratified before there is any talk of transitional measures to support prices. From the start Mr Frechette pointed out that the US had very little flexibility in the negotiations. 'I have to remind you of what the (US) National Coffee Federation says - they prefer the free market,' he said. The current purely administrative ICO pact continues until the end of September next year, but the ICO was hoping to sign a new agreement before the end of this year. That now looks unlikely.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Productivity up 10.5% as jobless total falls again: New Jobcentre vacancies at highest level for 2 1/2 years A SHARP rise in UK manufac-turing productivity, a squeeze on earnings throughout the economy and the fifth successive monthly fall in unemployment yesterday boosted hopes that Britain has a substantial platform for non-inflationary growth. Production per manufacturing employee was 10.5 per cent higher in May than 12 months previously, the biggest year-on-year rise for more than 13 years, suggesting that this sector is leading the recovery. While average earnings across the economy rose 3.75 per cent in the 12 months to May, the lowest year-on-year rise for 26 years, optimism about an upturn was further buoyed by another decline in unemployment. The number of people without jobs and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally-adjusted 7,600 last month to 2.91m, the lowest level for eight months. The unadjusted figure dropped 51,600 to 2.865m. The economic indicators were hailed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, as 'very good news indeed'. He told the House of Commons: 'It is entirely clear that we are coming out of recession and into recovery, and equally clear that we are leading Europe into recovery.' Opposition politicians voiced disappointment that the fall in unemployment was no greater, pointing to the more substantial declines of more than 25,000 in both February and March. Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, said the June reduction would 'make little impression' on unemployment of nearly 3m. In further indications that employers are starting to step up recruitment efforts in the wake of lower interest rates and the devaluation of the pound last autumn, new vacancies notified to government Jobcentres have climbed to their highest level for two-and-a-half years. Overtime working in factories was at its highest point in May for nearly 12 months, a sign that manufacturers are expanding production to try to take advantage of greater competitiveness and a sharp fall in wage costs per unit of factory output. In the three months to May, these costs were 3.6 per cent lower than in the same period of 1992, the biggest fall since the Department of Employment started records in 1970. Since numbers out of work started to drop in January, the total has shrunk by 83,100. The fall has particularly benefited south-east England excluding London - a region hard hit by the recession. Unemployment there dropped 4.6 per cent in the five months to June, well above the overall fall for the UK of 2.8 per cent. The south west also saw a relatively big reduction in joblessness, while northern England bucked the trend and recorded a rise in unemployment over the same period. In June, most regions saw a fall in unemployment, with the south west, the west Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside registering significant net flows of people into jobs. The pound lost 1 1/4 pfennig against the D-Mark to close in London at DM2.565 while it fell nearly 1 1/2 cents against the dollar to close at Dollars 1.488.

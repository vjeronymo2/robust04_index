According to  initial, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the  Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] achieved significant gains.  Final results are not available from every city yet.    In Mecklenburg Western Pomerania and Saxony Anhalt, the CDU  scored about 33 percent, in Saxony and Thuringia 39 percent.  The SPD remained in second place, increasing its share between  6 and 8 percent and achieving 22 (Saxony) and 30 percent.    The PDS, the successor party to the Socialist Unity Party of  Germany, achieved spectacular gains in the east. In Thuringia  and Saxony it polled 15-16 percent, in Saxony Anhalt and  Mecklenburg Western Pomerania 20 and 25 percent respectively,  In several cities it became the strongest party. In Schwerin  and Rostock, the PDS is now number one with 34 and 33 percent  respectively.    In most major cities in Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia, and  Saxony,  run-off elections will have to be held to elect mayors. In  Hoyerswerda, Magdeburg, Suhl, and Dresden, the PDS took its  candidates into the second round.    In the Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, and  Baden-Wuerttemberg, the governing or cogoverning SPD lost votes  while the CDU increased its share. According to preliminary  official final results from the Saarland, the SPD's share sank  from 45.7 to 44.4 percent, while the CDU slightly improved its  score to 37.4 percent.    In Rhineland-Palatinate, where the SPD chancellor candidate  heads the government in a coalition with the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP], the SPD suffered severe losses according  to initial individual results. In the capital, Mainz, it  dropped from 40.6 to 29.9 percent. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, where  the final results are not expected before the middle of the week  due to the complicated electoral system, everything is pointing  toward an overall CDU victory.    The FDP has obviously lost in all seven municipal elections,  while Alliance 90/Greens increased their share in the vote.    In the repetition of the election to the Munich City  Council,  the SPD dropped from 42 to 36.1 percent according to first  trends. The CSU increased its share from 30.1 to 34.3 percent.  Munich has been ruled by a SPD/Greens majority since 1990.  However, the vote had to be repeated after the result had been  challenged.</p>

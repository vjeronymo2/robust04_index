			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Poor pension performers - The life office league tables SURVEYS published in Money Management magazine this week show that charges on personal pensions and early surrenders of endowments are at worryingly high levels. They also suggest that the league tables advocated by Sir Carsberg, director general of fair trading (see Serious Money, page II) would make interesting reading. Several offices are shown to be poor performers. But at least they are open about it, while several companies decided not to disclose their figures. Many of these were poor performers in the past, suggesting that revealing the information might have been bad for business. On personal pensions, the stock market crash of October 1987 meant that 35 per cent of all unit-linked five-year funds failed to return the gross amount of premiums which had been paid into the fund. The most disquieting figures concern charges. Money Management asked offices to predict their final pay-out on the assumption that their funds grew at 13 per cent. Note that this return now looks on the high side, and that differences in projected pay-outs will be determined by charges alone. In reality, strong investment performance can often compensate for high charges. Lautro, the life assurance regulator, prevents companies from quoting projections on the basis of their own charges, but instead stipulates a fixed level, even if an office's charges are much higher. Money Management's figures suggest that this approach could be misleading. The table shows how much of the final fund you use to buy a pension annuity when you retire will be eaten up by charges. With no charges at all, the fund would be worth Pounds 399,297. If charges are on the Lautro basis, they will knock Pounds 63,697 off this. However, Money Management's survey shows that the average fund would shed Pounds 48,653 in charges, while the worst - Canterbury Life - would lose Pounds 169,989, and only pay out Pounds 229,308. By comparison the cheapest office, Professional Life, would pay Pounds 365,553. As for early surrenders of endowments - only 11 companies would say how many of their policies started in 1990 had survived into 1992. Their figures are shown in the bottom table. Some of them, particularly over 25 years for Colonial Mutual and Sun Alliance, are very poor. Long-term policies surrendered this quickly are a dead loss for both investors and the life companies. But at least these companies admitted the problem.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POLICIES SOLD IN 1990 STILL ON THE BOOKS (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Term                         10 Years       25 Years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia Life                   89.0           85.0 Colonial Mutual                  80.5           63.7 Friends Provident                80.2           89.5 Norwich Union                    88.9           84.8 Royal London                     88.1           78.3 Scottish Amicable                93.0           88.0 Scottish Provident               87.0           81.0 Scottish Widows                  96.0           96.0 Standard Life                    96.5           92.5 Sun Alliance                     89.0           71.0 Tunbridge Wells                  95.4           92.2 Average                          89.4           83.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- What the table shows: the percentage of policies sold in 1990 which are still on the books.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Management  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------ PERSONAL PENSIONS - TRUE COST OF CHARGES OVER 25 YEARS  ------------------------------------------------------ No charges                 0            0 Best fund     -Pounds 33,744      (-8.5%) Average fund  -Pounds 96,761     (-24.2%) Worst fund    -Pounds 169,989    (-42.6%) LAUTRO basis  -Pounds 63,697     (-16.0%)  ------------------------------------------------------ Monthly premiums of Pounds 200  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Money Management  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

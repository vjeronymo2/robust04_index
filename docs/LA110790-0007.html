			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IKE'S WARNING ON MILITARY SPENDING  </P> <P> For many years I have been paraphrasing Ike's comments with regard to the  military and the imposition it puts us.  </P> <P> Willens' column outlined how stupid we Americans can be at times.  </P> <P> I think we have the perfect opportunity to evaluate a Stealth bomber. Send one  across Iraq and if it is detected, scrap the program.  </P> <P> The "pie in the sky fantasy" remark regarding "Star Wars" is a classic and very  appropriate. Do we really expect the Russians, or anyone else for that matter,  to send nuclear missiles across the oceans? The Soviet Union can't even put  bread on the table for all its citizens.  </P> <P> The American people need to wake up to reality. I hope it's not too late.  </P> <P> DONALD A. LeJEUNE, Tustin  </P></p>

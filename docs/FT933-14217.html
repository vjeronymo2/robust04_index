			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / New laws urged to counter black market in secret data NEW LAWS are needed to stamp out the black market in confidential personal information, the data protection registrar said yesterday. Mr Eric Howe, the registrar, is so concerned about the market in computerised data on individuals' income tax, bank accounts and credit cards he has asked the home secretary to launch a parliamentary investigation. Mr Howe said at a news conference at which he presented the agency's ninth annual report: 'I have drawn it to the attention of the home secretary . . . and it may be that ministers and parliament might like to consider a wider inquiry to find out what is this market, how big is it, how easy is it to use.' He wants the government to consider whether there should be stronger legislation against those who force 'disclosure (of personal data) by deceit'. The Data Protection Act requires banks and other personal data users to have appropriate security for the information they hold. Data users of this type have to register under the act if they disclose personal details to another authorised organisation such as a credit reference agency. However, Mr Howe sees a possible weakness in the law as it stands since unauthorised people can fool data users into handing over information such as bank account details. The black market has arisen either because bank staff supply details knowingly to third parties with no legitimate access or because they are duped into giving away confidential information to unauthorised private agents posing as authorised users and hired mainly to collect debts. Banks and finance houses have become more concerned about leaks of information after complaints by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, and Ms Stella Rimington, the head of MI5, that the security of personal files had been breached. The British Bankers' Association has been reviewing security in banks after reports that 'tracing agents' were bribing banks' staff to obtain the internal codes required to authenticate telephone inquiries. The registrar believes stronger sanctions are needed as well as improved security at the banks. Mr Howe also warned that the reissue of National Health Service numbers could introduce a system of national identification by the back door. He doubted whether the use of NHS numbers would be adequately restricted by Crown Copyright. Complaints by individuals to the registrar about the use of their personal data rose from 1,747 in 1992 to 4,590 this year after a television campaign. Secrets exploited, Page 6</p>

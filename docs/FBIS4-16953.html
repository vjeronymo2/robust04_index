			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol 20 April TASS -- Russian Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev arrived in Sevastopol on Wednesday for talks with  Ukrainian officials on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet.    According to an agreement signed in Moscow on 15 April,  naval  bases of the Black Sea Fleet of Russia and Ukraine must be  separated. The naval base of one of the fleets should be in  Sevastopol. "This is what will be at issue at the upcoming  talks," Grachev said upon arrival at Sevastopol airport.    The Russian minister expressed hope for the success of the  talks, saying that he positively assessed proposals suggesting  that the entire Black Sea Fleet should belong to Russia.  According to Grachev, the fate of the Black Sea Fleet depends  on politicians and they have had their say on the matter. Now  the matter rests with the military," Grachev said.    Grachev does not expect that during the talks a final  resolution on the Black Sea Fleet will be adopted.  Nevertheless, he pointed out that "he would be satisfied if key  principles and approaches to this problem are coordinated." "We  came to Ukraine in a bid to reach a fair solution of the Black  Sea Fleet problem," the Russian defence minister said. Upon  arrival in Sevastopol Grachev met commanders of the Black Sea  Fleet. Afterwards, he will meet the city administration. On  Thursday, Grachev will begin talks with the Ukrainian delegation  led by Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy.    Grachev is accompanied by a plenipotentiary representative  of  the Russian president to the talks, Yuriy Dubinin, who told  journalists at the airport that the main task of the talks is to  reach the realisation of agreements reached in Moscow.  According to Dubinin, all previous agreements on the solution  of the Black Sea Fleet problem were not realised since lower  structures "refused to comply with the president's will."</p>

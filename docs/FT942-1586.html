			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nasdaq seeks partners to set up European exchange Nasdaq, the US screen-based exchange which is the world's second largest stock market by turnover, is holding talks with potential partners about creating a pan-European exchange for small and medium-sized companies. Mr Joseph Hardiman, Nasdaq president, said the new exchange could be formed quite quickly, perhaps in the next 12 to 15 months. Nasdaq would seek to be a minority shareholder, he said. The potential participants included the European Venture Capital Association, the UK-based City Group for Smaller Companies and several European bourses, he said. Before Nasdaq would commit itself, he said, 'we have to make sure there are no overwhelming regulatory hurdles and we have to make sure there is a critical mass of buyers of these securities'. Mr Hardiman expressed disappointment that the London Stock Exchange had rebuffed his suggestion that it become a participant. The LSE recently announced its own plan to promote trading in shares of smaller companies in the wake of its intended closure of the Unlisted Securities Market in early 1996. Mr Michael Lawrence, the London exchange's chief executive, said: 'Our proposals can, and will, be put into action speedily and without undue cost. The case for a pan-European venture capital market is far from proved.' Separately, Mr Jean-Francois Theodore, president of the Societe des Bourses Francaises, confirmed that he is one of the parties in the Nasdaq discussions. Should the bourse participate in a pan-European exchange, it too would hope to hold a minority stake. The bourse said there was a particular need to provide an exchange for companies for which the Paris unlisted securities market was inadequate but for which full listing was not feasible. 'We are hoping to develop jointly a true international securities market,' Mr Hardiman said, adding that the ability to trade its securities at 'all hours' might be one of its attractions. One possibility might include the opportunity for companies listed on the exchange to be simultaneously listed on Nasdaq, if regulatory and other requirements could be met. Such a move would give guarantee companies who list on the new exchange access to the US capital markets. While Nasdaq attributes much of its growth to its specialisation in the shares of small, entrepreneurial high-growth companies, it is not clear that a European version would be equally successful.

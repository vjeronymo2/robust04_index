			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Sekovici, Feb 8 (TANJUG) -- The Serb side has  information that the Sarajevo market massacre, which killed 68  people, was planned by the Moslem authorities and that directly  involved was a foreign intelligence service, TANJUG learned on  Tuesday from reliable sources in the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS).    The RS sources said that the scenario and its media support  were developped in mid-January with the participation of a group  of Moslems from former Bosnia-Herzegovina who are active in the  Islamic lobby in the United States. The preparations included  three military advisors to the Moslem army who carefully planned  the time and place of the massacre.    The bloodshed at the Sarajevo market was caused by a mortar  shell and several explosive devices, but the Serb side does not  yet have all the necessary facts.    The RS sources claim that there is no doubt that many  traces,  which would immediately show that the incident was  stage-managed, were removed with lightening speed.    They said that the expertise carried out by the U.N.  Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) was superficial and underscored the  significance of the fact that the Moslems refused to agree that  Serb experts take part in the investigation.    The RS sources said that the criminal action aimed to create  a reason for the continuation of the pressure against the  Bosnian Serbs, to provoke NATO air strikes and support the  Moslem side in its aspirations to control the entire Bosnian  territory.    The sources said that the stage-managed action is also an  attempt to bring about the failure of the Geneva peace talks and  to provide a justification to the Moslem side not to sign the  peace plan.    All this is supported by the fact that Moslem Presidency  Vice-President Ejup Ganic on Monday revealed a new Moslem  proposal to create a cantonal Bosnia.    The Bosnian Serb sources learned that a new stage-managed  action is planned in case the Sarajevo incident fails to achieve  the wanted results, thus confirming the determination to realize  these aims. The sources said that Moslem ambassador in the  United Nations, Muhamed Secirbegovic, on Monday openly  threatened to do this. If NATO fails to carry out the sir  strikes "such incidents will recur," he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 22 TASS -- The idea of averting  threatened NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions was  developed by Russian diplomats and military. Diplomatic efforts  by Russia, which took an independent stand on Bosnian  settlement, were backed by the Russian Defence Ministry's  concrete steps.    When asked by TASS to comment on the latest developments in  Bosnia, the Defence Ministry's information and press department  said Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev had repeatedly  called upon NATO to reverse its ultimatum threatening Bosnian  Serbs with air strikes and to find a political solution to the  armed conflict.    These appeals were voiced during recent meetings in Moscow  with high-ranking foreign military leaders -- French Defence  Minister Francois Leotard, inspector general of the German  Bundeswehr Klaus Naumann and British secretary of state for  foreign and commonwealth affairs Douglas Hurd.    Simultaneously, the Russian defence minister continuously  took efforts, through both diplomatic and its own channels, to  avert NATO air strikes against any of the warring factions. The  Defence Ministry's initiatives were based on the February  message by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the U.N. secretary  general on possible ways of settling the Sarajevo crisis.    At his own initiative, the Russian defence minister  discussed  Bosnian settlement on the phone with his U.S. counterpart  William Perry for three times last week. Specifically, during  Monday's conversation Grachev, as the Russian president's  authorized person, drew Mr Perry's attention to the fact that  Bosnian Serbs were gradually withdrawing their heavy weapons for  20-30 kilometers from around Sarajevo or hand them over to U.N.  control. The ministers considered possible measures to ease  tensions around the Bosnian capital.    According to military observers, this and other moves by the  Russian military command rested upon the firsthand assessment of  the situation in the conflict zone. Thus, an on-the-spot  reconnaissance group from among staff officers of Russian  peacekeeping forces deployed in Serb Krajina, as well as a group  of the Russian Defence Ministry officials headed by airborne  troop commander Yevgeniy Podkolzin were sent to the area of  possible air strikes. The Russian military obtained guarantees  from Bosnian Serbs that they would strictly fulfill their  obligations on big guns withdrawal. They also looked into all  political and organizational issues concerning the deployment of  Russian peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, including their possible  reinforcement.    As a result, 400 Russian paratroopers were stationed in the  buffer zone between the confronting sides near Sarajevo. These  military units were transferred here from Croatia with the  approval of the U.N. secretary general. Russian Defence  Ministry officials believe the presence of Russian peacekeepers  in the epicenter of the Bosnian conflict was key to achieving an  agreement between Russian special envoy for former Yugoslavia  Vitaliy Churkin and the Bosnian Serb leader.    According to Russian military, Russia's peacekeeping troops  transferred to the conflict zone need reinforcement. A decision  to send to Bosnia extra peacekeepers numbering up to 300  fighters should be approved by the Russian State Duma.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Recruitment: Tired corporate bodies reject new blood - Many organisations are not tapping the drive and enthusiasm of graduates The seasonal emergence of thousands of university graduates on to the jobs market has initiated the annual debate among recruiters about their respective merits. Typically, this appears as a series of gripes and moans about the graduates' quality and commitment. Graduates are either too complacent, too confident or too timid. It seems that they cannot win, no matter how they approach their job applications and interviews. Once through the door, full of vigour, eager to prove themselves, how often do they find themselves reined in and told they must walk before they can run? How many have their confidence undermined by older hands ready to focus on mistakes but sparing with praise when a job is well done? These are some of the comments collected by a Glasgow-based employment consultancy. A graduate working in consulting said: 'I joined the company and I had a brilliant training course and then I just wasn't given anything to do. There were a load of us who were all assigned together and, all right, we had a good laugh, sat there playing cards all day, but it's not really how you anticipate spending your first months with a company.' Another said: 'Something I found quite strange was that the whole idea of recruiting externally was to bring bright new blood in, new ideas. But anybody who goes against conventional ideas and traditions finds it just works against them. It's very much a case of don't rock the boat and you'll do fine.' Such negative experiences are far too common, according to Yellowbrick, the consultancy which collected them. Instead of focusing on the merits of graduates, it has chosen to study the different approaches towards their employment. The resulting report - Delivering the Promise - concludes that many organisations have become complacent about the recruitment of graduates and do too little to maximise their potential. The company conducted interviews with graduate recruits and personnel departments in 15 private and public sector organisations, reflecting a broad sectoral spread and which between them were responsible for recruiting some 2,000 graduates a year. It found that selecting graduates is an expensive business. A recruitment cost of Pounds 25,000 per graduate is a realistic figure, says the report, although estimates among different employers ranged from Pounds 5,000 at the lower end to as much as Pounds 40,000. When salary, training and overhead costs are included, a new graduate will cost an employer in excess of Pounds 100,000 over the first three years, says Yellowbrick. You might expect, with that kind of outlay, companies would give the same thought to developing their graduates as to a new product range. Instead, many employers appear to take the view that graduates are wet behind the ears and know nothing. Whether it has anything to do with the generation gap or fading memories of youth, some managers continue to harbour resentment, even hostility, towards the product of universities. The result in such workplaces is that enthusiasm and drive are less likely to be tapped than drained away. But why recruit them at all if your approach is the corporate equivalent of putting bromide in the tea? The report says graduates are recruited for three basic reasons: their future potential and prospects in senior management; their intelligence and knowledge to do an immediate job; and for their injection of new ideas and energy. In spite of this, companies often fail to live up to the expectations of graduates, sometimes leading to disillusionment, an early move and a loss to the employer of the front-end investment in their careers. If companies portray themselves at the recruitment stage as fast moving and dynamic and fail to deliver this image in reality, they can expect a negative response from their graduates, says Yellowbrick. The report finds that those companies which expect a lot of their graduate recruits receive the highest returns in terms of performance. 'Graduates arrive at an organisation with up to date knowledge, fresh creative potential, yet often this is ignored because the ideas may be put across in the wrong way,' says Colin Graham, a Yellowbrick partner. 'The challenge is to help these recruits communicate their ideas in a way that can benefit the employer.' He adds: 'We asked every company when they expected the graduate make a significant contribution. Between six and 18 months was the standard reply but one company we went to replied: 'Day two''. This meant that on their second day in their new job a group of young recruits would be given a project brief and budget of up to Pounds 100,000. Graham commends the approach: 'Graduates come to their new jobs with high expectations and these play an important part in their performance, attitudes and habits.' Since, according to a Department of Employment study, graduates spend, on average, only three years in their first job, it perhaps makes sense to make the most of them without delay. While Graham concedes graduates would require further training specific to the particular job - sometimes because they need professional qualifications  -the research had found the longer graduates were treated as trainees, the more likely they were to act as trainees. Prof Charles Handy, whose books on the organisation of work have inspired new approaches to employment and management, says in support of the findings: 'It has always seemed amazing to me that companies go to a lot of trouble to recruit the brightest of the bright and do nothing to use their brightness.' One of the main reasons for under performance of graduates, says the report, was poor management. 'They should be assigned to competent professional managers who can give them responsibility while at the same time extending them the support they need,' says Graham, who advises companies to carry out regular appraisals. 'Graduates are used to continuous appraisal and they find it a useful source of encouragement.' Apart from its criticisms, the report found good practices worth highlighting. It identified SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceutical group, and GKN, the engineering company, as having particularly effective graduate development policies. The cream of the SmithKline Beecham graduates from its worldwide recruitment is channelled into a fast track programme. This allows them to tour its international offices and plants, developing new ideas and reporting directly to the main board. The top two or three trainees from this group will then be promoted to a comparatively senior post, something like the post of marketing director of a Latin American subsidiary, in their mid 20s. The report points out that companies such as GKN which take a long-term strategic view towards graduate employment have had far better results from their training programmes than those which turn their recruitment on and off with short-term economic fluctuations. Unless companies approach their graduate recruitment in an organised, structured way they can only blame themselves if they see their promising youngsters walking out of the door to a competitor at the first opportunity. It is not simply lost investment, it can also be a loss to a company's reputation. Word about employment conditions soon gets around among young people with fresh university networks. Those new graduates may prove to be your best job advertisements for next year's crop. Respect their achievements, put them to good use and do it quickly.

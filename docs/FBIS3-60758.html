A United Nations spokesman said no one was hurt in the  explosion, caused by an estimated 18 sticks of dynamite,  according to military officials. "Our concern is that we do not  return to the kind of mine laying that we saw in August through  October," said UN military spokesman Major Tim McDavitt.    UN officials said the blast could have been in retaliation  for the killing of a Somali by U.S. Army sharpshooters who  opened fire on a vehicle carrying a machine gun on Sunday.  Another Somali was wounded in the incident, the first involving  U.S. troops for several weeks.    The radio of factional leader Mohammed Farah Aideed said two  Somalis were killed in Sunday's shooting, but there was no  independent confirmation. Officials of Aideed's faction  disclaimed responsibility for the explosion.    A senior aide of General Aideed, Issa Mohamed Siad, said the  warlord's Somali National Alliance faction was still bound by a  cease-fire signed in March in Addis Ababa. "We are committed to  honor the cease-fire signed earlier this year, but you must know  that there are many people who are not controlled by us," Issa  said.    Issa hinted that Aideed's enemy and rival factional leader  Ali Mahdi Mohamed could have been behind the blast. "I think  that Ali Mahdi Mohamed and UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] are  trying to say to the world that there will be chaos in Mogadishu  after U.S. troops depart, but there will be no chaos, at least  not from us," Issa told reporters.    A senior UN military official said, "The explosion may have  been an act of retaliation for the Sunday shooting, as if to say  quit blowing our guys away -- we still have this capability."    Somali residents said they did not know who was responsible  for the blast. "We don't know who did this, maybe it was the  U.S. forces of UNOSOM (the U.N. Operation in Somalia)," said  Ndifa Omar, a local businessman.</p>

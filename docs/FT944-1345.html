			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Truce agreed in Bosnia, says Carter: Warring parties guarded on prospects for end to fighting Bosnia's warring factions have agreed to a four-month ceasefire which will be worked out in detail over the next 10 days, Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president, announced yesterday. In a day of frenetic diplomacy, Mr Carter met the Bosnian Moslem leadership in Sarajevo, then drove to the Bosnian Serbs' stronghold of Pale for a further round of talks with Mr Radovan Karadzic, their leader. Mr Carter said: 'The most significant achievement this morning was that the Bosnian Serb leaders ..agreed to a complete ceasefire throughout Bosnia ..to be implemented on .. December 23'. Talks between then and January 1 are intended to work out details of the four-month ceasefire which would be 'monitored by UN forces along all lines of confrontation, with a cessation of all hostile activities'. Hopes of an end to the fighting remain slim, however, and the two sides have already expressed reservations about the agreement. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem president, said: 'I don't see the chance for peace but I see a chance for a ceasefire.' Mr Karadzic appeared doubtful whether ceasefire conditions about exchange of prisoners and Moslem withdrawal from the demilitiarised zone around Sarajevo would be fulfilled. Mr Carter later continued his private peace mission by flying to Belgrade for talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Members of the five-nation Contact Group, comprising the US, Russia, Germany, France and the UK, are to hold separate talks with Mr Milosevic today in Belgrade. Many previous ceasefires have been agreed and violated since war erupted in Bosnia 32 months ago. A peace plan, put forward by the Contact Group, calls on Bosnian Serbs to roll back their gains from 70 to 49 per cent of the country. The Moslem-led Bosnian government insists the Serbs must say they accept the plan before talks continue. On Monday, the Bosnian Serb leadership said it agreed to accept the plan 'as a basis for negotiations of all points.' Mr Carter's apparent breakthrough came as the UN announced that parts of the Belgrade-Zagreb motorway would re-open today for the first time since August 1991. The agreement to open the road, if honoured, could close a loophole in sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs. It is seen as a vital step for Mr Milosevic in securing extension of the provisional easing of UN sanctions against Belgrade.</p>

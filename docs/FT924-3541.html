			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UK Gilts: Conflicting signals cloud outlook INVESTORS are in a confused mood as a result of conflicting signals about the outlook for bonds. Gilts closed on Friday on a high note, shrugging off the downturn in prices at the start of the week and the slightly disappointing outcome to the auction last Wednesday of Pounds 2.5bn of securities from the Bank of England. However, the stronger pound helped spark buying pressure for gilts and bonds finished on Friday largely unchanged on the previous week. Over the past two weeks short-dated gilts have seen a moderate rise in yields and fall in prices, as expectations about further cuts in base rates have eased. That has fitted in with generally more bullish sentiment about a weak recovery in the UK next year, as reflected by a strong tone recently on the London stock market. It is generally reckoned that the government is unlikely to want to sanction further cuts in base rates, now 7 per cent, before early next year. The auction last Wednesday of 8 per cent bonds due in 2003 received bids only about 1.3 times above the value of gilts on sale, a figure for the 'cover ratio' considered to be fairly low. Overseas investors mainly stayed away from the auction, leaving most of the stock to be picked up by domestic institutions. Although the Bank of England was probably reasonably happy with the day's events, the auction did not augur particularly well for the run of auctions expected over the next year as the Bank tries to sell a large volume of securities to pay for Britain's burgeoning public sector borrowing requirement. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said overseas support for the auction was 'fairly close to negligible'. He said this was not a good sign, bearing in mind the Bank would have to try to sell large volumes of securities to non-UK institutions in the 1993-94 financial year when the Treasury expects the PSBR to be around Pounds 44bn, after a projected Pounds 37bn in 1992-93. 'Britain will almost certainly need large purchases of gilts by foreigners over the next two years; it would be wrong to think that domestic institutions will be in a position to buy all the gilts that will be on offer,' said Mr Shepperd. Demand for gilts during the week, however, was boosted by the strong gains made by the pound against a D-Mark weakened by growing indications about a German economic slowdown. On Friday, sterling finished in London more than 1 pfennig stronger on the day against the D-Mark at DM2.4875. That represented a gain of slightly more than 7 pfennigs on the week and was its highest closing level since mid-October. Some of the strength in the UK currency was due to indications that a fragile recovery may be about to start, a development which might have been expected to reduce demand for gilts on the grounds that inflationary pressures could be expected to increase. But according to Mr Ian Blance, an economist at Nikko Securities in London, gilt investors are, if anything, hoping that a recovery will start relatively soon. That is on the grounds that an upturn, even a modest one, will reduce the strains on the PSBR resulting from large increases in unemployment pay and a reduced tax take. As a result, an economic recovery could remove some of the strains on the gilt market arising from expectations of large volumes of price-depressing gilts issues.</p>

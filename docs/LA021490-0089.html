			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TROTTIER GETS 500TH IN 4-2 LOSS  </P> <P> Bryan Trottier has reached numerous milestones in his 15-year NHL career, and  Tuesday night he added another by scoring his 500th career goal.  </P> <P> The Calgary Flames, however, took some of the luster off the achievement by  defeating the New York Islanders, 4-2, at Uniondale, N.Y.  </P> <P> Trottier became the 15th player in NHL history to reach the 500-goal mark when  he scored at 9:57 of the second period.  </P> <P> The Flames got a tie-breaking goal early in the third period from Doug Gilmour  and a pair of goals by Joe Nieuwendyk.  </P> <P> Quebec 5, Vancouver 3 -- Tony McKegney and Mark Fortier each scored two goals  at Quebec as the Nordiques ended a club-record 11-game losing streak.  </P> <P> The Nordiques, who were closing in on the NHL's longest losing string -- 17  games by the Washington Capitals in 1975 -- had not won since they beat the  Montreal Canadiens on Jan. 9.  </P> <P> N.Y. Rangers 4, Philadelphia 3 -- John Ogrodnick scored two goals at  Philadelphia, including the game-winner in the third period.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Buffalo 1 -- Alain Chevrier turned back 25 shots at Chicago in the  Blackhawks first home game since Jan. 24.  </P> <P> Chevrier lost a bid for his first shutout of the season when Buffalo's Jeff  Parker scored with 2:22 remaining in the third period.  </P> <P> St. Louis 2, Minnesota 1 -- Rick Meagher scored the game-winning goal 2:49 into  overtime at Bloomington, Minn., when North Stars goalie Jon Casey deflected  Meagher's pass into his own net.  </P> <P> Brett Hull, the NHL's leading scorer with 52 goals, had his team-record 20-game  scoring string snapped.  </P></p>

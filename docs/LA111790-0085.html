			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAMARILLO STUNS GLENDALE, 33-8  </P> <P> It took only 14 seconds, but Glendale High felt the effects of Brian Vellmure's  73-yard opening kickoff return for the entire game in a 33-8 loss to Camarillo  on Friday night in the first round of the Southern Section Division II playoffs  at Glendale.  </P> <P> Vellmure faked a reverse to Fahali Campbell on the kickoff and ran down the  left sideline to give Camarillo a 7-0 advantage.  </P> <P> Camarillo (8-3), which placed fourth in the Marmonte League and received an  at-large berth, scored on its first four possessions and led, 33-0, at halftime  over third-seeded Glendale (10-1).  </P> <P> "We weren't intimidated," said Campbell, a sophomore running back who rushed  for 126 yards in nine carries, including a 77-yard touchdown run, to spearhead  the Camarillo wishbone. "We've played some good teams and we felt we could play  with anybody."  </P> <P> Camarillo's Corey Tucker and Tag Johnson rushed for 59 and 47 yards,  respectively.  </P> <P> Glendale running back Pathon Rucker, who ended the season with 1,878 yards,  carried 19 times for 102 yards, but Glendale, which came into the game  averaging 371 rushing yards, was limited to only 85 yards on the ground.  </P> <P> Glendale quarterback Eric Kiesau (seven of 23 for 70 yards), threw only one  interception during the regular season but threw two Friday night.  </P> <P> Tucker returned a Kiesau interception 28 yards to the Glendale six-yard line  that set up his own two-yard touchdown run that gave Camarillo a 33-0 lead with  58 seconds left before halftime.  </P> <P> "Once you get a break like we did at the start, the momentum just starts to go  your way," Camarillo Coach Carl Thompson said. "We just played our standard  defense and I felt if we stopped Rucker, we would be all right. I'd rather have  them pass than let him carry the ball."  </P> <P> Glendale, which had outscored its opponents, 320-81, entering the contest and  had not allowed more than 21 points in a game, scored its first touchdown late  in the third quarter. Kiesau threw a short pass to Tim Hilton, who flipped the  ball to Rucker, who ran 20 yards down the right sideline for his 31st touchdown  of the season. Rucker added the two-point conversion to make it 33-8.  </P> <P> After Vellmure's opening score, Rucker returned the ensuing kickoff 31 yards to  the Glendale 44. The Dynamiters, aided by a 38-yard Rucker run, drove to the  Camarillo 12, but Hector Maya was stopped for no gain on fourth and two and  Camarillo took over on downs.  </P> <P> Five plays later, Campbell ran 77 yards to give the Scorpions a 13-0 lead with  5 minutes 43 seconds to play in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Camarillo took over on the Glendale 28 after a short punt by Bill Tuttle. Seven  plays later, Johnson plunged in from one yard to increase the margin to 19-0  with 1:01 left in the first period.  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Lib Dem surge prompts Major to shift attack: Opinion polls highlight volatility of electorate and set back Labour hopes of decisive lead A SURGE in Liberal Democrat support at the expense of both Labour and the Conservatives last night provoked Mr John Major to turn on the third party in an attempt to recapture the support of wavering Tories. Two opinion polls, highlighting the volatility of the electorate, set back Labour hopes of having taken a decisive lead over the Tories. The polls led Mr Major to accuse Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, of being the 'door keeper to a Labour Britain'. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, launched the final phase of his general election campaign last night with the largest political rally in British post-war history and - in spite of the latest poll results - a confident prediction of victory on April 9. But earlier he implicitly acknowledged the Liberal Democrat threat in arguing that 'Britain needs a change of government if it is to be successful, and the only way to get that is to vote Labour.' As Tory strategists tried to avoid any impression of gloom descending over their campaigning, an NOP poll for today's Independent puts the Conservatives on 37 per cent - two points behind Labour. But Labour's score was three percentage points lower than last week. The Liberal Democrats, in contrast, are up five percentage points over the week at 19 per cent, A Gallup opinion poll in today's Daily Telegraph will come as relief for the Tories, giving them, at 38 per cent, a half a percentage point lead over Labour. But Liberal Democrats are up four points at 20 1/2 per cent. Speaking near Bath, where Mr Chris Patten, the Tory chairman, is defending a majority of 1,412 over the Liberal Democrats, the prime minister warned that Mr Ashdown was 'the Trojan Horse' for a Labour government. He described Lib Dem policies as 'close cousins' of Labour's. A upbeat Mr Ashdown responded by promising that his party would not be swayed from its 'positive' campaigning. Speaking in Cheltenham, he told supporters: 'Your vote is not a protest vote. A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a principled, positive vote - which is why we are gaining ground as each day goes by.' He added: 'Your vote is not a back-door vote for Labour, or for the Tories. A vote for the Liberal Democrats - in Cheltenham, in Hereford, and in dozens of other constituencies up and down the country - is a winning vote for the Liberal Democrats.' Later on ITN, Mr Ashdown deliberately distanced himself from Labour's 'swingeing' tax proposals for higher earners. He said he would 'not be prepared to go along' with a government that proposed a top rate of 50 per cent plus nine per cent National Insurance contributions, as set out by Labour. As Mrs Margaret Thatcher called on Conservatives 'to say that it was our policies which brought Britain from decline to high repute the world over', Tory officials said efforts in the campaign's last week would concentrate on Conservative strengths, including law and order today. Meanwhile, senior Labour strategists voiced confidence that Labour was set to end 13 years of Conservative government. At the Sheffield rally - an extravaganza estimated to cost Pounds 150,000 and attracting 10,000 supporters - Mr Kinnock said: 'In nine days' time Britain is going to have a Labour government.' Private polling evidence indicated that Labour's share of the vote was now soundly established at more than 40 per cent, the strategists said. That was enough to ensure that Mr Kinnock entered Downing Street on April 10. But Mr Kinnock has privately warned senior colleagues that Labour's performance next Thursday is likely to depend on the final 48 hours of the campaign. He has told them that there must be no slackening of the tight discipline under which Labour has so far operated. Last night's rally, designed to demonstrate to the voters Labour's confidence and to spur on party workers during the last week of the campaign, saw Mr Kinnock combine an attack on 13 years of Tory government with his own vision of Labour's prospectus. He said Labour was assured of victory, because 'people know that we will govern as we have campaigned - strongly, positively, looking to the future'. Attacking the widening gulf between rich and poor, he derided Mr Major's recent 'soapbox' performances. 'What is an issue in this election is not soapboxes that people stand on. It's the cardboard boxes that people live in.'

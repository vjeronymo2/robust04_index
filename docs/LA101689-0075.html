			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST;  </P> <P> STANTON;  </P> <P> SORTING OUT WHO'S IN AND OUT OF TOWN  </P> <P> Rand and Leslie Hogan have an Anaheim home address -- in Stanton. They are not  alone in this confusion.  </P> <P> Tucked into Stanton's zigzagging border, which takes about a dozen jogs into  Garden Grove and Anaheim, are residents who have no idea that they are  official, taxpaying residents of Stanton, according to Mike Bouvier, the city's  planning manager.  </P> <P> For convenience's sake, the Postal Service has given these pockets Garden Grove  and Anaheim ZIP codes, even though they are pieces of Stanton. With the ZIP  designations come corresponding Garden Grove or Anaheim mailing addresses,  Bouvier said.  </P> <P> The twists and turns of Stanton's boundaries are the result of what Bouvier  called an "incorporation boom" throughout much of Orange and Los Angeles  counties that began in the 1950s. In the decade or so that followed, the  incorporations and land grabs left many area maps looking like patchwork  quilts, he said.  </P> <P> About three square miles of real estate became Stanton when it incorporated in  1956.  </P> <P> Bad enough that residents are confused. Stanton Mayor Edward L. Allen wanted to  make sure recently that the Census Bureau wasn't. That could cost.  </P> <P> The bureau will soon begin its national census. That survey of age, income,  residency and other statistics is the basis for distribution of billions of  federal and state dollars to local communities. The more residents, the more  money.  </P> <P> "I's a significant issue," said Rand Hogan, a member of Stanton's Community  Affairs Committee, a group of residents and business representatives appointed  by the City Council to help promote participation in the upcoming census.  </P> <P> When a Census Bureau representative recently appeared before the Stanton City  Council to ask cooperation with the head count, Mayor Allen asked how the  bureau intended to sort through the mess created by the city's erratic  boundary. How would the bureau categorize a person who lives and pays taxes in  Stanton, Allen wondered, but whose mailing address is in Anaheim or Garden  Grove?  </P> <P> Fernando Tafoya, the Santa Ana district manager for the Census Bureau, assured  the mayor that the system is designed to handle such circumstances.  </P> <P> Even before census questionnaires are sent to residents, Tafoya said later,  census people canvass communities. Using current city maps, these canvassers  mark the exact geographic location of each residence to pinpoint what housing  is within which city boundary. From this door-to-door survey of "what's  actually on the ground," Tafoya said, the bureau compiles lists that are  cross-referenced to mailing addresses.  </P> <P> "When we mail the questionnaires, they go to the address provided," Tafoya  said, but in the tabulation process, the real city of residence is recorded.  </P> <P> "We have some other pockets" such as the ones in Stanton, he said. "The  system's set up pretty much to take care of them." PEGGY HESKETH  </P></p>

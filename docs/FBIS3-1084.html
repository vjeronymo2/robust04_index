			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bula-Bula [DOMINGO] enters all places armed with  seven eyes and ears. At Sheik Restaurant recently, it saw South  African Professor Andre Tomashaussen, legal adviser to UN  special representative Dr. Aldo Ajello on behalf of the  Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, and Raul Domingos, who  is extremely well known as one of principal figures in the  movement led by Afonso Dhlakama, dining together in rather  subdued light.    They were talking in a friendly manner, like two brothers,  and at times contented smiles came to their faces. At one  point, in the heat of their conversation, Tomashaussen either  forgot -- or perhaps not -- that there were other people in the  restaurant and off he went, loudly warning Raul Domingos to  watch out for the Americans. He reminded Domingos of what had  happened with the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola, UNITA: The Americans had begun with many promises but  had then dropped the organization led by Jonas Savimbi.    We looked around but saw no Americans. There were only some  opposition party militants who have already lost their  "emergent" status and are hoping for some financial aid from  Uncle Sam to get going.    Bula-Bula does not like to listen to conversations in which  it has not been invited to participate, so it withdrew and had a  meal at the bar. Let politicians heed the following advice,  though: You should not make loud comments in restaurants. Or  then, if you wish to, you can talk to the newspapers.  Otherwise, you may bother those in the vicinity or be heard by  Bula-Bula, which is becoming ever more omnipresent.</p>

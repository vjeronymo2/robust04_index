			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful  Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] issued a statement on the  grave situation that has arrived [toraehada] on the Korean  peninsula in which a nuclear war may break out due to the  reckless [mubunbyolhan] war provocation moves of the United  States and the South Korean puppet clique.    The statement issued by the CPRF spokesman:    Due to the reckless war provocation moves of the United  States and the South Korean puppet clique, an extremely grave  [kukhi omjunghan] situation has arrived on the Korean peninsula  in which a nuclear war may break out.    As is well-known, the United States unilaterally reneged on  its agreement to hold the third stage of DPRK-U.S. talks and is  stepping up arms pressure on us.    On 29 March, the U.S. Defense Department deployed 48  launching pads for Patriot missiles and a missile unit of some  400 personnel to South Korea from Texas. In addition, saying  that it will resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise,  which was agreed to be suspended, the United States ordered Carl  Vinson, an atomic aircraft carrier, to depart a naval base in  Yokoska and to deploy near the Korean peninsula; and maintained  a U.S. naval fleet of 30 ships, including two task forces of  aircraft carriers, in advance areas of our waters so they can  reach our area within 24 hours.    The South Korean authorities ruptured the working delegates'  contact for the exchange of special envoys, which was arranged  with much effort, and officially asked the United States to  introduce Patriot missiles, which the whole world rebuffed.  Worse still, it is openly instigating a war by disclosing a new  Northward invasion plan called the New Operation Plan 5027,  which was secret until now.    The CPRF brands aggressive arms buildup and war provocation  moves of the U.S. and South Korean bellicose quarters as a  heinous criminal act to disturb the peace and security of the  Korean peninsula and Asia and plunge the Korean nation into a  new nuclear war holocaust, and strongly denounces this.    The U.S. and South Korean bellicose quarters rave that the  Patriot missiles are so-called preventive weapons and so forth  in an attempt to hide their aggressive intent and to justify the  maneuvers for its arrangement. This is nothing but a foolish  scheme.    Modern war is three-dimensional -- staged in the sky, on the  ground, and in the sea -- attack and defense are not separated.  Patriot missiles are ultra-modern weapons that can also be used  for an attack. Considering the fact that the Patriot missiles  can easily strike any target or object on the Korean peninsula,  which is not that big, it is needless to say that its deployment  is dangerous.    Today, the United States is openly bringing nuclear weapons  into South Korea and scheming to continue nuclear war exercises.  This indicates that it seek solutions to the issue not through  negotiation but through strength, unilaterally reneging on its  promise to refrain from threatening the DPRK with nuclear  weapons, which was stipulated in the DPRK-U.S. joint statement.  Also, the U.S. imperialists are massively bringing modern  warfare equipment into South Korea. This is a very ill-boding  [simsangchianun] military move that can only be seen on the  night before a war.    What should not be overlooked is that the South Korean  ruling bunch is coming out as a shock brigade for an  anti-republic hostile policy of outside forces to crush fellow  countrymen.    The South Korean puppets' frenzied maneuvers to crush fellow  countrymen by continually bringing in U.S. nuclear weapons and  by depending on strength of outside forces are antinational  crimes that can be perpetrated only by the flunkeyist  nation-selling traitors [sadae maeguk yokchokdul] who do not  have even a slight degree of a sense of national independence.  Their maneuvers are an intolerable traitorous act that  unilaterally destroyed the North-South denuclearization  declaration on the agreement not to produce, not to introduce,  and not to possess nuclear weapons -- which reduced the  declaration to wastepaper.    Today DPRK-U.S. talks, which can resolve a series of  problems  including the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through  negotiations, were ruptured [kyollyol] and the nation's  situation has been strained to an extreme pitch. This is because  of flunkeyist nation-selling maneuvers of such crooked  politicians as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who has no independent  idea [chugyon] and philosophy for the nation.    The modern history of our nation illustrates that when the  flunkeyists without the spirit for national independence grasp  power of the nation and abuse it, the nation was reduced to an  arena of competition by outside forces, and the people could not  avoid the situation of homeless, ruined people.    The U.S. imperialists ignited the war of aggression in Korea  in the early 1950's and brought their 15 follower nations, and  as the result of this, the lands of our fatherland were  infringed upon by outside aggressor forces and our people were  enforced to suffer miserable war disasters. This was attributed  to flunkeyist nation-selling acts committed by such a pro-U.S.  flunkeyist nation-seller as Syngman Rhee in South Korea.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam, the most vicious outside  force-reliant flunkeyist nation-seller of all successive ruling  bunches in South Korea, has no real power nor ability.  Nevertheless, he continually and wildly ran amok in an attempt  to interfere in negotiations between us and the United States,  thus laying obstacles to DPRK-U.S. talks.    The Kim Yong-sam group ruptured the working-level contact by  putting forward the exchange of North-South special envoys as a  precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. It is no  secret that this proceeded from insidious political aims to  apply the brakes on DPRK-U.S. talks.    Therefore, to ease the strained situation prevailing in our  country and to seek a precise method for a solution to problems,  the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK must be altered and  such flunkeyist nation-sellers like traitor Kim Yong-sam must be  removed from power in South Korea, and the democratic  reunification forces--independent forces of the nation--who  treasure sovereignty of our fellow countrymen should grasp power.    People from all walks of life in South Korea should oppose  and reject the nuclear war policy and arms buildup maneuvers of  the United States and the South Korean bellicose elements,  including deployment of Patriot missiles, and should more  fiercely raise the flames of anti-U.S., antiwar, antinuclear,  and anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle.    The United States and the South Korean puppets cannot  frighten our people, who are firmly rallied behind the party and  the leader with single-hearted unity, with any military threat,  nor can they crush popular mass-centered socialism of our own  style. They should correctly realize this and should not run  recklessly.    If the bellicose quarters in the United States and South  Korea bring Patriot missiles to South Korea and advance along  the road of war at last in defiance of strong opposition and  rejection of the people at home and abroad, they will have to  pay dearly for this.    [Date] 5 April 1994    Pyongyang</p>

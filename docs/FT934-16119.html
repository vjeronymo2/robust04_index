			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Meeting to seek halt to biodiversity loss GOVERNMENT officials and environmentalists from about 130 countries will meet in Geneva next week to discuss how to implement an international treaty protecting bio-logical diversity. The biodiversity convention, signed at last year's United Nations Earth Summit in Brazil, has been ratified by the required 30 nations and will come into force on December 29. The convention is designed to stem the unprecedented and accelerating loss of the world's estimated 10m plant and animal species and thus its genetic resources. The loss is largely due to destruction of tropical rainforests, which contain roughly half the world's known species. Ms Elizabeth Dickson, senior adviser on biodiversity to the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep), said yesterday that on present trends the world could lose a quarter of all plant species within the next 30 years. Next week's meeting will be discussing immediate action to halt the erosion of biodiversity and secure its sustainable use, as well as how the measures should be financed. Ms Dickson said the main emphasis would be on getting countries to draw up national strategies for biodiversity protection and thereby trying to bring about a change of philosophy. 'Instead of saying 'Let's have a park', governments will look at how incentives built into the economic system encourage people to destroy biodiversity,' she said. The meeting is also expected to touch on the issue of how rich and poor countries should share the benefits from use of genetic resources, which are concentrated in the developing world. This includes technology transfer, granting of access to genetic resources, and the role of intellectual property protection. Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell, executive director of Unep, which sponsors the newly-formed interim secretariat for the convention based in Geneva, said yesterday it was imperative to take action now to stop the alarming loss of biological diversity: 'The richer the diversity of life, the greater the opportunity for medical discovery, economic growth and adaptation to changing circumstances such as global warming. The variety of life is our insurance policy. Our lives depend on it.'</p>

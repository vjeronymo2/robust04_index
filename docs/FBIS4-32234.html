			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 20 (TANJUG)--Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic, French General Pierre-Marie Gallois and  Greek poet and journalist Dimitris Analis condemned here Monday  the biased media reports on the causes and protagonists of the  crisis in former Yugoslavia.    The media war, which is undoubtedly being waged against our  country, had helped dismember former Yugoslavia, Milosevic said  during a talk with Gallois and Analis, who also comes from  France where he currently lives, the presidential office said in  a statement.    Milosevic and his guests, who are on a several-day visit to  Yugoslavia at the invitation of the Yugoslav Government, agreed  that it was a primary moral duty of all conscientious  intellectuals to stand up against such manipulation with public  opinion.    Gallois expressed to President Milosevic his support for the  efforts Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are making  to secure a stable peace in the territory of former Yugoslavia.    The French general, a prominent fighter against fascism in  the Second World War and former chief of the French General  Staff, also expressed his strong disagreement with the policy of  pressures and sanctions of the international community against  the Serbian people.    The resoluteness of Serbia and its citizens to persist in  protecting their legitimate interests set an example to the  countries which strive to equality-based relations among states  and peoples and which are determined to defend their freedom and  independence, the guests from France said.    The statement said Gallois and Analis had promised Milosevic  to continue to openly urge the affirmation of truth on the  crisis in former Yugoslavia.</p>

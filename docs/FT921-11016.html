			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Return to grammar schools signalled MR Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, yesterday signalled the widespread return of grammar schools. Up to one in 10 schools should be free to choose children according to academic ability if parents and governors want it, he told BBC 1's On The Record. He said: 'I have no objection to the re-emergence of grammar schools if that is what people want, if it is adding to the education system for all.' Mr Clarke reinforced the Conservative commitment to a diversity of schools so that parents could chose the type best suited to their child. This meant greater parental choice, not the return of a two-tier system. It would not cause prob-lems if as many as 10 per cent became selective, said Mr Clarke, who believes that nearly all secondary schools would become grant-maintained if the Conservatives won the election. He said he would look favourably on applications from opt-out schools to become grammar schools where plans were well-judged and had parental support. The decision would depend on there not being too many grammar schools in the same area.</p>

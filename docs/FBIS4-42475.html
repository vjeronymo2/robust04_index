			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anne Fulda: "Bosnia: Juppe Asserts His </F> Convictions"]    [Excerpts] Montpellier -- After the big show of support by  the UDF [French Democratic Union] in Lyons on Tuesday [31 May],  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is secretary general of the  RPR [Rally for the Republic], came to Montpellier yesterday to  encourage the "Union" list of the majority. Flanked by Philippe  Vasseur, the general secretary of the Republican Party [PR] and  a deputy for the Pas-de-Calais region; Dominique Baudis; and  Jacques Blanc, president of the regional council of  Languedoc-Roussillon (PR), the minister's speech focused on  three main subjects: the challenge of unemployment, the  challenge of European Union [EU] enlargement, and the challenge  of Yugoslavia.    Alain Juppe devoted the main part of his speech to this last  subject, in which he takes a particular interest, especially  after the attacks he endured recently by the still-born "Europe  Begins in Sarajevo" list. [passage omitted]    Alain Juppe clearly stated his position on the lifting of  the  arms embargo on the Muslims, a measure requested by the  "intellectuals' list" and by [Socialist Party Secretary  General] Michel Rocard. He admitted that "once the  international community had accepted the birth of new  independent states, maintaining this embargo perhaps was a  mistake, or rather a case of injustice." Nevertheless, he  argued, "today the situation is radically different.... In view  of the operational constraints imposed on our forces, the idea  of lifting the arms embargo is simplistic.... I believe it  would be disastrous." The minister hammered the point home:  "If certain countries were to disregard the embargo, Russia  would take the side of the Serbs. The war would spread  immediately and the Bosnians would be condemned to military  defeat even more certainly than before."    Alain Juppe concluded by saying: "Lifting the embargo is  certainly a mobilizing slogan, but it would make things worse.  This is why I am proposing the exact opposite step: Instead of  increasing the number of heavy weapons in Bosnia, we must reduce  their number; instead of giving weapons to those who do not have  as many, we must take away weapons from those who have too  many." He added: "Do those people in France and elsewhere who  are encouraging the fighting to continue realize that they are  likely to cause misfortune to people whose cause they think they  are defending?"</p>

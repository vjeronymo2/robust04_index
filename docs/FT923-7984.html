			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Arts: Mementoes of a wayward collector - Lynn MacRitchie explores the obsessive world of the artist Annette Messager THE long Hayward Gallery tribute to Magritte now over, those still with an appetite for Surrealism may find the last days of the Annette Messager exhibition worth catching. Born in 1943, this French artist is of a generation whose work was informed by radical politics of all kinds, including feminist and psychoanalytic theories. For her, the tools of pop art, such as found objects, comic books and magazine photographs used as a source of images, were a familiar vocabulary of expression. The pop artists were not the first, however, to see the possibilities offered by seemingly innocent objects, and it is to those old masters, the Surrealists, that this intriguing show owes its most profound debt. What Messager shares most obviously with them is a quality of obsession. She presents her work as made by two separate personae: 'Annette Messager' and 'Annette Messager, collector'. As the second, she shows selections from a range of 'collections' gathered at first in her small Paris flat (she now boasts a more spacious studio and a sometimes more expansive style). The 'collections' can be of anything. Two examples in the exhibition are dozens of framed copies of the artist's signature, written over and over again in ever varying styles in an attempt to achieve the perfect specimen, and 'Le bonheur illustre' (Happiness illustrated)', photographs of exotic locations, animals and dreamy couples culled from advertisements and travel brochures and carefully copied in gaudy coloured crayon. Even works which are not signed by Messager the collector display this obsessive gathering of images. 'Peche' (Sin) is made up of dozens of black and white photographs of indeterminate events, which could be love scenes or brutal attacks. Above each image, taken from found sources such as detective, film or sex magazines and splattered over with coloured inks, hangs a further image of a finger, pointing. 'Mes voeux' (My wishes) is a similar collection of images, this time of body parts, noses, mouths, eyes, ears, genitals, photographed separately and individually framed, hung clustered in a circle at the end of long trails of string. Also in the true Surrealist tradition is her recognition of the resonance of objects. One of the most beautiful works in the show is a series of vitrines, each holding a single dress. In one, the filmy white garment enfolds a large close-up photograph of a face, the features magnified, a combination of beauty and horror. In others, the dresses are covered with images, photographs, drawings, words, which seem to encapsulate the mood of the garment, the new worlds that slipping it on might suddenly reveal. A plain black dress is covered with snapshots of lovers kissing, a mauve gauzy gown, the cloth itself patterned with good luck charms (horseshoes, four leafed clovers) is scattered with small drawings of mysterious symbols, each one an embodiment of possibility, including the possibility of disappointment, of loss. Missing from this show is perhaps her most sinister collection, known as 'Les Pensionnaires' (The Lodgers), the corpses of sparrows which she arranges and displays in various ways, always dressed in tiny knitted garments. Here, she echoes Max Ernst and his terrifying bird-headed creatures. In other pieces, such as the 'Petites Effigies' (Little Effigies), arrangements of soft toys, she anticipates Mike Kelley, whose installations featuring toys gleaned from thrift shops and rubbish dumps were recently at the ICA. Compared with Kelley, whose message is strident, urgent, seeking to tear a way through to the child in all of us, to rub our noses in the carefully hidden chaos of our emotions and desires, Messager maintains the Surrealist tradition of mystery. Her works, no matter how disturbing, always have the quality of an elaborate game, even when, as in 'Les effroyables aventures d'Annette Messager truqueuse' (The horrifying adventures of Annette Messager, the trickster) the game is played against herself. In this piece (not in the exhibition), a series of drawings, comic book style, Messager shows herself impersonating the 'heroines' of that icon of the movement, the Marquis de Sade, depicting herself submitting to a variety of tortures and humiliations. This theme is exemplified in the Camden show in 'Les tortures voluntaires' (Voluntary tortures) another collection, this time of photographs of women undergoing various bizarre forms of 'beauty treatments'. These teasing and disturbing works indicate the presence of a very knowing magician, one whose tricks are underpinned with self awareness. The mysteries that the Surrealists loved to conjure are with us still; Messager reminds us that, however random or unlikely the means of their manifestation, their source lies within ourselves. Annette Messager's exhibition 'Telling Tales' is at the Camden Arts Centre until August 30. Arkwright Road, London NW3 6DG; (071) 435 5224</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As we have announced, Presidents Izetbegovic and  Tudjman today agreed to send an identical letter to the  ministers of a liaison group in Geneva that will venture on a  quest tomorrow to restore peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the  two presidents' letter, the following is stated, among other  things:    The delegations of the Bosniaks and the Croats in Vienna  yesterday reached a concrete and detailed agreement on  Bosnia-Herzegovina's internal setup on the basis of the  Washington agreement. This agreement offers a chance for an  overall political solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina on a just  basis. The Bosniaks and Croats do not harbor any aspirations  for foreign property and territories, or the rights of others.  We ask your help in the negotiations with the Serbian side. In  our opinion, we must make it plain to both the Serbian side and  the international public, that you are opposed to:    -- aggression and ethnic cleansing being rewarded,    -- that the conclusions of the London conference are your  conclusions, too, and,    -- that you will neutralize the Serbian military machinery  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia by political and other means if  the Serbs reject a peaceful and reasonable solution.    If we are to accomplish peace we need a firm stance. The  decisions that you will make tomorrow are very important and  will determine the course of international events, especially in  the regions where the Communist regime has collapsed. So reads  the identically-worded letters that Presidents Izetbegovic and  Tudjman sent to the liaison group ministers.</p>

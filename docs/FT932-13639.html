			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dorothy Perkins director quits BURTON, the UK fashion retail group, is expected to announce today that Mr John Coleman, managing director of the Dorothy Perkins chain, has left the company because of differences of management style. But there were rumours within the retail trade last night that Mr Coleman had been asked to leave after Mr John Hoerner, Burton chief executive, discovered he had been in discussions with headhunters about other senior positions - including that of chief executive of the Storehouse group. Storehouse has been without a chief executive since the resignation of Mr David Dworkin, who left in February to join the US department store group Carter Hawley Hale in California. Storehouse has been looking on both sides of the Atlantic for a replacement. Mr Coleman last night refused to make any comment on the speculation. If he were to be appointed to the Storehouse position, it would be a rapid rise for a man who entered the retail trade only 10 years ago. However, in the past two years Mr Coleman has helped make Dorothy Perkins one of Burton's two best-performing divisions, along with the Debenhams department store chain, redefining its image and target customers and introducing a new store format which boosted sales.</p>

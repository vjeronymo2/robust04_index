			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 6 (AFP) -- The reformist Yabloko  faction of the Russian parliament supports gradually lifting UN  sanctions against the former Yugoslavia, a senior member of the  bloc said Wednesday at a news conference.    Deputy Viktor Sheinis, who returned from a visit to the  former Yugoslavia, said his faction considered UN sanctions as  "unfair and one-sided".    "The Serbs are not the only side responsible for the tragic  situation in the former Yugoslavia," Sheinis said, adding that  sanctions on imports of energy and raw materials should be the  first to be lifted.    Sheinis however stressed that "it was in Russia's strategic  and national interests to avoid transforming the Yugoslav crisis  into a pretext for a break in relations between Russia and the  West."    He said that any decision concerning lifting sanctions  should  be taken in conjunction with the United Nations Security Council.    Sheinis was joined on his visit to the former Yugoslavia by  reformist deputy Mark Feygin, a member of Russia's Choice, who  said that his faction had yet to decide on the issue of lifting  sanctions.    Earlier, four hardline deputies denounced UN sanctions as  "genocide of the Serbian people" in the Balkans and said in a  separate news conference that they would vote in favor of  lifting the sanctions during an upcoming debate at the State  Duma (lower house of parliament).    The hardliners who recently visited the Serb enclave of  Krajina, in Croatia, and Serbia called for a military alliance  with the Serbs and said Moscow should set up a naval base off  the Adriatic coast.    "We must recognise on a diplomatic level the republic of  Serb  Krajina and establish a military and political union with that  state," said Deputy Speaker Vladimir Vengerovskiy, a member of  the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party.    "Russia's traditional interests in the region lie with the  Serbs and we must join them in a political and military union,"  said communist deputy Vitaly Sevastionov at a news conference.    The call for a closer alliance with the Serbs came as  Russian  diplomats were attempting to broker a peace agreement between  Croatian officials and Serbs in Krajina.    The delegation said that Serb leaders in Krajina and  Belgrade  were prepared to offer land on the Adriatic coast to Russia for  a naval base and said that up to 200,000 Russians would be  welcome to live there.    "They could be refugees from ethnic conflicts in the former  Soviet Union or military leaders who lost their posts because of  the pull-outs", Sevastionov said.    The deputies said the Serb leaders would make an official  proposal on establishing a naval base in the near future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou </F> and Jacques Delors, president of the European Union Commission,  at Zappion Palace in Athens--live; Delors speaks in French  followed by Greek translation]    [Text] [Papandreou] We apologize for the delay but we had  very little time. Our meeting with the EU [European Union]  Commission was very productive. Following the discussions we  had, we will finalize our program, which will be submitted in  April of this year. I believe that it is a common assessment  that Europe today is at a critical crossroads. The broader  international and European milieu are characterized by  instability, uncertainty, strong political developments, and  bloody conflicts. The European economy is going through an  extended crisis and recession. It is the worst crisis since  World War II. Unemployment has reached unacceptable, explosive  levels with an obvious danger of instability in our social  structure and our democratic norms.    In general terms, this is the framework in which the Greek  presidency is called upon to act during this third presidency,  which our country now assumes. There is a need for more  democratic and effective bonds, less bureaucracy, and greater  decentralization of the decision-making process. There is a  need to give the European Union the appropriate means to allow  it to respond to its internal problems and face the big  international challenges. There is a need to enforce our  cohesiveness and coherence by respecting the national identities  and particularities and the differences of opinion where they  exist.    The European Union is a group of countries where each member  has its own contribution to make to the European construction  process. We need to bring the European Union closer to its  citizens and maintain the model and tradition of the European  society and be in a position to respond to the justified  expectations of our citizens regarding the right to work and  have satisfactory compensation.    The Greek presidency will also seek to use the existing  framework and the capabilities offered. At the level of our  internal development, our primary goal is to contribute to the  efforts to deal with the recession and unemployment and to  attempts to strengthen employment. We will base our efforts on  the initiatives that have been undertaken thus far in this  direction; the development initiatives adopted in Edinburgh and  Copenhagen; the results of last European Council, which was very  important; on the plan to fight unemployment we have adopted; as  well as on the EU Commission's White Paper, especially after its  unanimous acceptance by the 12 EU governments. We place  particular importance on the ideas contained in the White Paper  which, in our opinion, gradually overturn the philosophy of pure  liberalism that prevailed in recent years. These ideas helped  in the formation of a new development model where the local  initiative, corporation, state, representative organizations and  the European Union are called to play an important and  supplementary role.    In foreign relations, we are called upon to complete the  negotiations for the accession of Austria, Norway, Finland and  Sweden by 1 March 1994. It is a very ambitious goal; and if  needed, the negotiations will be speeded up and special summit  meetings will be organized with the four prospective members.    In our presidency, we are also interested in the expansion  of  the European Union to the south. Therefore, we will pursue  pre-accession talks with Cyprus and Malta. We are also  interested in upgrading relations with the other Mediterranean  countries. We will continue the joint action which began during  the Belgian presidency. Yugoslavia occupies the highest  priority. The Middle East issue also demands constructive  support by the European Union. It has already been decided to  hold an international conference in Rodhos during the spring of  1994 for businessmen to identify development projects in the  Middle East. We will also use the possibilities of preventive  diplomacy by contributing to the preparatory conference that  will take place in Paris in the spring in the CSCE framework.    Finally, the Greek presidency will continue the  transatlantic  dialogue beginning with the meeting of 11 January between the  president of the European Council, the presidency of the  European Union commission and the U.S. President. It should be  noted that preelection campaign period for the European  Parliament will begin a few months after the assumption of the  EU presidency. This calls for the systematic implementation,  and in some cases acceleration of our program, given the  importance we all place on these elections. There could be a  need to help the European Parliament in preparing for these  elections.    Furthermore, allow me to say, outside the text, that the  meeting between President Delors, the EU Commission members and  the Greek Government was particularly important and satisfying,  it was indeed productive. I believe that we have identical  views on almost all issues, all points. Our goals are common  and we hope to achieve them. Thank you.    [Delors] Ladies and Gentlemen, I will not use up the time  for the questions. I just want to thank the prime minister and  his government for their welcome and renew once again the  message of friendship to the Greek people which I mentioned  yesterday and say that the Greek people are a full member of the  European family.    I think that this morning we have done a very good job. The  European Union of course has a lot of problems, it has a lot of  members, many partners; and we should set order and priorities.  The White Paper should be followed as a framework for action in  order to help the European economy with unemployment and other  issues, including the European political, economic and monetary  union; the common foreign policy and other issues; the issue of  Yugoslavia; the issue of security in Europe and the  Mediterranean; the Middle East issue; and finally the thoughts  and ideas about a Greater Europe.    The Greek presidency has also added its desire to see  European construction advancing, and I think that this term is  beginning with a lot of confidence. During the summit meeting  in Corfu we will discuss the various issues I mentioned in the  framework of European action at the community level, but also at  a national level. Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Political rift in Lebanon jolts currency The paralysing stand-off between Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanese prime minister, and President Elias Hrawi further jolted confidence in the country's currency yesterday - forcing the central bank to sell an estimated Dollars 30m in US dollars for the second day running in local markets to hold the pound steady. The row between the leaders, ostensibly over who to appoint in a cabinet reshuffle intended to boost Christian representation in government, appeared likely to prompt direct intervention from Syria, which exerts considerable influence in Lebanon. Local commentators said the dispute does not now look resolveable without a wholsale change in Mr Hariri's 19-month-old administration. Mr Hariri, the Sunni businessman appointed prime minister by Mr Hrawi in 1992 to revive confidence in the country after its 17-year civil war, remained ensconced at home yesterday, having 'withdrawn' from his duties at the weekend after the dispute with Mr Hrawi, a Christian, and Mr Nabhi Berri, the Shia speaker of parliament. Both Mr Berri and Mr Hrawi appear to have opposed Mr Hariri's plan to bring into the 30-member cabinet two senior Maronite Christians in a gesture his supporters say was intended to 'enhance internal unity' amid deepening bitterness in the Christian community over Mr Hariri's government style and their perceived political marginalisation. However, neither Mr Hrawi nor Mr Berri approved the men suggested; politicians in Beirut said both wanted a far wider cabinet shake-out than Mr Hariri had proposed, though neither was apparently pressing for the prime minister's resignation. The politicians said the row arose from a more general accusation that Mr Hariri has appointed close aides to critical ministries - to which Mr Hariri's backers have responded by accusing some ministers and other senior political figures of 'hindering' and 'delaying' Mr Hariri's ambitious multi-billion-dollar rebuilding plans for Beirut with their 'private interests'. They also suggested Mr Hariri had not been able to win 'basic' ministerial co-operation with the present cabinet. The row, the most serious yet between Mr Hariri and Mr Hrawi, comes amid a more general souring of the optimism which initially greeted the billionaire businessman's arrival in Beirut. Although the flotation earlier this year of Solidere, the company created to rebuild the city's shattered core, was a success, share distribution has since been delayed and the company this week said it would take at least 'another month' before reconstruction work can begin. Last week, Banque Audi also said in its economic bulletin that growth in the first quarter had slowed and that only a 'huge investment effort' would revive output. Money in the country, the report said, was increasingly being directed into money market placements rather than productive enterprises, partly the result of high interest rates on the Lebanese pound.</p>

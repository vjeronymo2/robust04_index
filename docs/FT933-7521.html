			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report A fluctuating London Metal Exchange COPPER market recovered losses in the afternoon and the three months delivery price closed at Dollars 1,900.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on the day. An early fall below Dollars 1,900 triggered a bout of speculative selling that sent the price to Dollars 1,890. But buyers were encouraged by continuing nearby technical tightness, which held the cash/three months premium at just above Dollars 30 a tonne. The ZINC market firmed by Dollars 9.50 over the day to end after hours trading at Dollars 893.50 a tonne. Traders saw no news behind the rise and said that after several days testing, and holding, support around the Dollars 880-a-tonne mark the market would now probably test the top end of its Dollars 880-Dollars 900 trading range. NICKEL staged a correction to recent lows and three months bounced to Dollars 4,740 before ending at Dollars 4,725 a tonne, up Dollars 55. At the London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE futures finished mostly lower with light profit-taking emerging after the market's recent rapid rise. The November position closed at Dollars 1,212 a tonne, down Dollars 3 on the day and dealers said there was scope for further falls with the market still overbought. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / France clamps down on five Islamist publications France yesterday banned five Islamist publications and detained another 36 people as part of its clampdown on suspected Algerian Moslem fundamentalists. The crackdown is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks in the wake of threatened reprisals against France for the internment of 17 suspected Moslem militants in an army barracks in north-eastern France. The internments followed the deaths of five French citizens in last week's attack on a French embassy building in Algiers. In a demonstration of its tough line, the French interior ministry justified the moved by claiming that the distribution of the publications 'could endanger public order because of their violently anti-western and anti-French tone and the calls for terrorism which they contain'. Paris police said that a further 36 people had been detained during a third successive night of spot-checks on vehicles and pedestrians. Monday night's detentions took to more than 100 the number held for questioning since the police launched their clampdown on Saturday. Some senior Moslem figures expressed fears that the upsurge in violence in Algeria and the crackdown in France could damage the position of the Moslem community in France. 'What we fear is that France will see a terrorist in every Moslem,' said Mr Dalil Boubakeur, head of the Paris Mosque. 'The fragile consensus between the Moslem community and French society could be broken'. Mr Boubakeur criticised the threat of reprisals issued by the Islamic Salvation Army, a militant group linked to the Islamic Salvation Front which is outlawed in Algeria after having been poised to win elections in 1992. 'It would be folly for Moslems to believe there could be any interest or benefit in taking violence to France.' Domestic criticism of the clampdown remained muted, although the opposition Socialist party demanded the centre-right government should expand contacts with moderate Moslems in Algeria. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, argues, however, that there is no choice but to back Algeria's military-led government or see extreme fundamentalists take power in France's former colony. France's hardline approach has demonstrated a rift with diplomatic partners, such as the US, which favour increased dialogue with moderate Moslems. The French foreign ministry has sought to play down the rift, claiming France's western allies shared its concerns and were taking the situation very seriously.</p>

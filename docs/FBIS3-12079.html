			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Julio Amilcar Nuila] </F>   [Text] There is still tense calm here. Many people are  outside the local office of the justice of the peace. Hours of  heavy tension were experienced here. Everything began in the  morning hours, about mid-morning, when people here accused a  U.S. citizen of being presumably linked to gangs that are  stealing babies.    There was no special or legal basis on which to make such an  accusation; however, the rumor was disseminated and the  population united and tried to lynch the woman on the street.  Local authorities intervened and managed to give her refuge at  the local court building. A large number of people surrounded  the building. We must note that they all used children and  teenagers as shields to prevent the public forces from using  greater coercive measures to calm down the people.    The situation worsened by the moment. Everyone was demanding  that U.S. citizen (June Diane Weinstock), 51, come out. She is  an editor for a U.S. magazine who hails from Florida and is  residing in Alaska. The woman said she entered the country  through Huehuetenango, toured El Quiche, arrived in San  Cristobal Verapaz, and was about to board a bus to head for  Coban -- she said she had come to see the beautiful carpets of  the solemn processions that are made here -- but she did not  imagine what was awaiting her.    The situation, I repeat, turned red-hot. I was, from the  very beginning, the first local reporter covering the situation  from the courthouse here at San Cristobal Verapaz. We all tried  to mediate. The volunteer firefighters showed up. They were  attacked as they pushed their way through the mob. The  departmental Red Cross also showed up, and its members were  attacked. The assistant human rights official also tried to  intervene. The crowd listened to no one.    They said they wanted blood and that they would not be  pleased until they saw blood. After trying to mediate, the  police -- in an attempt to calm down the population that started  to smash glass windows and make the situation more violent --  threw a can of tear gas, and this, instead of achieving the calm  that was desired, actually infuriated the mob even more.    The situation turned much more difficult. All of us who were  inside the courthouse gathered in an extremely small room. We  took refuge there while the rest of the building was being  destroyed by the mob. We observed a fire. The fire was already  surrounding the room housing the reporters, Red Cross members,  firefighters, policemen, the assistant human rights official,  the local justice of the peace, and the U.S. citizen who was  being protected in the nearby restroom.    The mob, however, nearly lynched every person inside the  building. We managed to leave, and the U.S. citizen fell into  the hands of the furious mob. The first report indicated that  she was completely massacred. However, when the volunteer  firefighters managed to reenter the building, they realized she  was badly injured but still alive and breathing weakly. She was  naked and her skull was partially destroyed. This was a very  dramatic situation. She was bathed in blood.    The 187th Unit of Volunteer Firefighters took her  immediately  to the regional hospital. We are quite far away from Coban. At  this time we do not know whether the U.S. citizen is alive. Her  prognosis has not yet been disclosed.    The presence of the National Army has been requested since  noon. Regrettably, members of the Army 21st Military Zone showed  up after all this had transpired. San Cristobal Verapaz is  currently under military control.    We want to give you a last-minute report: Another citizen  who is identified only as Luis Miguel -- he is called Mike here  in San Cristobal and resides here -- was called by authorities  of the local justice of the peace to serve as an interpreter and  was apparently seriously beaten up. He is being taken to the  regional [name indistinct] hospital.    The local justice of the peace reported that the residence  of  a U.S. family residing here in San Cristobal has been closely  monitored by the population. Rumor has it that they are also  involved in the stealing of children. The sin then is to be a  U.S. citizen. They have been branded. The Army is currently  headed for that residence to persuade them to evacuate this  place, which is a dangerous place for foreigners.</p>

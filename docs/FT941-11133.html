			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Doubts over Florida legacy I am a beneficiary under the will of a US citizen (resident in the state of Florida) who died in February last year. His assets were held almost entirely in US securities, in a trust. The trustees have told the beneficiaries that the securities have been sold and the cash will soon be distributed. They point out, however, that 57 per cent of the total is long-term capital gains, and the tax liability will be distributed to each beneficiary in proportion. I understand that, as a UK citizen and resident, I am exempt from US tax. Will I be liable for British capital gains tax? On the bare facts given, it looks as though what you will acquire from the trustees (under section 71(1) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992) is a portion of the balance in the trustees' bank account on the day on which you first have 'the exclusive right, subject only to satisfying any outstanding charge, lien or other right of the trustees to resort to the (balance) for payment of duty, taxes, costs or other outgoings, to direct how that (balance) shall be dealt with.' Broadly speaking, you will be liable to CGT only if the rate of exchange on that day differs from the rate on the day of disposal by a sufficient margin, after indexation relief, to bring your total chargeable gains for the year above Pounds 5,800. Ask your tax office for the free booklet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction), which should make the general principles clearer to you. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

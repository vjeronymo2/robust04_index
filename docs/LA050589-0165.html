			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH, KOHL FAIL TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES ON NUCLEAR FORCES  </P> <P> President Bush and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl held a telephone  conversation today but failed to resolve their differences over East-West  negotiations on short-range nuclear forces, White House spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> "It does not appear that a basis for agreement is there, but we'll continue to  discuss it and see," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> He described the 20-minute conversation, initiated by Kohl, as "productive,  cordial, but also direct," using diplomatic language implying that differences  remain.  </P> <P> "I would not characterize it as moving the situation one way or another, except  in terms of understanding" each other's position, he added.  </P> <P> Kohl wants NATO to accept a Soviet proposal for early talks on short-range  nuclear forces -- missiles with a range of less than 300 miles -- but the  United States and Britain say such negotiations should not take place until  there is an agreement to reduce the Warsaw Pact's advantage in conventional  forces.  </P> <P> "There is no change in our position," Fitzwater said. "We still believe early  negotiations" with the Soviet Union on reducing short-range nuclear weapons  "would be a mistake."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the United States would like to resolve the problem before the  NATO summit starts May 29 in Brussels, "but if we can't, it's not the end of  the world."  </P></p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (6): Roads to a better life - Cocoa still dominates agriculture ON the road to Breman Askuma, a small hamlet in the heart of Ghana's cocoa region, a signpost proudly announces that electricity has just arrived in this remote part of the world. Much government and aid agency development work is devoted to improving 'feeder roads' - the dirt tracks, connecting isolated farms to main trunk roads, which are a lifeline to Ghana's 10m farmers. Over the next three years, Ghana's donors will be financing a Dollars 106m project to improve and extend the feeder road network. The deregulation of farm prices - an important plank in the government's economic reforms - also had the welfare of rural communities in mind, as farmers now sell their produce at market prices, instead of controlled ones. And yet the agricultural sector, which dominates the economy (it contributes 41 per cent of gross domestic product) has stubbornly failed to respond to the new price incentives and other structural reforms. Growth rates have averaged only 2.1 per cent a year (below the increase in population) since 1985, compared with rates of about 7.5 per cent in the rest of the economy. The government admitted in a recent economic review that it would be 'a formidable task to raise agricultural output by 3.7 per cent a year' to achieve its objective of accelerated growth. Dr Kwesi Botchwey, the finance minister, blames erratic weather conditions and declining terms of trade for cocoa, Ghana's main commodity export, for agriculture's poor performance. 'When it rains, we have a glut and prices fall. When drought strikes, we have a disaster,' he says. He denies that some of his economic liberalisation policies have harmed farm productivity. Farmers complain, however, that the removal of subsidies for fertilisers, and the spiralling cost of imported agricultural inputs because of the devaluation of the cedi, have placed these vital ingredients beyond their reach. The government prefers instead to focus on promoting stronger links between agriculture and the rest of the economy. The absence of an effective agro-industrial processing capacity, it says, constitutes one of the main missing links in Ghana's quest for sustained agricultural growth and development. And if the agricultural sector is to contribute to the country's export drive, internationally acceptable quality standards, including packaging and product presentation, will have to be implemented. Cocoa, which contributes about 13 per cent of agricultural GDP and 40 per cent of export earnings, will remain of pivotal importance, despite the slump in international cocoa prices and fierce competition from East Asia. Dr KJ Adjei-Maafo, head of the cocoa policy unit at the Castle - the government seat in Accra - says his main objective at a time of plummeting prices is to maintain farmers' incomes, as 60 per cent of the rural population depend on this cash crop. He is doing so by slashing the bloated bureaucracy of the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod). 'The layoffs have not made me a popular man, but they were necessary to stave off the collapse of the industry,' Dr Adjei-Maafo says. Cocobod's farms and chocolate factories have been privatised, and internal marketing opened to private sector competition. The government's target is to put at least 60 per cent of cocoa's market value into farmers' pockets. Yields last season increased by 44 per cent to 405 kg per hectare. This, however, is still only half the yields achieved in neighbouring Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer. Cocobod will remain in charge of cocoa exports, but three trading companies have been licensed to compete with Cocobod over the purchasing of the crop at the farm gate. Competition is expected to be fierce, as Cocobod will pay a takeover fee of 54,000 cedis (Dollars 84) for every ton of cocoa delivered to port. The government has set the new producer price for the 1993-94 season at 308,000 cedis (Dollars 513) a ton, a 19.4 per cent increase over the previous season. Traders are promising to reimburse farmers quickly. Under the old regime, producers often waited for months for Cocobod to pay up. The reforms have also revived the moribund co-operative movement in Ghana. Over 200,000 farmers have joined together to form the Ghana Co-operative Marketing Association. Co-op members are both nervous and excited at the challenges ahead. They have been busy obtaining bank loans to finance their start-up costs, and have approached aid agencies for help. 'We will only know how good the business is after the first season,' says Mr Kojo Danso-Mensah at the Co-op's ramshackle offices above a chicken farming outlet in the heart of Accra. Ghana's efforts to give its farmers a better deal have led to a great deal of smuggling from the Ivory Coast, where the government has slashed its cocoa purchasing prices to remain competitive. The 'contamination' of Ghana's premium quality cocoa with its neighbour's inferior stuff is viewed with understandable apprehension. Smugglers who are caught are being charged with 'economic sabotage' - a crime punishable by life imprisonment. The government also hopes to attract foreign investment in oil palm, cotton, rubber and tobacco. It particularly wants oil palm to be processed in Ghana, to export a greater value added product. Dr Botchwey says he is prepared to consider incentives to foreign manufacturers. Forestry is another sector which the government wants to industrialise. The most common sight on Ghana's rural roads at present are broken down articulated trucks, leaning precipitously on the side of the road where axle shafts have buckled under the weight of enormous tree trunks. The government and ecologists are worried about the rapid depletion of Ghana's tropical hardwood forests, and a ban on all exports of raw logs has been decreed, beginning in 1994. From that date, all timber exports will have to be processed into sawn wood or furniture parts. (Several operators in the industry doubt whether the ban will be enforced. There are huge vested interests in the logging business.) In addition, Ghana has set aside 16 per cent of its total land area to permanent forest and wildlife reserves. Outside these areas, the government rations logging licences. But the population explosion, with the accompanying demand for food and fuel, has led to the removal of most of the non-reserved forest. Moreover, the practice of selective logging, which concentrates on a few choice species, has also contributed to deforestation and degradation. Furniture manufacturers complain that Aphromosia, the prized white teak, has become extinct in Ghana.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN GROUP MAY BUY STAKE IN MARINA DEL REY LEASEHOLD  </P> <P> A secretive group of foreign investors, using a major Paris bank, a Luxembourg  holding company, a Cayman Islands tax shelter and a series of California  corporations, is buying into Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> Unlike many of the highly publicized foreign purchases of private Southern  California real estate, this transaction involves investment in public land.  The marina is owned by Los Angeles County, and businesses there operate on  long-term leases approved by the county.  </P> <P> Although county officials who manage the marina do not know the identity, or  even the nationality, of the investors, they have already given preliminary  approval to the $21.8-million deal after an examination of details that did not  extend beyond California.  </P> <P> Supervisors to Decide  </P> <P> Early this month, the County Board of Supervisors will be asked to ratify the  complex deal, which would give the overseas investors a major stake in leases  on three hotels, two apartment complexes, restaurants, tourist facilities, a  shopping center, an office building and hundreds of boat slips at the marina.  </P> <P> The supervisors must approve any substantial change in the leases, including  the partnerships that control them.  </P> <P> County officials say there has been foreign investment in Marina del Rey  before, but never on this scale.  </P> <P> The marina's largest leaseholder, Abraham M. Lurie, is selling a 49.9% interest  in leases on 10 marina properties to foreign investors for $21.8 million.  </P> <P> Lurie, president and owner of Real Property Management, is a major real estate  investor and contributor to political campaigns. He and his companies donated  $27,350 to the campaigns of four of the five county supervisors from 1985  through 1988.  </P> <P> Lurie said he does not know the identity and nationality of the foreign  investors who are becoming general partners in his marina ventures.  </P> <P> "I have no way of knowing who the investors are now and if there is any change  in investors I have no way of knowing that either," he said. "I assume the  identity is not one particular nationality. It could be a number of them. They  are not U.S. residents."  </P> <P> The deal spans four countries -- the United States; the Cayman Islands, a  cluster of Caribbean islands with tax laws favorable to overseas investors;  Luxembourg, a small duchy in Europe with incorporation laws that require  minimal disclosure; and France. It involves a group of new corporations, a  holding company, a multinational bank -- Banque Indo Suez -- and investors who  value their privacy.  </P> <P> "They could be Saudi Arabians. They could be French. They could be Swiss,"  Lurie said. "They could be anyone who is a customer who is checked by Banque  Indo Suez. What they could not be is a U.S. resident."  </P> <P> The 10 leases cover the Marina del Rey Hotel, the Marina Beach Hotel, the  Marina International Hotel, the Islander Marina and Admiralty Apartments, the  Marina Beach Shopping Center, Real Property Management's offices, Fisherman's  Village and Pier 44. A total of 841 boat slips are included.  </P> <P> Lurie said he intends to use the proceeds from the deal to pay off loans, make  capital improvements and begin redeveloping some of the parcels involved in the  transaction. He also is taking on new partners to build a nine-story, 300-room  hotel, to be known as the Marina Plaza, on a long-vacant 3.7-acre site in the  marina.  </P> <P> Taken together, the Marina Plaza site and the 10 properties involved in the  transaction represent 16% of Marina del Rey's land area and provided the county  with $3.35 million in rental income last year. That was 20% of the marina's  overall rental revenue.  </P> <P> Approval Recommended  </P> <P> After a lengthy hearing, the county's Small Craft Harbor Commission, an  advisory group, voted 3-1 earlier this month to recommend that the supervisors,  at their Aug. 8 meeting, approve the changes in the lease partners.  </P> <P> The lone dissenter, Century City attorney Herbert J. Strickstein, objected on  grounds that the staff of the county's Department of Beaches and Harbors has  not supplied enough information on whether Lurie will have to pay a transfer  fee to the county.  </P> <P> Strickstein said that he has been concerned about "foreign investors coming in  and eventually owning the marina."  </P> <P> The terms of the lease require the county to approve changes in the ownership  of a leasehold if, in Strickstein's words, "a person is financially responsible  and their credit is good."  </P> <P> Strickstein acknowledged, however, that county officials do not know who the  new investors are.  </P> <P> "Under terms of the lease there is not a lot we can know," Strickstein said. "I  don't know what country or where they come from."  </P> <P> No Need to Know  </P> <P> "We just don't feel a need to know that," said Eric Bourdon, assistant director  of the Beaches and Harbors Department.  </P> <P> County lease specialist Dennis Heitmann, who works for Bourdon, said he had  limited his inquiries to the 10 new California corporations that were set up  for the transaction. The new companies are all headed by the same person,  Charles E. Wallace, and all share the same Century City office.  </P> <P> In his report to the Small Craft Harbor Commission, Heitmann described Wallace  as a certified public accountant "with a strong background in corporate finance  and management."  </P> <P> Wallace, however, said that he is not a CPA. He said he has no investment of  his own in any of the corporations and that he, too, does not know the identity  or nationality of the foreign investors.  </P> <P> Scope Unknown  </P> <P> "The $22 million is coming from the Banque Indo Suez and their clients," he  said. "I honestly don't know the scope of the group."  </P> <P> Nine of the new companies are acquiring varying percentage interests in Marina  International Properties Ltd., the company headed by Lurie, which holds the  marina leases. The 10th company is involved with the Marina Plaza hotel  project. All 10 are owned by Marina Enterprises International Ltd., which is  based in the Cayman Islands.  </P> <P> The Cayman Islands corporation, in turn, is owned entirely by North American  Real Estate Holding, which is based in Luxembourg.  </P> <P> And the money for the investments is being raised from customers of Banque Indo  Suez, a large Paris-based multinational bank, whose name stems from its role in  financing construction of the Suez Canal, which opened in 1869.  </P> <P> Reduce Taxes  </P> <P> An attorney for the state Franchise Tax Board in Sacramento, who asked not to  be identified, said the complex corporate structure will reduce taxes and  protect the anonymity of the investors.  </P> <P> Chicago attorney Cornelius J. Sullivan explained the structure to the Small  Craft Harbor Commission at its July 12 meeting. He said it would allow profits  from the sale of parts of the investment to be sent to the Cayman Islands  without paying a 30% U.S. withholding tax. "That is perfectly legitimate, legal  tax planning under our U.S. laws," he said.  </P> <P> Lurie said he has never met the actual investors and has negotiated only with  Sullivan. He said the identity of the investors will be known by the Banque  Indo Suez.  </P> <P> County officials said they did not ask for information on the identity of the  investors, although lease specialist Heitmann said Sullivan offered to give the  county a letter stating that "the money involved was not derived from illegal  sources."  </P> <P> "We think we have gone far enough," said Bourdon of the Beaches and Harbors  Department. "We are assured that the county is protected."  </P></p>

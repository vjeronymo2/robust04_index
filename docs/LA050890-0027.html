			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON IRVING BRANCH LIBRARY  </P> <P> In response to your April 27 editorial, "The Little Library That Could":  </P> <P> Do we need an expensive community center? No. Do we need a larger, full-service  library? Yes.  </P> <P> The option of expanding the current Washington Irving branch library was  somehow overlooked by your staff. A large number in our community have voiced  their desire to retain the current library facility and expand it to meet the  required service standards. Expansion is the only clear solution.  </P> <P> There has been no convincing argument made in support of relocation. If there  is a compelling argument to be made for relocation, make it. But next time,  make it before you advocate the misuse of public monies or the abandonment of a  64-year-old library.  </P> <P> PAUL PRATT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

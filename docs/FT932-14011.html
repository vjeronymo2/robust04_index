			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour faces Maastricht turmoil LABOUR WAS last night scrambling to sustain its hopes of forcing the government to embrace Maastricht's social chapter after a motion censuring Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, was accepted for early debate. The move came as Lord Healey, the former Labour chancellor, said it was 'quite possible' the House of Lords could vote for a Maastricht referendum. Lord Healey said government manoeuvrings had made him more inclined to vote for a referendum. 'A lot of people . . in the Lords . . will be tempted to vote for a referendum if the government is denying the House of Commons the right to decide on a major issue,' he said. With the tortuous line-by-line consideration of the Maastricht bill entering its final lap, MPs are set to start their own referendum debate later today after the motion of censure has been considered. With government and Labour front benches opposed to the idea, there seems to be no prospect that MPs will vote for a referendum to be held. But with feelings running high, the debate could provide a dress-rehearsal for its Lords counterpart, where the outcome may be less clear-cut. Although yesterday's motion of censure was triggered by MPs' disgruntlement at Mr Morris's decision not to allow a vote on the amendment widely thought to have the best chance of cornering the government on the social chapter, Labour has been forced on the defensive by predictions that it might actually lessen the chances of such a vote. If the motion were heavily defeated it could suggest MPs were content with Mr Morris's ruling, weakening the argument for voting on the amendment during the report stage. Labour sought to underline its view that the motion of censure was counter-productive by arguing there could not be a vote on the amendment - known as amendment 27 - before the report stage even if the motion were carried. Its remarks came as the government said it would accept another Labour amendment - known as new clause 74 - thought by some to give Labour an outside chance of achieving its aims. Labour will oppose the motion of censure, the first such motion to be debated for 21 years, and so far signed by 64 MPs including three Tory Euro-sceptics; Mr Richard Shepherd, Mr Roger Knapman and Sir Richard Body. Mr John Major will use a speech to the Conservative Group for Europe tomorrow to spell out the UK's positive vision for the EC. His argument is that by moving to shape the agenda for the next inter-governmental conference in 1996 at an early stage, the UK can avoid the sort of difficulties it found over the Maastricht treaty.</p>

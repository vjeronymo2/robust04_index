Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports that the terrorist, who wielded  a Galil rifle and a copy of the Koran, called out God Is Great  and fired at the troops. They fired back, critically wounding  the assailant. Army and Border Police troops summoned to the  site cordoned it off and launched an investigation.    Three armed fugitives, members of the Fatah Hawks, were  captured in an undercover unit operation in Gaza's al-Shaykh  Radwan neighborhood last night. When captured, the fugitives  had a Carl Gustav submachine gun and two handguns in their  possession. Their detention was followed by riots in the  neighborhood. IDF troops detained eight local residents who  tried to prevent the arrests.</p>

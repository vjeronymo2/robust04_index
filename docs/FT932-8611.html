			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Wallenberg group tumbles into the red INVESTOR, the Wallenberg family's key holding company, plunged heavily into the red in the first quarter following a worse performance from Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned vehicle and aerospace unit, and a lack of capital gains. The consolidated loss after financial items amounted to SKr542m (Dollars 73.8m), compared with a profit of SKr1.15bn in the same 1992 quarter. The value of the group's investment portfolio remained virtually unchanged from the year-end at SKr23.2bn - failing to keep pace with the stock market, which rose by 9 per cent over the same period. Investor said last year's result benefited from SKr1.31bn in capital gains, whereas there had been no share sales in the first three months of 1993. But it also noted a significant downturn at Saab-Scania and said the company was set to report a loss after financial items in 1993 because of adverse market conditions. Saab-Scania made a loss of SKr92m during the quarter, against a SKr211m profit in the same 1992 period, as sales fell to SKr6.2bn from SKr6.8bn. Investor said demand for Saab-Scania's main commercial products, trucks and aircraft, had fallen further and was expected to remain weak during the rest of 1993. 'We see no recovery this year,' said Mr Lars Kylberg, Saab-Scania chief executive. A particular casualty of the downturn has been Scania Trucks &amp; Buses, where earnings have fallen sharply.</p>

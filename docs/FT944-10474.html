			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / 'Go West]' echoes in Barclays' ears: Lessons a UK bank has learnt from a promiscuous foray into the US These days, it seems every European bank wants to be in the US investment banking business. Bank executives from Deutsche Bank, Credit Lyonnais and Union Bank of Switzerland, among others have talked this year about growing their trading and deal-making skills to complement their lending and foreign exchange businesses in the US. Barclays is no exception. After a disastrous foray into corners of the US financial market in the 1980s, the UK bank may have been pulling in its horns recently - earlier this week, for instance, it said it was in talks to sell its profitable US asset-based lending business. But it is now also focusing on growth. No bank with pretensions to serving big companies can afford not to have a substantial presence in New York, according to Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays chief executive. 'The investment banking business internationally demands dollar capability,' he said. Also, techniques and skills developed in the US derivative and other financial markets are a driving force around the world. 'New York is the centre of imagination and ideas in the (capital) markets,' said Mr Taylor. With a number of foreign banks pursuing the same goal - and some of the US's own commercial banks moving into investment banking - is there enough business, let alone enough skilled traders and deal-makers, to go around? Like other foreign and US institutions, Barclays lent liberally to US companies at low margins during the 1980s, hoping to forge relationships which would yield more profitable business later. It didn't work. Mr Taylor now refers to that era as one of 'extreme promiscuity'. 'Nobody built any particular loyalty or any particular strength.' There were also bad credit judgments. Last year, Barclays took a Pounds 346m charge against its US loans, Pounds 1bn of which were classified as non-performing at the end of 1993. Like others, it was caught out by excessive property lending. Now, the bank is busy cutting the number of companies it services in the US. 'Banks are getting back to the idea of having fewer and deeper relationships,' said Mr Taylor. At the start of 1993, Barclays did business with 900 US companies: that number has been cut to around 200. It has also pulled out of a range of retail or small business finance businesses entered during the 1980s. Besides the asset finance company, virtually the only one left is Barclays American Mortgage, which services mortgage loans. In the past three years, these mistakes - and charges for shedding excessive infrastructure - have cost the bank Pounds 1.1bn. The continuing part of its business, by comparison, made profits of Pounds 168m last year. Barclays is now trying to graft an investment banking business on to what is left. In this effort, it has some things working in its favour. Its name still scores high marks for recognition in the US and its reputation has barely been tarnished by problems in the UK. Mr Taylor calls this the 'halo effect'. The era of expansionism has left the bank with a base of customers on which it can build. 'However expensive an entry it was, we have got the relationships,' said Mr Taylor. It was one of six banks, and the only non-US one, which committed Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m) each to back the (ultimately unsuccessful) bid for Paramount Communications by QVC. Also this year it co-arranged a Dollars 325m financing to back a merger of two cellular companies to form Western Wireless. Taylor calls commitments like that to QVC 'the strategic use of the (bank's) balance sheet' - providing the bridging finance or underwriting to support a big corporate transaction. In future, he says, Barclays plans to use its capital in this way, rather than take on loan assets. For this approach to work, Barclays will have to avoid the sort of temptations which led it astray before. Mr Taylor seems wary of getting drawn into new areas such as US equities. 'The market is very well supplied with strong players at the moment.' The bank will also have to rebuild morale and management in the US after years of upheaval. That process may not be smooth: while Mr Richard Webb, head of the US bank, has handled the clean-up smoothly, the two joint-heads of the investment banking business in New York - Mr John Sutherland and Mr Malcolm LeMay - have left in recent months. Mr Taylor earlier this year professed himself happy with the US management. But he added: 'The challenge for Barclays in managing its US operations is how you move that management group over the next few years when you're coming out of a turnround phase into a development phase.'</p>

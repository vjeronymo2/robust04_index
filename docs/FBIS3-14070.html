To avenge the continuing Zionist crimes in Palestine; in  reply to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre; to vindicate the  souls of our people's martyrs; to confirm that direct clashes  with enemy troops are the way to defeat the occupation troops  and the Zionist expansionist scheme; because the heroic  mujahidin and revolutionaries believe armed struggle is the only  possible way to liberate Palestine and other occupied Arab  territories and defeat the liquidatory plan promoted by the  Tunis-headquartered PLO leadership as enshrined in the  Gaza-Jericho accord; and to expose the resolutions of the UN  Security Council, which has turned into a pliable tool in the  hands of the United States and the Zionist enemy, one of our  units operating behind enemy lines laid an ambush for enemy  patrols in the al-'Ayshiyah-al-Rayhan mountainous area.    At 1200 on Monday, 21 March 1994, our heroic fighters opened  fire on a Zionist patrol. As usual, the enemy attempted to  underestimate its losses. However, it later admitted that two  of its soldiers were killed.    In view of the immense losses sustained by the enemy, the  Zionist aggression troops, in cooperation with the agent Lahd  troops, poured their terrorist firepower on the heads of  Lebanese and Palestinian civilians, targeting schools, markets,  and residential neighborhoods.    While underscoring the importance of stepping up armed  struggle, and while persisting with this jihad course, we, in  the PFLP-GC [Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command], believe the best reply to the  enemy's massacres; that is, protecting our people against its  terrorism, is only achievable when the fire of the blessed  intifadah is fuelled, and when the course of jihad and armed  struggle is nurtured.    We would like to address the following questions to all  those  engaged in bargaining: What do you call the current shelling  and killing of civilians? Is not the shelling of al-Nabatiyah,  Sidon, and 'Ayn al-Hulwah the epitome of terrorism?    Our open war against the Zionist enemy and the mujahidin  attacks are the resistance approach our people have chosen as a  way to liberate land and man.    We will apprise you of any new developments or details.    It is a revolution until the liberation of land and man.    [Signed] The PFLP-GC    [Dated] 22 March 1994</p>

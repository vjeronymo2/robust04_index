			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) The draw of the Chicago and Northwestern railroad bridge, Mile 151.2, at Pekin, Illinois, is operated by a remote operator located at the Chicago and Northwestern offices in Chicago, Illinois, as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The draw is normally maintained in the fully open position, displaying green mid-channel lights to indicate that the span is fully open. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The draw is equipped with the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A radiotelephone link direct to the remote operator; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A horn for sound signals; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Eight high intensity amber warning lights, oriented upstream and downstream, with two secured to the uppermost chord and two secured to the lowermost chord of the drawspan; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A radar antenna on the lower portion of the drawspan capable of scanning one mile upstream and one mile downstream; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Infrared scanners located on the upstream and downstream ends of the channel span piers, to detect vessels or other obstructions under the bridge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The remote operator shall maintain a radiotelephone watch for mariners to establish contact as they approach the bridge to ensure that the draw is open or that it remains open until passage is complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When a train approaches the bridge and the draw is in the open position, the remote operator initiates a ten minute warning period before closing the bridge. During this warning period, the amber lights begin flashing and a signal of four short blasts sounds on a horn. The four-blast signal will repeat after a five second interval. A synthesized-voice message is broadcast over the radiotelephone as follows: ``The Chicago and Northwestern railroad bridge at Mile 151.2, Illinois River, will close to navigation in ten minutes.'' The announcement is repeated every two minutes, counting down the time remaining until closure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) At the end of the ten minute warning period, the remote bridge operator scans under the bridge using infrared detectors and the upstream and downstream approaches to the bridge using radar to determine whether any vessels are under or are approaching the bridge. If any vessels are under or are approaching the bridge within one mile as determined by infrared or radar scanning or by a radiotelephone response, the remote operator shall not close the bridge until the vessel or vessels have cleared the bridge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If no vessels are under or approaching the bridge, the mid-channel navigation lights will change from green to red, the horn signal of four short blasts will sound, twice, and the radiotelephone message will change to: ``The Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Bridge at Mile 151.2, Illinois River, is closed to navigation.'' The message will repeat every two minutes and the amber lights will continue to flash until the bridge is fully reopened. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) If the infrared scanners detect a vessel or other obstruction under the bridge before the drawspan is fully lowered and locked, the closing sequence is stopped, automatically, and the drawspan is raised to its fully open position until the channel is clear. When obstruction has cleared the navigation span, the remote operator confirms that the channel is clear, and reinitiates the ten-minute warning cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) After the train has cleared the bridge, the remote operator initiates the lift span raising cycle. When the draw is raised to its full height and locked in place, the flashing lights stop and the mid-channel navigation lights change from red to green. The synthesized voice announcement broadcasts at two minute intervals for ten minutes that the bridge is reopened to navigation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Frank M.

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FCC UPHOLDS 24-HOUR-A-DAY BAN ON 'INDECENT' BROADCASTS;  </P> <P> LAW: THE COMMISSION'S UNANIMOUS RULING FINDS THE PROHIBITION CONSTITUTIONAL.  RESTRICTING SUCH PROGRAMMING TO SPECIFIC TIMES AND LOCK BOXES ARE INSUFFICIENT  TO PROTECT CHILDREN, THE PANEL SAYS.  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission ruled Thursday that a 24-hour-a-day ban  on "indecent" radio and television broadcasts meets constitutional standards  and does not violate free-speech provisions of the First Amendment.  </P> <P> A unanimous five-member commission said that its ruling was based on its  findings that children -- whom it now defines as 17 or younger -- "are in the  broadcast audience for both radio and television at all times of day and  night."  </P> <P> The commission said that alternatives such as restricting potentially  "indecent" programming to specific times and mechanical restrictions, such as  lock boxes, "are insufficient to protect them from exposure to harmful indecent  programming."  </P> <P> The commission issued its regulations for the ban after Congress mandated a  24-hour prohibition on the broadcast of "indecent" programs in 1988. The  regulations were stayed in January, 1989, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia pending a review of their constitutionality.  </P> <P> The FCC reviewed Arbitron data for radio and television to determine whether  children remain in the late-night viewing audience. In reaching its  conclusions, the commission staff also relied on a 1988 Supreme Court  "dial-a-porn" ruling, in which the court held that indecent speech may be  regulated if it promotes a "compelling" government interest and is "narrowly  tailored" to serve that interest.  </P> <P> In its action Thursday, the commission approved a staff report that concluded  that the congressionally mandated prohibition "is a sufficiently narrow means  of preventing access to indecent broadcasts by children."  </P> <P> FCC chief counsel Robert Pettit said that because children are in the broadcast  audience in the middle of the night as well as the daytime, it makes it  difficult to target programming into specific time periods.  </P> <P> The commission report now goes to the appeals court, which is expected to  schedule oral arguments as part of a broader challenge to the prohibition.  </P> <P> As expected, the FCC action drew swift criticism from broadcasters and others  involved in the court challenge.  </P> <P> "The courts have made it clear that a 24-hour ban on constitutionally protected  speech is contrary to the First Amendment," said Edward O. Fritts, president of  the National Assn. of Broadcasters. "We are disappointed that the FCC, by its  action today, ignores this judicial precedent and the record in its support  developed in this proceeding."  </P> <P> Last month, the association issued a statement of principles for radio and  television in which it urged broadcasters to avoid programming that "panders to  prurient or morbid interests."  </P> <P> The broadcasters are among 17 groups who have challenged the blanket indecency  broadcast prohibitions in court. The unusual coalition of challengers includes  CBS, NBC, ABC and the Public Broadcasting Service, the Motion Picture Assn. of  America, the Recording Industry Assn. of America, Action for Children's  Television, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Reporters Committee for  Freedom of the Press.  </P> <P> Timothy B. Dyk, lead counsel for the coalition, which is challenging the  constitutionality of a blanket ban, said Thursday that the coalition firmly  believes that "parents should be making the choices and not the government."  </P> <P> The FCC said it was defining children as 17 or younger to be consistent with  numerous state regulations, such as those that limit the sale of pornographic  materials to minors.  </P> <P> "What we do will pass Constitutional muster," said Commissioner Ervin S.  Duggan, who added that parents have to be "superhuman" to monitor their  children.  </P> <P> Duggan said that many parents today find their homes "alien territories"  invaded by value systems and information that they find abhorrent. "Parents  need the support of the society and culture. They are not enemies of the  Constitution. They are people like you and me. We owe some decent concern to  the upset and anguish they are expressing."  </P> <P> The commission said it has received 92,500 letters dealing with this issue,  88,000 favoring the ban and 4,500 opposing it.  </P> <P> Until a final court ruling, the FCC continues to have enforcement authority  over broadcasts that occur during daytime hours, but cannot take action against  alleged indecent broadcasts that occur after 8 p.m. until the appeals court  ruling. According to its staff, the commission receives many more complaints  about radio broadcasts than television.  </P> <P> FCC officials refused to speculate on what effect the 24-hour ban might have on  radio and television if it is upheld by the courts, saying that each case will  be considered separately.  </P> <P> The FCC, for purposes of broadcasting, has defined indecency as "language that  describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community  standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs."  </P> <P> In 1988, the Supreme Court upheld the commission's definition of indecency as  well as its authority to restrict those broadcasts to a time of day when is was  unlikely that children would be in the broadcast audience. The commission  concluded that such programming could not be broadcast until after midnight,  but the appeals court ordered the commission to conduct a more thorough  inquiry.  </P> <P> Before the commission could launch its inquiry, Congress passed legislation for  a 24-hour blanket ban on "indecent" broadcasts. The commission adopted a rule  on the 24-hour ban, but the appeals court stayed implementation of the ban  pending a review of its constitutionality. At the same time, the court agreed  to allow the commission time to compile a record supporting the 24-hour ban.  </P> <P> The official commission report is expected to be made public shortly.  </P></p>

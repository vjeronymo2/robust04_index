			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Ireland's domestic issues dominate Ms Olive Braiden, a Fianna Fail candidate for the four-seat Dublin constituency, sums up the general level of interest in Europe among Ireland's 2.6m voters. Sipping a bowl of hot potato soup in a cafe in a south Dublin shopping centre, after passing a bitterly cold morning shaking hands and chatting with shoppers, she says, 'I am absolutely appalled at how little people know about European affairs'. Most of the 54 candidates contesting the 15 Irish seats are discovering that domestic issues such as taxation and unemployment are of more concern to the electorate than European affairs. At the Dublin bookmakers, Ireland's performance in next month's World Cup is attracting considerably more attention than the odds on Ireland's Euro-candidates. This indifference comes in spite of the large amounts of EU funding flowing to Ireland. The country's diplomats in Brussels are so effective in lobbying for funds that one EU official gives them the collective appellation 'Ireland Inc'. Up to the end of the decade, Ireland is due to receive IPounds 6.2bn (Pounds 6.08bn) in EU structural and cohesion funds from the EU, about 9 per cent of total payments. Per head of the population this is significantly more than will be obtained by Greece and Portugal. Most Irish people derive their favourable view of Europe from the image of Brussels as a cash cow to be milked thoroughly and regularly. In the referendum on Maastricht in June 1992 the electorate voted by a majority of more than two to one in favour of the treaty on European union. Nevertheless, according to a random poll conducted by one of the Labour candidates a fortnight ago, only 2 per cent of constituents can name their local sitting MEPs. On the Dublin campaign trail, Ms Braiden has been canvassing for the past 11 weeks, assisted by an enthusiastic crowd of friends and relatives. They have already seen Ms Braiden's brother-in-law, Mr Ray MacSharry, successfully climb the Euro-ladder, first as an MEP and then as the Commissioner for agriculture in Brussels. Reflecting how constituents are mainly concerned by national issues, Ms Braiden says, 'It depends on what part of Dublin you are in. Here in the wealthier southside, people are concerned about property tax. On the northside, where unemployment can be as high as 75 per cent in some neighbourhoods, people just want to know what is going to be done about jobs.' For the European elections, Ireland is divided into four constituencies. Three of them - Dublin, Leinster, Munster - have four seats each. Connacht-Ulster has three. As in the country's general elections, a single transferable vote system is used. The Fianna Fail party of prime minister Albert Reynolds has six outgoing MEPs. Its junior partner in the coalition government, Labour, has just one. Labour in particular, will be hard-pressed to repeat its performance of the 1992 general elections when it more than doubled its share of the vote from 9.5 per cent to over 20 per cent. Judging from recent opinion polls, Fianna Fail is likely to emerge with five to seven seats, Labour with none to two and the opposition Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats (PDs) with four or five and one respectively.</p>

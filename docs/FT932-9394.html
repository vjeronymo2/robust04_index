			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Path of peseta pleases exporters THE PROSPECT of a peseta devaluation has had Spain's business leaders, especially exporters, on the edge of their seats for weeks. 'I'm counting on it,' said Mr Pedro Ballve, chairman of the biggest processed meats group, Campofrio, a few days ago. 'It's desperately necessary. We need an exchange rate that reflects the true wealth of our country.' In the Basque country, industrialists, most of whom export, had been lobbying for a devaluation for weeks. 'A devaluation would have a minimal effect on inflation,' said Mr Enrique Portacarrero, head of a regional employers' confederation. 'The effect on import prices will be minimal because the recession has cut demand so much.' In all, the peseta has fallen about 20 per cent against the D-Mark since last autumn. The apparent inability to find a parity within the European Monetary System is an embarrassment to the government but it has been a boon to business as the country has slipped into recession. Recent official figures show that Spanish exports, which grew more slowly than imports for most of the 1980s, have suddenly taken off since last autumn. In the first quarter of this year exports rose 12.7 per cent, while imports fell 6 per cent. In the six months to the end of March, exports grew 5.5 per cent while imports fell 6.5 per cent. 'The only good economic news we have had in the last year has been export growth,' says Mr Ballve. But while yesterday's devaluation may further quicken export growth, some economists worry that unless wage rises slow, the competitive effect may be lost. 'It was probably not a good idea to devalue before this year's wage round has been completed,' said one Madrid banker. 'The settlements are coming in at above 6 per cent, which is too high.' The decision to devalue the peseta is a result of the country's inability to develop a competitive exporting industry and its traditional reliance on tourism to cover its large trade deficit. That pattern was broken by the economic boom after the country joined the European Community in 1986. It triggered a massive influx of imports, which last year resulted in a current account deficit worth 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Savings in Spain are low and Madrid has to attract foreign funds to cover that deficit and analysts said yesterday the devaluation would help reassure foreign markets that the peseta would now stabilise.</p>

Martin  said.  </P> <P> The fire at the end of a cul-de-sac at 1400 Vista Del Mar Drive sent clouds of  heavy black smoke billowing over the neighborhood. Thirty firefighters from  Fullerton and Buena Park spent 1 1/2 hours containing the blaze, Martin said.  </P> <P> Besides the children, all of whom are school age, the Ommanneys are also  guardians for a blind adult, fire investigator Thomas Thompson said. The family  is staying at a nearby hotel, where they were taken by Red Cross workers. The  Ommanneys declined to comment about the fire.  </P> <P> The house has 15 to 20 rooms, Battalion Chief Jack Cooper said. The unusual  two-story home, which includes a bell tower, was marked by intricate mosaic  work on the exterior walls.  </P> <P> The cause of the fire is under investigation, firefighters said.

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Borland slumps to fourth-term deficit as sales continue to drop Borland International reported heavy losses for its fourth fiscal quarter and year. The personal computer software company is restructuring its operations and trying to stem a sharp decline in sales. Net losses for the quarter ended March 31 were Dollars 76m, or Dollars 2.84 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 5.1m, or 19 cents, in the same period last year. The losses included a pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 14m covering about 300 job cuts and the closure of some facilities. An additional charge of Dollars 8.2m was recorded for the write-down of real estate assets that the company plans to sell. Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 51.0m, a 56.4 per cent decline from Dollars 117.1m in the same period last year. In March, 10 days before the end of the fourth quarter, Borland announced plans to sell its spreadsheet product line, Quattro Pro, to Novell, another software company, for Dollars 145m. The transaction is expected to be completed this month. Borland said lower sales were in part attributable to a significant decline in sales of Quattro Pro following the announcement of the proposed sale. The company also blamed its revenue drop on customers waiting to buy new versions of some of its products that are to be introduced this summer. Borland said it expected a further operating loss in the current quarter and that sales would be adversely affected by the same factors, as well as by disruptions from the restructuring of its European operations. The company plans to take a one-time charge of about Dollars 16m for the acquisition of Report-Smith, a software company. Borland amended results for the third quarter ended December 31 to include a Dollars 3.3m charge for marketing commitments that had not been accounted for previously. The charge resulted in a net loss for the third quarter of Dollars 2.9m, compared with net income of Dollars 419,000, as originally reported. For the year, it reported a net loss of Dollars 69.9m, or Dollars 2.62 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 49.2m, or Dollars 1.87 for fiscal 1993. Revenues for the year were Dollars 393.5m, a 15.2 per cent decrease from Dollars 464m.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Falstaff grows in stature - Malcolm Rutherford reviews Henry IV and other London openings ADRIAN Noble's production of King Henry IV Part 2 has arrived at the Barbican and, like Part I, is even better than when it was first performed at Stratford a year ago. The triumph lies not only in the synthesis of the two parts, but in the way that that Part 2 has elements not touched upon in Part I. The most obvious is the move to the countryside. Aside from the battle scenes, Part I is mainly about life in and around London. Where the action ranges wider, it is to the outlying areas: Wales and Northumberland. They are full of wild men like Glendower and Hotspur. Part 2 moves into the civilised English countryside of Gloucestershire. Instead of warriors it is full of slow-witted lawyers like the Justices, Shallow and Silence; instead of tribal passions inspiring the troops, there are reluctant conscripts like Francis Feeble and Ralph Mouldy. What we see in Part 2 is the beginning of English nationalism. The next wars will not be the southern English resisting the north, but all the English fighting the French. The Gloucestershire scenes in Noble's production are outstanding because they show the provincial deference to the capital. To Justice Shallow, Falstaff is not the disreputable, unreliable fellow he seems in London: he is to be looked up to because he has stayed at the centre and been knighted. In Gloucestershire, Robert Stephens's Falstaff looks like a man of authority. He moves about the southern counties recruiting soldiers. He may even drink less than Shallow; at least he holds it better. That is not how he is seen in London. The performances by David Bradley and Anthony Douse as Shallow and Silence respectively are impeccable, as is that by Christopher Luscombe in the even smaller part of Davy, Shallow's servant. How, you can see Falstaff wondering, is it possible to get such a good valet in a land of yokels? Other indelible scenes are first the illness, then the death of Julian GLover's Henry IV. As the dying man's memories of a lifetime come back, he recalls that there was less than 10 years between the deposition of Richard II and now his own passing away. In the meantime, a nation has has developed, or so Shakespeare would have us believe. ***** One of the reasons why Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden is such a good play is its ambiguity: in the transition from dictatorship to democracy nobody is quite sure who did what under the old regime and how much of the past should be investigated. As a play, Karate Billy Comes Home at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs, which is where The Maiden also began, is not in the same league, but it is broadly the same genre. Just as betrayals ran deep in Pinochet's Chile, in the old East Germany practically everyone spied on everyone else. Too much is known about the recriminations now going on to doubt the basic authenticity of Klaus Pohl's piece, even if the plot is excessively melodramatic. Billy was a prospective Olympic multi-gold medallist, having already swept the board at the world student games in Bratislava. As such, he was a jewel in the crown of the East German state, but was also being wooed to defect to the US. The East Germans tampered with him medically in order to keep him at home: he spent 13 years in an asylum developing some of the attributes of a monkey man. When the Berlin Wall came down he was released. Most of the play is about who was responsible for for betraying him. Even the local pastor turns out to have been an informer and Billy's devoted sister was not entirely innocent. The piece contains an extraordinary scene where the sister declares her incestuous love for her brother; it is not unmoving, but of dubious relevance to the plot. In the background is a man from the Deutsche Bank who has come to mop up the remains of the East German economy. He learns that it is helpful to know how the informer system worked under the old regime, for the old habits clearly die hard. The play has its flaws, but strikes me as a more interesting work than Howard Brenton's Berlin Bertie at the Royal Court's main house. It concentrates on East Germany as it is and avoids spurious comparisons between eastern and western decadence. Billy, wild-haired, wild-eyed and full of animal strength, is superbly played by Kevin McMonagie. The translation by David Tushingham; the direction by Stephen Unwin has moments of genuine tension. ***** It is hard not to like As You Like It. The most pastoral of Shakespeare's plays, it has scarcely a touch of malice. Nevertheless, James Robert Carson's production at Greenwich makes heavy going of it. The opening is funereal and the eary scenes are stultified by over-formal costumes and a peculiar Grecian frieze. When the scene changes to picnicland in the Forest of Arden, however, the production perks up Philip Franks as Jacques performs the remarkable feat of speaking the seven ages of man lines as if they had just been written. He shines again when he makes his dignified, melancholy departure at the end. There is nothing camp about Jemma Redgrave's Rosalind. She hardly even looks as if she is dressed as a boy. Instead she is an intelligent youth who has fallen madly in love and enjoying every minute of it. This is a very youthful production which gets more exuberant as it goes on. The cast includes a wonderful Welsh Phebe, Buddug Morgan. ***** Viktor Slavkin's Cerceau, subtitled 'I'm Forty But I Don't Look It', is playing for the first time in English at the Orange Tree in Richmond. Written in 1983, its chief interest is in the way it foreshadowed glasnost in the period just before President Gorbachev. The characters, gathered in an inherited, but dilapidated country house outside Moscow, do not speak as if they are wholly oppressed by the regime, but neither are they part of it. They seem to be waiting for something to happen: these were, after all, the years of stagnation in the Soviet Union. The debt to Chekhov and The Cherry Orchard, written shortly before the revolution, is openly acknowledged by Slavkin. Nothing much does happen: the guests at the house discover cerceau, an old aristocratic game played with quoits on summer lawns and an old man turns up who remembers pre-1917 Russia. The piece is lovingly translated and directed by Adrian Brine and it certainly catches an atmosphere of ennui. Henry IV, Part 2 in repertory at the Barbican (071) 638 8891.

Saying what is most important in manuring and cultivating  crops under the present condition of a long spell of drought is  to sufficiently water the fields, he gave instructions that all  the farms should adjust and reinforce the existing irrigation  setups and make an effective use of them in an extensive  irrigation of dry fields.    He said a high and stable harvest can be reaped, not  affected  by whatever long drought in the country where the irrigation of  agriculture was completed long ago to bring into shape a  powerful irrigation system.    President Kim Il-song said that in order to increase the  crop  yield, all the farm work including weeding and paddy water  control must be done substantially as demanded by the chuche  method and supplementary fertilizers be applied to paddy and  nonpaddy fields in larger quantities in addition to chemical  fertilizers.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WHITE SOX TAKE AN OLD-FASHIONED BEATING, 12-9  </P> <P> An organ grinder and his monkey made their rounds through Comiskey Park in  Chicago. A barbershop quartet harmonized in the corridor.  </P> <P> Popcorn sold for a nickel and general admission seats were 50 cents.  </P> <P> The Chicago White Sox, who are leaving venerable Comiskey Park after this  season for a newer model across the street, turned back the clock on Wednesday  in a 12-9, 13-inning setback to the Milwaukee Brewers.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the White Sox probably could have used Ed Cicotte and  "Shoeless Joe" Jackson.  </P> <P> Darryl Hamilton singled home the tiebreaking run in the 13th and Jim Gantner  singled home two insurance runs as the Brewers, who trailed, 9-3, after seven  innings, notched their first extra-inning victory in seven games. It was the  third consecutive defeat for the White Sox, who fell two games behind Oakland  in the West.  </P> <P> Oakland 11, Minnesota 7 -- Jose Canseco had three hits, including his 23rd home  run, and drove in three runs as the Athletics downed the Twins at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Canseco, who has had back and wrist injuries, doubled to drive in a run in the  first inning, singled in the third and hit a 435-foot, two-run homer to center  in the A's five-run fourth.  </P> <P> Scott Sanderson (10-5) pitched 5 1/3 innings and Dennis Eckersley got the last  out for his 26th save after the Twins scored four runs in the ninth against  Rick Honeycutt and Todd Burns.  </P> <P> Baltimore 7, Kansas City 5 -- Joe Orsulak singled home the tie-breaking run in  the seventh inning as the Orioles rallied to beat the Royals at Baltimore for  their third consecutive victory.  </P> <P> The Orioles, who trailed, 5-2, after three innings, hadn't won three in a row  since June 6-9.  </P></p>

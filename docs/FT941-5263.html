			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Killings cloud El Salvador poll: Democracy is threatened as a nation struggles to escape its past In the run-up to much-vaunted national elections in El Salvador this month, the political violence which was a feature of the country's past continues to cast a cloud over its future. The vote on March 20 for presidential, parliamentary, and municipal offices has been called the 'election of the century,' as it will include candidates from conservatives to communists for the first time in more than 60 years. But dozens of killings, particularly of former left-wing guerrillas, and accusations that the government is failing to implement fully a peace agreement signed with guerrillas in January 1992, after 12 years of civil war, have led to concerns over whether the elections will consolidate democracy. Human rights groups in El Salvador say the killings have had a chilling effect on the campaign of the former left-wing guerrillas of the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (FMLN), and the left in general. The most recent report by the UN's human right monitoring division, released at the end of December, pointed to a 'grave deterioration' in the observance of human rights. FMLN leaders have complained that the government has not met its commitment to provide land to former fighters, and has tolerated the re-emergence of right-wing death squads. 'People are worried about what is going to happen once Onusal (the United Nations monitoring group) leaves - that the violations will return,' says Mr Hector Dada, a political analyst. The front-runner for President is Mr Armando Calderon Sol of the right-wing governing Nationalist Republican Alliance party, who comfortably leads Mr Ruben Zamora, leader of an alliance between the Democratic Convergence, a centre-left umbrella group, and the FMLN. A distant third is Mr Fidel Chavez Mena of the Christian Democrat party, whose popularity has plummeted as Mr Zamora's has grown. Mr Chavez remains tainted by the failures of a disastrous Christian Democrat administration in the mid-1980s. But about half of potential voters either remain uncertain about who to vote for or unwilling to state their preference. Mr Calderon was picked to succeed the current president, Mr Alfredo Cristiani, by the late Mr Roberto D'Aubuisson, a sponsor of right-wing death squads who founded the party in 1981 to defend the interests of the business and land-owning elite against the perceived advances of communism. Mr Calderon was formerly a popular mayor of San Salvador. But he reportedly does not enjoy the full confidence of his party, particularly among modernising businessmen. He lacks the smooth public relations skills of Mr Cristiani. Mr Calderon has benefited from an expensive government campaign on television proclaiming its achievements, which makes little attempt to distinguish itself from party advertising. But he is thought unlikely to secure the more than 50 per cent of the vote required for an outright victory. A run-off in April, probably with Mr Zamora, looks likely. Mr Zamora, who is vice-president of the Salvadorean Congress, spent most of the last decade in exile, and is considered one of the most able left-wing politicians in Latin America. By securing the backing of the FMLN, he has emerged as the country's leading opposition figure. Since becoming a political party last year the FMLN has been racked by internal divisions and has been unable to maintain the cohesion in peace which it achieved during the war. Senior party officials admit the organisation is likely to split after the election, as some of its member groups have embraced social democracy while others are still ostensibly Marxist. The end of the war has brought the Salvadorean government considerable foreign aid and soft loans to rebuild infrastructure damaged during the conflict. Last year saw 5 per cent growth, following 4.8 per cent in 1992, the highest rates in more than a decade. The growth was mostly fuelled by a large influx of repat-riated capital and external financing. With inflation down to 12 per cent, record foreign reserves, and one of the lowest foreign debt burdens in the Americas, the economy is in relatively good shape although highly dependent on remittances from compatriots in the US, who sent home more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 547.9m) last year. But Salvadoreans are still not sure if the bad old days are really over. As Mr Dada says: 'The psychology of terror has not finished.'</p>

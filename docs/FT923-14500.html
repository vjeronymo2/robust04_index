			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: TT buys AB Electronic stake TT GROUP, the acquisitive industrial holding company, has made its third proposal so far this year by taking a 6.35 per cent stake in AB Electronic Products, a loss-making components maker, and suggesting a merger. AB Electronic said it was 'seeking clarification' of TT's intentions and would make a further announcement 'in due course'. AB's shares gained 12p to 90p, valuing the company at Pounds 25.7m. TT's fell 7p to 215p. The response by AB was more cordial than those from TT's previous targets. TT still holds a 7.5 per cent stake in ML Holdings, another components maker, and sold its 4.6 per cent stake in Renold, the chain and gear maker, after Renold said the approach was unwelcome. TT also holds a 39.9 per cent stake in Magnetic Materials following last year's unsuccessful takeover bid. TT is keen to expand the business of its Crystalate division, maker of electronic components, and may be especially attracted by AB's resistor networks. TT expressed interest in some AB operations earlier this year, but the discussions faltered. TT's latest approach was unexpected. AB, which reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.95m in the six months to 31 December, has also been discussing the sale or restructuring of other divisions</p>

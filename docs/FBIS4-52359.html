			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vasiti Waqa: "The Rabuka Saga"] </F>   [Text] Sitiveni Rabuka's compact new month-old government  vaulted its first hurdle. It was a shock challenge to the  political security of the 45-year-old prime minister. It came  to light at a Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei [Fijian Political  Party -- SVT] caucus meeting at which a handful of Rabuka's 31  SVT members of parliament, who were dropped from his ministerial  line-up, asked questions about his personal life. The issue was  discussed at the party's second caucus on March 16, the day  before all parliamentarians were sworn in. Issues raised could  have deposed prime minister Rabuka if more members were stirred  by them. But for the most part, they dismissed it as a bygone  matter and for the sake of unity and party survival supported  him. Rabuka's frankness and his admission, to parliamentarians  and management board members, of an extramarital affair won him  points for frankness and transparency. His clear offer to them  to choose another leader if they no longer had any confidence in  his leadership also gained him support. But despite repeated  assurances of full party support, since the issue was made  public, questions could still linger in some minds about his  suitability as prime minister. The doubts could make his  leadership role rather uncomfortable and perhaps contribute to  government uncertainty.    Five former government ministers in his first government's  cabinet were unhappy about Rabuka's personal life and questioned  it. Two were formerly of cabinet rank, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola and  Koresi Matatolu, and three state ministers -- Kiniviliame  Taukeinikoro, Mesulame Narawa, and Joeli Kalou. They made their  views known in a letter to Rabuka in which they withdrew their  support from him as prime minister and asked him to resign  immediately. They first criticized him for inviting the  National Federation Party to join the SVT in a coalition  government, without the "clear mandate or authority, let alone  blessings" of the great council of chiefs and the general  caucus. They also accused him of "committing adultery" in  October last year, "with a woman journalist", on the chiefly  island of Taveuni where his province of Cakaudrove was holding  its provincial council meeting.  <H5>  Personal Attack </H5>   When asked if he would have accepted a party decision that  he  was unfit to lead because of his extramarital affair, Rabuka  responded: "Yeah, right, exactly, and I had already warned out  the president." On whether he had discussed the challenge with  others in the caucus before the general discussion, Rabuka said:  "No I didn't need to. It was a personal attack on me and I had  to deal with it the way I thought was proper." Rabuka was asked  about the issue being raised in the light of his party's  relative success at the polls and generally positive response to  his more streamlined 12-member cabinet. He said: "It was  brought up in caucus, it was dealt with in caucus, and it was  finished in caucus. I don't think there is any need to do any  more than that. It was our own internal one, within caucus, and  that has been resolved. Going back to the number of cabinet  ministers, that is solely the prerogative of the prime minister  and if people believe that they have been unfairly dumped or  they have not been favorably considered then it's up to them.  But if we were to change our prime minister, can there be a  guarantee that they (axed ministers) will come in? You cannot  satisfy everybody all the time people. You might be able to  satisfy some people all the time, all the people some time but  never everybody all the time."    He was also asked if he was satisfied that the issue had  been  resolved now: "I am satisfied that it is now behind us. If  there are any who are still harboring those feelings I am sure  it will come out and when it comes out, it comes out." On  whether a prime minister's personal life, in this case an  extramarital affair, was an issue for leadership, Rabuka said:  "Within the party, within the group they might consider that  and if it is something that we resolve in the party and the  caucus feels, OK, you are no longer fit to be our leader, let's  pick another one. So it's on that basis that I opened it up for  discussion that day. And I asked those who tried to bring it up  to say right, if you are defeated, will you come along and we  all keep the party working together, because we owe it to the  people to make this government work. And that was how it was  resolved. So I don't know, these are personal things that  people might want to bring up or question."  <H5>  Public Property </H5>   He later said: "I think people in high office like  presidents and prime ministers should expect that. They are no  longer their own, they are in fact really public property and  people want to look at what you are, what you are like, what you  eat, what you wear, so they (leaders) must expect that and if  the nation feels you are not good enough, or if your party feels  you're not good enough to lead, you face it."    The five who wrote to Rabuka were also members of a cabinet  prayer group, along with Rabuka and others. Sources say they  could also have been inspired by groups of people outside the  parliamentary caucus who believed Rabuka should step down as  prime minister. Concern also arose from the group's spiritual  interest in Rabuka's life as an avowed Christian and Methodist  lay preacher. He has reportedly stepped down from his position  as lay preacher. Kubuabola, an official in the Baptist church,  has been a close associate of Rabuka's and is reported to have  confronted him about possibly compromising incidents in the past.  <H5>  Letter </H5>   Party sources say before it was raised in caucus Kubuabola  met him to suggest he resign. Rabuka reportedly told him to  bring the matter up at the party caucus but Rabuka himself took  the initiative to raise the subject at the meeting and read out  the group's letter. Sources say prior to the discussion, Rabuka  may have suggested Kubuabola and others would get cabinet jobs  in a planned expansion immediately before or after the  announcement of the new budget, this month. A close Rabuka  confidante and backbencher reportedly tried to play the part of  a go-between -- attempting to placate Kubuabola and the other  four on behalf of Rabuka.    Objections to the matter being raised by Kubuabola were  heard  from about a quarter of the parliamentarians and party  management board officials before the party resolved to put the  whole matter behind it. Sources say if there was any suggestion  that Rabuka should step down because of the incident, these were  brushed aside and his leadership and authority reconfirmed.  Said one parliamentarian: "Rabuka was wise to bring it to  caucus. This way he has cleared the air and once again gathered  support." Some signatories to the letter withdrew after some  discussion. Said Kalou: "The matter has been settled and I  don't want to make any comment." One backbencher, who spoke on  condition of not being identified, said: "I am glad the issue  was discussed. It is good so that they (leaders) will know that  we and the people are watching and they can behave." With the  air cleared, government could get on with the business of  running the country. It was a healthy sign for the party and  they preferred the issue be discussed rather than having it  swept under the carpet. They said open discussion meant an end  to further grumbling and whispering in the back benches. There  is some doubt as to whether Rabuka's judgment was altogether  sound in taking the matter to caucus because he forced Kubuabola  to discuss the issue in a forum where it was not altogether  welcomed. By alienating Kubuabola in that manner, Rabuka has  sacrificed a former political ally and right hand man.  Kubuabola and Rabuka go back to the fiery nationalist marches  leading up to the military coup of 1987 and the Taukei movement  that was formed through it.  <H5>  Public Discussion </H5>   The issue is an interesting test case for Fiji, where more  public discussion is being generated about the private lives of  public figures. Being a relatively small and closely knit  nation of 758,000, discussion about questionable actions of  Fiji's public figures and leaders are inevitably confined to  informal yaqona bowl discussions and the cocktail circuit. The  caucus challenge and the reasons for it were alluded to by  Fiji's two English dailies, the Fiji Times and Daily Post, and  first disclosed in the local monthly magazine The Review. The  impact of this unprecedented public airing will perhaps not be  known for quite some time. It could be used by opposition  Fijian parties for political mileage against Rabuka, and other  Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa parliamentarians at political and Fijian  communal gatherings.    If Rabuka had decided not to take the issue to the caucus he  might have had a more difficult time dealing with Kubuabola and  his group. Among the questions being asked now are:    -- will other ministers or Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei  parliamentarians be questioned about their private lives?    -- would Rabuka have been confronted over the affair if he  was a chief not a commoner?    -- and Can Rabuka now expect to be queried about every  aspect  of his personal life?    The issue of Rabuka's affair will hang over the prime  ministership for quite some time. Even if it doesn't have any  serious impact on his political position, it's the kind of  headache party officials and supporters could well do without.    Although the government now has 31 seats, one more than last  time, its coalition with four General Voters' Party members has  been cut by one. That, plus the support of two independent  parliamentarians, gives it back its previous total of 37 seats.  This time though, observers say their position is weaker because  the five Fijian opposition parliamentarians of the Fijian  Association are strongly opposed to the government, unlike their  predecessors. Former Fijian opposition members from the Fijian  Nationalist United Front and Soqosoqo ni Taukei ni Vanua had  some empathy for government policies and supported Rabuka.  <H5>  Broken Ranks </H5>   There are 37 seats for Fijians, 27 for Indians, five for  Generals (islanders, part Europeans, and others) and one for  Rotumans under the pro-Fijian 1990 constitution. The only  Fijian non-SVT representatives elected were Fijian Association  candidates from Lau in eastern Fiji and Naitasiri in central  Viti Levu, Fiji's main island. Lau was seen to have broken  ranks with the Great Council of Chiefs and its party, the SVT,  by voting for the party which was endorsed by its provincial  council and its own chief Ratu Finau Mara. He was previously  the Lau member for the SVT, and it was primarily because of him  that his party swept all three seats in his home province.    Former deputy prime minister and foreign minister Filipe  Bole was defeated by 684 votes. His loss was a loss for the  whole government side, especially in government and foreign  affairs. Bole's expertise in the constitution review process was  also going to be a loss for the Jai Ram Reddy-led National  Federation Party and for the Indian opposition as a whole. On  the government side, Bole is the best versed with the whole  constitution review process. Indian leaders know him and have  worked with him. So government has appointed him their special  consultant on constitution review and will be involving him as  closely as possible on this issue.    Naitasiri disproved the generalization that Fijians followed  their chiefs to the polls. Steered by strong anti-government  feelings, Naitasiri went against its more prominent chiefs, and  backed lesser chiefs and a Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei  dissident, Ilai Kuli, to vote against the ruling party. Fijian  Association party leader and former deputy prime minister in  Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara's interim government, Josevata  Kamikamica, said support for the SVT came mainly from ties with  the Great Council of Chiefs. "The election was also focussing  on the leadership, on the style of leadership, and I think the  results really show that the Fijian people prefer Rabuka and  Rabuka's leadership."  <H5>  Grooming </H5>   Kamikamica said the Fijian Association "would like to groom,  and help in the process of developing younger leaders. We have  some very talented young chiefs, Ratu Finau (Mara), Ratu Apenisa  (Cakobau, son of the late governor-general and high chief Ratu  Sir George Cakobau), Ratu Edward (Tuivanuavou, a former army  officer), and Ratu (Viliame) Dreunimisimisi (son of Fiji's late  deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ratu Edward Cakobau  and a former cabinet minister in Rabuka's 1992 government).    While theories have come and gone about different groups  challenging Rabuka's leadership from within the party, Rabuka  and party officials know they aren't out of the woods yet.  Beyond the party circle and by Rabuka's own admission, cabinet  is going to have to work hard to keep their enemies at bay. A  piece of paper pledging loyalty and support for Rabuka, that all  31 SVT parliamentarians signed the day after their victory was  announced, isn't enough to bind them. Rabuka may have to hand  out a few more cabinet appointments to those on the back bench  who want them and find other ways and means of keeping his team  happy. The theory that February election gave him an  opportunity to clear out detractors and gather true blue  supporters is now being tested.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria and Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In evaluating the designation of critical habitat to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not to exclude areas because of concerns over economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects, the Service used the following process:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Based upon the criteria described in this document, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographical area essential to the conservation of the species was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An economic analysis was conducted to ascertain the anticipated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic consequences of designating areas as critical habitat, using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agricultural and urban sectors as the primary level of economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Service balanced the costs and other impacts of designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the benefits of designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using the above described process, the Service has determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no exclusions to critical habitat are appropriate. The entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic area designated as critical habitat is essential to conserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delta smelt. Delta smelt are restricted to a limited geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, and retaining land and water areas contained within Suisun Bay and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> river reaches within the Delta and Montezuma, Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and First Mallard (Spring Branch) sloughs is necessary to recover this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual species. These areas provide habitat necessary for each life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stage of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic consequences of designating the entire area as critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat are relatively small. Most economic costs can be avoided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project proponents by using timing and construction restrictions, and by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using best management practices. Designation of critical habitat will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the need in the future to list fish and wildlife species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently in decline, and will improve the overall health of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary. The benefits of designating the entire area outweigh the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of excluding any of the area from the designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Act, as stated in section 2(b), is to provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species depend and to provide a program for the conservation of listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. Section 2(c)(1) of the Act declares that ''*&blank;*&blank;* all Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purposes of this Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act mandates the conservation of listed species through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different mechanisms, such as: Section 7 (requiring Federal agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and insuring that Federal actions will not likely jeopardize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or adverse modification of critical habitat); section 9 (wildlife  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research permits and habitat conservation planning on non-Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands); section 6 (cooperative State and Federal grants), land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquisition, and research. Other Federal laws also require conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of endangered and threatened species, such as the National Forest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, and various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other State and Federal laws and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat is not intended as a management or conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan. Critical habitat is primarily intended to identify the habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that meets the criteria for the primary constituent elements. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are benefits that result from the designation. Designation will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> help retain recovery options and reduce the near-term risk until a long-term conservation plan is implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designation of critical habitat does not offer specific direction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for managing delta smelt habitat. That type of direction, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any change in direction, will come through the administration of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facets of the Act (e.g., section 7, section 10 HCP process, and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recovery Planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recovery planning under section 4(f) of the Act is the ``umbrella'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that eventually guides all the Act's activities and promotes a species'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation and eventual delisting. Recovery plans provide guidance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which may include population goals and identification of areas in need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of protection or special management. Recovery plans usually include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management recommendations for areas proposed or designated as critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The delta smelt and six other fish species that depend on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary for a significant segment of their life history are included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Native Fishes Recovery Plan. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery plan is currently in draft form. The recovery plan will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include recovery criteria based on population abundance and geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution. Designation of critical habitat, along with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological opinion evaluating the effects of the Federal and State water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects on the delta smelt, is consistent with the plan's objective to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recover these fish species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7 Consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to destroy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accompanies, and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act that Federal agencies ensure that their actions do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of a species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survival and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state that such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification and jeopardy, are directly related. Survival may be viewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The closer one is to recovery, the greater the certainty in the species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued survival. The terms ``survival and recovery'' are, thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related by the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given period of time. Survival relates to viability. Factors that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influence a species' viability include population numbers, distribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the range, stochasticity, expected duration, and reproductive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> success. A species may be considered recovered when there is a high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of certainty for the species' continued viability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of critical habitat is to contribute to a species' conservation, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by definition equates to recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply to actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would impair survival and recovery of a listed species, thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat and recovery, the prohibition against destruction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse modification of the critical habitat should provide for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection of the critical habitat's ability to contribute to a species'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

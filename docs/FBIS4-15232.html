			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature no. 66 (556) by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Below is the text of President Yeltsin's interview  with Interfax news agency.    IF: Six months since last October's tragic events, what do  you think are the main lessons that Russian politicians ought to  have drawn?    YELTSIN: Going back to those days makes me both bitter and  sad. But this has to be done to prevent such tragedy from being  repeated. I think that to any Russian politician, this must  become a supreme goal and the main demand to himself and his  associates regardless of political leanings. What is needed  most is an internal ban on violence, extremism, the fuelling of  vile emotions and social unrest.    The only way of achieving political goals is through the  ballot box. Mutiny or uprising must be outlawed. This is the  first lesson to be learnt from the October tragedy. I can now  say that it is being learnt by all of us, albeit with  difficulty. One indication is the preparation of a civil peace  pact with more parties and groups willing to join it by the day.    One other lesson from those dark days is a vital necessity  to  beef up the state. What happened at the time was largely due to  inadmissible connivance at extremism and political promiscuity  which must be banished in a healthy state. No one must be  allowed to attack government offices or siege a TV center or  form armed units. It is the state's duty to protect civilians  and ensuring security is its main function. Unfortunately, the  government had managed to bring an end to the rioting only in  the last stage. If not, what rivers of blood would have flown  throughout Moscow and Russia?    We now have a minimum of what it takes to consolidate the  state. First of all, this is a new constitution approved in last  December's nationwide referendum. The constitution put an end  to the long- running power struggle by offering civilized ways  of resolving controversial issues, leading the country out of  the deadlock of confrontation and laying down the basis for  cooperation by all sensible forces of Russia. The mood of  searches for consensus now prevails and my task is to turn it  into reality.    IF: With next presidential elections about two years away,  what is your main priority in the run up to the vote? Will be  seeking re-election?    YELTSIN: I have already answered that question in part. But  to follow up, it is most important to try to avert new upheavals  and prevent the past tragedy from being repeated. Six months  on, there are indications that the country has shifted to a  different option -- that of understanding and cooperation with  confrontational attitudes receding into the backyard of body  politics. My own task is to help this in every way but above  all, to arrange stable relations between the government,  legislature and judiciary.    There emerges a new climate of cooperation with the  Federation Council and State Duma. Though there are some  hitches, there is also a drive for seeking compromise and  banishing ultimatums. Dialogue is evolving. I will do my best  to beef up this newly- emerging creative mood so that the  parliament works through its term of office and the next  election comes into its own stead in conditions of internal  stability and higher standards of political culture.    The accompanying task is to try to consolidate the unity of  Russia and our Federation as a whole. There is a good deal of  doom and gloom about its possible breakdown, but this will not  happen. We managed to stop it from plunging into chaos at the  most complicated moment. The process is now under way of  evening up federal relations, though with pain and friction  sometimes because of regional specifics. But it is under  control both by the center and the regions. We must make a  serious advance at home in the next two years. And also within  the CIS. I do not want to speak at length about our plans here,  this is a big and entirely different theme altogether. But I  think our states will move closer to each other in the next two  years.    And of course, there is a third important priority, that is  the country's economy. All of us are learning hard. Looking  two or three years back, it can be said with a fair amount of  certainty that we have learnt a few things. By now, we have  managed to recover only a tiny part of the experience it took  Russia centuries to gain and which was later destroyed.  Recovery is under way and its pace will increase in parallel.  In this sense, the next two years will be crucial. I hope that  many of the ills of our economy will have gone and all of us  will feel much relieved.    As for the second part of your question, I think it has been  raised much too early.    IF: Opinions vary about the concept, formula and timing of  Russia's entry of the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace [PFP]  program. What is the president's viewpoint on this?    YELTSIN: We have our own concept of European cooperation.  Its key elements -- the CSCE as a priority regional political  forum and the Council of North Atlantic Cooperation as a leading  mechanism of military-political partnership -- will coordinate  the activity of other structures including NATO's.    Russia backed up the NATO plan from the very start. On the  formula and timing of Russian membership of the Partnership  plan, I have instructed the defence ministry and other  government structures to look into the main parameters of  Russia's political and military cooperation within the framework  of the Partnership. It stands to reason that in its scope and  dimension, Russia's partnership with NATO must be entirely  different from that of other countries. The question is one of  signing a special agreement with NATO as befits Russia's place  and role in Europe and internationally and its military might  and the status of a nuclear power.    Overall, we are not in a rush. We have held a series of  consultations with CIS states and other countries are close to  sign an outline document.</p>

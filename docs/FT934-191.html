			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Granada extends bid for LWT Granada, the rental, leisure and television group, yesterday extended its Pounds 660m hostile offer for London Weekend Television for a further two weeks. At yesterday's first closing date, acceptances added only 2.39m shares, or 2.31 per cent of the target's equity, to those already held by Granada, taking the total to 19.82 per cent. The new deadline is January 12. The offer is based on six new Granada shares for every five LWT shares, worth just over 640p a share at last night's close, with a cash alternative of 528p. LWT closed up 2p at 625p yesterday. Since Granada launched the bid on December 6, its share price has risen from 485p to 534p yesterday - down 1p on the day - adding about 10 per cent to the value of the paper offer. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, said of the level of acceptances: 'I am not even going to use the word derisory.' LWT is not expected to take any further action until close to January 14, when it will provide a profit estimate. Sir Christopher has urged shareholders to stick with a 'pure' television company rather than take the paper of 'a conglomerate earning half its profits in a low growth sector'. Talks are continuing with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees which could lead to an LWT offer, although because one company can only hold two ITV licences a home would have to be found for Tyne Tees. The deal envisages Anglia Television taking over Tyne Tees in the hope that the four ITV franchises could eventually be brought together to form a super ITV region. Meanwhile Mr Gerry Robinson, the Granada chief executive, has said: 'Although we are in a number of different businesses, television will become a much larger part of Granada.' He was speaking after last week's EGM which approved the bid for LWT. 'This acquisition isn't going to make us a Paramount that's for sure. But we think there will probably only be three major (ITV) players at the end of the decade: ourselves, Carlton and MAI,' he added. Carlton Communications has made an agreed bid for Central and MAI, the main shareholder in Meridian Broadcasting, the south of England company, is interested in expansion. Lex, Page 12</p>

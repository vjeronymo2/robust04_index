			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (2): Battle to restore prosperity - Hugh Carnegy examines the economy Three issues have dominated what has sometimes been an anguished public debate about the Swedish economy this year: the budget deficit, the consequent expansion of the state debt and unprecedented levels of unemployment. The deficit, expected to reach SKr201bn in the current July-June fiscal year, is running at about 13 per cent of gross national product, one of the deepest holes in the public finances of any European country. Borrowing to fill the hole has pushed up state debt to almost 90 per cent of GNP, making Sweden the world's biggest sovereign issuer on international bond markets. This alarming imbalance, the legacy of a three-year recession and an overweighted public sector, has to a significant degree been exacerbated by the need to pay for record unemployment, now running at about 13 per cent of the workforce when those in government-funded training schemes are added to the 8 per cent of workers on unemployment benefit. These are the figures which attracted most attention in the campaign for the general election in September. The precarious state of the public finances has also led to strong pressure from the financial markets for drastic measures to curb borrowing, which in turn has put added strain on the economy in the form of high long-term interest rates; Sweden pays a premium of 3.5 percentage points in interest on its 10-year bonds compared with benchmark German rates. For Mr Goran Persson, the new Social Democratic finance minister, the tough task is to forge a transformation from a vicious to a virtuous circle where the deficit is reduced sufficiently to reassure the markets - thereby engineering a cut in interest rates which bolsters a real recovery underway in the economy at large and helps achieve the vital political priority of cutting unemployment. But even achieving this may not be enough to produce a long-term solution to the underlying structural weakness in the Swedish economy that has seen almost all net job creation in the past two decades come from the public sector as Sweden's famous universal welfare model expanded. Mr Persson must also engineer a reversal of a trend that has seen Sweden slide since 1970 from third place in the world league of GNP a head - then behind only the US and Switzerland - to 16th place. On the immediate task of sorting out the public finances, the new government has begun to get down to business. To stabilise the debt by the next election in 1998 at the latest, the target set by all mainstream political parties, Mr Persson's team at the finance ministry calculates that the budget must be strengthened by SKr93bn. In early November, the first step was taken by a package that included tax increases to yield SKr31.6bn and spending cuts of SKr25.5bn. A further SKr20bn in spending cuts is promised in the January budget. With an estimated saving of SKr14bn forecast for the period from lower interest rates, this will yield a little over SKr91bn. Although in a minority in parliament, the Social Democrats have support from the Left party for the initial package and is confident of securing a majority with the help of right-of-centre parties for the next budget. The markets have yet to be convinced. They will need to be reassured that the Social Democrats can get approval for budget cuts which will hit the party's bedrock supporters in the welfare system. They are nervous about the costs of an employment package also promised in the budget which is likely at least to include some significant short-term spending. They are also worried that some of the finance ministry's forecasts are over-optimistic. The ministry is anticipating 3.4 per cent GNP growth in 1995. (This year, growth is expected to be about 2.5 per cent after three successive years of recession.) It foresees stable private consumption despite the reduction in household income due from the tax increases and spending cuts, and a fall in 'open' unemployment to below 7 per cent. It also foresees inflation at 3 per cent, just on the upper target limit set by the Riksbank. Almost all other independent forecasts take a more cautious view. A central concern is that the hoped-for return to growth in the domestic economy will be dependent on a significant fall in the household savings rate, presently standing at more than 8 per cent of earnings, which is regarded as being far from certain. Mr Pagrotsky acknowledges that if the economy does not perform as well as anticipated, the budget calculations will be skewed. But he says exports, which have fuelled the return to growth this year, will continue to grow well in 1995 and will have a growing trickle-down effect into the domestic economy as home-based suppliers of exporters benefit. Corporate investment, long in recession, has finally begun to grow significantly. He also believes households are becoming less savings-minded as unemployment stabilises. If the government does succeed in bringing the public finances under control, the economic debate is likely to shift to the deeper question of the underlying structure of the Swedish economy. Public sector spending has grown to account for some 70 per cent of GNP - easily the highest level among industrialised countries. This will fall as the deficit is reduced - but to get back closer to average European levels would require a further stage of reform of the public sector. To achieve this, the previous government under Mr Carl Bildt, radical leader of the conservative Moderate party, advocated free market reforms to cut back state monopolies in the public services, widespread liberalisation in areas such as labour market regulation, lower taxation on capital and extensive privatisation. The Social Democrats, creators of the welfare state, have a different agenda. They readily accept the need to engender greater private sector growth; they acknowledge that the public sector must be reduced as a proportion of the economy; they embrace the need for open markets and competition. But they remain committed to a strong public welfare system and the maintainance of a society where variations in income are smoothed out by state-directed redistribution of wealth. Their critics say this ultimately prevents them from tackling issues such as labour and monopoly market deregulation which is needed to unleash long-term growth. The government has so far put a break on deregulation of Sweden's energy market, reversed some Bildt labour reforms and is hesitating over the privatisation of Telia, the state telecommunications company. The former government parties may tacitly or even explicitly support the Social Democrats in their efforts to cut the budget deficit. But they will certainly keep up the pressure on the new government to go further in reforming the economy in the battle to restore Sweden's long-term prosperity.</p>

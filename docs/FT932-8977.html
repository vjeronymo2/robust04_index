			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Cookery: Turkish delights ONE intriguing aspect of eating out in Turkey is the way each catering kitchen sticks to a narrow range of dishes. There is no need to eat a whole meal at one sitting. You enjoy one course in which the restaurant specialises and then move on. Mezze are served on saucers along with drinks. Take a digestive stroll and, a little later, order kebabs in another establishment. Then take coffee and dessert in a third. Tables do not have to be booked - in fact some places do not have tables. Rarely are you hurried on your way. You can read the newspapers, play backgammon, talk or just watch the world go by. Just as mealtimes can be contracted or spun out according to whim so can the form a meal takes be varied. Visit a kebab kitchen first, and subsequently settle down elsewhere to a serious mezze session. Or skip the savoury stuff and devote your appetite to a coffee and pastry emporium. This may seem a Mad Hatter's tea party approach compared with the prescribed orderliness of the British one-place-and three-courses set menu routine. But I think it is terrific; I cannot help reflecting how much more I might enjoy going to many restaurants in the UK if the same principles were practiced here. Restaurant is too grand a description for many of the best Turkish street kitchens. Often they are no more than a portable barrow equipped with a couple of storage pots, a cleaver, chopping board, and a brazier: no tables for the diners, and no cutlery. Time and time again I was led by my nose to such places. I marvelled at the speed with which chunks of lamb, bay leaves and wedges of onion were threaded on to skewers; and I delighted in the way the ingredients were basted by brushing them with bunches of wild thyme and oregano dipped in olive oil. The skewers were laid on the bars of the charcoal brazier and the embers revived with a fan. The fan, nothing more elaborate than a few branches of herb, was waved so the fringes of the herbs would singe. Their perfumed smoke mingled with the meaty aroma and rose in blue-grey curls. The smell was mouthwatering - and sometimes my eyes watered too. Given fine weather and flavoursome British lamb anyone with a barbecue can surely - weather permitting - lunch on food as simple and good as this. Wedges of lemon to squeeze over the semi-charred meat, good bread to sop up the juices and a leafy salad are the natural accompaniments. A suitably Turkish follow-up would be baklava. BAKLAVA (makes nine squares) For the pastries: 6 sheets filo pastry; 1 1/2 oz butter; a mixture of chopped pistachios and flaked almonds totalling 3 oz. For the syrup: 4 oz sugar; 2 tablespoons each runny honey and water; 2 teaspoons lemon juice; 1 teaspoon rose or orange blossom water. Working with filo pastry is more like dressmaking than baking. You need scissors, not a rolling pin, to shape it, but even a poor seamstress like me can produce professional results. Filo does, however, need protection against drying out. Unwrap each sheet as you need it, and cover the trimmings as soon as cut with greaseproof paper and a damp teatowel to stop them becoming brittle. Melt the butter and brush some over the inside of a shallow baking tin 6 1/2  7 inches square. Take a sheet of pastry and cut a piece large enough to line the tin and overhang the sides a little all round. Brush it with melted butter and lay it buttered side up in the tin. Cover with a second layer of pastry, cut and buttered in the same way. Use the trimmings plus extra sheets as necessary to line the base of the tin only (no more overhang is necessary) with another three layers of buttered pastry. Sprinkle on half the nuts, add two more layers of buttered pastry, and sprinkle on the rest of the nuts. Cover with five more layers of buttered pastry, folding the overhang from the the bottom two sheets of pastry into the tin just before adding the final layer. Brush the top of the pie with more butter. Cut into squares with a sharp knife and sprinkle with a little cold water to stop curling. Bake until golden and crisp allowing about 30 minutes at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4, and a further 10 minutes in the residue heat after the oven has been turned off. Make the syrup while the pie bakes. Melt the sugar and honey with the water and lemon juice. Bring to the boil and simmer for two minutes. Stir the flower water into the warm syrup just before pouring it over the cooked baklava, which will absorb it as it cools.</p>

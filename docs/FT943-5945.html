			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Metallgesellschaft escapes from Castle contracts A gaping hole in Metallgesellschaft's finances was plugged yesterday after the struggling German metals and engineering group negotiated its way out of a series of crippling contracts with a US oil refiner. The costly relationship, which recently forced Metallgesellschaft to sell prime assets to generate DM1bn (Pounds 400m) to cover expected losses on the contracts, is to end on January 31. The deal could mark the group's most significant step towards financial health since its creditor banks provided a DM3.4bn rescue package to save it from collapse last January. Under a complex two-stage agreement, MG Corp, the group's US subsidiary, will effectively cancel all existing links - as shareholder, customer and financier - with Castle Energy. The extraordinary customer relationship was developed by now-departed US executives. It obliged MG Corp to buy all Castle's refinery output until the year 2000 at prices above market levels. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, group chairman, recently described Castle, in which MG Corp had a 40 per cent stake, as a money-making machine. MG Corp was a money-destroying machine, he said. Group officials were unable last night to specify the cost of the arrangements, which include Metallgesellschaft's assuming Dollars 375m (Pounds 242m) of Castle's third-party debt and cancelling Castle's obligations to MG Corp. 'It is expensive, but the alternative (to honour the oil contracts) would have been much, much dearer,' a spokesman said. 'We are all very relieved,' he added. It also emerged yesterday that Metallgesellschaft is preparing to place its 47 per cent stake in the Kolbenschmidt automotive components group if talks with potential industrial buyers fail again. Plans were being drawn up as an 'option' to raise about DM250m, banking sources said. Industry officials suggested the preparations were intended to 'put a squib' under Dana Corp of the US and Britain's T&amp;N, the two leading contenders for the stake. A placing would almost certainly result in the holding's being taken into 'safe German hands'. The leaked news that the shares could be placed might have been a warning to Dana and T&amp;N that they could miss an important opportunity in the German market if they tried to drive too hard a bargain, the officials suggested. Metallgesellschaft confirmed negotiations had resumed with Dana, which unexpectedly pulled out of a purchase agreement signed in March after reportedly deciding the price was too high and that it wanted to exclude Kolbenschmidt's aluminium foundry from the deal.</p>

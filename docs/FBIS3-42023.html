			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukraiyinske Radio First Program  Network in Ukrainian at 1305 GMT on 17 January carries a  NEZHAVISIMOST program. This program lasts 45 minutes and in its  first part presents an interview with Aleksandr Chalyy, chairman  of the Legal Department within the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry,  and Konstantin Trishchenko, chief of the Department for Control  Over Weapons and Disarmament within the Ukrainian Foreign  Ministry by correspondent Syarhey Omelchuk. The second part of  the program is a live phone-in question-and-answer program. The  subject of the cast addresses the activities of Ukraine in the  denuclearization sphere and results of the tripartite  Ukrainian-Russian-U. S. negotiations in Moscow.    At 1313 GMT, touching upon opinions of various political  groupings regarding the Moscow agreement, Aleksandr Chalyy says  that ``this tripartite declaration is the logical continuation  of Ukraine's political activities on the international arena,''  and it fully corresponds to clause No. 9 of the Declaration of  the National Sovereignty of Ukraine. In addition, he recalls  that 90 percent of the population backed the text of this  Declaration and ``the Supreme Council has ratified the START  treaty with reservations.'' Responding to the reporter's  question on whether nuclear weapons are a deterring factor in  relations with Ukraine's neighbors, the chairman of the Legal  Department states that this theory was born in the USSR, and it  demands the existence of reliable nuclear weapons and an  aggressive military policy. ``Ukraine has no operational  control over its nuclear weapons and this policy cannot be used  by us. In addition, we cannot produce nuclear weapons,'' he  adds.    At 1317, when asked to comment on security guarantees,  Aleksandr Chalyy enumerates the principles -- territorial  integrity, inviolability of borders, sovereignty, and  independence of Ukraine -- saying that this document will be  published tomorrow. Further, the talk shifted to prospects of  the political development of Crimea. However, Mr. Chalyy  refuses to answer this question and says that time will show  what happens, however, the nuclear disarmament process does not  in any case affect the political processes in the Crimea.  ``There are many regions even in Russia that want to become  independent, however, Russian diplomacy is very careful in  meeting their demands.''    At 1328 GMT, queried on the compensation mechanism,  Konstantin Trishchenko recalls the Massandra agreement and  Geneva negotiations on the issue and reminds that ``Ukraine will  receive free fuel for its nuclear power plants and new jobs will  be created in the atomic power engineering field.''    In the second part of the program, at 1337 GMT, the  listeners  again ask about security guarantees for Ukraine and compensation  for the Republic. Konstantin Trishchenko recommends that they  read tomorrow's newspapers and repeats that the United States is  a stable guarantor of Ukraine's security. Next, some listeners  ask about the possibility of ratifying this agreement in the  Supreme Council. Konstantin Trishchenko responds that the  tripartite international treaty will be ratified ``by all  means.''    The final questions [1345 GMT] concern the general situation  in the world regarding the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.  The end of the program is unmonitorable.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GOSPEL SINGING A DOOR OPENER  </P> <P> Singing has always been Hovie Lister's stock in trade, but the gospel artist  likes politics enough to spend his winter days opening doors for Georgia  senators.  </P> <P> Lister, 64, who sang at the funerals of Hank Williams and Elvis Presley, is an  assistant doorkeeper for the Senate this year, a job he sought from music fan  Zell Miller, the lieutenant governor. It pays about $1,800 per session.  </P> <P> "I just love politics," Lister said.  </P> <P> The Statesmen Quartet, started by the Baptist minister in 1948, has been cited  as Presley's favorite gospel group and a major influence on him.  </P></p>

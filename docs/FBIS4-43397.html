			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller: "Defense To Save 690 Million"] </F>   [Text] By next year, the Danish defense will be operated  with 700 million fewer kroner.    This is stated in a previously secret report from Defense  Minister Hans Haekkerup (Social Democrat) who, in this way, has  set the stage for a political battle during the final stages of  the election campaign.    The planned cuts consist of two items. In the future,  expenditures on UN actions -- including the new international  brigade of 4,500 men -- will be included in the normal defense  budget. For next year, this figure is 390 million kroner.    Until now, these costs have been covered, by way of an  exception, by the Finance Ministry. In addition, the defense  minister wants to make a one-time saving of 300 million kroner.    Haekkerup has been so secretive so far that not even the  spokesmen on defense matters from the three other coalition  parties knew the plans in detail.    But CD [Democratic Center] chairman Svend Aage Jensen said,  "Significant savings in the defense budget is not our cup of  tea. We do not believe the time is right to cut back. But I will  see if these figures can be verified."    The present defense agreement was reached in November 1992  and it runs out at the end of 1994. It was signed by six  parties, other than SF [Socialist People's Party] and the  Progress Party.    Now Conservative leader and former Defense Minister Hans  Engell believes that the government is setting the stage for  "great uncertainty in the area of defense."    "We cannot go along. It is totally unreasonable to create  uncertainty over the military's ability to plan for the future  by suddenly pulling the rug from under it completely in an  economic sense," Engell said.    His fellow party member, spokesman on defense issues Helge  Adam Moller, is also attacking the defense minister for breach  of agreement. He said that, according to Haekkerup, a so-called  earned net interest of 107 million kroner would not be released  in 1994, as expected, but would be carried over to 1995.    "This is totally unacceptable and will poison future  negotiations toward a defense agreement."    "It will be totally impossible to maintain the combat  capabilities of the military if there are cuts of 700 million.  At the same time, this is in clear violation of a law passed in  December on the purpose and mission of the military. This is a  slap in the face to the parties that signed the agreement,"  Moller said.    The political battle will continue when a long-expected  report from the so-called Advice and Analysis Group of the  Defense Ministry is published today.    BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has tried unsuccessfully to obtain any  comments from Defense Minister Haekkerup.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: Country park project near Heathrow A Pounds 1.58m contract for the north site barrier works at Bedfont Lakes has been awarded to the piling division of FAIRCLOUGH CIVIL ENGINEERING. Bedfont Lakes is a 250-acre site the Rutland Group is developing less than a mile from Heathrow Airport. Rutland is transforming the majority of the once derelict former gravel works into a 188-acre country park. Site restoration costs are being financed by 56 acres of commercial and industrial development. The engineering contract involves the execution of an environmental protection system, which includes Bentonite cut-off walls and gravel venting to parts of the north site venting system, and ground water drainage provisions on part of the south site. Other works include demolition of parts of the north site which have been used for industrial purposes; excavation of lakes and ponds and formation of mounds to the north site industrial areas. A particular aspect of the works is the ground water drainage provisions of the environmental protection system, designed following a hydro-geological assessment.</p>

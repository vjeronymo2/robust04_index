			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. URGED TO REDUCE FORCES IN S. KOREA  </P> <P> A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday suggested reducing  U.S. forces stationed in South Korea and requiring Tokyo to foot the full bill  for keeping American troops in Japan.  </P> <P> "The United States can no longer sustain a disproportionate burden of  maintaining a common defense for the free world," said Sen. Carl Levin  (D-Mich). He is chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on conventional  forces and alliance defense.  </P> <P> Levin said in an interview with reporters that he will make his proposals in  the form of a "sense of the Senate" resolution that reflects the Senate's  sentiment but has no legal authority.  </P> <P> Specifically, Levin is proposing that the Bush Administration discuss with  South Korea a timetable "for a mutually acceptable . . . partial reduction of  our forces" and a plan to replace the U.S. commander who has operational  control over Korean forces with a South Korean general.  </P> <P> Levin estimated that the 43,000 U.S. troops in South Korea could be reduced to  about 10,000.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Labels that tell a story except for the certainty that selling it is extremely difficult just now. Once, we were told that only the so-called grandes marques, or big brands such as Moet &amp; Chandon and Mumm, had the stocks and blending ability to produce reliably good wine. Champagnes made by growers in much smaller operations were dismissed as kitchen sink concoctions; and as for supermarket champagne - well, that was simply undrinkable. In the British wine market today, the grandes marques (now re-defining themselves, in any case) have been losing share to a plethora of less familiar labels. Some are from individual growers, some from co-operatives, and some from substantial operations which specialise in buyer's own brand (BOB) champagne (such as the giant Marne et Champagne, the bottling lines of which supply a multitude of Pol Thises and Veuve Thats). This is not just because the British have become a nation of cheapskates but because UK wine merchants have discovered that growers' champagnes can be delicious and that some of the BOB cuvees can offer fair value, even in comparison with the dramatically improved sparkling wines of the new world. One merchant, Bibendum of London NW1, recently celebrated an offer of its four favourite growers' non-vintage champagnes by organising a blind comparison of them with five grandes marques. Extraordinarily, the preference of customers - on the ground of taste alone - was for the cheapest of all, Albert Beerens Reserve at Pounds 11.99. Their second favourite was another inexpensive Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs champagne from Michel Fearat at Pounds 13.99. Bollinger, the most expensive wine of all at Pounds 21.50, took only third place, just above Louis Roederer, Veuve Clicquot and Pommery. My favourite - and that of Bibendum's Willie Lebus - was the beautifully-balanced, mouth-filling Cuvee de Reserve from grower Henri Billiot of the top-quality Pinot Noir village of Ambonnay. At Pounds 17.99 (and available also from Adnams of Southwold), it is not cheap; but it is extremely well-priced for a connoisseur's champagne of this quality which could be served happily throughout a meal. For those who insist on a name their guests will recognise, Bibendum has a particularly good price on Pommery (Pounds 13.95), which showed well in this tasting. For champagne at rock-bottom prices, the supermarkets cannot be beaten and are at constant war with each other over price and quality. Probably the best value at the moment is Tesco's Louis Massing Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs at just Pounds 8.99, an all-Chardonnay wine apparently exclusively from top-rated vineyards. It tastes relatively hard-pressed and exhibits the green apple taste of very young champagne, but it is a perfectly respectable aperitif. Tesco describes Massing's own prime vineyards in Avize on the back label, but is careful not to claim that this wine is the produce of them because, in fact, Massing is a negociant, or champagne house, which also buys-in grapes. The picture is confused further by the number of growers who stick their own labels on the produce of the co-operative to which they belong, so that a champagne which looks very personal to the consumer really comes from an enormous blending vat. The Champenois have long had two letter codes which must appear on every champagne label; these allow those interested to identify the status of a given champagne producer. NM denotes one of the 250-plus champagne houses which buy-in and blend wine, and own vineyards as well. CM denotes one of the 42 co-operatives, which own about 200 brands between them. And MA denotes one of the several thousand BOB brands. Since last December, however, growers have had to declare themselves as either RM (one of the 2,100 producers of champagne from their own grapes) or RC (a grower which puts its own label on a co-operative wine). So, once these labels have made their way into commercial channels, we can all identify genuine growers' champagnes (RM), and genuine champagne houses (NM), although good short sight is required.</p>

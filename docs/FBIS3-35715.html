			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minsk January 28 TASS -- Three candidates for the  post of Belarusian parliament speaker outlined their programmes  for future activities on Friday.    Myechyslaw Hryb noted that he fully supports the government  programme for pulling the country out of the present crisis  situation. He sees the speaker's task in helping legislators to  come to mutual understanding on the basis of respect for  opinions of opponents.    The candidate pointed to the need to abide by law. "We shall  pull out of the crisis after we unite and establish law and  order in the republic," the legislator stressed.    He noted that he is against changing the present foreign  policy, does not intend to raise a question on remapping borders  and advocates independence, the nuclear-free status of the  republic and implementation of the signed international treaties.    Hryb stressed that he supports the development of relations  between Belarus and the east, above all with great Russia, which  should not prevent the republic from establishing good contacts  with the west.    Speaking of crime, Hryb, chairman of the parliamentary  commission on national security, defence and crime control,  said: "There is much talk, but results are too modest".    Accusations of lawlessness in the country forced former  speaker Stanislav Shushkevich and two power-wielding ministers  to step down.    The present situation will possibly be a new stage in the  political career of the chairman of the parliamentary commission  which is also responsible for the negative operation of law  enforcement bodies, condemned by the Belarusian parliament.  The programme-setting speech by Mikhail Marynych was short.  He said that he sees two main directions in the speaker's  activities: rallying of lawmakers to tackle economic problems  and to strengthen the young statehood of the country.    Viktar Hanchar explained his decision to contest the  speaker's post by desire to express "his protest at shadow  politicians who regard themselves cardinals" at the Belarusian  parliament.    The legislator underlined that it is necessary to take a  decision limiting powers of parliament speaker and vesting him  with strictly speaker's functions. Hanchar advocated reasonable  continuity of power: to hold presidential elections late in  April and early general elections in September.    Instead of electing a new speaker, which was scheduled for  12:00, local time, lawmakers began to discuss the candidates.  Initially, this procedural item was forgotten in the heated  atmosphere in the parliament building.    The debate was brief. The floor was taken only by one  legislator -- representative from the opposition Vitaliy  Malashko. He said that the opposition did not intend to  participate in "this cheap show" and called on all other  lawmakers to follow suit.    Then the session adjourned till 13:00, local time.</p>

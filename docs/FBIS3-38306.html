The real GDP will probably expand by  "more than 1 percent" on annual average.    For the first time since 1990, the economy will grow again  in  all West European countries. Unemployment, however, will  continue to rise. In 1993, demand and production declined by  about 0.5 percent in West Europe, according to Ifo. Even though  the low point of the recession was reached in spring 1993, the  overall economic production has revived only slightly since  then. Because of a decline in the utilization of facilities and  marked efforts by the companies to reduce costs, employment  continued to decline so that the unemployment rate -- 10.5  percent -- was about 1.5 percentage point above that of the  previous year. The increase in prices went slightly down to 3.5  percent on annual average, following 4 percent the previous year.    In 1994, "all large demand aggregates show positive rates of  change," the Ifo analysis continues. Low interests and stimuli  by demand from countries outside Europe have a reviving effect.  In particular, the U.S. economy will probably act as an engine;  there, a growth of the real GDP of 2.5 to 3 percent is expected.  Despite declining interests, consumption in West Europe rises  only very gradually, which is particularly due to the bad  situation on the labor market. According to the Ifo economists,  "a stabilization will probably take place" by the end of 1994,  but the unemployment rate will still be about 1 percentage point  above that in 1993. For the gross fixed investments, Ifo  expects an increase by about 1 percent; construction investments  will not quite reach last year's level.    The institutes thinks that exports will go up by 4 percent  and imports by 3 percent. The rate of price increases is to  continue to decline slightly, this year to 3 percent. Price  stabilization would be even stronger, the study says, if many  countries had not raised indirect taxes, rates, fees, and  administered prices.</p>

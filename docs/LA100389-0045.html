			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VENTURA WOMAN BADLY BEATEN IN STORE  </P> <P> The 27-year-old manager of a Radio Shack store in Newbury Park was in very  critical condition Monday after a San Diego man entered the store and beat her  on the head with a metal object, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department  reported. The man was arrested a short time later by deputies acting on a  description of the suspect.  </P> <P> Investigators could find no motive for the savage attack in the usually  tranquil community. "I have no idea why this individual would do this," said  Detective Mike Barnes.  </P> <P> Stephanie Ann Ramos, a resident of Ventura, was rushed to Los Robles Regional  Medical Center in Thousand Oaks after a customer in the store in the 700 block  of Wendy Drive noticed her lying on the floor and called for help, Sgt. Marty  Rouse said.  </P> <P> Barnes would not divulge what type of metal object was used in the attack.  </P> <P> Deputies later arrested Rossano Barin Santonil, 27, on a street nearby, Rouse  said. Authorities were given a description of a suspect by a man who saw him in  the store minutes before the attack, Rouse said.  </P> <P> Santonil was being held at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempted  murder. Rouse said investigators found no evidence that the man intended to  commit a robbery or that he knew Ramos.  </P> <P> "It's very shocking," Rouse said.  </P></p>

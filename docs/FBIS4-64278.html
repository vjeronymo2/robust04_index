			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Isnard: "United States Has Bagged 70 </F> Percent of Mideast Arms Market Since 1991"]    [Text] In a steadily declining world arms market, France is  finding it more and more difficult to export its military  equipment, or even keep its current clients. The United States,  meanwhile, is consolidating its position as the world's largest  arms supplier, while the Middle East remains far and away the  biggest buyer. There is a connection between these two facts:  The 1991 Gulf war had and continues to have immense impact on  the market, and France--unlike the United States, which has  carried off more than two-thirds of the arms trade in the  region--has not yet reaped the benefits, appearances  notwithstanding.    Arms exports globally have fallen by close to two-thirds in  the last 10 years, according to estimates (expressed in current  dollars) from the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA).  Exports for 1984 totaled $72.8 billion, while the 1992 figure  was $25.5 billion. The decline is thus perceptible. Exports to  the Middle East have declined proportionately, but the latter  remains the number one regional market for the arms trade, with  three major clients: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates  [UAE], and Israel. Iraq was at the top of the list for some  time, but the post-Gulf war embargo war ended that, and nowadays  Egypt, Qatar, and Kuwait, to cite only a few examples, are much  bigger customers.    L'ARMEMENT, a review published by the General Delegation for  Armaments (DGA), focuses attention in its latest issue on the  fact that the United States has won about 70 percent of the  contracts signed in the Gulf since the war against Saddam  Husayn. More than one-third of all American arms deliveries go  to this region--more precisely, to Saudi Arabia and Israel, the  biggest beneficiaries of what the Americans call FMS (foreign  military sales): government-to-government transfers, and even  gifts, of material. The practice has accelerated since the Gulf  war, says L'ARMEMENT, since the volume of this new type of  transaction has tripled over the last five years.    France, by contrast, is cutting a rather pathetic figure. Of  course, it is not doing as badly as the arms makers would have  people believe. But the general trend is down, with annual sales  over the next few years expected to average about 30 billion  French francs [Fr]. According to provisional estimates, orders  taken in 1993 totaled about Fr40 billion, down 12 to 13 percent  from the Fr45.7 billion in 1992. Ten years ago, orders amounted  to almost Fr62 billion. The defense minister had hoped new  orders for 1993 would reach at least Fr50 billion, but the  target was not met. True, 1992 saw an unusual surge with  Taiwan's order (more than Fr30 billion all by itself) for 60  Mirage 2000-5. But a new trend seems to be emerging that could  further aggravate France's already delicate position: Some  clients--and not just minor ones, since they are Middle East  countries--are reneging on contracts already signed between the  two states.    This is what is happening in Kuwait. That country's  legislative body has reopened the issue of financing terms for  the order of 155mm artillery pieces from France. The Kuwaiti  Army had apparently underestimated the extra costs, beyond  actual acquisition, involved in putting these batteries into  service. In its Wednesday 6 April issue, the weekly strategic  newsletter TTU--known for getting its information from highly  reliable sources--claims to have learned that Kuwait did not  really need the French arms but signed the contract to "commit a  still-reluctant France" to play an active role in the area.    It is also happening in the UAE. In 1993, France sold it 390  Leclerc battle tanks--not counting about fifty armored emergency  repair vehicles--for the sum of Fr21 billion. On condition that  French manufacturers involved in the deal reinvest Fr15 billion  in the country as an offset. The two parties are having serious  problems identifying domains of possible cooperation, and the  UAE are now leaping on this pretext, threatening to renegotiate  the entire contract if the investment commitment is not met.    In Saudi Arabia, whose leaders are already being quietly  urged to renegotiate the country's contracts with France for  maintenance of warships and missiles, the vicissitudes of the  Kuwaiti deal are being followed very closely. In fact, the  Saudis too are considering a purchase of Leclerc tanks, and  their current budgetary problems scarcely incline them toward  generosity in their dealings with France.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> MARGALIT PERFORMS AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE  </P> <P> Elfin and mischievous, Margalit scampers about in a delicate and private way  and tells simple little tales amplified by her expressive face and powerful  voice. At Santa Monica College on Friday night, her solo program ranged from a  delicious yarn about her youth in Aden, the former British protectorate, to a  collection of rather fey little pieces about motherhood, children and world  peace.  </P> <P> Outfitted in a bright yellow gown and a fanciful headdress concocted by Leslie  Yarmo, she evoked a land of "hot wind, hot sun" and a loving, vivacious family  in "Through the Gates of Aden." Sketching in the details with rhythmic,  repetitious bursts of simple words -- in the fashion of a story for small  children -- she would stop to wail with the harsh, sustained tones of a muezzin  calling the faithful. Her birdlike intensity and quicksilver shifts in tone and  posture made the piece truly magical.  </P> <P> In "I Wish" and "Mom, Goliath is Dead" -- groups of short, simple poems  delivered with passages of drumming, piping, eccentric, springy little walks  and animal sounds -- Margalit became a feisty little child. ("I wish my mom  were president of the world!") A trifle cloying, these pieces were nonetheless  peppered with wit and invention, qualities in short supply in "I Am a Mother; I  Am a Wonderful Mother."  </P> <P> The final piece, "Yemenite Wedding," looked -- with its elaborate costumes and  tapestry set (by David Sharir) as though it would unfold at a leisurely pace.  Alas, it was over before the five characters had quite taken root in the mind's  eye.CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading TRADING volume in stock index futures nearly doubled in London yesterday as investors reacted to the setbacks in New York and Tokyo caused by the political crisis in Russia, writes Terry Byland. The December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index traded for most of the day at a discount to fair value, but early losses were quickly recovered and the market closed on a steadier note. The initial loss was not large but, although few sellers appeared either in equities or futures, December fell to 2,988, driving the underlying stock market down. The recovery then began and by midsession the December contract stood at the day's peak of 3,030, a premium of 28 to cash but only around 4 points above fair value. The future topped off as Wall Street failed to hold all of its early gain, and December closed at 3,026, a 20-point premium to cash but lagging behind the fair value premium of around 24 points. Turnover jumped to 15,230 contracts from Tuesday's 8,929. Business in traded options also rose sharply, to 42,110 bargains from 23,186. In the FT-SE 100 option, volume rose to 14,753 lots. Individual stock options were headed by British Steel (6,307) as a UK securities house rerated the stock. Also active was the Euro FT-SE option (4,436). Awaiting President Clinton's healthcare proposals, Glaxo traded 1,833 contracts.</p>

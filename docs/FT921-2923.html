			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Ukraine explains U-turn on debt UKRAINE yesterday justified its decision to back down and agree to share collective responsibility for the former Soviet Union's debt with the other republics. Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister, said Ukraine had obtained important concessions on Vnesheconombank, the bank through which the foreign debt is serviced and which will now be controlled primarily by Russia and Ukraine together. Mr Fokin was defending a change of stance by Ukraine, which was previously demanding that it should be allowed to pay its share of the debt to western creditors independently of the other republics. Underlining the haphazard state of the debt negotiations, Mr Fokin admitted that Ukraine had not yet actually signed the critical Group of Seven memorandum - which binds all the republics to 'joint and several' responsibility for the debt - because officials had misplaced the text. Signature by Ukraine was a condition set for the restructuring of Vnesheconombank, and Mr Fokin insisted that Ukraine did intend to sign. He said the bank would in future be governed by an inter-state council which will have three co-chairs, one from Ukraine, one from Russia and a third representing the other 10 republics on a rotating basis. The voting structure of Vnesheconombank is also to be slanted in Ukraine's favour, Mr Fokin said. Votes are to be distributed according to each republic's share of the debt, but decisions can only be taken if they are backed by 80 per cent of the votes. Mr Fokin said this structure could give Ukraine, which has agreed to pay 16.37 per cent of the debt, veto power if it had the support of any one of the medium-sized republics. The bank's operations are to be fully transparent and subject to the supervision of an independent auditor. Mr Fokin also reiterated plans to introduce a separate currency in two to four months.</p>

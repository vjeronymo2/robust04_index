			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). The EPA announced its proposed approval of the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations on April 4, 1994 (58 FR 15683&hyph;15686) and requested public comments. No comments were received. In this FR action, the EPA is approving two of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, specifically the 1990 base year CO emissions inventory, and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP will be acted upon in separate FR actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated previously, the EPA proposed approval of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15683&hyph;15686), and no comments were received regarding the proposed approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). The EPA in this action is approving the following elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP: the 1990 base year CO emissions inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. These two elements meet all of the applicable requirements of the CAA. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP that were submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1992, or by November 15, 1993, will be or have been acted upon in separate FR actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 23, 1992, the Governor of Texas submitted to the EPA a SIP narrative revision for CO concerning El Paso, which included the general SIP revision and the oxygenated fuels regulations. The State also submitted to the EPA a completed emissions inventory on November 17, 1992, and a commitment to upgrade the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> I/M program on November 15, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA announced its proposed approval of the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15683&hyph;15686) and requested public comments. No comments were received. In that rulemaking action, the EPA described in detail its interpretation of title I and its rationale for proposing to approve these elements of the El Paso CO SIP after taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. It is important to note that the El Paso CO 1990 base year inventory consists of the following list of the CO peak season daily emissions estimates in tons per day (t/d): Point Sources, nine t/d; Area Sources, three t/d; Mobile On-Road Sources, 291 t/d; Mobile Nonroad Sources, 67 t/d; Total Sources, 370 t/d.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final action on the El Paso CO SIP is unchanged from the April 4, 1994, proposed approval action. The EPA prepared a detailed analysis in its Technical Support Document as a part of its proposed approval and which is available for review along with the current FR document at the locations referenced in the beginning of this FR document. The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action that the EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred to the April 4, 1994, proposed approval FR action for a full discussion of the action that the EPA is now finalizing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 15683 (April 4, 1994). As noted elsewhere in this action, the EPA received no public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from table two to table three under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989, and revised via memorandum from the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to the Regional Administrators dated October 4, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has reviewed these revisions to the El Paso CO SIP and is approving the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations in this action. Other elements described above will be or have been addressed in separate FR documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

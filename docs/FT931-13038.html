			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Accidents at work 'cost up to Pounds 15bn' WORKPLACE accidents and ill-health cost Britain Pounds 10bn-Pounds 15bn a year, with employers bearing Pounds 4bn-Pounds 9bn of the expense, according to an investigation due to be published by the Health and Safety Executive. Employers appear to be seriously underestimating the true cost of accidents and wrongly assume that they will be fully covered by insurance, Mr John Rimington, HSE director-general, said yesterday. 'Boards of directors need to take full and proper account of what these events are actually costing them,' he said. The estimates are the first attempt to put a realistic price tag on occupational injuries and ill-health since the discovery in 1991 that official figures were seriously flawed. A survey of 40,000 households revealed then that more than two-thirds of workplace accidents remained unreported in breach of the law - a far higher proportion than previously thought. The latest study, to be published in full in May, calculates the costs to society of occupational accidents and illness. The estimates include social security and National Health Service expenses, as well as financial and other losses suffered by victims. The total cost is equivalent to 1.75-2.75 per cent of gross domestic product, the HSE said. About 1.6m accidents resulting in injury are estimated to occur each year and about 750,000 workers suffer occupational ill-health which results in time off work. For employers, costs of accidents and ill-health include Pounds 750m paid in employers' liability insurance to cover compensation to injured workers, the cost of recruiting and training replacements for those forced to give up work and the cost of property loss. Employers' expenses equalled 5-10 per cent of gross trading profits, the HSE estimated. Detailed case studies of five organisations showed that companies' uninsured costs could be between eight and 36 times greater than the costs of insurance premiums. This is substantially greater than the ratio of 4:1 which is commonly used by industrial safety experts to estimate the total costs of accidents within individual organisations. Typically, companies pay for employers', product and public liability insurance, but fail to calculate fully the costs arising from accidents of production delays, fines, legal fees and management and clerical time taken up by investigations. Mr Rimington said the HSE had been surprised by the results of the case studies. The Costs of Accidents at Work. Health and Safety Executive. Stationery Office. Pounds 8.50</p>

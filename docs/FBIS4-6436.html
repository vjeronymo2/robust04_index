			<p>BFN     [Text] After analyzing available data on the violent riots  in Medan, North Sumatra, authorities have reached the conclusion  that the rioters tended to employ tactics used by former PKI  [Indonesian Communist Party] members and that the riots were  masterminded by a group of individuals who called themselves  SBSI [Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union].    Lieutenant General Mantiri, chief of general staff of the  Indonesian Armed Forces [ABRI], said ABRI has never recognized  the SBSI because its legal existence is not recognized by the  government. Therefore, ABRI will take strong action against  anyone involved in the destruction and looting of property  without fear or favor and in accordance with existing laws.    Commenting on rumors that racist violence and riots also  took  place in various parts of Jakarta, Lt. Gen. Mantiri said the  rumors were not true. The rumors may have been deliberately  spread by irresponsible elements to create anxiety among the  public.</p>

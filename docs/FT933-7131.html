			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Curbs on secrecy 'not enough' THE CAMPAIGN for Freedom of Information yesterday attacked government plans to reduce secrecy, saying they did not go far enough. The pressure group said last month's white paper on open government contained some 'positive' elements but stopped well short of delivering freedom of information. There was now 'a foot in the door,' it said in the August issue of its Secrets newspaper. It was particularly critical of the proposed code of practice which would require Whitehall to comply with reasonable requests for information. Too many of the code's proposals represent victories for the 'culture of government secrecy' which Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, was trying to overturn. The code's 'overwhelming, central flaw' was its rejection of direct access to documents. The government was promising to answer questions, not let people see correspondence, documents or reports. The group welcomed the proposed statutory right of access to non-computerised personal files and health and safety information. Mr Waldegrave said last month that public access to information would be restricted only where there were good reasons. Secrets.

			<p>BFN     [Text] France Info interviewed the commander of the French  forces in Djibouti, Colonel Gandouli. The airlift between  Djibouti and Sanaa to evacuate Westerners -- among them the 200  or 300 French nationals still living in the Yemeni capital -- is  continuing.    [Begin recording] [Gandouli] Operation Diapason 2 was  launched today. Its aim is to evacuate those nationals based in  Sanaa wishing to leave Sanaa. We set up an airlift between  Djibouti and Sanaa to evacuate these nationals. We have two  Transall [Air Force cargo planes] currently shuttling between  Djibouti and Sanaa. Two Italian aircraft should join them  tomorrow to reinforce this airlift.    [Correspondent Isabelle Dorre] Are there many French  nationals wishing to leave Sanaa?    [Gandouli] I believe between 200 and 250 have asked to  leave.    [Dorre] Will they stay in Djibouti or will they return to  France?    [Gandouli] As far as I know they will return to France. Some  80 percent of all the nationals we welcomed yesterday left for  France on an Air France flight or for other destinations on  Lufthansa, Aeroflot, or Italian aircraft. If more European  Union nationals or other nationals were to ask to be evacuated  to Djibouti, we would naturally evacuate them within the limits  of our capacities. There are not only French aircraft, but also  two German planes flying back and forth between Djibouti and  Sanaa.    [Dorre] You have met people who came back from Sanaa. What  did they say about the situation on the ground?    [Gandouli] The situation was tense at one point, but the  situation in Sanaa itself is not dangerous now.    [Dorre] Are there other evacuation operations under way?    [Gandouli] The evacuation operation is called Diapason.  There is a Diapason 1 operation under way, it is mainly using  naval means, including helicopters, to evacuate nationals from  Yemen's southern coast. The Diapason 2 operation is mainly a  Djibouti-Sanaa airlift to evacuate nationals from Sanaa. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Own Information report: "Homeless Officer More Dangerous </F> Than Partisan"]    [Text] There are over 7,000 servicemen without apartments  in Moscow today, most of them senior officers from Defense  Ministry main and central directorates.    In January 1994 Defense Minister Pavel Grachev asked Boris  Yeltsin to allocate 28 billion rubles to ensure the minimum  improvement in the provision of housing for high-ranking Moscow  officers and generals. Yeltsin instructed Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin to allocate the required amount. Chernomyrdin  redirected the document to the Finance Ministry, which told the  military 20 April 1994 that there is no money for housing.    Under the Soviet authorities high-ranking servicemen waited  for housing in the capital for two years at most. Now there are  102 generals and admirals alone in Moscow without housing.  Russia-wide there are 169,700 officers without apartments.</p>

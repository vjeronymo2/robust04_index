			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Kurbanov: "The New Railroads of Turkmenia"] </F>   [Text] In connection with the plans to develop  Turkmenia, the railroad workers of this state have been faced  with the task of further rebuilding existing lines and  constructing new ones.    The interests, let us say, of the Balkan Velayat -- a region  with tremendous reserves of oil, salt, iodine, bromine and hard  coal --require an exit, not only to the center of the country,  but also to the north. It is planned to run new branch lines  from Gazandzhyk (Kazandzhyk) to the open-pit mines of Gyzylgaya  (Kyzylkaya) (about 150 kilometers) and from Krasnovodsk (now the  city of Turkmenbashi) to the salt developments.    A mainline track to the Turkmen subtropics has already been  laid from the Gazandzhyk Station to the south. This is needed  for development of Turkmenistan's agriculture. Several harvests  a year may be obtained here with an approach to the subtropic  area of the Amu-Darya waters along the Karakum Canal (this  project is already being carried out successfully). On the other  hand, the branch line from Gazandzhyk to the border settlement  of Gyzylatrek (Kyzylatrek), over 300 kilometers long, will be an  alternative, a second link of the Trans-Asian mainline, with an  exit to Iran and Turkey. In this case, about 80 kilometers of  rails remain to be laid from the Turkmen border to the closest  station in Iran.    To the northeast of Turkmenistan, the Dashkhovuz (Gashauz)  Station will be further developed and will become the country's  major new railroad junction. The Dashkhovuz Velayat is a major  producer of agricultural goods: grain, rice, cotton, sesame, raw  silk and karakul sheep. Last year alone the supply of fresh  vegetables from Dashkhovuz by the inhabitants of Ashgabat made  it possible to reduce the urgency of the "vitamin" problem  several-fold. Motor vehicle transport between the north and the  capital of the republic, however, is expensive. The prices for  Dashkhovuz tomatoes and cabbage are very high.    A branch line is now being constructed in Dashkhovuz from  the  Koneurgench Station to the small town of Kerney. It is possible  that a mainline by-passing the Uzbek territory will soon have to  be built from the Dashkhovuz Station, since this section, up to  the junction station of Gazochag (Gazochak), for the time being  has strained relations with the Central Asian section --  primarily because of disputes about the engineering shoulders  for locomotive traffic and about safeguarding freight.    It is planned to run another branch along the left bank of  the Amu-Darya from Chardzhev (Chardzhou) to Kerki, along the  motor-railroad bridge to the Amu-Darya Station. The  communicating road is now cut off from the area of medium flow  of the Amu-Darya. Thanks to the new branch line, it will become  faster and more reasonable to transport sulfur, potassium salt,  marble, cotton and grain from the southeastern raw materials  "corner" to the center of the country.    Large reserves of valuable raw material have been discovered  in the eastern, Lebap Velayat. The future mainline from  Chardzhev to Kerki must therefore be linked up with the  presently operating branch line from Mary to Gushga (Kushka).  This "ring" will make it possible for Turkmenistan to exit  through Afghanistan and Pakistan to ports on the Indian Ocean  and the Persian Gulf.    To a certain extent, all these plans are being implemented  today. Dozens of kilometers have already been laid in all  directions. Work on laying a road to the border town of Sarakhs  is particularly intensive: almost the entire 120-kilometer  roadbed and 50 kilometers of mainline tracks have been  constructed. The road is, of course, experiencing a shortage of  rails and ties, and does not have enough construction equipment,  but things are moving. The outlines of a developed transport  structure for Turkmenia are gradually appearing.</p>

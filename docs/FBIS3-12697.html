The official spokesman added that Morocco, as it pays homage  to the souls of the martyrs, who were martyrs of blind  extremism, strongly condemns this hideous crime which was  perpetrated at a time when the international organizations were  expecting that peace would soon prevail in the region and were  according particular importance to the recent  Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    The spokesman concluded by saying that Morocco, while  calling  for the perpetrators of this hideous crime to be severely and  decisively punished and for the escalation of violence to be  halted, considers that such acts must be an incentive to  international organizations to make preparations for  guaranteeing peace, security, and the legitimate rights of the  Palestinian people.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich: </F> "To See the Essence"]    [Text] There are events in people's lives that define their  destiny and development for many years to come. Thereby, it is  no accident that the monetary merger treaty between Belarus and  Russia has attracted such attention. The ink on the paper had  not yet dried -- as they simply put it -- when this document  became the focal point of many political disputes. Various  borderline opinions and statements -- varying from complete  approval to absolute rejection -- appeared. Therefore, I  consider it necessary to explain why the Belarusian Government  took this step, what is the essence of the document concerning  the single ruble zone, what does this agreement provide our  economy, people, and the Republic as a whole.  <H5>  From the Previous History of the Agreement </H5>   We all know that after the fall of the USSR, two tendencies  prevailed in the development of newly independent states: The  first one was a disintegration theory, supporters of which  advocated complete disintegration and the second one -- the idea  of integration.    The government of our Republic always favored the process of  integration. I already foresee a question: How can I explain  my signing of the Belaya Vezha agreement? Why did I undertake  this step? Only because it was necessary to set up a civilized  procedure for that process of disintegration, which was widely  spreading across a big state. Viskuli initiators cannot be  blamed for the fall of the USSR: The key reason for this was  Gorbachev's illogical policy, which brought the Union to a state  of utter chaos. Because by December 1991 -- when the Baltic  republics and Ukraine declared that they were leaving the USSR  and the Russian Supreme Soviet declared the supremacy of its  laws over the USSR Constitution -- the Soviet Union as a state  ceased to exist. Interethnic conflicts were erupting.    Let us now recall the gist of the Belaya Vezha agreement.  They advocated the need to set up a joint economic zone,  thereby building economic relations "on the basis of the  existing tender -- the ruble" -- pursuing an agreed-upon policy  in the budget sector; coordinating activities among customs  services; providing for the free flow of transit shipments.    Therefore, it is easy to see -- if we compare the Viskuli  agreement with the monetary merger pact -- that the second  document reflects the agreement that had specified the setting  up and functioning of the CIS.    We have never opposed and do not oppose the CIS. However,  what happened within the CIS over the past two and a half years  cannot be called anything other than the stalling of development.    Given this situation, the expediency of setting a close  economic union between Belarus and Russia, based on a single  monetary system, cannot raise any doubts. By the way, we are  not inventing anything. The joint monetary system --as an  expression of the highest degree of integration between states  -- existed within the framework of the former USSR, and our aim  is to restore its advantages to our Republic.    Let us discuss the key aspect of this issue -- the economy.    Indexes of specific proportions of resources imported to  Belarus and of exported Belarusian products show the importance  of cooperation with Russia for our Republic. For example, in  1993 (which was not the best year for our economy), of all the  oil used in Belarus, we had to import 86 percent; natural gas --  100 percent; rolled steel -- 42 percent. At the same time, of  all exports of Belarusian-made goods, Russia bought 51 percent  of all trucks, 44.4 percent of all tractors, 42.8 percent of all  refrigerators and deep-freezers, and 42.8 percent of all silk.    In other words, our economy, first and foremost, our  industry  is closely connected with the Russian market for raw materials  and products. When these relations broke down due to Russia's  increased prices -- up to world levels -- for energy resources  and raw materials exported to Belarus, our Republic immediately  suffered "a breakdown."    I can provide you with some figures. Over the first quarter  of this year alone, the volume of net national income in Belarus  fell by 38 percent in comparison with the same period last year.  Due to the failure to sell products because of high prices, on  both domestic and foreign markets, warehouses and trading  facilities have amassed Belarusian-made industrial products  worth some 4.7 trillion rubles. Tens of thousands of large  industrial enterprises are faced with the threat of shutting  down. The specter of unemployment has begun to haunt thousands  of people.    This is the answer to the question: What has happened?  <H5>  On the Gist of the Agreement </H5>   The agreement includes the treaty itself and seven [as  published] bilateral documents, which represent its  indispensable constituent parts.    The process of unifying the monetary systems will be carried  out in two stages. During the first stage, which will begin on  1 May of this year, all tariff and tax restrictions, as well as  customs duties on trade will be lifted. It is natural that this  applies only to goods produced on the territory of Belarus and  Russia. At the same time, customs duties will be imposed on  products produced in other countries (currently, a single  mechanism regarding their functioning is being drafted).    Nontariff barriers -- quoting and licensing which rule out  dual taxation -- will be retained until the monetary merger is  completed, because these quotas --proceeding from the volumes of  mutual deliveries between enterprises -- have already been set.    The most acute issue in the package of monetary merger  documents is the Belarusian National Bank issue. You know that  Belarusian National Bank Chairman S. S. Bahdankevich signed this  agreement with reservations regarding its clause No. 5, which  contradicts some of the paragraphs of the Belarusian  Constitution. I can understand him. The documents, which  concern every citizen of Belarus, were drafted while one  constitution was in force and they were ready and signed after  another had gone into effect. I hope that a solution will be  found. A formula, enabling us to consider all mutually  beneficial interests and on this basis strengthening Belarusian  statehood as an equal and esteemed member of the world  community, will be found.    I am not a naive man and I understand perfectly well that it  is not very ethical and correct to modify the Constitution,  which has just been adopted. Therefore, we, having signed the  agreement, had set up a basis for future talks. When Supreme  Soviet Chairman M. I. Hryb and I were present at the recent CIS  summit, we met with Russian President B. N. Yeltsin and found an  understanding on his part that it is necessary to formulate  clause No. 5 in such a way that could unable us to painlessly  resolve the constitution issue.    Many people ask: If separate clauses of the agreement  contradicted the new Constitution, why had I signed it?  Everything is extremely simple: I signed this agreement for  the sake of the remaining nine documents that will come into  force on 1 May. For how long can we hold our economy in this  crisis? My signature meant that all customs duties will be  removed on the fixed date, meaning a reduction of the total cost  of products by 30-40 percent.    As a result, production costs will be reduced, Belarusian  producers will receive access to traditional Russian markets.  Eventually, it will cause a reduction in retail prices and an  improvement in the life of our people. These are the motives,  the only ones (and not political competitiveness) which dictated  my actions.    As for the exchange rate of Belarusian "hares" for Russian  cash, which is of especial interest for our citizens, the  exchange will be carried out at a 1:1 rate to a maximum of  200,000 Belarusian rubles per individual. Therefore, if, for  example, a family consists of five members, then it will be able  to exchange "hares" for the sum of 1 million rubles [R]. In  addition, individuals who have bank accounts and deposits will  be able to exchange their money at the same exchange rate,  however, the total will be limited to R1 million. However,  together with the increase in retail prices in Russia, the  aforementioned maximum sums of money that are subject to  exchange at a 1:1 rate will also be increased.    The issue with the exchange rate of savings, which exceed  the  aforementioned sums, and the revaluation of balances of  accounts, inventories, assets and liabilities of enterprises,  organizations, and all legal entities is more complicated. It  will be set and drawn up on the basis of the parity of Russian  and Belarusian currencies' buying capacity and their market rate  against the dollar at the moment of the monetary merger (the  current rate is some 1:5).  <H5>  Who Is Against the Agreement? </H5>   I do not want to waste time on debates with those who  consider each decision of the government in both states to be  "evil," "incorrect," or even "criminal." There are only a few of  them; however, they are rowdy and make much noise.    Well, I have to admit that there are serious politicians and  economists with their own vision of the issue among the  adversaries of this agreement. Well, each person can have his  own opinion and we have to respect his right. I am ready to  argue with such people and defend my viewpoint.    I could conditionally divide such serious opponents into  three categories in line with their positions.    The first group: The so-called "westerners." Their key  argument is as follows: We should have concluded agreements not  with Russia but with West European states. They have culture,  they are civilized, they eat "bread and butter" while our  Eastern neighbor has its own problems. It seems beautiful and  convincing for many people. However, we should also consider  historic traditions, the difference in economic development, the  degree of integration of our economies, and the living standard.  Besides, reality shows that the only real and prospective  source of mineral resources (eventually, this is the key factor  of our economy) for Belarus can only be Russia. We could come  to Europe as equal partners only with Russia.    The second group is represented by "isolationists." If  "westerners" criticize us for the allegedly flawed way of  development, these people do not admit the Belarusian-Russian  negotiations at all. Hence, their cries about the encroachment  on our sovereignty, undermining of the statehood, betrayal of  the national interests. Sometimes, the representatives of this  trend speak about economic integration, political unions (let us  recall the notorious Black-Baltic Seas union), however, they  boil over everything. It seems to me that there is no neighbor  left to whom they had not issued territorial claims. This is  the first issue. Second, how can politicians speak about  political integration if they already agreed that "national  interests are superior to the interests of a person?" Mankind  has already gone down this path and stained it with seas of  blood.    The supporters of the so-called "tough" sovereignty, who  foresee not only a breakdown of economic relations with Russia  but a confrontation with it by issuing demands for leasing  payments for the dislocation of Russian troops on Belarusian  territory.    What can I say regarding this?    1. It is a well-known fact that Ukrainian attempts to divide  the Black Sea Fleet with Russia have not brought about either  economic advantages, or political stability.    2. Russian military units stationed on the Belarusian  territory, in particular, the antiaircraft protection troops,  ensure the security both for Russia and Belarus.    3. Belarus profits directly from this situation because it  can reduce its own Armed Forces without harming its national  security.    There is one more group of adversaries of the agreement.  They are filthy dealers in the currency black market on both  sides of our eastern border. They are less noisy and  eye-catching but not less dangerous. They use the  underdevelopment of our financial infrastructure; they play on  the difference in exchange rates and prices for essential  foodstuff and consumer goods and to generate substantial income.  Who will voluntarily refuse such huge profits? Therefore, these  people can go to extremes and hamper efforts to put our house in  order, to raise the economy, to introduce civilized economic  methods.    An attempt to torpedo and drown the idea of an economic  union  of two fraternal states will hardly win. Finally, the  Belarusian-Russian agreement responds to the core interests of  our peoples, and this is the key issue. By the way, according  to polls, conducted by a range of sociological agencies in our  Republic, including independent ones, more than 65 percent of  the Belarusian population support the monetary merger of our two  states.    Currently, all, who support the government's policy aimed at  setting up a strong, long-term union with Russia, live through  hard times. We are experiencing tough pressure from various  sides. Nevertheless, we have made our choice. I am ready to  bring this issue to an end because I am deeply convinced that  only in the union with Russia will we find our salvation, the  salvation of our young sovereign state in which, and I am sure  of that, our children and grandchildren and all the generations  to come will live happily.    Therefore, I am addressing Belarusian citizens: You will be  judges in this historic process. Only the people's opinion can  be a criterion for the truth.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SNOW SLOWS DOWN LIFE IN TOKYO  </P> <P> Pollution, overcrowding and other ills of urban life may leave the residents of  Japan's capital unfazed, but it took just a few inches of snow today to delay  tens of thousands on their appointed rounds.  </P> <P> The season's first snowfall forced a two-hour closure of Tokyo's international  airport. Commuter and inner-city trains ran late. And 23 people got hurt in  falls on slippery streets, the Kyodo News Service reported.  </P> <P> All the breakdowns and confusion stemmed from a snowfall that left only three  to five inches around the area that sometimes goes through winter with no snow.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Observer: Knightmare The troubles of the UK Tory party may have helped paper over the cracks in Britain's opposition parties. But a brief skirmish at yesterday's annual meeting of MSF, Britain's fifth biggest trade union, suggests that Labour party leader John Smith ought to enjoy his honeymoon while it lasts. The MSF rescued Smith last year, when he was in danger of losing his battle over one-member, one-vote in selecting parliamentary candidates. Yesterday, 'Red' Ted Knight, once Labour leader of the rebel Lambeth council, along with a comfortable majority of MSF members, passed a motion condemning the MSF delegates who had helped bail out Smith at the last moment. Standing up and being counted alongside Red Ted was Dave Nellist, the former Coventry MP expelled from the Labour party, and Jim Mortimer, the Labour party's former general secretary.</p>

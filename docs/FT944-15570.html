			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Grants vital in tipping the investment balance Samsung's new electronics complex underlines the fierce competition between areas of Europe for investments, and the substantial incentives offered to tip the balance. In the summer the rift between UK government departments over the DTI aid available for inward investment was exposed in a leaked letter in which Mr Michael Portillo, then chief secretary to the Treasury, criticised the use of grants to deal with regional employment imbalances. But Mr Tim Eggar, trade minister, said on BBC Radio 4 yesterday: 'We have got to live in the real world, and the real world is that major investment decisions of this kind inevitably involve a level of government assistance.' Samsung could, however, have been given more money had it gone to Spain, the other shortlisted location for the project. The Northern Development Company was told informally that more was on offer in Spain than in the UK. Samsung's choice of the north-east will have been influenced by its happy experience in the region, where it has expanded an investment at Billingham, Cleveland. But nobody in the economic development field doubts the important of cash incentives. At Wynyard, a development area, Samsung has been offered Pounds 58m in regional selective assistance, on the basis of a Pounds 450m project. If, as hoped locally, the investment goes up to Pounds 600m, applications for further assistance could be made. In addition, government-backed developer English Partnerships is putting in Pounds 9m and Cleveland County Council and Teesside Training and Enterprise Council Pounds 5m each. Other council aid and European funds have produced an additional Pounds 1.85m. As late as last Friday the Northern Development Company did not know if it had secured the project. Mr John Bridge, chief executive, believes the Samsung study team made its decision only on Friday, and that Mr KH Lee, company chairman, confirmed it at the weekend.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      INVESTMENTS FROM THE FAR EAST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Date        Name                  Where            Project Cost    Jobs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989        Toyota Motor          East Midlands    Pounds   700m   3,000 1989        Fujitsu               North-east       Pounds 4,000m   1,500             (Semiconductor) 1992        Honda Motor           South-west       Pounds   300m   1,300 1989        Murata                South-west       Pounds   460m     953             Manufacturing 1993        ASAT                  Wales            Pounds    42m   1,000 1989        Yachito Industrial    West Midlands    Pounds    25m   1,000 1991        Nissan Motor          North-east       Pounds   150m   1,600  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: DTI  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Unions to press for Pounds 700 pay rise LOCAL GOVERNMENT unions yesterday endorsed a proposal by Nalgo, the public-sector union, to press for a flat-rate pay increase of Pounds 700 a year for 750,000 local authority workers. The claim would add 5.5 per cent to local government wage costs. The claim, to be submitted to employers on April 6, ignores the government's ceiling of a 1.5 per cent pay increase in the public sector.</p>

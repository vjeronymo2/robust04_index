			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Gardening: When you need an expert . . . - Robin Lane Fox knows where to turn if his plants have fire-blight or Black Spot IN AUTUMN, leaves are suppose to fall romantically: this year, some of mine have made a premature exit. Old-fashioned roses took their clothes off in July; hostas have turned to rags; some of the sorbus are wearing see-through and a particular type of malus has gone topless for most of the year. I know how to handle a ragged hosta: reach for the slug bait, where the pet-friendly Growing Success is my No 1 choice. The other problems are more difficult. They all involve diseases and, here, I know very few of the answers. So do the experts, but sometimes they know one which we do not. This week there has been one place to find an expert: the Royal Horticultural Society's Great Autumn Show. It is a gentle mixture of blood-red dahlias, blue autumn gentians with Scottish names and a heavy emphasis on fruit. This show is much less crowded than Chelsea, but it shows you all the things which Chelsea is too early to permit. There are experts everywhere, experts at visiting flower shows, experts at finding beige suits, experts at finding things to do now that the children have grown up and a president who is expert at making speeches of welcome which have very little to do with the art of the gardening. If you mix with the rose-petal hats, you will soon find the expert you want. By the bi-coloured collarette dahlias I met the redoubtable Mrs Robinson and settled my rose's treatment. Mrs Robinson has been a guiding spirit of the great garden at Hyde Hall in Essex. Its roses are famous; it has the Arthur Hellyer seal of special approval and the trust which now runs it is making it safe for future public visitors. Since the 1950s it is the creation of the Robinson family on one of Britain's less favoured hills: Mrs Robinson is no ordinary Essex girl. Now in the autumn of life, she knows how to make a rose bush happy: what should we do with our naked old-fashioned roses which are plainly suffering from the awful Black Spot? Mrs Robinson recommends a double attack. When the first leaves appear early in the year, spray them with diluted Nimrod T; try to spray fortnightly on any new leaves which appear; at the same time water freely, preferably by using a stretch of the newish dribble hosepipe, the type with leaky holes which can be laid along a flowerbed. The hosepipe is certainly a good idea for those of you who have a source of water near. We have almost all forgotten the very dry spring, but it is probably the reason why Black Spot and leaf drop were so serious so early in rose gardens on less favoured soil. What about denuded trees? Among the bigger nurseries, none is better than Notcutts at showing something seasonal among trees and tall shrubs to the best effect. Last week, their display of white and red berries on Sorbus trees was heavenly: Charles Notcutt, one of its presiding geniuses, was ready with all the answers. Your malus here are all very charming, I confessed to him, but I was told to grow grey-leaved Malus Torringoides five years ago and this wretched tree has lost its leaves every year in June. Dump it, he answered, hitting the floor with his walking-stick: grow Red Sentinel instead. The family of Malus includes the crab apples and, apparently, my crab has caught scab. Red Sentinel is much more resistant and the Notcutt view is that the birds leave the red fruits on its sweeping branches until late in the season. Otherwise, he suggests, grow Golden Hornet instead. I wondered if, perhaps, they were not, well, a little too obvious? Not to Notcutt: if they are so well known, it is simply that they are the best and that is why most people plant them. The results are in Notcutt's favour. What about that problematic Sorbus, Joseph Rock? From time to time I mention fire-blight here and its special attraction for this lovely small tree, previously one of my favourites in any list. Fire-blight began in the south-west and readers as far north as Scotland have been writing to ask if it is likely to hit them too and, if so, what should they do about older trees? The Notcutt view is that fire-blight is swirling in the atmosphere just about everywhere (I wondered if it was present in some of the rose-petalled hats) and that every garden is at risk to it. New plantings should therefore avoid Joseph Rock: personally, he likes the red-berried Sorbus Matsudama instead. Old plantings with existing Joseph Rocks need to be very careful not to prune or damage them during the autumn or winter when the blight will enter through scars. Nobody will be so tough as to pull up good old trees but if one starts to die back, show no mercy. Chop the lot before they infect roses and malus in the vicinity. If this disease is all too much for you, why not sink your teeth into a Continental strawberry instead? The king of new strawberries is Ken Muir of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. This year, he is marketing a new French number called Maras des Bois which combines the lushness of a garden strawberry with the subtlety of the small alpine variety from the woods. The publicity did say that it would fruit in late spring, summer and autumn, but Ken Muir seemed more cautious: de-fruit it early in the first year and allow only one crop in the first two. Late cropping does happen, but wasps love it: duly chastened, I sampled a Maras des Bois which is best tasted when it has turned a dark red. I thought it an interesting bit of both, as the marketing once called British Biscuit in America. If you do not like this French little fantasy, you can always leave it out for nearby French partridges: a French evening snack for my unannounced visitors who have, incidentally, returned at full strength after doing their best to destabilise the entire Anglo-French system before this weekend.</p>

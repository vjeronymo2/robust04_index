			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by business editor John Spira] </F>   [Text] Aid approaching R[rand] 5 billion is poised to pour  into South Africa. But it is nowhere near enough to lift an  economy which, nevertheless, has the potential to achieve  much-heightened growth rates.    Aid of about R1.7 billion a year might seem a lot of money.  Yet perspective indicates that R1.7 billion worth of aid in the  next 12 months is about equal to the cost of establishing one  new gold mine. It's half the sum South Africa borrowed from the  International Monetary Fund at the end of last year -- funds  used to bolster foreign exchange reserves which, in spite of  that injection, are now, only five months later, under severe  pressure. Indeed, in the first four months of 1994, the net  reserves plummeted by R3.2 billion, equivalent to more than two  years' worth of foreign aid.    Accordingly, the aid-to-SA [South Africa] conduit won't even  begin to have a favourable impact on an economy desperately  trying to emerge from five years of crippling recession. Not  that we should be looking for handouts to pull us out of the  economic mire. We need to be tugging ourselves up by our own  bootstraps. Aid dents the pride of the nation and promotes a  poor work ethic -- as countries to our north have discovered at  exorbitant cost. In short, the entire country has to get back  to work -- to work hard, efficiently, and assiduously. Is the  nation prepared and able to do just this? The portents are  promising. What remains is for the potential to be realised.    It is the new Government's most awesome task to get people  into jobs, to train them to do those jobs well and to ensure  that they keep doing them well. It won't be easy and it won't  happen soon. The starting point is to enhance South Africa's  economic growth rate. Even this year's predicted 3 percent is  well short of the desired mark. Next year simply has to be 5  percent plus -- and, if one is to take a less than jaundiced  view of the future, it can be achieved. How?    -- The psychology is right. All South Africans are suddenly  on the same side, working for the same goals. No more is  government at such odds with labour and business; no more is  labour at such odds with business. Co-operation among all the  aspects of production translates into meaningful economic growth.    -- Foreign investment, as opposed to foreign aid, stands  ready to enter an economy no longer constantly threatened by  violence and labour unrest -- an economy with a well-developed  infrastructure, a sound legal system and one which offers an  attractive platform for launching products into sub-Saharan  Africa.    -- Even without the post-apartheid benefits that are about  to  accrue, the economy has been emerging from recession. The major  indicators are pointing up and, given a heightened level of  foreign and domestic investment, they are poised to point yet  higher.    -- Inflation remains in single-digit territory. While many  fear that the huge social upliftment expenditure targeted by the  new Government will before long jerk inflation back into double  digits, the substantial excess production capacity in the  economy and the Reserve Bank's continued vigilance are notable  ameliorating factors.    -- International capital markets are now, as seldom before,  ready to lend to South Africa. Although they involve a cost in  the form of interest payments, if the funds thereby raised are  used to expand the nation's productive base, the interest bill  can be covered many times over by heightened exports and import  replacement.    -- Much local and foreign money is destined for education  and  training. Some dividends will be garnered only many years into  the future. But some, particularly in the training arena, will  accrue in the near term. In concert with the will to work hard,  those dividends will help lubricate South Africa's economic  engine.    -- Interest rates are scheduled to decline in the near  future  as the balance of payments constraint is rendered less onerous  by capital inflows. Cheaper money implies more investment in  productive capacity and increased spending -- vital ingredients  for growth.    -- The global economy is expanding. This is bound to benefit  all exporting nations, including South Africa. In addition, the  upturn is coinciding with a revival in the commodities cycle.  And South Africa is among the world's leading exporters of  gold, platinum, diamonds, coal, manganese, and chrome.    Too optimistic a scenario? Are there no flies in the  economic ointment?    Earlier in the year, the gloom and doom merchants predicted  that the election would bring chaos; that the Left-leaning  elements in the ANC would drive the country down the communist  precipice. Today they're silent. Business people are positive.  The Johannesburg Stock exchange continues to scale new peaks,  pointing to a future more prosperous than the recent past.    Even so, flies, among them exchange control, are by no means  absent from the ointment.    International investors are invariably reticent about  placing  their money in a country which prevents its unfettered  repatriation. They're wary of a country which aims to attract  foreign capital via a discounted financial rand.    Why not, then, abolish exchange controls and scrap the  financial rand? Because vast sums of funk money would leave our  shores, plundering our scarce foreign exchange reserves. At  least that's been the reason for the past decade or so. It's a  reason which could evaporate if confidence is restored --  confidence that South Africa does indeed have a bright future;  confidence that capital seeks to flow into the country rather  than out of it; confidence that democracy will bring with it  responsible government of responsible citizens.    Ultimately, South Africa will row its own boat. Its  oarsmen's determination, wisdom, and strength will determine its  destiny.</p>

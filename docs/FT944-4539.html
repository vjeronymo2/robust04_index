			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / OECD warns on Canada recovery Canada is enjoying a robust, low-inflation recovery, reinforced by a marked improvement in international competitiveness, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says in its annual country survey. However, the OECD cautions that high federal and provincial budget deficits and concerns about Quebec secession make the economy vulnerable to swings in financial markets. 'Even if temporary, such pressures could affect confidence and hold back activity in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy,' the survey says. Gross domestic product is expected to grow 4 per cent this year and 4.1 per cent in 1995, with exports and business investment leading the way. Inflation, measured by the GDP price deflator, will be less than 1 per cent this year, but will accelerate to 2.1 per cent in 1995. Unemployment will drop to 9.9 from 10.6 per cent. A highlight of recent economic performance has been the replacement of relatively expensive labour by machinery and equipment. According to the OECD, the capital-to-labour ratio rose by about 20 per cent between 1989 and 1993, 'lending credence to the view that the Canadian economy has gone through one of the most important periods of input restructuring since the war'. The other side of the coin however, is what the OECD calls a 'jobless recovery'. About four-fifths of output growth has come from more efficient use of labour, and only 20 per cent from the creation of jobs. Declining unit-labour costs have, in turn, contributed to the unusually low inflation rate. The survey concludes that 'the significant improvement in Canada's competitive position should allow a gradual unwinding of the large external deficit'. The current account balance is forecast to decline from an annualised CDollars 22bn (Pounds 9.8bn) in the first half of 1994 to CDollars 19.9bn in June-December 1995. Mr Jacques Parizeau, Quebec's premier and head of the separatist Parti Quebecois, said he would ask voters in next year's referendum to vote yes or no to Quebec becoming a sovereign state in economic association with Canada, Robert Gibbens writes.

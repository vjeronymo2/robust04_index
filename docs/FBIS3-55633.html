			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gevorg Nazaryan on news conference held by </F> presidential Press Secretary Aram Abrahamyan in Yerevan on 10  January]    [Text] Today's news conference was of interest for  reporters not only because it was the first of the year but  because recently the political situation has become tense in the  Karabakh conflict zone and in Armenian-Georgian border regions.    In congratulating the reporters on the occasion of the new  year, Press Secretary Aram Abrahamyan said:    [Begin Abrahamyan recording] As is already known to you, an  unprecedented escalation of military operations has been taking  place in Nagorno--Karabakh since 18 December. Having rejected  every peace plan, Azerbaijan is launching fierce offensives all  along the Karabakh-Azerbaijan front. The Azerbaijani  infringements have taken place against our Republic in recent  days. The political assessment of these operations has already  been made in the statements issued by the Republic's president  and government.    Azerbaijan is again entertaining the illusion that the  problem could be solved by military means. The neighboring  country is always paying dearly to be convinced that such  illusions do not conform with reality.    Regarding our position, Armenia has always realized that  there is no military solution to the problem. Therefore, the  Armenian leadership will use all the possibilities, even the  infinitesimal ones, at its disposal to make the problem a  political one. [end recording]    Regarding Armenian-Russian relations, the press secretary  said that they are stable and practical. As you know, the  Armenian prime minister was in Moscow at the beginning of this  year. The result was positive on the three main issues under  discussion: the nuclear power plant, unfreezing of credits, and  trade-economic relations between the countries in 1994.    Mr. Abrahamyan referred to the reoperation of the gas  pipeline entering Armenia through Georgia. It is obvious that  in this case also we are dealing with one of the worst  manifestations of the Azerbaijani militaristic policy. The  neighboring republic is sending terrorist and sabotage groups to  another country, in this case Georgia, and is blowing up the  only gas pipeline entering Armenia and is mining the area around  the pipeline. The Armenian Government is taking various  measures to resolve the gas pipeline issue. Following the  meeting between the three deputy prime ministers of Armenia,  Georgia, and Azerbaijan, there was a possibility that mine  cleaning work would begin. However, certain problems have  arisen between the bordering Armenian and Azerbaijani villages,  delaying the mine cleaning work.    Mr. Abrahamyan informed reporters of the difficulties of  obtaining fuel by the Georgian railway. Stable state structures  have not yet taken shape in Georgia and the state is not in full  control of the situation. Talks with the Georgian Government  are continuing at various levels, and there is positive movement  on the issues under discussion.    The press secretary noted that U.S. colleagues have not yet  succeeded in bringing heating oil to Armenia as part of  humanitarian assistance.    As you also know, the Armenian president called for a  Supreme  Council meeting on 12 January to discuss the 1994 program for  privatization. This program, as well as the 1994 socio-economic  plan submitted to the parliament, arise from the situation  prevailing in our Republic. There are plans to private a total  of 15 percent of the industrial enterprises. Abrahamyan said:  We hope that this will stimulate the development of industry.    The press secretary also said that Vice President Gagik  Arutyunyan will leave for Zangezur [southern Armenia] on 11  January. The next day, an extraordinary session of the  Coordination Council on Armenian-Iranian ties will be held in  Megri. In addition to the members of the council,  representatives from all the interested organizations, local  authorities, customs posts, border guards, and business circles  in both countries have also been invited to the meeting. It is  expected that [Iranian charge d'affaires in Yerevan] Ahmad  Sobhani and [Armenian charge d'affaires in Tehran] Vahan  Bayburdyan will also take part in the meeting. The entire  complex of Armenian-Iranian economic-trade ties will be  examined, such as the construction of the bridge, transit  transportation, border trade, the normal functioning of customs  posts, and so on.</p>

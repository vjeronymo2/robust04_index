			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Liang Kuo-shu, governor of  the Central Bank of China, suggested Monday [20 June] that the  government consider abolishing or lowering the bond-transaction  tax in a new attempt to revitalize the domestic capital market.    Trading of corporate bonds and treasury bills is currently  subject to the imposition of a 0.1 percent transaction tax,  while transactions on government bonds are not subject to a tax.    The lowering or lifting of the bond-transaction tax would  help induce more foreign funds to pour into the Taiwan bond  market and thus boost overall financial activities, Liang noted.    The governor made the statement at a seminar on the economy  sponsored by Academia Sinica, the highest academic body in  Taiwan.    Stressing that the Central Bank welcomes investment from  abroad, he said four other conditions were necessary for Taiwan  to open up its capital markets: Making government debts  publicly known; narrowing differences in financial conditions  -- such as the difference in interest rates -- between Taiwan  and foreign countries; introducing measures to help insure  export-oriented manufacturers against risks; and overhauling of  the domestic stock market.    Bond-market traders reacted positively toward Liang's  suggestion on the bond tax, [words indistinct] the proposed  measure would greatly push up the circulation of corporate bonds  and treasury bills, transactions of which have nearly come to a  standstill as of late.    Trade volume on the bond market, though reaching trillions  of  new Taiwan dollars, comes mainly from transactions of government  bonds, while most corporate bonds and treasury bills are kept by  banks and insurance companies as reserves, the traders explained.    Meanwhile, Liang said he has great confidence that Taipei  can  gradually be turned into an Asia-Pacific financial hub, with the  first step being to become a regional funding center.    In its ambition to become a financial center, Taipei aims to  play a complementary role rather than replace other hubs in this  part of the world, he elaborated.    To fit into the government's financial-internationalization  strategy, he said, the central bank will also place a top  priority on enlarging the presence of foreign banks in Taiwan, a  move expected to bring in more and better financial services.</p>

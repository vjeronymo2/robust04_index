			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Whips mop up all but last dregs of revolt A DAY of intensive lobbying by government whips and Mr Michael Heseltine seemed to have paid off last night as the Tory revolt over pit closures seemed almost to have disappeared. Face-to-face meetings between the trade and industry secretary and rebels took place late into the night - and the private pressure was matched by public statements from Mr John Major and others expanding on Monday's U-turn announcement. Ministers said the shift in emphasis was no more than a clarification of what Mr Heseltine had originally told the Commons, but erstwhile rebels hailed the statements as a real change. As Tories dispersed last night there was a different atmosphere compared with last week, or even Monday. Tory MPs stamped their feet in approval when Mr Heseltine addressed the party's backbench trade and industry committee. 'There was an outbreak of unity,' said one waverer as he left. One government whip, pausing between arranging for still more doubters to see Mr Heseltine, claimed the dissenters had been 'dramatically reduced'. Mr Winston Churchill, MP for Davyhulme and one of the most prominent of the Tory rebels, last night said he would support the government in tomorrow's Commons vote 'because of the significant change of policy'. There are only about half a dozen Tories who say they may still vote against the government. Together with abstentions, that might yet scare government business managers - although overturning the 21-strong Tory majority looks increasingly unlikely. Labour whips promised a 100 per cent turnout - with none of their MPs having any hesitation in supporting the miners. Of the 44 MPs from smaller parties, the three Democratic Unionist party MPs, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, will vote with Labour. The nine Ulster Unionists will not decide until today how to vote. The signs are that they will join Labour, but there is some internal pressure for them to abstain. One Ulster Unionist - Mr Cecil Walker, MP for Belfast North - is in the US and will almost certainly not return in time for the vote. Four Welsh and three Scottish Nationalists and 20 Liberal Democrats will vote with Labour. So should the four Social Democratic and Labour party MPs from Northern Ireland. Although Dr Joe Hendron, SDLP MP for West Belfast, was on the same trip as Mr Walker he was last night considering flying back to London. Mr James Kilfedder, the sole Ulster Popular Unionist party MP, who usually votes with the Tories, is refusing to say how he will vote. Government whips were assuming a more-or-less complete turnout of Tories. Sir Donald Thompson, MP for Calder Valley, is recovering from an operation and may be excused. Of the rebels, Mr Hugh Dykes (Harrow East), said he was looking for further 'substantial' changes by the government, including a promise of a 'genuinely independent' review. Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton) also said she would vote with Labour unless there was an independent review on all aspects of energy policy. Others Tories still believed likely to vote with Labour include Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and Spen), Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield). Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson (New Forest) continues to oppose the government, but says he will abstain. Other possible abstainers include Mr James Cran (Beverley), Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East) and Mr William Cash (Stafford). The biggest boost for government whips came after Mr Heseltine's meeting with the executive of the Tory backbench 1922 committee. Sir Marcus Fox, 1922 chairman, announced the executive was now unanimously behind the government. Mr Heseltine, he said, had promised a 'full and open' review. One executive member who had privately threatened to defy the whips said Mr Heseltine had been 'put through the wringer', but was moving all the time on the scope of the review. In his meeting with the 1922 committee Mr Heseltine insisted that government energy policy should not be decided by people outside the party and urged loyalty, warning of many tough decisions to come on public spending. 'You can't have a la carte government,' he said.</p>

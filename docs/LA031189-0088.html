			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'UP IN SARATOGA' -- A GOOD IDEA GONE WRONG  </P> <P> It's amazing what can happen to good ideas on their way to the stage.  </P> <P> It seemed like a good idea to take an old farce with a solid track record  (Bronson Howard's 1870 "Saratoga"), dust it off and rewrite it for a modern  audience with a new title: "Up in Saratoga."  </P> <P> It seemed like a good idea to have playwright farceur Terrence McNally ("The  Ritz," "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune") deliver the reconstructed  script.  </P> <P> It seemed like a great idea to have Jack O'Brien, a man who could direct the  phone book con brio, stage it. But the results at the Old Globe, where "Up in  Saratoga" opened Thursday, prove only, again, that there are no guarantees.  </P> <P> The play is a mess.  </P> <P> Every ingredient known to Georges Feydeau, Neil Simon and Michael Frayn has  been thrown into this stew. It is framed -- literally -- in a sumptuous,  gilt-edged set by Douglas W. Schmidt, draped in the swirling or dapper elegance  of Robert Wojewodski's costumes, anointed with light by David F. Segal,  punctuated with songs by composer Bob James, sprinkled with Scott Joplin and  other period music, primped, powdered, propped up and ordered to live. To no  avail.  </P> <P> This saga of a young man whose helpless romanticism makes him fall in love with  every lovely in his path (and to become engaged to several at once), unfolds  with the predictable and unpredictable intrigue and imbroglio one might expect.  The plot is as twisted as a telephone cord and in this McNally incarnation,  it's like pushing rocks uphill.  </P> <P> For the first two acts this extravaganza is all period posturing and exposition  and asides to the audience and carefully timed exits and entrances. But  something's missing from the start. There's flavor, but no leavening. The  confection won't rise. Characters twitter, bluster, mince, scheme, sashay,  simper and sigh, but it all feels like work.  </P> <P> Scene changing interludes in Act II between a maid (Vicki Lewis) and a butler  (Sterling Macer) wither from terminal cuteness. The James songs, delivered as  Olio numbers and sung in a nasal whine by Lewis, seem extraneous.  </P> <P> By Act III, particularly the final scene of Act III peppered with gunshots,  screaming women and slamming doors, the mayhem has become so forced, the effort  to make us laugh so driven and at such a fever pitch, that an audience can only  sit back limp, assaulted, amazed and unamused.  </P> <P> A program note from the director tells us that despite the play's derivation,  every word is McNally's. It's an assertion we don't doubt, since "Up in  Saratoga" is riddled with intentional anachronisms ("I've heard of male  bonding, but this is ridiculous") and contemporary buzzwords ("Tsawright?" --  "Tsawright"). Paraphrased song titles become lines of dialogue ("You've got it  bad and that's not good"). That sort of indulgence dates and dooms a text.  </P> <P> The ultimate in-joke drew a hiss of consternation opening night, as the young  hero claims to have tickets to "Bronson Howard's new play, 'Frankie and Johnny  in the Clair de Lune.' " It's downhill from there, hitting a nadir at "Lie down  with actresses wake up with fleas."  </P> <P> What's an actor to do? The poor ones here work relentlessly, huffing and  puffing their little hearts out trying to entertain us.  </P> <P> The young men are brash and engaging (Jon Tenney is the hapless Romeo, William  Duff-Griffin his buddy and cohort), the young women are lissome and lively  (Finn Carter, Lauren Mitchell, Marietta DePrima and Mary-Louise Parker). Jack  Fletcher accomplishes the remarkable feat of playing a fey buffoon without  surrendering a shred of dignity. Mitchell Edmonds, Dorothy Constantine,  Laurence Guittard, Richard Kneeland offer better than competent support, but  they can't rise above the play.  </P> <P> Somewhere along the line, McNally and O'Brien, working together, lost sight of  the ultimate goal. The lavish Old Globe production gilds a counterfeit lily.  </P> <P> A lot of high energy, bucks and hopes have gone into this monster, but its  chances of being salvageable are slim. It's all style over content. What should  have been wit and daring is replaced by trivial pursuit, clarity by confusion.  </P> <P> Farce may spring from muddle, but just as stage boredom can't be allowed to be  boring, stage confusion needs to be clear.  </P> <P> "Up in Saratoga's" situations are so mixed up that it's a night's work to keep  track of them. Nothing organically funny emerges from this labyrinth of events.  </P> <P> Instead, we're given a frenzied three-hour-plus white elephant from which we  come out numb, humming the sets and costumes.  </P> <P> At the Simon Edison Centre for the Performing Arts in Balboa Park, Tuesdays  through Saturdays, 8 p.m. (March 29-30, April 11, 7 p.m.); Sundays, 7 p.m.;  matinees Saturdays, Sundays at 2. Ends April 16. Tickets: $16-$25; (619)  239-2255).  </P></p>

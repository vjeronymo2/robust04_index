			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Satisfaction With CPC Is Declining--A Survey on </F> Ideological Conditions Among University Students After 4 June  Incident"]    [Text] [Editor's note] At the time of the fifth  anniversary of the "4 June incident," the CPC authorities kept a  close watch on the ideological trends among the college students  in Beijing. Two months before "4 June," the CPC Central  Committee instructed the State Education Commission and the  Communist Youth League Central Committee to jointly carry out  "an analysis of the current conditions of college students," to  understand the current ideological conditions and  characteristics of college students. The "analysis of the  current conditions of college students" is summarized below.  [end editor's note]    Compared with other social groups in contemporary society,  today's college students are still a group which is very  idealistic and politically sensitive and is characterized more  by belief and aspirations.  <H5>  A Group Which Is Ideal and Diversified in Development </H5>   Compared with the college students in an earlier period,  today's college students exhibit the features of diversity in  thinking, choice, and the problems they face. In concrete  terms, at present, the number of students who want to "learn  some practical knowledge" has increased, reaching 84.9 percent;  at the same time, 60 percent of them are still interested in  major international and domestic issues and news but their focus  on politics, the channel through which they care about politics,  and the style with which they do so have changed and shifted.  <H5>  Eager To Work Part-Time and Fall in Love </H5>   Judged superficially, college students today have obviously  become more pragmatic in all areas and at different levels. In  the area of study, students are quite vigorous. Most students  have a "broad" understanding of "study," saying that "reading  books is study but using knowledge is a more important study  method." In terms of behavior, they have already jumped out of  "books." Absence from class, being late for class, and leaving  before class is finished are spreading phenomena. The "craze  for going abroad" among students has declined a bit but is  basically in a condition of steady development. On campus, a  "craze for becoming capable people" is taking shape. However,  as regards the criteria for a qualified person and how one can  become a capable person, useful to society and needed by the  country, students have an understanding and behavior very  different from the traditional modes. In the area of politics,  discussions on political problems, as well as expressing and  exchanging ideas, have decreased, and there is little deep  pondering and research. Thus, there is no clear sign of any  emerging political ideological trend and there is a certain  degree of indifference and apathy.    In the area of daily behavior, last year, the phenomenon of  students breaking the law and discipline was frequently seen.  The number of lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases was  four or five times that in the previous year and the most acute  phenomenon was "fighting and beating." The "love wind" was  constantly blowing. During last summer, about one-third of  students worked amid the "work craze."  <H5>  The Sense of "Ego" Swells </H5>   Judged psychologically, most students are currently in the  "individualizing" condition and their senses of "ego" and of  being an individual are gradually becoming explicit and clear.  This is mainly illustrated by the following three points: 1)  When they choose a mode of behavior, they mainly or solely ask  "whether it is beneficial to myself" or "whether I can obtain  benefit from it." 2) In the area of politics, they cannot  resist the temptation and about two-thirds of students show  great interest in and enthusiasm for the major international and  domestic political issues. 3) In daily life, their  psychological condition and concepts are in a rather seriously  unbalanced state.    From the above descriptions we can see inconsistency and a  great deal of contradiction between the superficial phenomenon  of students and their psychological condition. The use of  traditional viewpoints and angles to observe and analyze  students' superficial problems will easily slip into an impasse  characterized by puzzlement and confusion.    Judged from a static perspective, that is, from the current  conditions, the basic situation among college students is quite  optimistic. They are still fully confident and hopeful about  the future and still want very much to train themselves into  "people useful to the society," wanting to do great things.  They show a higher degree of care for politics. For example,  about 73 percent of the college students in the Beijing area  said that they are "very concerned" or "quite concerned" with  "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's inspection tour to the south" and "the  14th CPC National Congress," 95.8 percent of them agree that  "economic development needs a stable political environment," and  76 percent of them thought that the central authorities have  scored results, or havve "obtained marked effect," or "scored  initial result" in "stabilizing the political situation."   <H5>    Mammonism Has a Certain Market on Campus </H5>   However, judged from a dynamic perspective, that is, from  the  situation of development and changes, there is something to  worry about. Judged from the students' job choices, mammonism  has a certain market on campuses. "High income" has already  jumped from second and third choice in several previous surveys  to first choice and "giving full play to individual specialties"  has dropped from first to second choice. Judged from the  psychological condition of the students, although they think  that the future is full of promise, about half of them "do not  know exactly what to do in the future." When 1993 is compared  with 1992, the degree of satisfaction felt by students toward  the relevant work in schools is decreasing, generally by over 20  percent; the degree of satisfaction toward the work done by the  central authorities in recent years has also decreased by over  15 percent.    The main current among today's college students is good,  positive, and upwardly mobile. This is mainly manifested in the  following:  <H5>  Some 75 Percent of Students Think That People Should Have </H5> Belief    1. In the area of outlook on life, all college students hope  that they can become people who are viewed by others as "useful  persons," "successful persons," or "persons who can accomplish a  lot of things." Although they have different criteria regarding  "success," (making contributions to society or making themselves  happier and freer); although they have different choices of  channels to "success," (such as "going to the mountain," "going  to the sea," carrying out theoretical research, or engaging in  actual operations), most students have a positive outlook on  life; and the degree of "waiting" is decreasing and the sense of  "struggle" is increasing. A survey in Beijing shows 73 percent  of students strongly advocate that "people should have belief"  and 50 percent of students do not agree with the viewpoint  "enjoying without delay." Many college students throughout the  country gave similar answers. The "craze for becoming a capable  person" has quietly emerged. Nearly 70 percent of students  thought that "university students should become builders of  socialism."  <H5>  Not Caring About Politics, Caring Only About Immediate </H5> Interests    2. In the area of politics, although one-third of students  have the concept that "it is better to be indifferent to  politics" and two-thirds of them feel that "at present, most  people do not care about politics but care only about immediate  interests," two-thirds of students are still very interested in  international and domestic political issues, toward which they  show a high degree of concern, and their viewpoints are quite  correct. For example, 75 percent of students think that  "China's future is full of promise" and this is particularly  true after further unfolding of the "anticorruption" work and  the closing of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee.    The minor points regarding students cannot be neglected and  belittled. These are mainly manifested in:  <H5>  Feeling That Religious Activity Is "Fun" </H5>   1. There is an increasing number of students who feel that  religious activity is "fun," who have a certain interest in  religion, and who have varying degrees of religious belief.  According to information, there is a certain number of students  who go to church on Sunday but only a few of them really have  firm religious belief.    2. Among students, the number of those who agree with the  "tendency to become the same" theory is increasing and the  number of those who are indifferent to politics is also on the  rise. According to a survey carried out on the campus of a  comprehensive university in Beijing, in 1992, 41.9 percent of  students believed in the "tendency to become the same" theory  and thought that the socialist and capitalist systems will  gradually mix together; in 1993, the figure had risen to 51.1  percent. According to a survey by Beijing Municipality, in  1986, 11.9 percent of students held the viewpoint that  "university students should mainly concern themselves with study  and not with politics and society"; in 1988, this figure dropped  to 6.2 percent. However, in 1993, 36.8 percent of students held  the viewpoint that "it is better to be indifferent to politics."    3. The phenomenon of psychological imbalance among college  students is quite general and the condition of psychological  well-being among students is deteriorating. According to a  survey done by a college of engineering in Beijing, 34.3 percent  of students have psychological illness to varying degrees, far  surpassing the average level (16 percent) in the colleges across  the country two years ago.  <H5>  Twenty-Five Percent of University Students Have Premarital </H5> Sex    4. The moral condition of college students is  "deteriorating." According to a survey of 2,000 students in 20  universities, about 25 percent of students have had premarital  sex and this tendency is increasing; according to the heads of  many student work departments (offices) in higher learning  institutes, students' morals have sharply declined and cheating  in exams has become prevalent.  <H5>  College Students Are Seriously Unbalanced Psychologically </H5>   Judged from the above analyses, to varying degrees, college  students have left the "intermediate state" and entered the  "polar state" or "plural state." That is, activity and  passivity coexist, stability and agitation occur simultaneously,  and hope and despair perpetuate together, forming a rather  seriously conflicting condition. Superficially, campuses do not  seem to have any "flash points" and "no focus" but, in fact,  they have "many flash points," "many focuses," and "many  tendencies," and are in a disorderly state and a psychologically  unbalanced, and even seriously conflicting, condition.</p>

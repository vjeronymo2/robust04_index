			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / For what we are about to receive: Andrew Jack on tensions over the role of investigating accountants Power without accountability' is a phrase that crops up regularly when the owner of a textile company in north London talks about his bank, the accountants it hired, and his business's fall into receivership. Two years ago he lost his largest customer. Under pressure from the bank, he agreed to pay Pounds 18,000 to a large firm of accountants to write a report assessing the viability of the business. All sides agreed that the company should continue trading and that the position should be reassessed after six months, during which time the accountant was paid more than Pounds 3,000 a week to monitor the company's financial health. Six months later, the overdraft had been reduced to within a few thousand pounds of the owner's forecast. But repeated restructuring proposals from him and his independent auditors were rejected by the bank and the accountants. Instead, the bank appointed the accountants as receivers and closed the business down. Underlying the story - and others like it - is an issue that concerns many directors and a number of financiers and accountants: should accountants hired by bankers to investigate a financially troubled company be appointed as receivers? The debate concerns a potential conflict of interest. The accountant may have a financial incentive to slant the advice given to the bank to suggest a company cannot be salvaged under existing management. By recommending that receivers be appointed, it stands a high chance of winning the work itself and generating extra fees. Those most affected - company directors - are generally unwilling to be identified: often a company's bank loans are secured against their personal assets even after the companies have collapsed. One exception is Mr John Jackson, chairman of Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the loss-making Poundstretcher retail chain recently rescued by the South African retailing group, Pepkor. He calls the practice 'objectionable' and has demanded an inquiry by the Bank of England and the accountancy bodies. Some smaller accountancy firms are sympathetic to his viewpoint. 'How can a firm be seen to be objective when reporting to a bank on whether a business is a going concern if a negative report will provide that firm with insolvency business?' asks Mr Michael Snyder, senior partner at accountants Kingston Smith. He says his firm does not conduct any insolvency work because he believes it does not 'sit happily' with its work as investigating accountants. 'What is required is a wholly independent review. The investigators appointed (from large firms) are most likely to be insolvency experts with the prospect of a future receivership in their minds.' These charges are vigorously rejected by those from the larger firms involved in conducting investigations, which win most of the work from the banks. Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner with Grant Thornton and vice-president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the leading trade body, says: 'It's a bit hard to stomach people doubting my professional integrity. I get my enjoyment from saving companies, not closing them down.' He argues that most of the companies he is asked to investigate emerge intact with existing management, and with creditors none the wiser. Moreover, he says, finding a second accountancy firm to act if the first firm calls for the appointment of a receiver would add to costs, because the new firm would have to learn about the company. In the meantime, as word leaked out, the value of the assets to be sold might also be substantially reduced. Similar arguments are made by many banks. Mr Brian Clare, head of Midland Bank's loan management division, says: 'The argument is perceived rather than real. If banks have a weakness, it is allowing companies without a future to carry on and throwing good money after bad. I would never accept a recommendation to appoint a receiver if there was any better alternative.' Weighing up the merits of each side of the argument is difficult, because the circumstances surrounding a receivership are rarely clear cut. Company directors often have a vested interest in slanting their story to conceal their own poor management, while bankers and insolvency practitioners are precluded on ethical grounds from breaking confidentiality to tell their side of the story. Banks remain split on the issue. But an indication that there is a potential conflict of interest is shown by the decision of the Royal Bank of Scotland to reorganise the way in which it handled companies in distress over the past two years. It introduced a policy banning the investigating accountants it appoints from becoming receivers, except in exceptional circumstances. Mr Derek Sach, director of specialised lending services at the bank, says: 'If customers perceive that investigating accountants will become receivers, they are unco-operative and resist intervention by the bank.' In the past two years, Mr Sach has reduced the number of people authorised to approve receivership from 300 to effectively three. Companies in distress are all handed to his specialist team. He says the result has been to reduce the number of receivers appointed by the Royal Bank by more than its competitors - even taking into account that the number of business failures in the UK has also dropped during the period. But the Royal Bank's move is unique. The last time the accountancy profession's joint ethics committee studied the issue of investigating accountants acting as receivers was two years ago. It decided to take no further action, although 30 per cent of those asked believed that there was an actual and not just a perceived conflict of interest. Mr Jackson thinks it is time for the accountancy profession and the Bank of England to examine some cases of business failure in detail to decide whether there is a case for stronger regulation.</p>

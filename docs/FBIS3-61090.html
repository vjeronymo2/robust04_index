			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nurtay Abiqayev, chief of the apparate of </F> the Republic of Kazakhstan president and cabinet of ministers,  recorded by Yerzhuman Smayyl: "National Character Begins With  the President."]    [Text] [Smayyl] Nurtay Abiqayuly, when you were granted  your powers, confirmed by the authority of the president, from  the highest leadership of the republic, it was said that you  were, first and foremost, assigned the task of organizing the  work of the apparate functioning in the area of providing  services to the president and the cabinet of ministers. I would  like to ask the following question in terms of this: what kinds  of measures, what kinds of questions are involved with providing  services to the president and the cabinet of ministers?    [Abiqayev] It is not necessary, in order to answer that  question, to list the duties of the president as formulated in  the primary law of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Constitution,  and the duties of the cabinet of ministers as established in  special constitutional law, or go into detail about each duty.  We must, however, understand the fact that the president is the  head of state, that he manages the executive authority of the  republic as a unified system, and that the cabinet of ministers  decides questions of government. Thus, these two institutions of  the republic leadership are involved with all sectors of state  life. You can understand, in terms of this, the broad scope of  the work of the apparate and where the emphasis lies.    When the institution of the presidency was first established  in Kazakhstan, it had its own apparate as did the Kenges of  Ministers. When the two were unified, we investigated how these  things were in other countries. However, we strove to find our  own way. Whereas there were previously more than 500 officials  in the two apparatees, now there are 380. It is possible that  staffing will decrease still more. However, it is now  increasing. That is the first thing. Second, we have specified  exactly what each person and each part of the apparate is  concerned with: what is being done by ministries and committees,  what the central apparate is concerned about, what must be  turned over to oblast governments.    A sovereign and independent Kazakhstan has become a part of  a  world public. We must take in hand measures and very important  reforms intended to get our country out of a very deep crisis. A  second era of privatization, as the basis of a market economy,  and of the ending of state ownership, has begun. However, the  law on privatization is still being discussed with some  production establishments in the United States with its history  of more than two hundred years. Moreover, we made some mistakes  when we first pushed privatization forward. We can say that this  was the case in regard to the privatization of residential  housing. However, we are pressing forward resolutely. We must  understand our responsibility as an independent country to enter  upon the road of world development. However, starting from the  question of which countries we should go to first in our  international relations and what policy we should maintain in  regard to what nation, and how we must receive honored foreign  guests, it is all virgin territory for us. We have entered into  economic relations with some of the most developed nations in  the world. We have established joint industries to jointly  master our riches. One aspect of the proper control over such  complex operations with their many problems is through the  apparate.    Let me state one thing: as the president has said about  this,  the divisions of the apparate do not replace ministries and  state committees. The apparate must provide the services of the  president's office and cabinet of ministers, which enjoys the  entire executive authority, in terms of organization and of  cadres, in terms of creating favorable conditions for providing  analysis on specific circumstances and the results of public  opinion surveys on some given issue, and even for the fullest  and most effective operations of the president's office and of  the government. The measures to be carried out to achieve this,  and the issues are extremely numerous and, other than those  connected with daily services, must be determined separately  with respect to every event or circumstance.    [Smayyl] Those organizational measures you mentioned in  passing require that the apparate have powers at a level set by  the leadership and that you have influence upon the appropriate  ministers and chairs of committees. The chief of the president's  apparate in the United States is in many areas considered second  to the president...    [Abiqayev] In my view, it is appropriate to evaluate any  given service in terms of how its level of power benefits the  people or common concerns to a superior degree. In these terms,  we must not understand involvement with organizational measures  as diminishing one's stature.    However, if we try to make comparisons with conditions in  the  United States, I think that this does not reflect the real state  of affairs. I do not look at my office in terms of exerting  authority over another or in terms of rule. I was twice an  assistant to President Nazarbayev when he was chairman of the  Council of Ministers and later first secretary of the Republic  of Kazakhstan Communist Party. When he became president, I was  entrusted with taking charge of the apparate. Fate has  determined that we have to live and work in difficult and  interesting times. If I am able to guarantee the proper  functioning of the presidential command, I think that I will  have fulfilled the responsibility assigned me by the times.  Under such circumstances, the deciding issue should not be how  high my position is in the presidential command structure.    [Smayyl] The fact that the time of the president and others  holding high governmental posts is scrutinized and divided by  the minute is something which the people have hitherto been  unwilling to believe. Thereby, is it possible that the president  is unable to do what he wants to do because of the influence of  a strict daily regime? In general, how is the work day of the  president planned?    [Abiqayev] The work schedule of the president is in truth  extremely tight. However, this is not to say that the president  is allowed no time for creative efforts, to evaluate some  circumstances or the other, or to carry out his thoughts and  ideas.    This fact is shown clearly by how N. Nazarbayev's work  schedule is planned. The president's Secretariat prepares  suggestions for a normal month assigned for every week and every  day. At this time, various long-term policies and analytical  assumptions, the circumstances of the period, whatever measures  there are from various authorities and organizations,  social-political organizations within them, of high officials at  various levels or of citizens in the ranks, and what requests  will be made for meetings, are borne in mind and carefully  researched. In any case, the scope of the president's heavy work  load is determined in connection with activities in the  international sector and the resolution of socioeconomic  problems in Kazakhstan. In addition, planned as part of monthly  work schedules are conferences with the leaders of the republic,  receiving citizens and ministers, trips within Kazakhstan, and  meetings with various specialized workers. For the president's  creative work, time is allotted likewise for him to work with  documents and acquaint himself with newspapers and magazines and  reviews of the press. The draft of the work plan is reported to  the president and it is altered and expanded if he sees the need.    Now as for your question of why the president's time is  analyzed to the minute, I think that it is necessary for him to  be able to accomplish the business planned for each day by  organizing carefully activities of this sort. This teaches  people to establish a work regime and to learn how to use time  well. It should be mentioned in passing that if people brought  questions before the president which should be resolved  elsewhere, at other levels, then at times even vital questions  of state would be delayed.    At the same time, one must not think that the president has  become entangled in his strict daily regime. On occasion, if  Nursultan Abishuly thinks that emphasis should be placed on  questions raised by those persons he receives and the time  allotted is too short, it often happens that the president will  remain at work until 1:00 in the morning to resolve some  question which has come up in this way. In fact, at a time like  the present, when unresolved problems and questions are  overflowing, we have gotten used to having the president work on  Saturday and sometimes on Sunday.    [Smayyl] It is well known that there are a great many people  sending the president letters and asking to see him.  Specifically, what kinds of letters reach the hands of Nursultan  Abishuly? What kinds of persons does he receive with what kinds  of problems? Who determines this?    [Abiqayev] Indeed, what you say is true. The number of  requests, appeals, and suggestions coming to the head of state  and the number of persons asking to see him are not decreasing.  During the past period of the present year, more than 2,000  letters arrived each month and nearly 500 citizens were received  each month at the apparate. One must add to this the letters  received by the president when he is on a trip and those  citizens he receives in local areas.    We get a lot of letters from CIS countries and from abroad.  Nearly half of the president's mail are letters expressing  support for his policies. There are many letters requesting  help. Most of them are solved at the oblast level. However, we  seem to think that only the president call solve all the  problems of Kazakhstan.    As for letters read personally by Nursultan Abishuly and  those persons received by him personally, the situation is as  follows: the Apparate Division for Letters and Receiving  Citizens provides to the president a summary of the letters  arriving each month. The summary includes a discussion of the  geography of the requests and appeals, of questions raised, and  of the social circumstances of those writing the letters. At the  same time, classifications are made of suggestions and thoughts  regarding major problems, and letters directed at the  development of our state and people. Direct assignments are  given to the president, vice-president, prime minister, their  deputies, oblast governors, and ministers, and to other high  officials in terms of the classified letters and there is  follow-up to make sure that the assignments are fulfilled.    Likewise, we analyze what those people wanting access wish  to  say and we make suggestions to the president. The head of state  himself selects the people he wants to see and directly assigns  other persons to be received by the appropriate official.    [Smayyl] A short time ago, United States Ambassador Courtney  was received by Nursultan Abishuly and gave him a letter from  the American President. Do you know what that letter was about?  In general, when heads of state write letters to one another,  what kinds of things are they about?    [Abiqayev] At first letters from foreign heads-of-state to  the president of Kazakhstan had a purely official character.  They were, it would seem, congratulations in connection with  some special occasion or letters sent after some particular  event. The president provided human warmth to this official  style. He inquired about families, about kin, and freed the  letters of stuffiness. Not long after such qualities began to be  felt from the answering letters. We sent a letter to United  States President Bill Clinton in connection with the  establishment of an Aral fund and the selection of Nursultan  Abishuly as Kazakhstan president. The United States chief of  state made known his warm feelings in his letter to the  president of Kazakhstan, supported the establishment of the Aral  Fund, and said that he had given the appropriate orders.  Likewise, he expressed his approval of the intention of  Kazakhstan to become a country without nuclear arms.    Our relations with the United States have continued to  develop and relations at the industrial level have proven  successful. However, governmental authorities have failed to  give attention to Kazakhstan at the required level. We spoke  about this to Ambassador Courtney. The words had their effect.  Recently United States Special Ambassador Strobe Talbott,  presented the greetings of President Clinton, and said that the  United States Government would devote special attention to the  government of Kazakhstan. There was thus an agreement to make  preparations for bilateral discussions at the ministry and for a  meeting of the two heads-of-state. In general, when we talk of  writing letters or of communication, it is in regard to pursuing  a given question. If there is agreement of views, talks are  carried out at the foreign minister level and specific steps are  taken for a meeting of the heads of state.    [Smayyl] It is well known that both the president and the  prime minister are concerned with questions in all sectors of  life and are making decisions fateful and important for the  country. As a person who has been there when so many questions  have been decided at the state level in an independent  Kazakhstan, tell us: does the president come to fundamental  decisions in advance or does he seem to make decisions taking  the suggestions and thoughts offered him into consideration? Are  the suggestions and thoughts offered by the presidential staff  adequate from you point of view? Can you recall a case where the  president was indecisive and unable to come to a specific  decision?    [Abiqayev] Before I fail to answer your question let me look  in detail at a previous question. "Do the suggestions and  thoughts of the president's staff satisfy you? The question is  not the value of the suggestions and thoughts. It should be in  terms of whether or not they satisfy the president.    Becoming an independent country and achieving this in a very  difficult time places many, many questions before us. Under such  circumstances, we must recognize that expression of the most  complex suggestions and ideas from the president has a role in  the formation of a new society in Kazakhstan. But as to the  specific question, I cannot say that all the suggestions and  thoughts expressed equally satisfy the president...    [Smayyl] Nurtay Abiqayuly, let us try to get one thing  clear.  Are there those on the president's staff who argue with him? To  whom among those surrounding him does the president listen? What  does he think of his opponents?    [Abiqayev] The words of opponents should not be directed so  much at argument or at debate. If intelligent thoughts,  well-conceived ideas are expressed, President Nazarbayev is  ready to exchange views with them, to argue about those areas  where there is disagreement, and to support his own policies. He  strives to convince his opponents that he is right, to talk  people into accepting his views, and to make them his  supporters. If during a discussion he realizes that his ideas  are wrong, he stops supporting them. There has been repeated  criticism that we do not know how to take the views of others  into consideration and that we are unable to work with opponents.    Courage is needed to argue with the president and, on  occasion, to come out against him. If one is opposed to him, one  will have to justify one's ideas in detail. However, Nazarbayev  respects the views of Minister of Economics Beysenbay Iztilewov  on theoretical questions. He takes into consideration the views  of such persons as Minister of Finance Yerkeshbay Derbisov,  First Deputy Prime Minister Dawlet Sembayev, Minister of  Agriculture Baltash Turysnbayev, Qwanysh Sultanov on spiritual  matters, and Abish Kekilbayev.    I suspect that the people know that the president takes  counsel with the other high officials of the republic: with the  chairman of the Supreme Kenges, with the vice-president, with  the prime minister, and carries out the appropriate work. May  God preserve us from becoming like some other countries where  one leader is in competition with the other; where one comes out  against what the other has said. The people are harmed by this.  If the leading officials of the state know how to achieve  concord, understanding, necessarily mutual respect, disagreeing  only when necessary, then conditions will be created for the  intelligent resolution of problems, whatever they are. In any  case, we must make it a virtue that national character comes  first and foremost from the head of state.    From what has been said above one should not conclude that  the president pays no attention to others on his staff.  Nazarbayev listens readily to good ideas whatever their source.    To finish this question, let me return to your original  question about presidential decisions.    We have said that ideas about very important questions  connected with the present era of transition, about the process  of our country's consolidation, and about the market economy  continue to come from the president. That is to say, the  president expresses key ideas and strategies for solutions.  Documents connected with very complex questions are prepared and  he reviews them in detail. They are also discussed at meetings  where the president is present or at sessions of the cabinet of  ministers. In this way documents are signed. At present drafts  of documents are prepared by those suggesting them. They are  discussed in detail and ways of achieving them discussed.  Signatures are collected starting with the lowest officials up  to the heads of government. Only them do I place the document  before the president. President Nazarbayev entrusts me with  seeing to it that everything is in order and that the document  is not contrary to existing law.    The Kazakhs have the expression "expect a person not to have  done a lot of things but to have experienced a lot of things."  The president's rich life time experience, the fact that he is  thoroughly involved with the broad masses, his amazing quickness  of thought, and abundant knowledge make it possible for him to  express well-based, intelligent thoughts with regard to whatever  the question. He is altogether divorced from any conceit. He  always offers new ideas that are proper. Whatever the question,  it is clear that President Nazarbayev has his own solution.  However, he does not choose to force his decisions on anyone. In  my view, first, it would seem as if he is testing himself and  whether or not his thoughts are founded on those of the masses  or not. Second, it would seem as if others are being subjected  to a presidential test in such cases.    [Smayyl] As you know, there was a certain chilliness among  the people towards the words spoken by the president at the time  of his trip to the United States to the effect that: "we are  still learning how to do things." There was incomprehension  about why he was late in expressing his views regarding the  August 1991 Moscow revolution, at the time of the referendum in  Russian following it, and at the economic solidarity of the  "Slavic three..."    [Abiqayev] Questions about this were at one time also asked  of the president and he answered them completely. In my view, we  must understand the need for the policy adopted by Kazakhstan in  connection with events taking place in Russia to be different  than that of some other CIS country. Second, what would we be  doing becoming involved in the internal affairs of Russia, an  independent country? Our relations with our neighbor to the  north are very good. The heads of the two nations cooperate in  many questions. Some credulous souls have said that the  president was frightened in connection with the situations  mentioned above and wish to blame him by saying that he did not  know what to do. I speak as someone who knows the president  well: Nazarbayev's personal resolution impresses everyone  whoever they are, but must not the chief of a great nation be  concerned with the mood of the time? For that reason, I think  that the policy maintained by the chief of our country was the  very best policy.    However, which of the new ideas expressed in his speech in  the United States were wrong? If you think it over, all of us,  beginning with President Nazarbayev, are still learning. This  being the case, is it not a good thing to learn from a country  with a history of more than 200 years.    [Smayyl] Nurtay, in the division of function you discussed  above, you said that the apparate was concerned with  investigation of the cadre policy of the leadership, with  investigation of state officials and cadres appointed by the  government, and with making nominations. How do you understand  that aspect of your duties?    [Abiqayev] The cadre question is something very complicated  and serious. Whether work gets done or not is, in my view,  connected with what kinds of cadres are managing what sector.  That is to say, because Saghat Tugelbayev, recently appointed  governor of Atyraw Oblast, is an energetic leader, an oblast  which has for many years seen no benefit whatever from the oil  it produces, is now showing that it is altogether possible to  renew the Atyraw area through that wealth. During last August  and September, when the president was in various oblasts of the  republic, he returned in a particularly good mood from his  Atyraw trip. There are many good cadres among rayon governors.  When the government of Almaty Oblast carried out a measure  connected with privatization in Talghar Rayon, the president was  satisfied with what the governor of the rayon, Alikhan Toybayev,  did.    Another example is the process of privatization which makes  special demands on cadres. If there is someone who does  particularly well in this area, it is the chairman of the state  committee, the deputy prime minister. Zhanibek Keribzhanov, who  manages this authority, understands production and financial  questions extremely well. However, the president has himself  contributed a great deal to the privatization question. Many  ideas have been expressed by Nazarbayev himself. Is not the  question a matter of continuing to hone and carry out those  thoughts in terms of its scope and of every circumstance?    At present individuals have come to the apparate who are  sharp, who are adequately informed about economic questions,  political conditions, and management techniques, and who, above  all, actively support and actively carry out the policies of the  president and of the government. Their average age is around 44.    [Smayyl] Formerly there was a well-known, single system for  educating, training, choosing, and placing cadres. Most cadres  were selected from the Komsomol, or from various industries.  What is the situation now.    Representatives of many nationalities live in Kazakhstan  along with the Kazakh people. Is not the continuation of the  division of the Kazakhs into hordes creating difficulties in  developing a cadre policy? Speak as forthrightly as possible.  What are the guiding principles in this area?    [Abiqayev] You are right, there was previously a carefully  defined system in cadre policy. This policy certainly had its  disadvantages and advantages. Bearing in mind present  circumstances and the demands of democracy, we have taken in  hand the creation of a new system for choosing cadres. This new  policy takes fully into consideration the responsibility borne  by cadres and social circumstances. We are in the process of  looking into the cadre question from the lowest level to the  very highest levels of the president's staff, each according to  his functions. It should be said that at the present time of  transition to a market economy the president is not happy with  the work of some oblast governors and some ministers. In this  connection we are looking at young cadres known for their  competence in industry and in commercial organizations.    The fact that there are representatives of many ethnic  groups  living with the Kazakhs is not, as you suggested, making cadre  policy more difficult. The question is one of which factor one  chooses to emphasize. If all residents of the republic think of  themselves primarily as Kazakhstani, who should be concerned  about what nationality, what place, what parents someone comes  from. The primary measure must be a person's competence,  knowledge, skill, and justice. Thereby there should be no  concern about percentages as in past years.    [Smayyl] Since you have spoken about those years, let me ask  a connected question. During the days of the December Incident,  Abiqayev, first secretary of the Frunze Rayon Party Committee,  was opposed to arming the peoples' militia with wooden clubs and  cleavers and the word quickly spread that: "I will not go  against my own people." However, the person who was then first  secretary of Oktyabyr Rayon became a secretary of the Central  Committee for producing the cleavers...    [Abiqayev] Alas, he heaped up such iron weapons in front of  our rayon party headquarters..    [Smayyl] Tell us, did those words have an influence upon  your  subsequent fate?    [Abiqayev] When I spoke those words, I was not thinking that  I was creating some historical heroism. When various [i.e.,  different] instructions began to come down from various places,  those words came first to the tip of my tongue. Subsequently,  they have had no influence at all upon my life or my career.    [Smayyl] Some have said that your father was the neighbor to  the president's father...    [Abiqayev] Lots of people want to be the president's family,  friend, or, if all else fails, neighbor. If they are not, they  pretend that they are and begin to envy. There is nothing  special about our fathers being neighbors. I was born in another  village. However, there are those who speak sarcastically in  this way about the fact that I, like President Nazarbayev, one  of the old-time people, am the son of a herdsman.    The "preservation among the Kazakhs of division into  hordes,"  as you worded it, cannot be said to be a factor having a  decisive influence upon cadre policy. Most of those making a lot  of noise about this or that horde or clan have limited need for  horde or clan interests. They are calling up the souls of their  ancestors, and, exhibiting a false shame, are striving for power  and hiding behind the shadows of figures with influence on the  people. They are looking out for their own interests. All the  talk about clan with regard to chief officials is, in any case,  because of that.    To go on repeating such talk after the great meeting  recently  at Ordabasy is tedious. Let me repeat again: the primary measure  of what one accomplishes is one's humanity.    [Smayyl] How are nominations for cadres to be appointed to  high office made? At least, there must be someone who first  mentions a certain person. But who are these people?    [Abiqayev] There must be an investigation. Ideas are  collected on what is being done in each sector. If a position  becomes available, as you know, various kinds of letters are  received and various people make various suggestions. However,  according to the established order, the following persons make  the first suggestions: first, the president and the other  leaders of the republic; second, there is a division in the  apparate concerned with the oblasts; third there is a division  carrying out cadre policy; fourth, there are the deputies of the  prime minister in every sector; fifth, there are the committees  of the Supreme Kenges; sixth, you can add me to their ranks.  Such suggestions are made by officials of the apparate too.  Since they are in contact with cadres on a daily basis, there  are many occasions when their evaluations, thoughts, and  viewpoints are altogether different.    [Smayyl] Some feel that, since they come in contact on a  daily basis and work closely with leading officials, they  themselves are really in control of things. What do you think  should officials in the apparate be like?    [Abiqayev] We have noted that there is a system for  selecting  cadres. If any one becomes arrogant, or mercenary, if they  attempt to make personal gain from their work in the apparate,  we have little to do with them. It seems that at present some  build up their own machine when they enter the apparate and when  they go to the oblast bring people along with them. We cannot be  in agreement with officials who fail to understand the proverb:  "if you are great, be small." Understanding that every person  has his own character, and respect for all is a quality  absolutely needed for apparate officials.    This question, in terms of the apparate managed by you which  provides services for the president and the government, must be  the primary question for you at any time. Do these special  characteristics of your office have an influence on your  personal life?    [Abiqayev] At a difficult time such as the present, the fate  of the nation and of the land of our people has been entrusted  to the hands of Nazarbayev. I know that my presence on the  president's staff under such circumstances is a responsibility  assigned me by fate. However, I and my family know well what  this responsibility demands.    Since the reins are held in the hands of the president for  the entire people, we must all assist him in carrying out all  his thoughts and plans. Only then will our nation pass quickly  from the time of consolidation and, entering upon the path of  development, grow to maturity. However, if everything that is  Kazakhstan is able to stand on its own two feet, it will be  clearly visible from every corner of the world.</p>

"Social-democratic in character, the programme lays stress on  welfare and is by all means reformist." The premier added that  decisive steps were in view for 1994 as far as restructuring and  privatisation are concerned. He mentioned that the government  was open to "a dialogue with political parties in search of  (restructuring and privatisation) solutions, and, if good ideas  are expressed, we are definitely ready to take them over."    The head of the Romanian executive rejected the "slogan"  saying that no reform had been carried out in Romania and showed  that important good things were achieved in 1993 in external  relations "in consequence of our policy of reform that has been  known and recognised as such." Premier Vacaroiu admitted that  "things did not go equally well as regards restructuring and  privatisation," although "more than 3,000 assets were sold and  more than 300 small- and middle-sized commercial companies were  privatised." The pace was too slow, implied Premier Vacaroiu,  who mentioned that 2,000 of the 6,7000 companies selected for  privatisation so far would be passed to private hands by making  use of the vouchers distributed to the population about two  years ago, for which shares can be bought."</p>

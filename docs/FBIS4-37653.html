			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, June 23, INA -- Yugoslav economy minister  [Milorad Unkovic], who is on a several-day visit to the country  said his government is looking forward to resume good ties with  Iraq and its leadership, especially in economic fields.    In press statements published here, the minister hailed  Iraqis steadfastness despite the tragic consequences resulting  from the continuation of the UN-imposed blockade on Iraq.    The imposition of blockade has greatly affected the  Iraqi-Yugoslav trade relations, the economy minister pointed out.    Iraq and Yugoslavia were used to exchange goods, equipment,  and other industrial supplies. Moreover about half of the  latter total needs of oil was used to be imported from Iraq, the  visiting minister added.    Furthermore, many Yugoslav companies had implemented  billion-dollars worth strategic projects in various parts of  Iraq just before the U.S.-led aggression and the imposition of  the sanctions.    According to the Yugoslav minister, who is also his  country's  representative to the meetings of the Iraqi-Yugoslav joint  economic committee, their presence in Baghdad will help enhance  and restore economic and scientific cooperation.    He referred to the current political situation in  Yugoslavia,  stressing that relations between countries of the world must be  based on firm and equal grounds.    The Yugoslav minister added that the United States was the  party responsible for the collapse of Yugoslavia and the  eruption of civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nevertheless,  the Yugoslav government and people are still fighting and  struggling to get independence, he concluded.    On the other hand, minister of planning, Samal Majid Faraj,  on Sunday [19 June] met with the Yugoslav economy minister and  the accompanying delegation. During the meeting, the two  ministers discussed means of boosting bilateral relations.</p>

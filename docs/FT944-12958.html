			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Savings rates up at last The long-awaited rise in variable savings rates, following the increase in base rates on September 12, has only now started to come through. That from the Halifax, which took effect from October 21,was 0.35 of a percentage point on most accounts. Compared with the rest of the industry, this seems fair. Bearing in mind, however, the millions of pounds the Halifax must have saved by its delay, it would have been hoped that the rise could have matched the increase the society made to its borrowers' rate (0.46 of a point). Alliance &amp; Leicester, Britannia and Leeds are the major movers this week, but their increases have not been across the board and vary from tier to tier. At least these societies have moved. Many have yet to react, taking the view that, if the money is still coming in, there is no need to raise rates. Credit must be given to Barclays, which increased rates to savers by the full half percentage point on September 12. All savers need to keep a wary eye on their investment products. Even where new rates have been announced, some tiers have risen by only 0.05 of a point and savers could do better elsewhere. Fixed-rate products that were quick to go up after the base rate increase are also beginning to fall, or be withdrawn, as rumours of another base rate rise subside. Halifax has reduced rates on its Guaranteed Reserve account by half a percentage point in recent weeks, and market-leading rates from Cheshire and Skipton have been withdrawn. Guaranteed income bonds are also on the slide: the best is down again to 8 per cent net (10.66 per cent gross).</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Reactor hopes NUCLEAR Electric's ageing reactors will stand a better chance of winning a new lease of life if, as expected, one of them breaks a world performance record this afternoon. The Magnox reactor, at Oldbury-on-Severn nuclear power station in Avon, will have been operating continuously for 700 days. Nuclear Electric has six other Magnox reactors, the oldest type of commercial reactor in the world. Oldbury's unbroken performance will help to support Nuclear Electric's case for keeping the seven Magnox reactors going, rather than retiring them at the conclusion of their thirty-year official life span.</p>

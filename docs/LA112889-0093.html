			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN WOULD CUT 250,000 TROOPS, 62 NAVY SHIPS;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE PENTAGON WOULD AX THREE ARMY DIVISIONS AND FIVE AIR FORCE WINGS.  MAJOR SHIFTS IN DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. FORCES WOULD BE REQUIRED.  </P> <P> The United States armed services have drafted plans to reduce military  personnel by more than 250,000 men and women and eliminate three active duty  Army divisions, five Air Force fighter wings and 62 Navy ships by 1994 to meet  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's demands for deep budget cuts, Pentagon  officials said.  </P> <P> The proposed reductions would dramatically change the face of the nation's  armed forces and would force major shifts in U.S. military strategy and the  global deployment of its personnel, ships and aircraft, Defense Department  officials said. It would mean a 16% reduction in active Army combat divisions,  a 20% cut in the Air Force's fighter wings and an 11% cutback of naval vessels.  </P> <P> Military leaders have proposed initiating the cuts in the 1991 fiscal year  budget that begins next Oct. 1, with the full reductions scheduled to be  completed by 1994, officials said. Cheney, however, is still engaged in a  political duel with Budget Director Richard G. Darman, who is seeking even more  severe military spending cuts. President Bush is expected to decide the  Pentagon's spending ceiling for the 1991 budget within the next two weeks,  officials said.  </P> <P> Cheney began planning for major military cuts two months ago but in recent  weeks has become more vocal about the reductions in response to the political  upheavals in the Warsaw Pact and the political pressures from a deficit-driven  Darman.  </P> <P> "Cheney has lost the battle -- Darman has the clout," one defense official  said. "Cheney had to get aboard to have a unified position with the  Administration and stop being the odd man out."  </P> <P> One defense official said the 1991 budget plan will be a "watershed," offering  a preview of the reductions likely over the next several years. "You can look  at '91 as an early warning," a military officer said.  </P> <P> Cheney, who on Sunday said deep new cuts may be possible in European forces,  has said he has not decided how much he will cut from the new five-year defense  plan President Bush will present to Congress in January. Cheney, attending a  NATO defense minister's meeting in Brussels, Belgium, this week, said the new  budgets will include average annual reductions of at least 2% after allowing  for inflation -- about $150 billion over the next three years.  </P> <P> Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services  subcommittee on projection forces and regional defense, in stressing how much  political priorities have shifted over the last five years, said: "If Cheney  comes in with minus 2% real growth, we'll make it minus 4."  </P></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Child World freezes credit payments CHILD WORLD, which claims to be the second largest discount toy retailer in the US, revealed yesterday that it has stopped paying trade creditors and landlords of its 125 stores. The troubled company said payments were being 'delayed,' although a spokesman declined to say when they might restart. Child World, based in Massachusetts, made the delayed payments public in conjunction with an announcement that it was 'entering discussion on new sources of equity financing'. It maintained the object of holding up creditor payment was to 'ensure that day-to-day operations continue to run smoothly'. The retailer added that its banks had entered 'an amendment and limited waiver' in relation to an existing credit facility, which constrict the facility to the amount outstanding for the next fortnight, in order to give time for the discussions to take place. Child World's financial problems last came to head in late-1990 when payments to creditors were also temporarily halted. However, in June 1991, the retailer's former owner - CNC Holding - sold its 82 per cent interest in the struggling company to an investor group led by two former executives of Toys 'R' Us, the largest retailer in the field. Under the deal, toy manufacturers were to receive sums over a number of years. This schedule had begun and was continuing until the current freeze of trade creditors payments became operative. Speculation that Child World, which operates stores under the Child World and Children Palace names, might be unable to make payments circulated last December, but a payment was made mid-month.</p>

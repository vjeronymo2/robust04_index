			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR VISIT ENDS; U.S., ISRAEL AVERT OPEN BREAK  </P> <P> Despite elaborate public displays of solidarity, this week's U.S.-Israel talks  about the Middle East peace process were often acrimonious, with the Israeli  side threatening an open confrontation unless the Bush Administration softened  its criticism of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, U.S. and  Israeli sources said Friday.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his government were angered by President  Bush's statement Monday that U.S. goals in the Middle East include "the end of  the occupation and achievement of Palestinian political rights."  </P> <P> Israeli officials interpreted those remarks as a tacit endorsement of the  creation of some sort of entity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip controlled by  the Palestine Liberation Organization. When Shamir and his party reached  Washington on Wednesday, Israeli officials told their American counterparts  that if Bush's comments, which he made after a meeting with Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak, accurately reflected U.S. policy, then the two countries were  facing an open break.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Put Our Dukes Up'  </P> <P> One Israeli source characterized the attitude of the Israeli side this way: "We  might as well put our dukes up and settle it right now." The source said Shamir  left no doubt that Israel would refuse to go along with any plan that afforded  even a remote chance that Arab armies might be moved into the West Bank or that  included any sort of role for the PLO. The source said that Israel would not  accept even a demilitarized Palestinian entity because pledges of peaceful  intent could be violated.  </P> <P> An Administration official conceded that the Israelis were angry when they  arrived. But he said the troubles were smoothed over during the course of  Shamir's visit, which ended Friday.  </P> <P> "The Israelis came here feeling bruised," the official said. "They are  naturally paranoid and feel they are boxed into a corner. There certainly is no  desire in the Administration to undercut the Israelis. We do want to work  toward the same goal. But we have different tactics. There is no question about  that.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Israelis Mollified  </P> <P> "They came away feeling a lot better than when they came here," the official  added.  </P> <P> Israeli sources said the confrontation was defused by Bush's qualified  endorsement of Shamir's proposal for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip  to choose Palestinians willing to negotiate terms for limited self-government.  </P> <P> "It is clear the United States has decided to walk with us," one Israeli said.  "Both sides wanted to find a middle ground."  </P> <P> Bush told a White House press conference Friday that although he was not elated  with Shamir's election plan, "In the Middle East, a little step sometimes can .  . . prove to be fruitful."  </P> <P> "I think that the answer is to get on with the elections," Bush said.  </P> <P> However, Washington and Jerusalem may have very different understandings of  what the elections will look like. U.S. officials clearly expect PLO-backed  candidates to sweep the elections. But Israeli officials say they expect the  balloting to select Palestinian leaders independent of the PLO.  </P> <P> Asked if the PLO would have a role in the elections, Bush said: "We haven't  fully resolved exactly who's going to have a role, but I think that's a matter  to be determined by -- between the parties. . . . The PLO has people living on  the West Bank, as you know, and we want to see elections that are free and fair  there."  </P> <P> Bush also said he has not changed his view that two key U.N. Security Council  resolutions require Israel to yield at least part of the West Bank and Gaza  Strip. Shamir has argued that Israel met the conditions outlined by the  resolutions when it returned the Sinai to Egypt a decade ago.  </P> <P> "I do not feel that the provisions of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338  have been fulfilled," Bush said. "The territory that has been ceded for peace  (so far) is not the end. It simply isn't."  </P> <P> The resolutions require Israel to withdraw from territory seized in the 1967  Middle East war. The United States has long interpreted that to mean that  Israel should yield most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, although some  adjustments to the pre-1967 borders would be acceptable. Arab parties have  insisted that the resolutions require Israel to withdraw from all occupied  land, including East Jerusalem and part of what is now the main Jerusalem-Tel  Aviv highway.  </P> <P> Under Shamir's election plan, Palestinians would be selected to negotiate with  Israel over an interim "autonomy" plan which would allow the Arabs to run their  own domestic affairs but would retain Israeli control over security. Shamir  also has promised to negotiate a final settlement following the autonomy  period.  </P> <P> Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories and the PLO at its headquarters  in Tunis announced their rejection of the plan Friday. However, both Israeli  and American officials have expressed hope that the elections can be structured  in a way that would attract wide Palestinian participation.  </P> <P> When State Department spokesman Richard Boucher was asked if Washington expects  Palestinians to participate in the elections, he said, "The Palestinians'  decisions probably depend on how the details are worked out."  </P> <P> Another Administration official said most Palestinians' "natural inclination is  to reject anything Shamir will propose because it comes from Shamir." But he  added, "Palestinians should take a look at this because it is a more positive  approach from the Israeli side than they have ever heard before."  </P></p>

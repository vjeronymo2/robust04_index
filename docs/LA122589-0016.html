			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAM NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> INTERCEPTIONS NEW TO RAMS' STRICKLAND  </P> <P> Before Sunday, Ram linebacker Fred Strickland didn't remember intercepting a  pass in his life.  </P> <P> Apparently, he was saving up for the New England Patriots. In the Rams' 24-20  victory at Sullivan Stadium, Strickland had two key interceptions in the first  half that may have saved his team's season.  </P> <P> The Patriots were second and 13 at the Rams' 14-yard line late in the first  quarter when Strickland stepped in front of a Marc Wilson pass and returned it  29 yards, bailing the Rams out of deep trouble.  </P> <P> "On the first one," Strickland said, "LeRoy Irvin came over to me and told me  to watch out for the quick slant in from the wide out, and as soon as I looked  at the quarterback he looked that way and I ran right toward the wide out. I  just tried to run as far as I could run."  </P> <P> Strickland's second interception, in the second quarter, came against Wilson's  replacement, Steve Grogan. Again, it stopped another potential scoring drive.  This one came with the Patriots on the Rams' nine with a first down.  </P> <P> Strickland returned this interception 27 yards to the 32.  </P> <P> To put it as mildly as possible, Jim Everett endured the cold. He completed 13  of 29 passes, had two interceptions and finished with 181 yards, his lowest  total of the season.  </P> <P> But he also put 24 points on the scoreboard, enough to get the Rams into the  playoffs.  </P> <P> "Mistakes are part of the game," Everett said. "We're human. I made a couple of  early mistakes, but the main thing is to recover from them. Go on from there.  Don't dwell on them."  </P> <P> Everett finished the regular season with 4,210 passing yards, the ninth-highest  total in National Football League history. With one touchdown pass Sunday,  Everett ended the season with 29, two shy of the Ram record he set in 1988.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Patriots' four-headed quarterback fell short of 4,000 yards,  with Steve Grogan, Marc Wilson, Doug Flutie and the recently departed Tony  Eason combining for 3,957 yards.  </P> <P> The breakdown:  </P> <P>  -- Grogan: 1,697 yards.  </P> <P>  -- Wilson: 1,006.  </P> <P>  -- Eason: 761.  </P> <P>  -- Flutie: 493.  </P> <P> Each quarterback had at least three starts, with Grogan leading the pack with  six.  </P> <P> New England running back John Stephens on the Patriots' 5-11 season: "No one  person in particular did terribly bad. I'm just glad we were able to stick  together."  </P> <P> Best politically motivated banner of the year: In reference to Central  America's most elusive runner, fans in the bleachers at Sullivan Stadium held  up a poster that read: "Tackle Noriega."  </P> <P> File this one under the Inauspicious Debut category: Crowd favorite Steve  Grogan got a roaring ovation when he took the field to replace former Raider  Marc Wilson at quarterback early in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Grogan then fumbled his first snap from center and fell on it for a two-yard  loss.  </P> <P> On the Patriots' next possession, Grogan's first pass was blocked and, on the  next play, he lost control of the ball while pump faking. After a television  replay, the play was ruled an incomplete pass.  </P> <P> Irvin's assessment of Sunday's game: "Just another typical Ram game."  </P> <P> Despite the elements, the Rams drew the fewest number of penalties -- three --  of any of their 16 regular-season games. The 26 yards assessed was the  second-lowest only to the 25 they were charged with in the Oct. 22 game with  New Orleans.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writers Chris Dufresne and Mike Penner contributed to this story.  </P></p>

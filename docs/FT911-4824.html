			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Microsoft 63% ahead at nine months MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software publisher, reported record revenues and profits for its third fiscal quarter, exceeding analysts expectations, writes Louise Kehoe. Revenues for the quarter jumped 57 per cent to Dollars 486.9m from Dollars 310.9m in the same period last year. Third-quarter net income was Dollars 123.8m, or 98 cents per share, an increase of 65 per cent over Dollars 75.2m, or 62 cents, a year ago. Revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 1991, were Dollars 1.3bn, 56 per cent more than the Dollars 846.5m for the same period of fiscal 1990. Net income for the nine months rose 63 per cent to Dollars 324.3m, or Dollars 2.61 per share, from Dollars 199.2m, or Dollars 1.69, a year ago. Microsoft's performance is remarkable in light of slowing sales growth in the personal computer market, particularly in the US. The company said it achieved record revenues from retail sales of applications programs and from sales of operating system software through computer manufacturers.</p>

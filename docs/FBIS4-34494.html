			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the Dominica Labor Party, Rosie  Douglas, has chastised the governments of the region for not  coming to the rescue of Haiti. Douglas, who was also a panelist  on the "One" discussion program, noted that in light of the end  of the Cold War and the quest for economic cooperation in the  region, Caribbean governments [words indistinct] time ago. He  suggested that the governments join hands with the Black Caucus  of the United States in the current move to pressure the Clinton  administration to bring down the illegal regime in Haiti.    [Begin Douglas recording] We are going to impose a serious  blockade, not without [words indistinct] spoke to the government  in Santo Domingo who would send military advisors that will  ensure that no oil flows to Haiti. That kind of embargo is much  more serious. And I think the Caribbean governments realize it  is at that point when the United States drifted away from the  original objective of ridding the country of that kind of  dictatorship. That is where the Caribbean governments [words  indistinct] the Cold War is over [word indistinct] to that  return now that they are associate membership in Santo Domingo,  now that they have broken the ice with Cuba.    I think that at that time, the Caribbean as a group should  have stood up to [word indistincts]. But they are still more or  less simply endorsing what the United States is doing, but they  themselves are not taking up the kind of responsibility, in the  light of the end of the Cold War, in the lack of the need of  that kind of economic bloc in the Caribbean. They should have  been the ones sticking up the [words indistinct] nothing through  the back door -- Jamaica, Trinidad are ready, then talking as  one voice -- Haiti is part of the Caribbean -- and linked  through the Black Caucus. The Black Caucus would like the  Caribbean leaders to link much closer to them, and tell Mr.  Clinton, look, action must be taken. I believe now that the  approach we take now on the pressure from the Black Caucus will  see the end of that dictatorship, certainly before the end of  this year. [end recording]</p>

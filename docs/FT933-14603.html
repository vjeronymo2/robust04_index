			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Merck board seek successor A DECISION not to confirm Mr Richard Markham, heir-apparent at Merck, to the position of chairman was yesterday seen as the most likely reason for his sudden and unexpected departure from the company. Since the 42-year old Mr Markham was appointed to the number-two job of president and chief operation officer last December, leapfrogging more experienced Merck executives, he had moved fast to install his own appointees at senior management level. The speed of the change, and an aggressive management style, are reported to have caused disquiet among other senior executives. Merck refused to say whether the board had decided against confirming Mr Markham as successor to Mr Roy Vagelos, the chairman who is due to retire next year. However, it added: 'Mr Markham was a leading candidate to succeed Dr Vagelos, but he was never the named successor.' The most likely successor to Mr Vagelos is expected to come from among the four vice-presidents on the seven-person chairman's staff. No decision is likely soon. Mr Markham is unlikely to be succeeded by another chief operating officer, a title that had been created for him, the company said Merck denied that the departure had been prompted by any disagreement over business style, saying only that it was for 'personal' reasons. Mr Markham's departure was seen on Wall Street as likely to make little difference to Merck's overall strategy. By midday in New York the company's shares had slipped by only Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 . Lex, Page 14</p>

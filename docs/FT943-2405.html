			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / US troops fly in to control Haiti: Signs of co-operation by junta raise hopes for success of occupation mission US troops yesterday spread out unopposed around Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, after completing the first stage of a mission President Bill Clinton defined as 'limited in time and scope'. By last night 3,000 troops were expected to have arrived. Signs that Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, the republic's military ruler, was co-operating with US military commanders in ensuring an uncontested US landing fuelled hopes in Washington for the success of the operation to restore democracy. Retired general Colin Powell, previous head of the US joint chiefs of staff and a key figure in the negotiating mission led by former US president Jimmy Carter, said this was early evidence that the military junta was prepared to live up to the letter of the agreement. The deal between the US delegation and the Haitian military rulers was reached at the last minute on Sunday night local time, as the first US airborne invasion troops were on their way to Haiti from their bases. It stipulated that the members of the junta would quit no later than October 15 and paved the way for what it is hoped will be a peaceful intervention in Haiti by US forces. The first US troops from the Tenth Mountain Division landed by helicopter from the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower. US officials said 15,000 troops, the maximum deployment envisaged, were expected to be in position by the end of the week. A succession of helicopters, followed by fixed-wing aircraft, swung low over Port-au-Prince bay and skimmed over the tree tops into the civilian airport north of the city. Gen Hugh Shelton, commander of the US armed forces in Haiti, landed to discuss with Gen Cedras the details of co-operation between the occupation force and the Haitian military. He emerged from the meeting saying that 'the Haitians are our friends'. The general's emphasis on co-operation was echoed by US helicopters which circled over the city with loudspeakers blaring in Creole, 'This is not an invasion, we are here to work with the Haitian army. This is not an invasion'. In Port-au-Prince, the streets emptied during the day as people retreated to their homes amid widespread anxiety about the US operation. However, by early evening thousands of local people gathered at the port, lured by the military spectacle and emboldened by the US presence. The crowd chanted calls for the return of Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted as president in the 1991 coup. They were chased away by Haitian police armed with clubs and semi-automatic weapons. In Washington, Mr Clinton stressed that the force's immediate mission was 'to make sure the leaders keep their word'. The president and members of the US delegation acknowledged that the agreement placed the junta under no obligation to leave the island. This has caused open concern among advisers to Mr Aristide. Mr Randall Robinson, the Washington human rights activist whose hunger strike this year influenced US policies, said the agreement was 'terribly flawed'. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, questioned why General Cedras was 'allowed to stick around until October 15, maybe stay in the country and maybe run for president next year'. But Mr Clinton and Mr Carter pointed out at a joint press conference that the Governor's Island agreement of July last year, also designed to ensure the restoration of democratically elected government but never honoured by the junta, would not have forced them into exile. 'I think they probably will leave - and should leave,' Mr Clinton said, 'but this still has to be worked out by all the actors in the Haitian problem.' The agreement was greeted with huge relief in Washington, where a fully fledged invasion was widely opposed. Reports and analysis, Page 4 Japanese pledge, Page 9</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCE SPONSORED BY ARAB LEAGUE HOLDS IN BEIRUT  </P> <P> A noon cease-fire called by the Arab League held Friday, but the issue that  sparked weeks of brutal artillery battles remains unresolved.  </P> <P> The Museum Crossing linking Muslim West Beirut and Christian East Beirut  reopened. All front lines were reported calm.  </P> <P> But the two sides remained at odds over Christian army commander Michel Aoun's  continued blockade of ports.  </P> <P> A few people walked across the line in both directions for the first time since  March 21, when Syrian troops and their Lebanese Muslim allies laid siege to the  Christian heartland by closing all crossings in response to the blockade.  </P> <P> Lebanese who have seen hundreds of abortive cease-fires in the 14 years of  civil war were skeptical and most stayed indoors.  </P></p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Break for the Border Higher costs of operating as a listed company since its flotation in May reduced pre-tax profits at Break for the Border Group from Pounds 149,000 to Pounds 140,000 for the six months to September 30. Sales at the restaurant and nightclub operator rose to Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 1.87m). Gross profit came to Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 1.41m) but operating expenses took Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.26m). Earnings per share came to 1.6p (2.6p). Mr Ian Howard, chief executive, pointed out that traditionally two thirds of turnover came in the second half and the burden of overheads fell heavily on the first half. As December was such an important month the company would make a trading statement in January.</p>

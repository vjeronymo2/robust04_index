			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 23 May (PANA) -- Four prominent leaders of  the Ogoni community in southeastern Nigeria have been reported  killed in political violence connected with Monday's [23 May]  national constitutional conference election. Reports reaching  Lagos Monday from Port Harcourt, capital of south eastern state  of Rivers, said the four were killed on Saturday in a leadership  tussle for delegate slots for the June-December conference.    State military administrator, Lieutenant Colonel Dauda Komo,  named those killed to include Albert Badey, a former secretary  to the state military government and Edward Kobani, a former  commissioner and prominent politician in the state. The others  were Samuel Orage, also an ex-commissioner and his brother  Theophilus Orage.    Komo said the incident took place at Giokonkoo, the  ancestral  home of the Gokana people in Ogoni. He said that security  reports indicated that the assailants after murdering the four,  took their bodies in a car to a nearby forest and burnt the  corpses. the administrator pledged that those who committed the  crime would be brought to book.    Meanwhile, the president of the Movement for the Survival of  the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Ken Saro-Wiwa, has been reported  arrested for alleged violation of rules governing the  constitutional conference. Saro-Wiwa, who has been in the  forefront of the campaign for Ogoni self-determination because  of what MOSOP called "exploitation" of the oil-rich community by  oil companies and successive Nigerian governments, was reported  arrested at the weekend following his campaign to be elected a  constitutional conference delegate.</p>

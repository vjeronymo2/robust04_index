			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> COLEMAN NAMED CW CAGE COACH  </P> <P> Gil Coleman was named the new basketball coach at Central Washington University  today, even as former coach Dean Nicholson clouded the waters with reports that  he may rescind his resignation.  </P> <P> Coleman, 33, signed a one-year contract and is the first non-Nicholson to lead  the NAIA school's basketball program since 1929.  </P> <P> Leo Nicholson was named coach that year and his son, Dean, succeeded him in  1965.  </P> <P> To satisfy affirmative action guidelines, Coleman, an assistant coach under  Nicholson last season, will have to reapply for the position next December when  the school begins a nationwide search for a permanent coach, Frederick said.  </P> <P> The school's announcement made no mention of reports that Nicholson plans to  take back the resignation he offered April 2, after a university auditor found  that he improperly distributed more than $65,000 of his basketball camp  revenues to 49 players over the last three years.  </P></p>

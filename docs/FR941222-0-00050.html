This amendment is prompted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes.

That action proposed to require inspection of certain landing gear brakes for wear and replacement if the wear limits prescribed in this AD are not met, and incorporation of the specified wear limits into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, BFGoodrich, requests that the tables contained in the proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that list maximum brake wear limits for the affected airplanes be revised. BFGoodrich  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that the airplane model/series listed for BFGoodrich series 2&hyph;1526 brake part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers should be ``A320,'' instead of ``A320&hyph;220'' and ``A320&hyph;200.'' The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also indicates that three additional part numbers for BFGoodrich brakes should be listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the tables for Model A320 series airplanes: Part numbers 2&hyph;1526, 2&hyph;1526&hyph;5 (both with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum wear limits of 1.97 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;), and 2&hyph;1572 (with a maximum wear limit of 2.68 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the FAA agrees with the commenter's remarks, inclusion of the three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional part numbers specified by the commenter would necessitate (under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period for public comment, considering additional comments received, and eventually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months. In the interest of issuing this final rule, and in consideration of the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original notice, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that further delay of this final rule action is not appropriate. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA may consider further rulemaking on this issue to address the three additional part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers discussed by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members, suggests that measuring the maximum length of the wear pin may not be as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective as measuring the total length of the wear pin or controlling the carbon thickness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the brake. The commenter points out that, due to human error, it is possible to have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thinner disc with the same amount of wear pin length showing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur. The FAA infers from the commenter's remarks that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is referring to controlling the carbon thickness of the brakes by direct measurement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thickness of the brake stack. The FAA finds that measuring the thickness of the brake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stack would only be useful when specifying the brake assembly configuration and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thicknesses of new, refurbished, or overhauled individual discs. Otherwise, a brake disc  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is too thin also could be installed in a brake stack having a wear limit that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled by measuring the stack thickness. Further, it would not be practical to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routinely measure the brake stack on the airplane as all of the wheels attached to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brakes would have to be removed to allow access to accomplish the measurement. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA considers that this would pose an unwarranted burden on operators. Currently, only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wear pin must be monitored while the brake is installed on the airplane. If an operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the wear limit, the pin could be shortened or the operator could devise a method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of accounting for the reduced wear using the existing wear pin as opposed to removing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wheel and measuring the brake stack. (Thus, the wheels would not have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from the airplane since the wear pin can still be used to monitor brake wear.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The wear limits specified in this AD, which are used to establish wear pin lengths,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are interdependent with the brake configuration and minimum disc and stack thicknesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The stack and disc thicknesses are specified for new, refurbished, or overhauled brakes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the airplane maintenance manual (AMM), the component maintenance manual (CMM), a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service bulletin, or the brake manufacturer's assembly drawings. These minimum brake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stack and disc thicknesses have been established by tests and in-service wear data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis such that monitoring a wear pin should not allow the stack or disc minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits to be exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA also questions the need for the proposed AD, and requests that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision be included in paragraph (a)(2) of the AD to state that the AD would no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be applicable to operators that have acceptably revised their maintenance programs, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that operators choosing this provision could use an alternative recordkeeping method in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lieu of that required by &sect;&sect;91.417 or 121.380 of the Federal Aviation Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA states that if its suggested provision is not included, confusion will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always exist as to what records should be maintained for the duration A300/A320  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. The ATA maintains that once an operator incorporates the criteria (brake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wear limits) specified in the proposal into the maintenance program, the AD should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signed off as complete, since such incorporation is the stated purpose of the AD. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA is aware of an FAA concern that the proposed type of rule must continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indefinitely because operators may otherwise escalate intervals through their reliability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The ATA states that adjustments to operators' programs are accomplished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with substantiation and with the approval of FAA Flight Standards District Offices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FSDO). The ATA maintains that FAA FSDO's have sufficient authority to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators maintain the brakes on their Model A300/A320 series airplanes once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed criteria (brake wear limits) have been incorporated into an operator's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

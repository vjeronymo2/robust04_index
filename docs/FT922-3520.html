			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television We could be living through the end of television's golden age. Four programmes in peak hours tonight may be the sort which, in five years time, will be rare or non-existent. Business Matters seeks to discover why the economies of Hong Kong and Singapore, both founded by the British, have grown faster than Britain's (7.30 BBC2). This Week (8.30 ITV) investigates legalised prostitution (not that it is illegal now, of course, only soliciting or running a brothel). The Dutch have just fully legalised the business and next week the Mothers' Union will announce whether its members support the call for legalisation in Britain. One of the most intriguing ideas for a long time is Pandora's Box (9.30 BBC2), which uses clips from feature films, cartoons and home movies to explore the cultural impact of 20th century science. Today: the Russian attempt to run a scientific society to a Plan. True Stories (9.30 C4) tells of the four eccentric Ward brothers who lived until recently in a two-roomed shack in New York state. In June 1990 Bill was found dead in the bed he had always shared with brother Delbert.</p>

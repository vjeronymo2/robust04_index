			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry  will conduct hearings on housing makers and other related  industries on Japan's regulations on imports of houses and  construction materials, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said  Tuesday [29 March]. Igarashi told a press conference after the  day's cabinet meeting that the ministry will call executives of  housing makers, contractors, and trading houses in early April  to hear their opinions on the restrictions.    The results of the hearings will be referred to when the  ministry works out deregulatory steps in these areas.    Easing of the curbs on housing imports is viewed as a  necessary step to bring down Japan's relatively expensive house  building costs. The ministry has drafted an action plan to  reduce the Japanese costs by one-third by 2000.</p>

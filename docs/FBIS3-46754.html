			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The observation of human rights in  Indonesia this year has been poor.    The Indonesian Bar Association (Ikadin) in its assessment of  legal sector development in the past 12 months found much  lacking.    "Ikadin sees an erosion in the way human rights were  respected, as exemplified by limitations and violations of the  rights to associate and to express opinions and of the  principles of democracy," the organization announced yesterday.    The statement cited the arrests and prosecution of students  for staging demonstrations as a clear violation of the  principles of democracy, especially the rights to express  opinions and to have different views, which are guaranteed by  the constitution.    The police are currently detaining 21 students and a human  rights activist, who will be charged with insulting President  Suharto, an offense punishable with six years imprisonment.    Ikadin noted that the authorities have detained a number of  people without going through the proper procedures as required  by the Criminal Code, and this, it said "is one reason for the  decline in the integrity of the law."    Ikadin did not give any examples, but the authorities came  under strong criticism, when in October, they detained nine men  accused of murdering labor activist Marsinah. The case has  become highly political.    The warrants for their arrests were not issued until after  pressures from relatives, lawyers and wide media exposure made  it all but impossible to delay doing so further.    Ikadin deplored the use of violence and intimidation against  people who were defending their land and other legitimate  rights. "These represented violation of the most fundamental  human rights."    There have been a series of incidents pitting the  authorities  against the local people in land disputes. Most notable was the  one in Nipah, on Madura Island, in September, which left four  people dead. The military leadership was quick to remove three  local officers, who were considered directly responsible for the  incident.    The lawyers' association also deplored the bureaucratic  obstacles imposed by the authorities for people holding  gatherings, congresses, seminars and even anniversaries, all of  which can only be held with permission.    Ikadin also noted a series of government bans, prohibiting  certain people from appearing before academic seminars. "This is  alone a form of suppression of the principle of campus freedom."    Leading human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution was banned  from appearing before two seminars this month and noted poet  W.S. Rendra also suffered the same fate earlier on.    The statement, which was the result of a year-end meeting,  was signed by Ikadin's chairman, Harjono Citrosubono, and its  Secretary-General, Johan Jauhary.    Also taking part in the year-end Ikadin meeting held last  week were E.J. Kanter, Sukarjo Adijoyo, Alie Amangku, Kitty  Sugondo, Frans H. Winarta, Abdul Hakim Garuda Nusantara and  Luhut M.P. Pangaribuan.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Metall Mining to shut down smelter for three years Metall Mining, the inter-national copper producer until recently controlled by Germany's Metallgesellschaft, plans to close its Copper Range smelter in Michigan next spring for about three years. The Toronto-based company yesterday put a brave face on the shutdown and various changes in mining practices at Copper Range which have dented productivity. The changes coincide with proposed modifications to the smelter required by tighter environmental standards. Mr Klaus Zeitler, Metall chief executive, said that the mining changes would have a detrimental effect on earnings for the rest of this year, 'but in the long-term it will have a highly beneficial effect'. Metall's share price dipped by 75 cents to close at CDollars 12 on the Toronto stock exchange. The Copper Range news overshadowed an overall improvement in third-quarter performance, caused by rising metal prices and higher investment income. Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 6.1m (USDollars 4.49m) or 7 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 5.9m loss, equal to 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues climbed to CDollars 208.5m from CDollars 44.5m, largely as a result of last year's acquisition from Metallgesellschaft of a 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche Affinerie, the European copper smelter. Copper Range's cathode output fell to 22.6m lbs from 24.8m lbs, due to lower grades and productivity. Metall said that copper grades slid by more than 10 per cent during the quarter as a result of difficult mining conditions, and a decision to stop second-pass mining. Cash operating costs averaged USDollars 1.05 a lb, up from 78 cents in 1993. The suspension of second-pass, or pillar, mining, is designed to ensure stable rock conditions for solution mining, which is expected to be introduced in tandem with the smelter modifications. Metall has reached an agreement with Canada's Hudson Bay Mining to process Copper Range concentrates for 33 months, starting next March. Dr Zeitler said that Metall was keen to acquire another large copper mining project. Its interest was focused on South America. It suffered a setback recently with a failed bid for the Tintaya copper project in Peru. But Teck Corporation, in which Metall is a minority shareholder, unveiled plans yesterday for a final feasibility study of the large Petaquilla deposit in Panama.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE CANDIDATE FACES ARREST WARRANT FOR SPEEDING  </P> <P> Gary McDonald, a former Lawndale planning commissioner and a candidate for City  Council in the April 10 election, faces a misdemeanor arrest warrant for a  speeding ticket he received in Inglewood in January, 1989.  </P> <P> The warrant was issued last April 27 in Inglewood Municipal Court after  McDonald failed to meet an April 13 deadline to provide proof that he had  attended traffic school, court officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> McDonald can avoid arrest by providing that proof or by paying a $243 fine,  officials said.  </P> <P> McDonald said Friday that he attended Aids Driving School in Lawndale in  January, 1989, and that it is possible he did not send documentation to the  court. He said he paid in cash and does not have a canceled check to show he  attended the school, but he said he will clear up the problem on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The school, which is headquartered in Santa Ana, has since closed its Lawndale  branch. Rob Blamey, a spokesman for the school, said he has been unable to find  a record of McDonald's attendance. But he said it is possible that records  might have been misplaced.  </P> <P> Council members and other candidates in the April election said McDonald should  be held accountable for the violation.  </P> <P> "If he is going to be a council member he should pay his tickets," said  Councilman Dan McKenzie, a longtime supporter who signed McDonald's nomination  papers.  </P> <P> Some critics said that McDonald, who has made a point of personally  investigating alleged wrongdoing by city employees, should not ignore the law  as it applies to him.  </P> <P> Virginia Rhodes, a community activist and mayoral candidate in the upcoming  election, said: "People who live in glass houses should not throw stones."  </P> <P> The warrant stems from a ticket McDonald received on Jan. 10, 1989. On that day  Inglewood police stopped him in the 800 block of Main Street for driving 43  m.p.h. in a 25 m.p.h. zone.  </P> <P> According to court officials, McDonald had until April 13 to show that he had  attended traffic school. But the deadline passed, and when Inglewood court  officials had still received no word from McDonald by April 27 they issued the  warrant.  </P> <P> McDonald played down the significance of the warrant and said his critics and  challengers should concentrate on the issues in the election and not on  personalities.  </P> <P> "If it was a murder warrant or a robbery warrant, I would understand; but this  is petty," he said.  </P> <P> Longtime supporter Councilman Larry Rudolph agreed. "There are issues out  there. Why can't they talk about the issues?" he said.  </P> <P> However, Councilwoman Carol Norman, a vocal critic of McDonald, said the  warrant and other past incidents indicate a pattern.  </P> <P> "He seems to feel he is above laws," she said. "There is a certain arrogance in  his behavior."  </P> <P> In December, McDonald was criticized by Mayor Sarann Kruse for operating his  development consulting business for almost six months without a business  license. McDonald renewed his license a week after a Times reporter asked him  about it.  </P> <P> In 1988, Kruse accused McDonald of plagiarism in a campaign statement he wrote  for Councilman Harold Hofmann. McDonald later issued a public apology, saying  he thought lines he copied from Kruse were common phrases that could be used  without attribution. "I realize now I was totally wrong," he said at the time.  </P> <P> Often described by critics as a zealot who tries to interfere in city business  without respect to due process, McDonald has nonetheless conducted several  one-man investigations that have resulted in disciplinary actions or dismissal  of city employees.  </P> <P> For example, it was McDonald's research of city records that prompted an  investigation of an alleged scheme by city maintenance workers to embezzle  money and property. Last month the district attorney's office filed four felony  charges against a former maintenance supervisor who allegedly headed the  scheme.  </P></p>

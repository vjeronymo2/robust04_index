			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / GA seeks Pounds 300m in share capital GENERAL Accident, the third largest composite (general and life) insurer, yesterday announced that it aimed to raise capital to finance possible expansion after posting a significant improvement in the first six months of 1992. Pre-tax losses fell to Pounds 21.2m compared with Pounds 105.2m at the halfway stage last year. Perth-based GA recorded a profit of Pounds 9.5m in the second quarter and maintained its dividend at 9.7p per share. The company is to seek shareholders' approval to issue up to Pounds 300m preference shares. This is designed to reduce debt and increase GA's leeway to augment its premium income at a time when insurance rates are rising in most of its main markets. Mr Nelson Robertson, chief general manager, ruled out any sudden expansion but added that the company did not want 'to feel unduly restricted' as profits came through. An issue of Pounds 100m would allow GA to boost solvency (net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income) to 40 per cent from 37 per cent and to reduce its debt, which stands at Pounds 610m. Debt of Pounds 250m is due for rescheduling next spring. The announcement, which follows a Pounds 100m issue by Commercial Union in May, is a further indication of an improvement in trading conditions for UK insurers. Companies such as GA, CU and Guardian Royal Exchange, which lack large exposure to mortgage indemnity business - where analysts forecast an upward revision of losses in view of the continuing slump in the housing market - are particularly well placed. At GA, a sharp reduction in underwriting losses to Pounds 216.3m, compared with a Pounds 288.9m loss in the same half last year, underpinned the improvement. Long-term profits fell to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 15.5m profit). Estate agency losses rose to Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 8.4m loss) and net investment income to Pounds 190.4m (Pounds 176.1m). UK underwriting losses were substantially reduced to Pounds 104.8m (Pounds 178.4m loss), following cost-cutting measures and a more selective approach towards underwriting. Staff numbers in the UK have fallen from 8,000 to about 6,500. The number of policyholders in the loss-making motor sector has fallen by about 20 per cent. Lex, Page 18; Market, Page 36</p>

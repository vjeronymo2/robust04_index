			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Frankfurt still favourite THE German government yesterday denied reports that it was prepared to propose Bonn as an alternative base for the future European central bank. Frankfurt was still the country's candidate, according to Mr Dieter Vogel, the official government spokesman. 'Chancellor Kohl has not changed his opinion,' he said. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, also supported Frankfurt, his ministry said. However, officials in Mr Kohl's office are known to favour preparation of a fall-back negotiating position for the time when decisions must be made. The denials followed reports that Bonn had been suggested as an alternative after resistance from other EC members.</p>

This announcement was made by Teodulo Hernandez, secretary  general of the CGTP [General Confederation of Peruvian Workers].  He said the U.S. Department of Commerce has suspended until June  the implementation of sanctions against Peru for systematically  violating 16 workers' rights recognized by the International  Labor Organization [ILO].    Hernandez said that the implementation of sanctions was  postponed at his request, in his capacity as highest  representative of the Peruvian labor union, to the U.S.  Department of Commerce in Washington.    Hernandez said: "We have given President Alberto Fujimori's  government time (104 days) to eliminate the articles of the  labor law that violate the Peruvian workers' rights and  liberties."    Moreover, he demanded the resignation of Labor Minister  Augusto Antonioli and of Ricardo Marcerano, CCD [Democratic  Constituent Congress] Labor and Social Security Commission  president, who are regarded as responsible for the possible  sanction.    Hernandez recalled that in June 1992 the CGTP and other  Peruvian labor unions reported the systematic violation of  workers' rights in Peru to the ILO.    The labor union leader said: "The final ILO report  questioned  16 articles of the labor law. Moreover, the American Federation  of Labor of the United States acknowledged this report and  submitted it to the U.S. Department of Commerce."    Hernandez explained that, in his capacity as CGTP leader, he  and other leaders visited Washington between 9 and 11 March to  explain to the U.S. authorities the current situation of the  Peruvian workers as a result of the laws enacted by Fujimori's  government.

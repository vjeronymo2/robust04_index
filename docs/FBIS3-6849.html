The call has come from the Cook Islands high commissioner to  Australia, Vincent Ingram, who has warned the allegations could  severly affect the country.    Mr. Ingram has returned to Rarotonga to advise Sir Geoffrey  on the issue. He said he has told the prime minister to take a  more interventionist approach to the matter.    The allegations were made earlier this week by the New  Zealand parliamentarian, Winston Peters. Mr. Peters told the  New Zealand parliament that Cook Islands Government was  operating financial scams worth millions of dollars. He tabled  documents he said supported his claims.    Reports from Rarotonga say that today, Sir Geoffrey has said  he will not look at the documents and he has denied any  wrongdoing.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rival Topic systems to be launched in October ICV and Telekurs, the two companies chosen by the London Stock Exchange to develop the next generation of its Topic market information system, plan to launch competing versions in October. ICV, a UK financial information company, took on existing Topic contracts with users of 14 terminals or fewer, while Telekurs, owned by a consortium of Swiss banks, took the bigger ones. There are some 10,000 Topic terminals in use, roughly split between the two companies. Telekurs said yesterday that it would unveil a new system on October 4 which would offer a choice of satellite or landlines for data communication. ICV said its Topic 3 range, to be launched on October 19, would reduce costs by between 15 and 30 per cent, compared with the existing version of the 12-year-old service. The company has invested about Pounds 3m in developing Topic 3 products. These include a version for use with Windows software. Mr David Taylor, ICV's managing director, said data for Topic 3 would be delivered by satellite. ICV has rented broadcast capacity from France Telecom and has had a special satellite receiving system developed for customer sites. Reuters, the UK-based international news and financial information agency, offers a rival system called UK Equity Focus.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 7 KYODO -- Japan will convey to China  and South Korea soon what Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is  thinking about Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remark on  Japan's World War II campaign, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  said Friday [6 May]. Kakizawa told Japanese reporters traveling  with him that he has instructed Japan's embassies in Beijing and  Seoul to inform the countries of Hata's thinking. Kakizawa said  that the justice minister has taken back his remark that the  1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication and that he thinks it  wrong to define the war as a war of aggression by Japan.    Asked whether Nagano should leave the post of justice  minister, Kakizawa said it is up to the prime minister to  decide. Kakizawa also said he will convey his own idea to Hata  after returning home Sunday.    Hata, at a news conference in Brussels on Friday, said he  regrets Nagano's remarks but skirted the issue of whether he  will seek Nagano's resignation. Hata said that he has  reprimanded Nagano over the telephone for his remarks, which he  characterized as "not appropriate." Hata, however, said, "I  don't want to talk about (Nagano's) resignation at this stage."    In an interview with the mass-circulation daily MAINICHI  SHIMBUN published Wednesday, Nagano, a former chief of staff of  the Ground Self-Defense Force, said "the Nanjing incident was a  fabrication," and "I still think it wrong to define the war as a  war of aggression (by Japan)." He called a news conference  Friday and retracted the remarks.    Following the invasion of the then Chinese capital of  Nanjing  in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more  than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates.  Japanese historians, however, tend to cite lower estimates.  According to estimates given at the war crimes tribunal in  Tokyo, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more  than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the  vicinity over the next six weeks.</p>

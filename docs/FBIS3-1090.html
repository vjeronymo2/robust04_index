Abdoulaye Wade and Landing Savane were interrogated in Dakar  yesterday in connection with the 16 February riots that led to  the death of eight persons including six policemen. Nothing  filtered out of the hearing conducted by three examining  magistrates as lawyers took refuge behind the confidentiality of  judicial inquiry.    Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party [PDS] and  Landing Savane, secretary general of the African Party for  Democracy and Socialism were marched back to their prison cells  after the hearing. They were charged with breach of internal  state security. Four other accused persons, Boka Kane, PDS  deputy and Pap Malik Sy, second in command of the banned Dayira  Moustarchidine Wal Moustarchidate Muslim youth organization were  also heard and kept in detention.    The Senegalese Government believes Wade and Landing Savane's  responsibility is clearly established. This was stated by  Abdoulaye Elimane Kane, Senegal's communication minister and  government spokesman, who is currently visiting Paris where our  Paris correspondent, Mohamed Issoufou Saliou, met him.    [Begin Kane recording] Since the docket is already before  court, the public prosecutor will have the task of proving their  responsibility and the defense counselors will have to prove the  contrary if they can. However, the Senegalese Government is  convinced today that the incidents occurred during a protest  march that was indeed unauthorized and that they resulted in  frightful killings, material damage, and demonstrated a clear  intention to endanger the Republican institutions. There is no  doubt about this viewpoint because one can verify from all  newspapers published after the incidents, including private  independent newspapers, that it was the organizers who gave the  order for the protest march to begin, and it is quite clear that  they did not take any measures to forestall the consequences of  the protest march. The rest is purely technical. I tell you  that the state attorney general upholds the view that they were  effectively caught in the act. [end recording]</p>

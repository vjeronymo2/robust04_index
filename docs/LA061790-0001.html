			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: CASSEL'S COMEBACK WOULD MAKE A CERTAIN STRAIT-LACED COP HAPPY  </P> <P> He was nominated for an Oscar -- best supporting actor for "Faces" -- in 1968.  He made a bigger splash in '71, starring as a free-spirited parking attendant  in "Minnie and Moskowitz" (both films directed by the late John Cassavetes).  But by the late '70s, Seymour Cassel admits, he had a "compulsive" taste for  alcohol and drugs and "got carried away with the wrong people."  </P> <P> He wound up doing jail time in 1982 for a conviction of conspiracy to sell  cocaine -- after doing a "favor" for a friend, he says -- and "came out real  angry and real bitter."  </P> <P> But in 1985, he went through recovery, got sober -- and started to work again.  After "Eye of the Tiger" for Scotti Bros., he appeared in "Tin Men" for Disney,  which proved a turning point, as more roles followed.  </P> <P> This year, he culminated his comeback with two more Disney films: "White Fang,"  which he just finished shooting, third-billed behind Klaus Maria Brandauer and  Ethan Hawke, and the just-released "Dick Tracy," in which he portrays the  detective's loyal sidekick, Sam Catchem. He's signed for a "Tracy" sequel, is  discussing other films with Disney, and has a TV movie in negotiation, he says.  </P> <P> "It is a comeback for me, and I hope it doesn't stop," Cassel says. "This  business is so forgiving. They'll forgive anything if you have talent and  straighten out and want to work."  </P> <P> At the end of July, he takes his one-man show, "Bukowski at Midnight," to  France. Cassel wrote the piece, using excerpts from the work of hard-living  cult writer Charles Bukowski.  </P> <P> As for "Dick Tracy," Cassel adds, "We all read the Tracy comics as kids. I  never thought I'd grow up to play Sam Catchem. And with Al Pacino, Jimmy Caan,  Estelle Parsons, Warren Beatty (all in the cast) -- it's like getting to work  with everybody you ever wanted to.  </P> <P> "God kept me alive for something. Now I just want to work." John M. Wilson  </P></p>

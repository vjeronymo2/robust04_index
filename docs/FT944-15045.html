			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: Officials put a brave face on redundancy Stiff upper lips were in evidence at the Treasury yesterday as officials reacted philosophically to news of swingeing job cuts. An official whose job is in the firing line said: 'One has got to be intellectually honest about this. There are one or two details about the proposals which I disagree with, but the overall goal of cutting down on management layers in the civil service is something hard to argue against.' Such stoicism was the order of the day throughout the department, with officials mindful that the medicine they were being forced to swallow was precisely the stuff they had dosed out to other government departments for a decade in the cause of greater public sector efficiency. Another high-ranking civil servant said: 'A lot of people can see the logic behind the moves, even if the costs in human terms are uncomfortable.' There was some concern, however, that the proposals might jeopardise the tradition at the Treasury that promising young officials can expect a series of promotions to the higher echelons of the department over an unbroken civil service career. A long-standing Treasury official said: 'Anyone in the bottom layers and who saw themselves as having a job for life is bound to be disappointed. But I suppose this is exactly what's happened to tens of thousands of others outside the department.' Another concern is officials in their forties and fifties, just below the top layer in the Treasury and so not well enough connected to land senior jobs in private industry, yet too old to take on jobs for youthful high-fliers that might be on offer in the City. But as officials digested the implications of the proposals there was even time for some grudging admiration for Mr Jeremy Heywood, the young Treasury official who masterminded the review. 'He's razor sharp, an absolutely brilliant individual who could get a job virtually anywhere,' said one Treasury man whose own future at the department is in doubt.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'MISS SAIGON' PRODUCER STILL NOT SATISFIED  </P> <P> The producer of the hit London musical "Miss Saigon" said today that he would  take a $600,000 loss rather than bring the show to Broadway amid controversy  over his casting of a white man to play a Eurasian pimp.  </P> <P> But Cameron Mackintosh left the door open for a rapprochement that could bring  the show -- and its $25 million in advance ticket sales -- to Broadway in  April.  </P> <P> The show initially was supposed to begin previews a month earlier.  </P> <P> "I cannot in good conscience reschedule the production in the absence of a  positive working environment and an understanding . . . that artistic freedom  of choice cannot be compromised," Mackintosh said in a three-page statement  released in New York.  </P> <P> Mackintosh, however, said that he was willing to work out differences with  Actors' Equity and that he had sent the union a letter outlining the problems  he felt must be overcome for a U.S. production.  </P> <P> Equity's approval of Jonathan Pryce to play the role of the Eurasian was  insufficient evidence that the union had a change of heart, Mackintosh said.  </P> <P> "Their decision was made solely on the technical basis of Mr. Pryce's  acknowledged star status. As I have repeatedly stated, it is also essential  that the profoundly unpleasant atmosphere currently surrounding the production  be dispelled," Mackintosh said.  </P> <P> Equity Executive Secretary Alan Eisenberg was in a meeting this afternoon and  unavailable to comment on the statement.  </P> <P> Mackintosh had canceled the $10-million production on Aug. 8 after Actors'  Equity, which has veto power over a foreign actor's appearance in the United  States, voted against letting Pryce bring his award-winning role to Broadway.  </P></p>

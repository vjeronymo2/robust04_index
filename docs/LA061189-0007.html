			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTERIORS: A MODERN ADOBE;  </P> <P> A PURE, SIMPLE APPROACH WEDS PUEBLO STYLE TO L.A.'S MODERNIST MOVEMENT  </P> <P> THE DELICATELY CRAFTED, modestly styled house that architect Lorcan O'Herlihy  recently designed in Malibu for his parents, actor Dan O'Herlihy and his wife  Elsie, is on a slight plateau above Trancas Canyon. The 3,200-square-foot house  -- with its low profile; simple lines; small, sunken windows; thick, adobe-like  walls, and roof hidden behind parapets -- is an engaging blend of traditional  pueblo and expressive modernist design principles.  </P> <P> "I just didn't think any design should, or could, compete with the site and the  views, so I kept everything simple, almost minimalist," says the architect,  who, after graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, served as an apprentice to  such design luminaries as Kevin Roche and I. M. Pei, working with the latter on  his famed addition to the Louvre in Paris. O'Herlihy recently opened an office  in Venice in partnership with Richard Warner.  </P> <P> The low profile of the Malibu house is accented by the minimalist proportions  of the 13-inch-thick, stucco-clad walls; the simple detailing of the square,  wood-framed windows, and the spacing of the square, exterior lighting fixtures.  Helping also to set the pueblo/modernist tone is the entry from the parking  area. It leads past a similarly styled garage on an axis along a gently rising  Saltillo tile walkway beneath a plain wooden pergola. On it, a bougainvillea  arbor grows.  </P> <P> An oversize wooden door opens onto a warm, welcoming interior. Mexican tile  accents the outer walk and continues into the house. You enter to a generously  proportioned, 35x24-foot living room with a dramatic, 13-foot-high beamed  ceiling. One wall is dominated by a large, graceful fireplace and another by a  10-foot-square window that frames a stunning view of the ocean and sky.  </P> <P> "With such a view, the house becomes a sort of backdrop," says the senior  O'Herlihy, most recently seen in John Huston's "The Dead" and whose long,  distinguished career includes an Academy Award nomination. "That is the way it  should be."  </P></p>

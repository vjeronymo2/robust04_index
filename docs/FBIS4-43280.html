			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 14 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin on Tuesday [14 June] said that the extension of the  mandate for the multinational force is in Turkey's advantage,  adding in case they are moved out the terrorist PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan] organization will have a wider freedom of  movement in the region.    He was speaking at the parliamentarian general council  meeting where the issue concerning its extension for another six  months as of June 30 is being discussed.    He said it is not a force that has been set up against  Turkey's will, reminding it was set up initially upon Turkey's  request in 1991, in conformity with Article 192 of the Turkish  Constitution.    `The terrorist PKK organization is the one who is the most  against the force. Because if it is dismantled they will have  an extraordinary freedom of movement in a troubled region. If  it is lifted Turkey will also lose its support for the fight  against terrorism in the southeast,' he said.    He said the problems in that region do not stem from the  force but from the embargo imposed on northern Iraq.    `Even if the force goes, as long as the embargo is on,  problems will continue,' he said adding that Iraq's territorial  integrity is of a great importance to Turkey.</p>

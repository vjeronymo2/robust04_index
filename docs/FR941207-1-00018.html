			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The designation of critical habitat will not, in itself, lead to recovery, but, through regulations under section 7 of the Act, may assist the Service and all Federal agencies in contributing toward the species' conservation. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities by identifying areas that contain essential habitat features (primary constituent elements), regardless of whether they are currently occupied by the listed species, thus alerting the public and land-managing agencies to the importance of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical habitat also identifies areas that may require special management considerations or protection, and provides additional protection to areas where significant threats to the species have been identified. Critical habitat receives protection from destruction or adverse modification through required consultation under section 7 of the Act with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by a Federal agency. Section 7 also requires conferences on Federal actions that are likely to result in the adverse modification or destruction of proposed critical habitat. Aside from the added protection provided under section 7, the Act does not provide other forms of protection to lands designated as critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan for a listed species. Designation does not establish numerical population goals, prescribe specific management actions (inside or outside of critical habitat), nor does it have a direct effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management recommendations for critical habitat are most appropriately addressed in recovery plans, management plans, and through section 7 consultation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the conservation of a species. Areas not currently containing all of the essential features, but with the capability to do so in the future, may also be essential for the long-term recovery of the species, particularly in certain portions of its range, and may be designated as critical habitat. However, not all areas containing the features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to a species' survival. Areas not included within critical habitat boundaries that contain one or more of the primary constituent elements are still important to a species' conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act, and other conservation laws and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The steps used to determine proposed critical habitat are summarized in the following sections on Primary Constituent Elements, and Criteria for Identifying Candidate Critical Habitat Units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Primary Constituent Elements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining which areas to propose as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological attributes that are essential to a species' conservation and which may require special management considerations or protection (section 3(5)(A)(i), of the Act). Such physical and biological attributes are described in 50 CFR 424.12. They include, but are not limited to, the following:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Food, water, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cover or shelter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sites for breeding, reproduction, or rearing of offspring; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of a species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl are those areas that include, but are not limited to, the habitat components which provide or which have the potential to provide for nesting, roosting, foraging, or dispersal. Forested habitats used for nesting and roosting are typically characterized as supporting mature stand attributes including high canopy closure, multi-canopied structure, coniferous vegetation (sometimes including a hardwood understory), large diameter trees, high densities of live trees, snags and large logs. Canyon habitats for nesting and roosting are generally sparsely vegetated, steep-walled areas, often containing rock outcrops and crevices. Nesting and roosting habitat also supports owl foraging activity; however, a wider array of habitat attributes may be found in areas used solely for foraging and/or dispersal, including fairly open and non-contiguous forest, small openings, woodlands, and rocky slopes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Areas of proposed critical habitat include both ``suitable'' and ``unsuitable'' forest habitat. Several definitions of ``suitable'' are currently used by different land-managing agencies; however, the term ``suitable'' generally refers to habitat that supports the combined activities of nesting, roosting, and foraging. In the Southwest, ``suitable'' habitat is often interpersed with ``unsuitable'' habitat that may be important for foraging. This critical habitat proposal is not limited to habitat that meets ``suitable'' definitions, but includes habitat with any of the primary constituent elements described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria for Identifying Candidate Critical Habitat Units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary objective in proposing critical habitat is to identify existing and potential Mexican spotted owl habitat considered essential for the conservation of the species, and in need of special management considerations or protection. The Service has focused on available nesting and roosting habitat to identify locales that provide a nucleus for delineation of critical habitat units. Additional habitat was added as needed to develop units based on the criteria described below. In its proposal of critical habitat, the Service has considered all habitat types needed by the species through its definition of the primary constituent elements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using aerial photography, Mexican spotted owl habitat and forest type maps, and field verification, the Service identified areas to be considered for designation as critical habitat. Because habitat maps available to the Service were generally based on the varying definitions of ``suitable habitat'' used by the agencies, the major focus was on habitat that provides nesting, roosting, and some foraging attributes. To assist in these determinations, the Service relied upon the following principles developed by the Interagency Scientific Committee (Thomas  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990) for the northern spotted owl, and by others working in the field of conservation biology: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> _Develop and maintain large contiguous blocks of habitat to support multiple reproducing pairs of owls;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Minimize fragmentation and edge effect to improve habitat quality;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Minimize distance to facilitate dispersal among blocks of breeding habitat; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'EMPTY NEST' PRICES  </P> <P> I am writing to applaud the price cuts made by Urban West Communities at their  Creekside II development in Moorpark "Sitting on Empty Nests" by David W. Myers  (Jan. 21).  </P> <P> I can understand that earlier buyers may be unhappy to see prices reduced, but  I would hazard a guess that many of these "First 22" would have been gloating  over the "Last 32" if Urban West had made "unexpected and drastic" price  increases instead (Letters, Feb. 4).  </P> <P> This was the practice last year, when greed and profiteering was rampant among  sellers, and buyers were being caught up in the frenzy, fueled by anticipation  of overnight riches. Now it appears that the bottom of the pyramid is being  squeezed, and prospective buyers are demanding quality homes at truly  affordable prices.  </P> <P> It is clear that costs to build a new home (or sell an existing one) did not  skyrocket as rapidly as prices did over the last few years, so where did all  that extra money go? Buyers should think about this and strive to get lower  prices instead of simply relying on the "creative financing" games popular with  banks and real estate brokers that only serve to keep prices (and quick  profits) sky high.  </P> <P> L.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "The Prague Probe"] </F>   [Text] It has now been revealed that Gyula Horn [chairman  of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] is looking into the  MSZP's strategy on neighborhood policy in terms of conciliation,  the essence of which is that to restore confidence, the  inviolability of borders and the necessity to respect national  minority rights should both be included in future basic  agreements. In fact, Horn is testing more than this when he  tells a Prague newspaper that if the MSZP is given the  opportunity to implement its foreign policy program, then it  will strive to have basic agreements signed with these contents  as soon as possible.    At the moment, there is no point to guessing whether the  MSZP  will get this opportunity. However, according to our  information, it is almost certain that the MSZP's strategy is  obvious for the enlightened section of the Hungarian party  spectrum. Therefore it is likely that if a coalition with this  kind of enlightened majority comes to power next year, their  foreign policy will be dominated by a neighborhood strategy  similar to that of the MSZP's. Therefore, the results of the  Prague investigation could even assume national importance.    It appears to be particularly ingenious that Horn detailed  the concept, which he published in Hungary about three weeks ago  (and which received virtually no response here), in a Prague  newspaper. Although the Czech Republic is not one of our  neighbors, as a result of 70 years of shared history it is quite  attuned to Hungarian sensitivity to Slovak foreign policy, while  this "message from Budapest" may appear more credible if it  comes to Bratislava through a Prague detour rather than in  "direct transmission."    It will be interesting to find out how [Slovak Prime  Minister] Meciar (or Romanian President Iliescu, or perhaps  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic) reacts to this offer of  Horn's, which speaks about mutual offers rather than bargaining.  He did not say "if you give me the border issue, then I will  give you the national minority rights" -- it was something  completely different.    This something different is the lesson of European history  --  also being intended for domestic use. It shows that the  problems of national minorities cannot be solved through  reattaching territories. It also shows that only guaranteeing  the borders, rather than changing them, can bring peace, however  badly and unjustly they were established in the first place and,  for this reason, the borders must to be made permeable and open.  It shows that the members of a national minority must be free  to meet their relatives over the border whenever they want and,  on their return, books and newspapers in their language must not  be confiscated by customs officers. It shows that these  minorities must be allowed schools and choirs in their home  country, and, living in one unit, they should be able to elect  their leaders, have the same freedom as other citizens to start  businesses, and, something that is not a reality but only a wish  even in Western Europe: Owing to their predetermined  disadvantage, they should enjoy a few more rights on certain  issues than the others (positive discrimination).    Bosnia and the disease tormenting Yugoslavia are examples of  the opposite. Does anyone yearn for these? Before anyone tries  to use the trump card of the "sold minorities" in the election  campaign, he should consider this. [sentence as published] If  he can.</p>

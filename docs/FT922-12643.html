			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Overseas sales help Coca-Cola improve SOFT drink sales outside the US continued to fuel earnings growth at Coca-Cola, the leading US carbonated beverage company that yesterday reported a 19.4 per cent rise in its first-quarter net profit, to Dollars 383.1m. The earnings improvement - slower than the 21.8 per cent increase achieved during the last quarter of 1991 - translates into earnings per share of 58 cents, against 48 cents in the first quarter of 1991. Revenues for the first quarter grew by 11.7 per cent, to Dollars 2.77bn, while operating profits were 17.3 per cent higher at Dollars 579.4m. Coca-Cola's slowest growth region in terms of unit case sales is in the US, where such sales were only 2 per cent ahead in the first quarter of 1992. By contrast, international unit case sales to retail customers improved by 7 per cent. Sales in the European Community rose 6 per cent, including a 12 per cent gain in France, 10 per cent in the Benelux region and 5 per cent in Germany. Unit sales growth in the UK were sluggish at less than 3 per cent. In the Far East, sales were 5 per cent higher, with a 12 per cent rise in Japan, the largest market in the Pacific region. Mr Robert Goizueta, chairman of Coca-Cola, said the strong volume and profit performance in the first quarter 'bodes well for the rest of 1992'. Wall Street appeared to agree with Mr Goizueta's prognosis and marked Coca-Cola's share price Dollars  3/4 higher yesterday, to Dollars 82 3/4.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, June 17 (TANJUG) -- The chief Croatian  negotiator for the postponed talks between the Republic of Serb  Krajina and Croatia, Hrvoje Sarinic, has outlined a number of  issues standing in the way of the talks in addition to the  dispute over press accreditation.    Sarinic said he was not satisfied with items the Serbs had  included in the agenda of the talks. He also objected to  Krajina's insistence on lifting United Nations Resolution 820, a  move he said would make Krajina completely independent.    Sarinic said the Serb side was interested in discussing  partial issues, such as the restoration of water supplies, while  Croatia wanted to negotiate not only economic, but also  political issues. He said the problem of Krajina-Croatia  telephone connections was politically important, reiterating  Croatia's demand that telephone numbers in Krajina bear the same  area code as Croatia.    The Croatian reaction to the cancellation of talks between  the Krajina and Croatia indicates that Croatia's demands for  increasing the press quota for Croatian reporters was merely a  tactic to avoid holding the talks at all.    The talks scheduled to take place in Plitvice were cancelled  when Krajina permitted Croatia to bring only the same number of  reporters to the talks as the Serb side had been allowed at the  Zagreb talks in March. The Krajina Serbs were allowed to bring  two reporters to the earlier talks.    Responding to a Serb request that Croatia pay up on the  outstanding pensions due to Serb retirees now living in Krajina,  Sarinic rejected Serb estimates of 57,000 such retirees, saying  the total was only 34,000. Sarinic also said Croatia would only  pay the smaller number of pensioners in the new Croatian kuna  currency unit. The kuna was first introduced as Croatia's  currency in the fascist independent state of Croatia, a  Nazi-sponsored puppet state that existed only during World War  II. The Croatian Government reintroduced the kuna last month.    The Republic of Serb Krajina was established in 1991 on Serb  ancestral lands in Croatia after Croatia seceded from the former  Yugoslav federation. Krajina was placed under United Nations  protection in 1992 and has since suffered three military  offensives from Croatia. International conference on former  Yugoslavia representatives Kai Eide and Geerd Ahrens have  pledged their assistance in trying to resume the stalled  Krajina-Croatia talks.</p>

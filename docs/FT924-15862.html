			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Harshad Mehta, determined to clear his name Mr Harshad Mehta, the former Big Bull of the Bombay stock market, looks a shadow of his old self, writes Stefan Wagstyll in Bombay. After three months of interrogation, he has lost a stone in weight, his once chubby cheeks have sunk, and dark patches have appeared beneath his eyes. But Mr Mehta has lost none of the confidence which won him many admirers and not a few enemies. In an interview yesterday with the Financial Times, he pledged to clear his name of allegations of fraud, to repay all his debts and to go back to business in Dalal Street, the home of the Bombay Stock Exchange. 'They are trying to make me a scapegoat, but I played only a small part in a big market,' he says. 'The truth will come out.' Mr Mehta was released from arrest last week after a gruelling 111 days in custody where he was questioned about allegations that he defrauded banks trading in the securities markets. Now he must spend seven hours a day at the criminal board of investigation, which is probing the scandal. Outside his luxury flat overlooking the sea sit six armed policemen. 'The government is guarding me,' says Mr Mehta with a smile. 'They think I'm a valuable commodity.' His life has been brought to a standstill since the affair erupted in April  -even the half-completed renovation of his flat. His records have been seized, his assets frozen, including a fleet of 29 cars, among them his favourite Toyota Lexus saloon. Mr Mehta once loved to be photographed in front of it. Now it stands forlornly in the garage where he is not allowed to touch it. It is all a far cry from last year when 39-year-old Mr Mehta rode to fame and fortune by aggressively promoting an unprecedented surge in the stock market. His biggest killing was made in buying 5 per cent of Associated Cement Corporation and helping to push the price from Rs350 in early 1991 to a peak of Rs11,500. 'I showed people that, by accepting a little risk, you could make 80-300 per cent instead of 12 per cent on a bank deposit.' Mr Mehta was then the poor boy made rich, a quick-thinking trader who had dealt in diamond and hosiery before turning to financial services in the late 1970s. He secured his Bombay Stock Exchange seat in 1984. Seven years later he was the best-known broker in India. As Mr Ashwin Mehta, his brother and partner, says: 'Harshad is a man in a hurry.' Even now, Mr Mehta has many fans. When he emerged from custody last week, he was mobbed outside the courthouse. However, Mr Mehta knows it will take more than popularity to get him out of trouble - he declines to discuss the details of the affair, saying that it might compromise his defence. Nevertheless, he angrily denounces the banks for their role in the scandal, including Citibank, the US bank which until the affair broke was the biggest trader in the inter-bank securities market. Citibank has denied that its activities broke the law, though this week it admitted to a parliamentary committee that it infringed some central bank guidelines. But even in his present predicament, Mr Mehta is also able to talk about the affair dispassionately. The origin of the scandal, he says, lies in the fact that 'financial reforms are overdue in this country, as both the capital and money markets are over-regulated and governed by policies which market players cannot observe.' Inevitably, the Big Bull is bullish about India, arguing that 'India is an economic miracle.' Equally inevitably, Mr Mehta wants to play a part in that miracle and talks confidently about linking with foreign brokers to channel funds into India. The optimism seems absurd in the context of a daily visit to the prosecutor's office. But Mr Mehta insists that he will be back. 'I've been down before. Once I had to pledge my wife's jewellery.'</p>

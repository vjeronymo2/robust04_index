			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Fimbra proposal to widen supervisory role THE troubled Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association has thrown its hat in the ring as a potential supervisory body of the 'multi-tied' financial advisers. Such advisers are expected to emerge after the Securities and Investment Board's review of the way packaged investment products are sold to the public. Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, which supervises independent financial advisers, said he would consider the creation of a new category of 'multi-tied' financial advisers if they were regulated by his organisation and did not threaten the future viability of the independent sector. 'Multi-tied' advisers would sell several companies' products, standing between independent advisers (who advise on all products on the market) and tied agents (who sell only one company's products). Recommendations on how banks should account for loans were proposed in a draft statement put forward by the British Bankers Association yesterday. The Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice (SORP) addresses issues such as the valuation of advances, treatment of provisions, recognition of interest and fees, and disclosure of concentrations of exposure. It proposes, for example, that banks should list their exposure to countries with financial problems.</p>

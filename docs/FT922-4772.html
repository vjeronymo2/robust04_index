			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Beregovoy secure despite close vote THE MORALE of France's conservative opposition parties has been boosted following a censure motion debate in the National Assembly on Monday night in which the government avoided defeat by the narrowest of margins. With 286 votes out of a possible total of 576, the opposition motion only fell three short of the absolute majority required to bring the government down and force early elections. This is the closest the government has come to defeat in parliament since the general election in 1988. Although enough to give Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy a serious fright, and temporarily unite the warring opposition conservative parties, it is not likely to make a fundamental difference to the balance of forces between government and opposition. The main reason for this is that the vote is not expected to provide any lasting remedy to the splits which have undermined the effectiveness of conservative opposition parties. On the contrary, the splits are certain to reappear this week, as the Senate embarks on a three-day debate on the revision of the French constitution, as a preamble to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty of European Union. Monday's censure motion in the National Assembly, which denounced the government for having agreed in Brussels to a far-reaching reform of the Community's agricultural policy, provided an opportunity for the conservatives to put on a united front, after their recent division and disagreement in the first phase of the Maastricht debate. What really put the government's position at risk was a last-minute decision of the 25-strong Communist group to vote for the censure motion. In the past, the Communists have refused to join forces with the conservatives, except for one occasion in 1990. Monday's vote is a clear warning that the socialists can no longer count on them. Monday's show of unity has only temporarily enhanced the conservative parties' credibility. The leaders of the Gaullist party know that these squabbles are deeply damaging to their image. At the end of the day, they will be forced to endorse the Maastricht Treaty, because an anti-European posture is not a viable option for a mainstream French political leader. And yet they are apparently unable to lay down a firm party line or assert party discipline.</p>

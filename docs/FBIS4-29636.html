			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter and his entourage today paid a visit to the  Mangyongdae School Children's Palace.    Accompanying the guests were Vice-premier and Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam and Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong  and vice-chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], League of  Socialist Working Youth of Korea Ham Un-kon.    School children warmly welcomed the guests with applause.    The guests saw round the indoor swimming pool, the accordion  room and the embroidery room, hearing an explanation about the  construction of the palace as a wonderful extramural educational  base for school children.    At the embroidery room Jimmy Carter and Madame expressed  adoration at the wisdom and talent of school children, while  seeing the extramural activities with keen interest.    Embroidery room members presented a fancywork to the guests  as a souvenir. Jimmy Carter saw the both-sided embroidery  "Cimjongilia" and said he would keep it as an heirloom.    Then the guests appreciated a performance of the art circle  members at the palace theatre.    At the end of the performance Carter said no children in any  other country can match the Korean children and that this is the  first time he saw such an admirable performance of children  although he had toured many countries in the world.    Before leaving the palace, he said he would surely convey  the  friendly feelings of the Korean children to the American  children.    Jimmy Carter and his entourage today visited the Mansudae  Art  Studio, combined art creation base, and the Pyongyang metro.    Earlier, on the 16th, they visited Pyongyang department  store  No. 1 and the Ognyu Restaurant and made a round of Pyongyang  streets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Referring to yesterday's statement by Turkish  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman, who rushed to condemn  our country for the incident at the Albanian guard post,  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the Turkish  side is trying to create tension or is exporting domestic  problems. This Turkish interest in Greek-Albanian relations  should be noted because it could be useful in the interpretation  of various problems or events, the spokesman said.    Today, on the pretext of the latest developments in Albania,  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] also appeared  provocative. Skopje attacked the Greek Government and described  our country as a source of problems in the Balkans. Greece was  also accused of seeking clashes between the Albanians of Skopje  and Skopjeans.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERU DEVALUES CURRENCY IN BID TO BOOST EXPORTS  </P> <P> The government on Saturday devalued Peru's currency by 16.6% in an effort to  boost exports and reduce deficit spending.  </P> <P> Officials have blamed inflation -- which reached a record 1,722% last year --  for Peru's fiscal and trade deficits.  </P> <P> The devaluation, announced in the official El Peruano newspaper, pushed the  official exchange rate to 1,440 inti to $1, up from 1,200 to $1.  </P> <P> The government uses the exchange rate to pay exporters and to finance imports  of vital drugs and food staples. The floating free market rate, which  registered 1,550 intis to the $1 on Saturday, is used for nearly all other  transactions.  </P> <P> The Economy Ministry said Saturday that March consumer prices rose 42% over  prices in February.  </P> <P> Officials expect inflation to continue in the short term because of price  increases but eventually decline as the economy stabilizes.  </P> <P> Earlier last week, the government increased by an average of 20% the prices of  gasoline and subsidized foods such as wheat, cooking oil and rice.  </P> <P> By devaluing the inti, the government hopes to spur exports and reduce a  growing trade deficit.  </P></p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph issue at discount THE FIRST day of trading for The Telegraph new issue was dogged by several factors, not least of which was the market view that the shares were priced too high. The shares opened 289p, a sharp discount to the issue price of 325p, and slid further throughout the day to close at 283p; the final discount of 42 to the offer price indicated the market's cautious view of the issue. Only 3m shares traded of 26m now in issue. Analysts argued that at 325p the P/E multiple was too high and the yield too low but SG Warburg believed that at the 290p level the shares were attractive. Initial trading was further hampered by the overhang of stock left with the underwriters. Private investors subscribed for only 3m of the 13m offered. Finally, the gloomy state of the stock market, the stream of bad publicity relating to the Maxwell media empire and the failure of a number of new issues recently, all had their impact. Mr Guy Lamming from agency broker James Capel commented: 'Its a shame that such a good asset has got off to such a bad start.' Dixons fall Full-year results from Dixons were in line with expectations, but the high street group's bleak trading statement added to the gloom over the retail sector. While the market was fairly positive about the group's overall trading performance, the poor trading climate at the present time created a general consensus that Dixons faces a tough 12 months, with margins under continued pressure. Analysts chopped forecasts for the next year accordingly, shaving an average 15 per cent off down to a range of Pounds 80m-87m. Yesterday, the shares tumbled 9 to 214p. County NatWest said: 'At this price, we are in no hurry to buy. Dixons will get cheaper.' Elsewhere, Marks &amp; Spencer lost 8 to 311p, Kingfisher 4 to 466p, Boots 13 to 428p and Argos 4 at 229p. RTZ nervous The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, fell 25 to 583p following reportedly cautious comments by its chief executive Mr Derek Birkin, who was said to have told a meeting in Tokyo that copper prices are unsustainably high. The shares were also hit by a weaker dollar. RTZ profits are highly sensitive to US currency moves and the dollar has lost about 14 per cent against sterling since mid-March. Analysts said the group loses Pounds 50m from net income profits for every 5 per cent fall in the dollar against a basket of currencies, all other things being equal. Takeover rumours continued to sustain TSB which managed a minor gain of 2 at 139p although turnover was a minimal 1m shares. Merchant banks with market trading operations were again under pressure as turnover continued at extremely low levels. SG Warburg closed a further 23 down at 460p and Kleinwort Benson dropped 5 more to 254p. Union Discount, still reeling from the warning that the group will record losses of up to Pounds 15m for the half-year period, relinquished 8 more to 53p. The latest slide in share prices and their damaging effect on the composite insurance sectors' solvency margins, led to more weakness in the composite sector viewed by many strategists as a prime area for dividend cuts. The sector was also damaged by fears that the mortgage indemnity crisis will deepen. General Accident fell 12 to 438p, Royal 7 to 200p, after a low of 198p and Sun Alliance retreated 8 to 268p. The electricity distribution stocks suffered profit-taking after a better than expected outcome from the Offer review. The Electricity Package dropped 43 to Pounds 3,305, while the worst performers among individual stocks included Yorkshire, 10 lower at 373p, and Seeboard, 8 easier at 332p. Midlands fell 7 1/2 to 332p. General unease took its toll on the water sector where smaller more thinly traded stocks were the poorest performers, with Northumbrian giving up 9 at 478p. Reports of sharply declining oil consumption triggered a bout of nervous selling throughout the oil sector. Hints that some of the leading London broking houses may well be preparing downgrades across the board reversed the recent rally in BP shares which settled 3 off at 211p on good turnover of 6.1m shares. Shell dipped 3 to 495p on 3.4m. British Gas retreated 4 to 251 1/2 p on 6.7m shares. Vague takeover speculation saw Calor edge up 5 to 184p. Enterprise Oil retreated 6 to 394p, unsettled by falling oil prices, but Lasmo were especially weak and settled 10 down at 162p, a fall of some 6 per cent, in relatively heavy trading. P&amp;O eased 6 to 418p, after a couple of brokers downgraded profit expectations. BZW reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 35m to Pounds 275m citing continued weakness in the UK economy. Kleinwort Benson was also cut its estimate. Container group Tiphook continued to recover from Monday's big falls that followed the release of lower than expected profits. The shares gained 18 to 365p, as dealers said a large line of stock that had overshadowed the market in the shares had been absorbed. Reports that British Airways and USAir were in negotiations about a transatlantic airline partnership helped the shares of the former harden a penny to 268p. Among motors, GKN were in demand, the shares firming 7 to 380p. Financial worries have continued at BM Group and the shares fell another 17 to 103p, in response. 'A dead cat bounce' is how the day's trading in British Aerospace was described by one dealer. The shares jumped 11 to 242p, in modest trade of 1.3m shares. A Profits downgrading from Smith New Court left BTR lighter 12 at 450p. A dull day in leisure stocks was enlivened by a bounce in Rank Organisation, with the market growing in confidence that the group would report satisfactory results today. The share, up 11 at one stage, retreated to close a net 3 ahead at 631p. A big agency deal in Queens Moat Houses saw 4m cross at 68p. The shares dipped a penny to 70p in overall turnover of 9.2m. Fellow hotel group Forte slipped 4 to 169p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (11).

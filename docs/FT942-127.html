			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Blue chip off the old block Angstrem is among the most successful companies in Russia. It epitomises, in almost textbook form, what privatisation is supposed to do - although it owes its progress to more than privatisation alone, writes John Lloyd. Founded in the 1960s, Angstrem was a leader in the Soviet Union's belated efforts to catch up with the US in micro-technology for space and defence programmes. It was the leading centre in the 'silicon valley' town of Zelenograd, 25 miles from Moscow, with more than 6,000 scientists and researchers working in the fabrication plant and an associated institute. Two years ago, it became clear to Valery Dshkhunyan, the director, that its days as a protected state enterprise were numbered. Before privatisation got under way, he began seeking new markets - in an exercise of initiative rare for a Soviet-era director. Moreover, he was prepared to shift production from the most sophisticated technologies used in space and defence programmes to those better suited to the consumer market. The stereotypical military plant director, on the other hand, is a man scornful of making useful tools when he could be making useless advanced weapons. Dshkhunyan acknowledges that 'certainly, we have had to move down to a second level of quality'; but he adds that, 'once we secure niche markets there and get new technology, we can move back up'. He has also reduced the number of staff by about one-third to a little over 4,000. In part, this reflects a fall in output. But it has also resulted because 'some people wanted to use their skills to found small businesses of their own, and others could not adapt to the new circumstances'. Here again, Dshkhunyan's outlook is atypical: most directors from the old Soviet era have retained staff, even if many are doing little or no work. His plant is one of the last to go through the first stage of the privatisation process; the voucher auctions end today. Though his fellow managers and the workforce will end up owning about 50 per cent of the company, he worries that an outside investor will snap up a big stake and attempt to gain control of the company. 'Many who are now investing want very quick returns, and that would be bad for this kind of company,' he says. It is a very tempting morsel. Its nominal value at privatisation is no more than Dollars 8m - even though it now exports half its production to hard currency markets, mainly in South East Asia, and is completing a Dollars 70m investment in a new facility with the latest available technology. It is a dramatic example of the undervaluation of Russian assets which the privatisation process has forced on many companies - although in the case of many other companies, almost any valuation is too high. Mr Dshkhunyan needs, above all, a foreign partner - and, with the aid of Credit Suisse First Boston, he is readying himself for one. He needs a joint venture in high-quality semiconductors and if he is to be able to put up the funds to complete the new plant. Moreover, he must have one if he is to open up new markets and extend the already impressive expertise he himself has built up in marketing. And he needs constant access to world-class technology so that the company remains a top Russian producer of microelectronic products and gadgetry. He seems a little sad at the passing of the old era but he does not mourn it. 'We realise that a foreign partner would have little interest in an association with a state company, and so we must privatise,' he says. Despite the sacrifices and a certain feeling of loss, Mr Dshkhunyan is taking the long view, and getting on with it.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUDGET PLAN HAS GOOD NEWS FOR CAMPUSES, BAD FOR POOR  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed 1990 state budget would earmark more than $17  million for Cal State San Marcos to prepare California's newest university for  its first class of 250 full-time students this fall, but it contains bad news  for San Diego County's poor.  </P> <P> The proposed $54.1-billion budget, unveiled Wednesday by Deukmejian and his  last before he leaves office, also allocates millions of dollars for other  higher-education and park concerns in the county, including increased  maintenance and lifeguards for beaches at Carlsbad and San Onofre.  </P> <P> But the spending plan packs ominous signs for county drivers: Unless voters  throughout the state agree to a 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase this  summer, construction on $785 million worth of San Diego road projects will be  delayed or scuttled.  </P> <P> Projects jeopardized in the transportation plan include the widening of  Interstate 5 from Del Mar Heights Road to Interstate 805 and the first phase of  extending I-15 south from Mission Valley along 40th Street, according to a list  compiled by the state Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> "In effect, what it will do is delay everything, and we can only guess as to  how long at this point," said Jim Larson, spokesman for the Caltrans district  office in San Diego.  </P> <P> However, the budget would allocate $17 million for track improvements on the  Los Angeles-to-San Diego Amtrak line.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another kind of traffic -- drug traffic across the international  border -- may suffer as well under the proposed spending plan. Deukmejian  announced Tuesday night that the California National Guard will receive $10  million in federal grants to help local law enforcement agencies apprehend drug  runners in San Diego, the Imperial Valley and other entry points.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's budget includes a $5-million loan for the proposed San Diego  Olympic Sports Training Facility in the South Bay, a loan that is supposed to  be repaid through sale of special license plates.  </P> <P> At the same time, the plan contains bad news for San Diego County's poor.  Deukmejian has proposed deep cuts in social programs that would require  families on welfare to forgo millions of dollars in expected benefit increases.  </P> <P> The total impact of Deukmejian's budget on San Diego County residents will not  be known for weeks, maybe months, as legislative analysts and lawmakers roll up  their sleeves to plow through the hundreds of pages of the plan. Legislators  have until June to debate the proposal and hand it back to the governor with  their suggested cuts or increases.  </P> <P> But, at first blush, San Diego County officials say, the plan does not hold  good news for the area poor and mentally ill. Estimates show that, although  Deukmejian has increased the social service budget, welfare and health programs  would need $1 billion more to maintain their current level of service.  </P> <P> "Recognizing that this is our preliminary view, it suggests that we will be  looking at some reductions in service delivery and some health and welfare  programs as a result of these proposed cuts," said John Sweeten, the county's  director of intergovernmental affairs.  </P> <P> For instance, Deukmejian intends to freeze welfare benefits at current levels,  Sweeten said. That translates into $18 million less for San Diego welfare  recipients than if the governor had allowed the cost-of-living increase to go  through.  </P> <P> In the area of mental health, San Diego County's budget, already meager by  state standards, would suffer even more. Deukmejian's budget would probably  mean $1.5 million less for the area's mentally ill.  </P> <P> Not all is woe, however. Sweeten said the governor intends to increase some  allowances to pay medical care for the poor -- a move that would give the  county a one-time, $4-million windfall in 1990.  </P> <P> And, in terms of brick and mortar, San Diego has some clear winners in the  Deukmejian budget, which sets aside nearly $100 million in buildings for area  colleges and universities.  </P> <P> The plan allows for $8.3 million to operate Cal State San Marcos, the North  County campus that was added to the extensive California State University  system last year. Those funds -- enough to pay the salaries of 121  administrators, professors and other college employees -- will suffice for the  infant campus to admit its first 250 full-time students in the fall, according  to the budget.  </P> <P> Besides the money to operate Cal State San Marcos, Deukmejian made room for $9  million in capital improvements, including $4.57 million for its initial  buildings and $2 million to acquire books for its library.  </P> <P> At UC San Diego, Deukmejian wants to spend $59.1 million -- the biggest chunk  for any single campus. The amount includes $42 million for a  111,000-square-foot science building, $6.5 million for an addition to the  central library and nearly $1.2 million to help improve access for the  handicapped.  </P> <P> Area parks, from the beaches to the desert, would be bolstered under the plan.  The governor wants to add lifeguards and maintenance employees to patrol newly  expanded areas of the Carlsbad and San Onofre state beaches, while continuing  the state's program to buy up nearly 4,500 acres near Ocotillo Wells for  off-road vehicle enthusiasts.  </P> <P> Although dune buggy riders were cheered by the Deukmejian budget, more  traditional motorists received glum news. Unless voters approve the gasoline  tax increase, there will be a $533 deficit in the transportation projects.  </P> <P> And that means the state will put several key projects on hold. Some of those  are in the Sorrento Valley, where Caltrans wants to widen I-5 south of Del Mar  and do more construction on the interchange of I-5 and California 56.  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: RVI first-half losses rise to FFr437m RENAULT Vehicules Industriels (RVI), the struggling French state-controlled truck maker, yesterday announced far worse than expected losses, in spite of a reduced deficit at Mack, its US subsidiary. Pre-tax losses at RVI rose to FFr437m (Dollars 90.85m) in the first six months of the year. This was nearly three and a half times the FFr128m loss it made in the first half of 1991, before a FFr156m extraordinary contribution from its acquisition of the outstanding majority stake in Mack, for which RVI paid less than it had provided for. RVI is unlikely to make an overall profit this year, after the small FFr23m net surplus it reported in 1991, warned Mr Marc Randon, group secretary-general. He attributed the setback to a decline in European sales, down 13 per cent against the first half of last year and 32 per cent below the levels achieved in the first six months of 1990. Those figures exclude Germany, where three quarters of the market is controlled by the national truck industry. RVI group sales fell by 3.4 per cent to FFr13.36bn from the FFr13.83bn reported in the first half of 1991, on which operating losses rose to FFr301m from FFr106m. Over the same period, restructuring costs climbed to FFr136m from FFr22m, because of the 1,000 French job losses announced last April. RVI warned that more cost cuts would be needed, although it planned to hold the research and development budget at current levels and to invest in enlarging its sales networks, especially in northern Europe. RVI's European branch saw a plunge in operating profits to FFr151m from FFr484m, while Mack reduced its operating losses to FFr83m from FFr102m. The US truck market was showing signs of recovery, but intense price competition was affecting the profits of all producers there. Mr Randon said the objective was to return the US subsidiary to break-even by 1994. RVI is 55 per cent owned by Renault, with the remaining 45 per cent held by AB Volvo, parent company of the Swedish automotive group.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Progressive Socialist Party on 28 </F> February]    [Text] The PSP [Progressive Socialist Party] denounces the  criminal bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq  Mikha'il, condemns the perpetrators, offers its heartfelt  condolences to the victims' families, and wishes a quick  recovery for the wounded. It wishes to put the following points  on record:    First, the crime comes in the context of a scheme seeking to  undermine the process of security and national accord which has  made great progress with Syrian assistance. It aims to involve  the country in a new cycle of violence, keep the Lebanese arena  open to those who wish to exploit it in order to pressure and  weaken Lebanon, throw Syria's role in Lebanon into confusion,  and undermine the two countries' relationship. The crime comes  in the wake of the bombing of the Phalangist Party headquarters  in al-Sayfi and several other similar operations. A number of  suspects were arrested after these operations, which proves that  the same groups are responsible for all these crimes.  Consequently, we ask the state: What point has the  investigation into the al-Sayfi bombing reached? Would it not  have been possible to halt all these assaults on Lebanon and  these new crimes against the Lebanese people if the Lebanese  security departments had succeeded in apprehending the al-Sayfi  culprits? What point has the interrogation of the pro-Israeli  ring reached? Some of this ring's leaders were uncovered,  arrested, and accused of planning assassinations of Lebanese  officials and the bombing of various places.    We demand increased focus on these investigations and urge  that all information that thus comes to light be made public.  We all urge that the severest penalties, up to execution, be  inflicted on the suspects. We call for measures to extradite  Ghassan Tuma, the most prominent fugitive suspect linked to the  aforementioned operations.    Second, the PSP warned earlier of the consequences of having  several diverse official security agencies that have no  coordination whatsoever with each other. Indeed, some of their  actions undermine the efforts seeking to maintain security,  prevent infiltrations, or uncover criminals, particularly the  perpetrators of crimes against the state's security. We  reemphasize our call to reexamine this affair. We urge that  this be done from the perspective of supreme national interest.  If it is unavoidable to have all these separate agencies, at  least let them be placed under a unified command and let matters  follow their proper course.    Third, it is clear that a single political-security  operations room is making plans, implementing them, and trying  to exploit the results. In the context of sectarian sedition  and to cause greater rifts among the Lebanese people, some  forces are now raising their heads and pretending to be  concerned about the Christians' welfare and future. These  forces already stand convicted of formerly involving the  Christians in strife, causing their displacement from their  homes, and forcing them to make suicidal choices that have cost  them and cost Lebanon dearly. They now exploit any political or  security incident to pressure, intimidate, and incite them,  heighten their frustration, and then call for self-isolation and  demand special guarantees. They try to do this just when all  the Lebanese people are unanimous in their opinion that such  crimes are directed against them all and against Lebanon's  national unity and future.    Hence, efforts must be made to isolate and excise this  pro-Israeli tendency from Lebanon's national body and prevent it  from achieving its aims.    Fourth, in such circumstances, just as in our daily life,  the  media play a vital role. Some of them are part of the  above-mentioned operations room and are consequently incapable  of exercising the necessary self-censorship and halting the  dangerous sectarian incitements so evident in their news and  other programs. We urge the state to act promptly and pass a law  organizing the audiovisual media. This law will lay down  restrictions and prevent the use of media for such a purpose or  other purposes that threaten national unity and national and  social morality.</p>

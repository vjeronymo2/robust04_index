			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Evgeni Gavrilov: "Cabinet Sets New Record in </F> Governing"]    [Text] On 30 December Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and his  ministers festively marked the first anniversary of their tenure  at the head of the executive. This is noteworthy because no  other government since 10 November 1989 could match this  achievement.    Foe a whole year the government based itself on a "dynamic  parliamentary majority." Indeed, this was the government's  foundation. In the final analysis the cabinet's longevity was a  result of Lyuben Berov's ability to balance interests, which at  first glance seem to be contradictory. This is because the  interests of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], the Movement  for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], and the Union of Democratic  Forces [SDS] are rather different. This resulted in certain  incomplete decisions that disturbed rather than furthered reform.    The cabinet, which survived four no-confidence votes, had  succeeded in strengthening its positions only by the end of the  year. It was then that its two major successes came -- the deal  with the bank-creditors on remitting 50 percent of Bulgaria's  foreign debt, and signing a provisional trade agreement with the  European Union. Other governments also contributed to those  successes, but it was Berov's government that reaped the rewards.    However, the successes were preceded by the three great  failures of Berov's team -- privatization, land reform, and the  budget. In his program speech, precisely one year ago, the  prime minister announced that his team would be the government  of privatization. The lack of privatization deals was replaced  by actions that in the past belonged to the category of  organized enterprises. In January the government adopted a  decision to prepare a long-range privatization program by the  end of May. The program has still not been carried out. In  February a group of experts led by Emil Khursev, deputy chairman  of the Bulgarian National Bank, submitted a proposal to the  Council of Ministers on the participation of the banks in  privatization. At a special meeting in March the government  adopted a number of decisions related to accelerating  privatization, but they remained only on paper. In May there was  an inadequately considered proposal by Berov on accelerating  mass privatization through promissory notes. Deputy Prime  Minister Valentin Karabashev did not like the proposal. Two  months later he proposed a draft mass privatization program  through investment funds. This time Berov disagreed with the  proposal. Finally, in August the Berov-Karabashev hybrid  proposal was accepted. Prior to this it had been rejected by  everyone, but, nevertheless, it was adopted without any debate  at a government meeting.    In November the professor told REUTER that he was  contemplating the establishment of a ministry of privatization.  In December the government admitted that the greatest  privatization deal -- the one with the "Balkan" Air Company --  had fallen through. Throughout this entire period the  government four times dismissed the members of the Privatization  Agency Supervisory Board, appointed on a quota of the government  basis, but the Supreme Court restored their membership.    The words of the minister of agriculture that in 1993 land  will be returned to its owners still hang in the air.</p>

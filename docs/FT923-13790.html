			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Molins settles six-year US patent infringement suit MOLINS, the tobacco machinery maker, said yesterday that it had agreed a settlement in a six-year US patent infringement suit, the roots of which lie with the company's pioneering work on flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) in the 1960s. Molins has agreed terms with Cincinnati Milacron, one of the biggest US machine tool makers and one of the principal defendants in a lawsuit based on the exploitation of a system fundamental to factory automation  - the centrally-controlled linkage of different machine tools. Although terms were not disclosed, Molins said it considered the outcome of its negotiations with Milacron to be satisfactory, justifying 'the confidence which it has consistently expressed in the strength of its legal position.' Molins' royalties fight has been overshadowed in the past four years by five attempts from hostile shareholders to win control. Last night, the company said the deal would not have a major impact on its profits, but did involve an unspecified payment. The settlement with Milacron comes a few weeks after the death of Dr 'Theo' Williamson, who pioneered the development of numerically-controlled machine tools while working with Ferranti, before joining Molins in 1961. At Molins he developed System 24, which was launched in 1967 and linked tasks previously carried out by separate machine tools. In the early 1970s, however, Molins pulled out of research and development of System 24, and let all its FMS lapse except those covering the US. Since 1986, Molins has been trying to enforce its FMS patents in the US courts. Litigation is continuing with other defendants, principally Kearney &amp; Trecker, the US machine tool company now owned by Giddings &amp; Lewis, and a number of German machine tool suppliers. In 1991, Molins had a trading profit of Pounds 300,000, on sales of Pounds 3.3m, in its 'other activities' - license income, the net cost of its research centre, and several small business ventures. It is actively pursuing its licensing programme, and last year granted licences to two non-US users of FMS Equipment, Mercedes-Benz and Fanuc, for the import into the US of FMS-made goods. The German and Japanese companies joined FMS users such as Ford, Caterpillar and General Motors, and machine tool makers Litton Industries and Mandelli, in negotiating licences with Molins.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cost of executive share options should be assessed on issue Sir, Andrew Jack's article on US efforts to regulate executive compensation provides a resounding wake-up call for UK companies. Based on the US experience, unanswered calls for the self-regulation of executive pay invites far more onerous steps by regulators; for example, poor disclosure practices led the Securities and Exchange Commission to require quoted companies to present extensive data for the highest-paid executives. Meanwhile, a perceived lack of connection between executive pay and performance prompted the Clinton administration to eliminate the tax deductibility of 'non-performance based' pay in excess of Dollars 1m for top executives of quoted companies. Finally, a history of inadequate share scheme disclosure contributed to the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's current efforts to impose an earnings charge for executive share options. In the UK steps by the Accounting Standards Board and statements by the Association of British Insurers/National Association of Pension Funds are mild by comparison. Self-regulation through the voluntary enhancement of pay disclosure represents an attractive way to diffuse growing regulatory pressures. Subjecting pay practices to 'the light of day' does wonders to limit abuse. In addition, we have found that shareholders react favourably to the disclosure of well-designed, performance-based executive pay schemes. Finally, an earnings charge for share options is a bad idea. Share prices already incorporate expectations concerning executive share option awards. David Rhoads, managing director, Strategic Compensation Associates, 19-25 Argyll Street, London W1V 1AA</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET'S HAVE A YEAR-LONG MORATORIUM ON POLITICS -- TO REDISCOVER AND PLAN FOR  CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian and the Legislature are to be commended for putting  together a budget that more fairly meets the needs of Californians. And it is  especially commendable that they successfully negotiated a financial scheme for  education and transportation in the process.  </P> <P> The pathetic reality, however, is that this took a miracle, or what Speaker  Willie Brown called "an awesome legislative achievement." California is a  magnificent ship adrift. What our elected leadership lacks is vision, the  ability to see what things will be like 10 years from now and plan, as  historian James MacGregor Burns puts it, beyond one's own ambition.  </P> <P> A way to generate such vision would be for the people of California to call for  a moratorium on politics over the next year. Like the Year of Jubilee  proclaimed in the 25th chapter of the Book of Leviticus, no bills would be  introduced or passed during the next legislative session, except for those that  formulate the budget. And the budget would be developed and adopted only after  eight months of study, debate and planning.  </P> <P> That long-range planning process would commence on September 16 when the  current legislative session ends and extend until June 30, 1990. Campaigns for  state political offices would not be allowed to begin until July 1, 1990.  </P> <P> All Californians would be invited to participate in the debate about the  shaping of our future. Legislators and the governor would go out into the local  communities and listen to the people.  </P> <P> With all due respect to the many conscientious legislators of both parties and  in both houses, what goes on in Sacramento year after year is absolutely  insane. Since January, 4,599 pieces of legislation have been introduced,  hundreds of them restructured with countless amendments. That's ridiculous! No  legislator can keep track of the bills, let alone understand them and how they  all fit together. This is essential for the responsible development of public  policy.  </P> <P> What is worse is that their overriding concern and preoccupation is not  principled law-making, but getting elected the next time around. This is  commercialized politics marketed for an increasingly disconnected electorate of  consumers.  </P> <P> The newly framed abortion question could provide a marvelous opportunity to  reconnect the electorate and involve them in the vigorous public debate that is  the stuff of democracy. But, because of the commercialization of politics and  the lack of vision, what the campaigns of 1990 promise is a thoughtless and  fruitless exchange of loud and angry slogans, playing for the polarized crowds.  </P> <P> That's the way things will go, unless and until we the people start taking  responsibility for our future and stop leaving politics to the politicians. We  must re-enfranchise ourselves in the knowledge and skills necessary for  effective citizenship.  </P> <P> And we can change. It's already happening in a number of communities throughout  the state. In 1988, for example, it was not the politicians but people  organized at the grass-roots in the inner city of Los Angeles who brought about  an increase in the minimum wage for California workers. Similar church-based  community organizations are working from a shared vision of what they want  their cities to be like to solve the drug problem as it menaces their  neighborhoods in Oakland, San Jose, Anaheim, Santa Ana and San Diego.  </P> <P> We need to revitalize the traditional seedbeds of civic virtue: families,  churches, neighborhoods and local communities. There we need to talk to one  another about what is important to us and how we want to live together as  communities of mutual support. What are the truths we hold to be self-evident?  How do we realize them and live by them in our public life?  </P> <P> With this as a start, we can begin to come to grips with the issues that remain  unaddressed in most political campaigns, from environmental degradation and  urban decay to the feminization of poverty.  </P> <P> Hunger, homelessness and the lack of access to basic health care are the most  blatant symptoms of a system that is not working. There is no reason that the  system cannot be made to work. But that will never happen unless we reject the  short-term, piecemeal, quick fix finagling and manipulation of a fragmented  system that has masqueraded for enlightened government for too many years.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most important thing to be hoped for from a moratorium on politics  as usual is that during that time someone will come up with an idea for how we  can do away with the commercialized politics in which wealth and technical  expertise determine public policy.  </P> <P> A global consensus is emerging that, as we stand on the brink of the 21st  Century, we face an unprecedented time of reckoning, a singular moment of  opportunity. But without radical change and recovery of civic virtue, we will  stagnate in the vicious circle of visionless, self-serving and ultimately  self-destructive commercialized politics.  </P></p>

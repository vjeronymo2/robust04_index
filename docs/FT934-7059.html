			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Part-time jobs are boost for women Part-time work has helped women increase their contribution to household income in the past two decades, says a report published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Men are still responsible for 'the lion's share' of money coming into the household, Mr Steven Webb, the report's author has found. In 1991, the average income received directly by men was about Pounds 200 a week compared with Pounds 100 a week for women. However, the figures reflect 'a major growth in equality', Mr Webb argues. Two decades earlier women received directly only one pound in four coming into households. But where more than two thirds of men's income comes from wages or self-employment, women on average receive only just over half of their income from earnings and nearly a quarter from social security. The study says that the growth in women's employment has come mainly among married women with children. Employment rates among the growing numbers of lone parents have 'fallen back sharply' over the last 20 years, and they now receive around half their income from social security. According to the study, the likely future growth in the availability of part-time jobs should help increase women's share of household income further. It says: 'There is every likelihood that the gap will close still further in coming years.' Mr Webb argues that more than a third of married women with children are currently outside the labour market and would be prime candidates for part-time jobs. However, he acknowledges that growing responsibilities for caring for elderly relatives and the limited availability of affordable child-care may restrict married women's ability to take such jobs.

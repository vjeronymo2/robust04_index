			<p>BFN     [Text] U Myint Maung, the son of U Maung Htin of 11th  Street, Einme, Irrawaddy Division, and the officer in charge of  agriculture, forests, and environmental protection in Dr. Sein  Win's exile group, entered Kawthaung, Myanmar [Burma] from  Thailand on 26 March and returned to the legal fold. U Khine  Saw Tun, the son of U San Tun Aung of the Lamadaw area,  Kyauktaw, Rakhine State; a member of the Central Committee of  the ALP [Arakan Liberation Party], an Arakan armed organization  in the jungle; and joint secretary of the Information Committee  of the DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] in the jungle,  returned to the legal fold in Yangon [Rangoon] on 29 March.    U Myint Maung joined the National League for Democracy in  December 1989. He took part in the election held in May 1990  and was elected as a representative of constituency-2 in Einme  Township, Irrawaddy Division. He went underground in Manerplaw  in December 1990 and was made the officer in charge of  agriculture, forests, and environmental protection in Dr. Sein  Win's exile group. He returned to the legal fold because he was  unhappy with the unfairness of the jungle groups and the  one-sided decisions made by their leaders.    U Khine Saw Tun went underground in 1988 and served as a  reserve Central Committee member of the ALP, an Arakan armed  organization, and a central committee member of the National  United Front of Arakan, NUFA. He also served as joint secretary  of the Information Committee of the Democratic Alliance of  Burma, DAB, and was in charge of the central office. He  traveled to Germany in 1991; Bangladesh and Germany in 1992; and  Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, England, Switzerland, and  France in 1993. On these trips he attended constitutional  meetings and other political meetings. It has been learned from  responsible personnel that he returned to the legal fold because  he became discouraged during his visits to many foreign  countries by the attitudes and unrealistic dreams of the groups  that are opposed to Myanmar and refuse to review and understand  the truth and ongoing changes taking place in Myanmar.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISHAP THAT PULLED PASSENGERS FROM JET BLAMED ON CARGO DOOR  </P> <P> An accident that pulled nine United Airlines passengers out of a Boeing jumbo  jet over the Pacific Ocean resulted from failures by the airline, manufacturer  and FAA to correct problems in cargo doors on 747 airliners, federal  investigators said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board voted 3 to 0 to accept the results of  a more than 13-month investigation despite the fact a key piece of evidence in  the Feb. 24, 1989, incident remains three miles under water: Flight 811's cargo  door.  </P> <P> The NTSB said United failed to properly inspect the door after its electrical  system failed in December, 1988, and mechanics had to operate it manually. The  door had been operated electrically since then, however.  </P> <P> Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration were cited for failing to order  timely corrective measures after another cargo door partially popped open on a  1987 Pan American jet flying from London to New York. That plane returned  safely to London.  </P> <P> On Flight 811, the door ripped off at 22,000 feet. A piece of the fuselage was  ripped off and the passengers and their seats were sucked out through the hole  in the plane.  </P> <P> The plane, en route to New Zealand, returned to Honolulu. Five other passengers  were seriously hurt and 33 had minor injuries. The plane carried a crew of 18  and 337 passengers.  </P> <P> United spokesman Robert Dowdy said the airline had complied with all FAA  requirements except in one instance. That occurred after six words mandating an  inspection were left out of an FAA regulation when it was copied into the  company's system, he said.  </P> <P> Dowdy said that despite the oversight, the door had undergone three inspections  since the December, 1988, problem was corrected.  </P> <P> "We think the board has done a good job with the evidence and data available,"  Dowdy said, adding that a better investigation and probable cause could be  determined if the door is recovered.  </P> <P> Boeing had recommended that the board conclude that probable cause of the  incident could not be determined.  </P> <P> In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the company had no comment on the  NTSB finding "except to say we feel, No. 1, those cargo doors are safe."  </P> <P> "There were subsequent changes made as a result of the accident, changes and  inspection processes. All of the necessary actions have been taken to ensure  integrity of that door's operation in flight," Gamble said.  </P> <P> The board said the current cargo door system on 747s can indicate to the pilot  that the door is locked when it is not. That's expected to be changed with an  imminent FAA order that would require detectors on the locks, said Ron Schleed,  investigator in charge for the accident.  </P> <P> Schleed said efforts to locate and recover the cargo door from the ocean would  continue. He said a Navy vessel and sophisticated probe device would be  available in June to conduct a search that would be limited to about two weeks.  </P></p>

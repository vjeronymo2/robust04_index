			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has reacted to the  secessionist rebels' step to form a secessionist government in  Aden. He said: This secessionist act, which ignores  constitutional legitimacy, aims only to obstruct the efforts  exerted to achieve security and stability in our country in  light of UN Security Council Resolution 924.    The source added: The step taken by the secessionists, who  have rebelled against constitutional legitimacy, reminds us of  another step taken by the secessionist gang, which rebelled  against legitimacy and democracy when the three-day cease-fire  decision was issued on 21 May 1994 in response to a desire  expressed by the custodian of the two holy places, King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz of fraternal Saudi Arabia. Then, 'Ali Salim  al-Bid shocked the world by announcing the secession despite his  knowledge of the good efforts exerted by the custodian of the  two holy places in the hope that his desire, to which our  political leadership responded favorably, would be a prelude to  a permanent cessation of fighting and a solution to the disputes  through constructive dialogue.    The source added that this secessionist gang has confirmed  once again that it insists on shedding the blood of the Yemeni  people in order to impose secession through force of arms.    The source concluded by saying: The government of the  Republic of Yemen considers this illegitimate step a blatant  challenge to the UN Security Council and a flagrant violation of  Resolution 924. Despite this fact, this flagrant violation of  the UN Security Council will not deter the government of the  Republic of Yemen from dealing with that resolution in a  positive spirit and in manner that will lead to implementing it  in a comprehensive way by all those concerned.</p>

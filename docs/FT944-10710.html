			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Date for Milan futures Futures trading on Milan's new MIB-30 index should start in the week beginning November 28, Mr Enzo Berlanda, chairman of Consob, the stock market regulator said, Reuter reports from Milan. The MIB-30, based on the existing BCI-30 index of leading shares, was launched on October 17. Mr Berlanda said a full range of trading instruments would probably not be available before September 1995. He said there were also hitches in the movement of all shares to cash settlement because of liquidity problems. 'Now there are 240 (shares with cash settlement), but there are difficulties in terms of liquidity,' he said. A total of 370 shares, from 204 companies, are currently quoted on the Milan bourse.</p>

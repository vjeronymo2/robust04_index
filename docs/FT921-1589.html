			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Le Pen turns his protest vote into real influence THE ONE eye of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's extreme right-wing National Front, was yesterday glittering with satisfaction at the sight of the first extensive regional power base his party has ever had. For one of the less obvious but most important consequences of Sunday's regional elections was to give the FN real influence, in some cases the swing position, in most of the country's 22 regions. Formerly, Mr Le Pen's people, with their loud anti-immigrant xenophobia, were seen as dangerous outsiders in local politics. Now, the FN has number two position in the three largest regions and significant influence in five more, a solid country-wide base from which to make its voice heard in the run-up to next year's general election. That will be the real opportunity for the FN to make up for the main weakness in its political weaponry; the fact that it holds just one seat in the 577-seat National Assembly. Nationwide, the FN did slightly less well than expected out of what was a protest vote against the political establishment. The FN's 13.9 per cent score on Sunday was a big advance on the 9.8 per cent it got in the last regional poll in 1986, but miles behind Mr Le Pen's own claims that he would get 20 per cent. Notably, both Mr Le Pen and the wily Mr Bruno Megret, his number two and the brains behind the FN's policies, suffered personal disappointments in the key region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, the FN's main battleground. There, Mr Le Pen came second to the local conservative candidate in the Alpes-Maritimes district, and Mr Megret came third in the Bouches du Rhone, behind Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, regional council president and the millionaire Socialist supporter Mr Bernard Tapie. Yet overall, the FN came out second in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region, with 34 of the 123 regional assembly seats, more than double its previous representation. So the area's conservatives, with a relative majority of just 43, cannot ignore Mr Le Pen in daily government. The FN has even out-distanced the Socialists, to be number two behind the conservatives, in the two largest regions, the Ile de France, which embraces Paris, and Rhone-Alpes, whose regional capital is Lyons, France's second city. It now holds similar positions in Alsace and Languedoc-Roussillon and has made strong advances in Franche-Comte, Bourgogne and the Socialist stronghold of Nord-Pas-de-Calais. One reason why the FN's moderate score counts for so much is that the regional election is by proportional representation, as against the one-member constituency system that now applies to French general elections. According to Sofres, the polling organisation, the FN would win 77 parliamentary seats if it repeated its weekend performance in a proportional general election. This calculation matters because the Socialist party might agree to introduce an element of proportional voting for next year's poll, so as to help the ecologists and other respectable alternatives. Sunday's vote indicates just how much such a change would also benefit the FN.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (2): The old feuds, the old troubles - Kieran Cooke looks for changes in the country's foreign policy OPEN THE history books. Dust off the old maps. There is trouble again in the Balkans. The priorities of Greece's foreign policy have traditionally been Turkey, Turkey again and then the US. Things are changing. Turkey is still top of the list. But now the Balkans, a l o n g with the European Community, have assumed greater importance. In recent months foreign policy debate within the EC has been dominated by the break-up of eastern Europe and the consequences of German unification. But for Greece, problems in the Balkans are of far more concern. 'Our geographical position has always meant that we have special worries about the Balkans,' says Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister. 'Now the problems in the region are acute.' There is great concern about the possible break-up of Yugoslavia. Macedonia, perched on Greece's northern borders, might become a break-away republic and try to pursue what Athens terms as irredentist claims on Greek territory. Turmoil in Yugoslavia would also have serious economic consequences. It could put in jeopardy Greece's vital road links with the rest of the EC. Mr Mitsotakis's government has worked hard to promote good relations with the new regimes in Bulgaria and Romania. But Greece has been in something of a quandary over recent events in Albania. Earlier this year Mr Mitsotakis became the first Greek premier to visit Tirana. A breakdown of Stalinist-type controls in Albania has meant a partial opening of frontiers. Greece has suddenly found itself the rather reluctant host to thousands of members of the Greek minority in southern Albania. Having talked for years about the plight of this group in what is known in Athens as North Epirus, the government cannot very well turn the refugees back: Mr Mitsotakis has instead pleaded with them to stay in Albania and await political changes. But, as ever, Turkey remains at the centre of Greek foreign policy. 'The problems between Greece and Turkey are still in the same old rancid state,' says Mr Thanos Veremis of the Hellenic Foundation for Defence and Foreign Policy. 'After Mr Papandreou (the former Greek premier) and Mr Ozal (the then Turkish Prime Minister, now president) met in Davos in 1988 there was talk of a rapprochement between the two sides, but nothing has come of it,' Mr Veremis adds. Greek a r g u m e n t s with Turkey focus on two issues. One is the continuing Turkish presence in northern Cyprus, dating from the 1974 invasion. The other concerns various territorial claims - on the delineation of the Aegean continental shelf, the extent of territorial waters and flight controls in Aegean air space. While the arguments might appear somewhat stale, they still have the potential to erupt into open conflict. As recently as 1987, Greece and Turkey were brought to the brink of war over rival oil exploration claims. Suggestions that Greece has lessened its resolve in any way on the Cyprus question are firmly dismissed by Mr Mitsotakis. He draws parallels between recent events in the Gulf and the Cyprus question. 'I feel now that conditions are better than ever for a settlement. The world reacted strongly to the occupation of Kuwait. There is a foreign occupation in Cyprus. The Security Council resolutions on the issue m u s t be i m p l e m e n t e d,' says Mr Mitsotakis. This view is unlikely to be echoed in Ankara. There are fears in Greece that Turkish attitudes are hardening. The theory is that Turkish self-confidence has been bolstered by its role as a vital support base for the allied forces during the Gulf conflict. Mr Antonis Samaras, the Greek foreign minister, has lobbied energetically in western capitals to try to ensure that Greek interests are not forgotten. At the same time, Mr Samaras has sought to reinforce relations with many governments in the Middle East. Greek officials admit that foreign policy, with the exception of attitudes to Turkey, has lacked consistency. Mr Papandreou sought to weave a complex set of relationships with the third world, with the countries of the Middle East and with some of the now disgraced governments of eastern Europe. During his term of office, there was much anti-US talk but behind the scenes Athens remained close to Washington. In the middle of last year Mr Mitsotakis became the first Greek premier to make an official visit to the US in 27 years. He describes relations now as 'excellent'. A new agreement on US bases in Greece has been signed. Out of the four bases one has already been closed through Pentagon cost-cutting measures, while another is due to stop operating later this year. But there are still some political difficulties between Athens and Washington. Greece was angry about a State Department directive issued during the Gulf war advising US nationals not to visit Athens. More broadly, Greece is concerned that a Washington which is now more well- disposed towards Turkey might try to upset the seven-to-10 ratio in military aid given to Greece and Turkey. However, this ratio is more myth than fact - for some time more US aid has been flowing to Turkey. American officials in Athens say it is clear that the EC is now seen as 'big brother' in Athens, rather than the US. Greece is among the most ardent integrationists in the EC. It wants a common defence network and to become a full member of the Western European Union (WEU). Some officials in Athens say Turkey has been actively lobbying against the latter move. Greece has been heartened by what it s e e s as increased EC interest in the Cyprus question. Luxembourg, the present holder of the EC presidency, has proposed some form of initiative on the issue: however, some EC members clearly do not want the Community to be dragged into what is seen as an argument between Greece and Turkey. Last month Greece again used its veto within the Community to block Ecu600m worth of EC aid to Turkey. The aid had been linked to progress on the Cyprus issue. Greece said that if Turkey were to receive the funds, it would be seen as 'a reward for Turkish intransigence.' Again, some EC members were unhappy at this development. Greece recognises that its interests are best served within the EC. But it is also beginning to realise that there are limits to EC patience when it comes to old and seemingly intractable arguments between Athens and Ankara.</p>

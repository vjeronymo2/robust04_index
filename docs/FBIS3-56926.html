			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed BELINFORM report: "Stanislav Shuskevich: `No </F> One But Us Will Put Things in Order"]    [Text] On the evening of 17 January, Belarusian Television  broadcast a one-hour-long live call-in program with Supreme  Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich who answered many  questions of the viewers.    People were interested in various aspects of our aggravating  and difficult life. It is understandable that on the eve of the  Supreme Soviet session, which is to resume its work on 18  January, viewers wanted to hear Stanislav Stanislavavich's  opinion on current matters. He called the situation in Belarus  difficult and conflicting, and stated that it should be  fundamentally changed. This task is beyond the current Supreme  Soviet's powers, so he supports the idea of early elections.    It should be noted that sometimes the questions were posed  point-blank. For example, Minsk resident Valyeriy Kharkow  wanted to know whether it is not time for the Supreme Soviet  chairman to resign of his own will. "If I had seen any  advantage to my resignation, or if someone else had secured the  holding of new elections, I would have resigned long ago,"  underlined S. Shushkevich. "Instead, I am doing everything in  my power to propel the process of reelecting our parliament by  preparing the necessary legal basis."    A viewer from Orsha, having stated that during the last year  prices in the Republic increased 28 times, asked why the  parliament does not replace Prime Minister Kebich who drove the  economy into a dead end, with Karpyenka who is a supporter of  market economy. To this S. Shushkevich answered: "The issue is  not only in the government. Just look at your neighbor states  of the former USSR. The situation there is no better. I think  that we must look for people with market ideas and place them in  the Cabinet of Ministers. This way we can activate the levers of  the market economy."    Of course, the viewer did not forget to ask Stanislav  Stanislavavich about his opinion on the unification of  currencies with Russia, as well as about the consequences of  this serious step for Belarus. The Supreme Soviet chairman  stated that if unification brings a parity of prices for energy  resources then the economic situation will begin to improve.  Yet nobody but we alone can put things in order in our home.    Of course, it was impossible to answer all the viewer's  questions during a one-hour cast. Besides, many questions  required special references to be answered. Therefore, it was  resolved that all the questions that were phoned in during the  cast, should be handed to the parliamentary speaker who will  answer them in full detail.</p>

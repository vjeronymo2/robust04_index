			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Holmes recovery hits setback with tumble to Dollars 133,000 Correction (published 25th August 1993) appended to this article. HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security group quoted in the UK, suffered a setback to its recovery in the six months to June 30, when pre-tax profits fell from Dollars 1.47m to Dollars 133,000 (Pounds 89,000). Mr Richard Hickson, chief executive since Mr Eric Kohn resigned in May, said the reorganisation of the group had involved the 'clean-up of both its balance sheet and its operations'. The former - it had been necessary to clear the Dollars 73m of debt built up in the acquisitive 1980s and had resulted in the note-holding banks now controlling 53 per cent of Holmes' equity - had been achieved, he said, though it had taken longer than anticipated. This in turn delayed the progress of the latter, which is now only two thirds complete. Mr Hickson said that both he and Mr Kohn had been cautious not to repeat Holmes' old mistakes. Therefore there had been a delay in the intended programme of acquisition of subscriber monitoring contracts. The rate of subscriber cancellations had fallen 79 per cent year-on-year in the first half, and was the lowest since 1986. Group turnover slipped to Dollars 27m (Dollars 28.3m), of which monitoring and service of alarm systems contributed Dollars 20.6m (Dollars 21.5m). Net operating costs rose to Dollars 13.6m (Dollars 12.4m). Mr Hickson said that Holmes had been spending 'general and administration' money on its European strategy, with little to show for it. While Holmes Protection in the UK was still operating, activities on the Continent have now been delayed. Interest costs rose to Dollars 262,000 (Dollars 195,000) as debt rose to Dollars 5m (Dollars 1.5m) at the period-end. Holmes was forced to borrow from its bank when in March it had to cancel a share placing, after an investor, thought to be Faisal Finance (Switzerland), failed to honour its agreement to pay for 1m shares. Legal proceedings continue in Switzerland. Earnings were 0.1 cents (3.3 cents) per share. CORRECTION The investor who failed to honour an agreement to buy 1m shares in a Holmes Protection placing was not Faisal Finance (Switzerland) as suggested in yesterday's edition. Holmes and Faisal, a Holmes shareholder, said yesterday that their relationship was harmonious. We apologise for the error.</p>

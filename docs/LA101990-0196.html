			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOUGLAS GIVEN LIFE ACHIEVEMENT AWARD  </P> <P> Kirk Douglas was named the 1991 recipient of the American Film Institute's Life  Achievement Award today, which, coincidentally, is the 30th anniversary of the  Los Angeles premiere of "Spartacus" -- one of Douglas' most memorable roles.  </P> <P> Douglas, 74, was informed of his selection by film institute trustee Steven  Spielberg, who called him in the south of France where he is shooting Xavier  Castano's "Welcome to Veraz" co-starring Gerard Depardieu.  </P> <P> "This award is special because it was voted by my peers and recognizes a whole  body of work," the actor told The Times. "It's a nice pat on the back, and if  you've read my autobiography, you know that that's always been very important  to me."  </P> <P> With his clipped delivery and famed cleft chin, Douglas has been one of  Hollywood's more enduring leading men, snagging three best actor Oscar  nominations ("Champion," "The Bad and the Beautiful" and "Lust for Life") in  his more than 60 feature film performances.  </P> <P> Last seen on the screen in 1986's "Tough Guys", Douglas recently shifted his  focus to writing. His autobiography, "The Ragman's Son," was published in 1988,  and his first novel published in 1990, "Dance With the Devil," will be adapted  for the screen.  </P> <P> He will be honored March 7 at the Beverly Hilton.  </P></p>

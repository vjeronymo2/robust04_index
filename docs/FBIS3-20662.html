Now it must "break with convention" and reform its power  industry, said Power Industry Minister Shi Dazhen, in PEOPLE'S  DAILY (December 19). Excerpts follow:    When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the  mainland had an installed electricity capacity of only 1.86  million kilowatts, and it could generate just 4.3 billion  kilowatt hours a year.    By the end of this year, China's installed capacity is  expected to have passed 180 million kilowatts, with an annual  supply of more than 800 billion kilowatt hours. The amount of  electricity China generates in two days now is equal to the  total for the whole of 1949.    But as industries expand and people use more electricity,  the  shortage of power in most parts of the country gets worse. The  industry has developed most in areas with higher economic  growth, but these places are also the hardest hit by the power  shortage.    It is unfair to say that the State has overlooked the  problem  and achievements made in reforming the power industry's  management should never be underestimated.    But most reform measures and policies in this sector were  drawn up within the framework of the traditional planned economy  and it is inevitable they bear the stamp of the old system.  <H5>  Investment </H5>   Conventionally, enterprises in the power industry are  subsidiaries of administrative organs. They tend to be  controlled by arbitrary orders, which can mean poor investment.    The World Bank suggests developing countries invest more  than  2 percent of the gross national product (GNP) in the power  industry. But from 1980 to 1992, China put in an average of only  1.24 percent of GNP.    Energy-saving policies and measures are also inadequate and  the public lacks a strong sense of energy conservation. The huge  shortage of electricity thus co-exists with massive waste.    For a long time, the State has demanded enterprises in the  power industry hand in more than 90 percent of their revenue in  taxes and profit turnover. This leaves them little cash to keep  going and the enterprises can afford no more than 5 percent of  their revenue to invest in development.    By contrast, their foreign counterparts raise about half the  cash they invest themselves and in some countries the figure is  up to 90 percent.    Because enterprises in China's power industry are not  independent commodity producers and managers, they do not feel  the pressure of competition. Most have long had more workers  than they need.    In the old system, electricity prices were unreasonably low  which has caused unequal competition between enterprises in the  power industry and those in other sectors.    This leads to waste which affects fundraising and the  introduction of foreign investment.    China's power industry is, however, trying to keep pace with  and even overtake the growth of the national economy.    From 1995 to 1997, the government plans to increase the  generating capacity of large and medium-sized power stations by  more than 15 million kilowatts a year. The figure for 1998-2000  is 20 million kilowatts.    If these goals are met, China's total installed electric  capacity will hit around 310 million kilowatts by the turn of  the century. This will ease the shortage nationwide and put  electricity within the reach of every county and 95 percent of  rural households.    To fulfill the goal, the power industry must break with  conventional practices.    Modern power enterprises should be set up. They should be  free from government interference, be given decision-making  powers and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses.  Their property rights, and rights and obligations should be  clearly defined.    The package also includes efforts to drum into the public  the  need to save electricity. Enterprises in the power industry  should also be allowed to compete on an equal footing with  enterprises in other sectors.  <H5>  Shareholding </H5>   The power industry would further be helped by the  introduction of the shareholding system. This sophisticated form  of fundraising can separate managerial power from ownership and  help protect the legal rights of both investors and managers.    In the next seven years, the power industry will need $25  billion to import electricity generating units with a capacity  of 45 million kilowatts.    Besides foreign loans, foreign investment is welcome and  overseas investors are encouraged to build solely-funded or  co-funded power plants.    As investors, they can draw dividends according to their  investment. As loan lenders, they will recoup both the loan and  interest.</p>

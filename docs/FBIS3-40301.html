Bresan: "Company Travels to Position"] </F>   [Text] Trogir--It is very lively every 10 days at the  Trogir [a town near Split] railroad station. The reason is that  members of the King Tomislav 2d Trogir Company of the 114th  Brigade of the Croatian Army are leaving for positions on the  southern battlefield.    Thus, we photographed the members of the 2d Trogir Company  while they waited for the bus before their departure. They will  replace their friends and fellow fighters, also members of the  Trogir Company.</p>

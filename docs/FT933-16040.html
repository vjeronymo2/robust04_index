			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: Too much protesting Sir, Recent editorials and letters about British Gas's supply monopoly and future structure confirm an industry view that British Gas doth protest too much. The assertion by its chief executive, Mr C H Brown, that a competitive framework would lead households to face gas bill increases of 'up to 94 per cent' (Letters, June 30), is unworthy. No government would allow that threat to materialise and British Gas does itself no favours by pretending otherwise. The heart of the matter is that energy consumers deserve choice and need regulatory protection. A new gas market, probably franchise based, must eventually empower suppliers, including British Gas, to compete on price (below a regulated maximum) while meeting all obligatory standards of service British Gas so effectively provides today. Those standards include an obligation to supply gas at a tariff price to households which are connected to the mains; the British Gas notion that low-income households might one day pay more than the better-off is politically preposterous.

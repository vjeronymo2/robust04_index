			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 47 (537): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] "The parliamentary elections conducted in Kazakhstan  on March 7th were the most democratic and just, considering the  socio-economic and political conditions prevailing in the young  sovereign state," the chairman of the Central Electoral  Commission, Karatay Turysov, told Interfax. "There are no  reasons for cancelling the election results or for recognizing  them as null and void," he stressed.    According to Turysov, observers from the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), who criticized the  election system and pointed to a number of violations in the  course of voting, have not informed him of their conclusions  officially, and therefore he finds it impossible to comment on  "what he knows by hearsay."    IF Note: The conclusion that Monday's elections were  "undemocratic" was voiced at a news conference in Almaty by a  spokesperson for the CSCE bureau for democratic institutions and  human rights, Elizabeth Winship. She thinks this was largely  because political parties, movements and candidates did not have  enough time to organize the election campaign, and because the  system of registering party candidates was confused. According  to the CSCE spokesperson, during the elections some voters cast  ballots for several people; some lists of voters were in  duplicate; some ballots were substituted by commission members.  CSCE experts also noted violations on the part of officials  from the Central Electoral Commission, who revoked independent  candidates under different pretexts, and pressure exerted on  district commissions by local administration officials.  Besides, CSCE experts believe that the list of candidates  compiled by the president "ensured 20% of parliament  seats for  people from government structures from the outset".    As the Central Electoral Commission chairman said, the  so-called "presidential list" of candidates for parliamentary  elections (64 persons), which was criticized by international  observers, had been submitted in accordance with the electoral  code. It included prominent writers, scientists and economists,  "and very few representatives of government structures."    Having conceded that abuses did take place in the course of  elections -- a man cast ballots for his entire family, for  instance -- Turysov pointed out that they cannot serve as  grounds for cancelling the election results. Several  commissions have been formed to inspect concrete statements  concerning violations.    The elections were attended by 125 observers from France,  Germany, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries, Turysov  stressed. They all evaluated the elections positively.    When asked if Kazakhstan will invite CSCE observers to its  next elections, Turysov said that the CSCE is an authoritative  organization, and Almaty will undoubtedly send invitations to  its observers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] According to a report on Novi Sad Television,  weapons and military equipment have been discovered in aid sent  by the Hungarian Ecumenical Charity [Magyar Ekumenikus  Szeretetszolgalat]. The discovery was made during a customs and  control inspection in Novi Sad. Our correspondent Szilveszter  Varga, reporting from Belgrade, also gives an account of the  continuing fighting in Bosnia.    [Begin Varga recording] [passage omitted] According to a  report by Novi Sad Television yesterday, 15 Belgian-made  submachine guns, more than 1,000 uniforms of the former East  German Army, and other military equipment were found by Novi Sad  customs officers in one of the three trucks the Budapest  Ecumenical Charity sent to Kosovo. Representatives of the  Hungarian aid organization -- which also has links with the  Pravoslav Church -- stationed here have dissociated themselves  from the affair. [end recording]    MTI's Belgrade correspondent also reported, on the basis of  the Novi Sad Television account, that the aid delivery  containing the military equipment was sent by the Hungarian  Ecumenical Charity from Budapest to the Pristina-based Mother  Teresa organization and that the documentation was signed by a  Balazs Kek.    The Hungarian Ecumenical Charity resolutely denies and  describes as provocative the Novi Sad Television report, which  said that weapons and military equipment weighing 10 tons were  found in their aid delivery during customs inspection. The  charity also stresses that the delivery was made up of clothes,  medicines, and food, and was not being sent to Pristina, the  mostly Albanian-populated center of Kosovo, but to Novi Sad.    Following the regular customs inspection last Saturday [4  June] the Yugoslav customs inspectors found both the documents  and the delivery itself to have been in proper order because  after off-loading, the trucks returned to Hungary.

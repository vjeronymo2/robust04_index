			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Serb pledge to quit Gorazde zone Bosnian Serb leaders have reiterated their pledge to withdraw from a 3km exclusion zone around Gorazde, the south-eastern Moslem enclave which is a United Nations 'safe area', to try to pave the way for an overall ceasefire. Some 150 Bosnian Serb troops were due to withdraw by yesterday afternoon. The Serbs were up to 1km deep in the UN exclusion zone, set up four weeks ago under threat of further Nato air strikes. The Moslem-led Bosnian government has refused to return to the negotiating table until Serb forces comply with their pledge. But even after Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, wrote to Bosnian and Serb leaders proposing renewed truce negotiations, both sides reported fighting along key supply lines in northern and eastern Bosnia. Tanjug, the Serbian news agency, said that five people were wounded on Saturday night when Bosnian Croat forces bombarded Brcko, at the eastern end of the corridor which joins Belgrade to Serb-held land in Bosnia and Croatia. Bosnian Croat forces have fought alongside their Moslem counterparts in the northern Sava River valley since the eruption of war 25 months ago while elsewhere their alliance was restored only in March in an agreement brokered by Washington. After the agreement, Croat leaders have turned their attention to the status of Serb-held territory in Croatia. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia at the weekend warned that he would use 'all possible means' if Serb leaders of the self-styled state failed to accept Zagreb's authority within four months. Brcko, which was mostly Moslem before the war, is now held by Serb forces and is viewed as the next possible flashpoint because of its importance to all three communities. Serb forces control about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, but Moslems have advanced in the region and may try to sever the corridor. UN officials said Serb forces shelled Tuzla, the second biggest Bosnian government stronghold, shortly after the attack on Brcko. A Spanish UN soldier and his interpreter were killed yesterday when an armoured personnel carrier crashed near Mostar in southern Bosnia. Three soldiers were also injured in the accident, as the vehicle went off the road. Spain has around 1,400 troops serving with the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, mostly concentrated around Mostar.</p>

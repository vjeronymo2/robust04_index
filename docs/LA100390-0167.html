			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAW FIRM COLLAPSE BANKRUPTS ATTORNEY IN A BILLION-DOLLAR WAY  </P> <P> Steven Kray says he is bankrupt. Is he ever.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach attorney recently filed a petition for personal bankruptcy in  federal court here saying that his liabilities outstrip his assets by $2.3  billion.  </P> <P> That's billion, a 10-digit number.  </P> <P> The reason is about as clear as some court briefs.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, Kray was a partner in the Irvine office of New York-based  Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey. The law  firm was the nation's fourth-largest before it collapsed in 1988 under a huge  debt burden.  </P> <P> The failure has spawned enough lawsuits to keep an army of attorneys employed.  Malpractice suits pending seek $2.5 billion in damages. And the trustee  overseeing the Finley Kumble bankruptcy is suing 40 former law firm partners to  contribute to a fund to pay off creditors.  </P> <P> Rather than fight some of these suits, Kray figured the best way out was to  declare bankruptcy. His Chapter 7 petition lists $2.5 billion in liabilities,  presumably the total malpractice claims outstanding against Finley Kumble, and  assets of $2 million.  </P> <P> He listed no personal assets, only a potential $2-million claim against the  Finley Kumble trustee. Kray, who was making $250,000 when he left Finley Kumble  in 1987, now works in the two-attorney firm of Stephens &amp; Kray, which does  taxes, estate planning, mergers and acquisitions.  </P> <P> While Victor Preston of Irvine, Kray's attorney, said it is unlikely that Kray  could be held liable for $2.5 billion, his client would bankrupt himself  fighting the lawsuits in New York.  </P> <P> "It would cost me too much money," said Kray, estimating the legal battle could  run up a $200,000 bill in attorneys' fees and lost time at work. "The system  does work, but it's expensive for the little person."  </P></p>

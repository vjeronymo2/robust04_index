			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Clinton streamlines rules for Medicaid PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday ordered his administration to relax controls on how states manage their portions of Medicaid, the national programme that provides healthcare coverage for low income families. Mr Clinton told the National Governors' Association that he had ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to streamline its procedures for granting waivers from Medicaid rules for states which seek new ways of handling their healthcare problems. Governors from both parties have complained for years that state budgets are collapsing under the burden of Medicaid, as the federal government imposes more and more requirements on them without providing the necessary funds. Medicaid accounted for 14 per cent of states' budgets in 1990. and is expected to balloon to 25 per cent by 1995. Total Medicaid spending will amount to Dollars 189bn by that year with states picking up Dollars 81bn of the bill. Many states have tried innovative approaches to healthcare reform, but some complain that DHHS waiver procedures have slowed them unnecessarily. Some proposals, such as Oregon's plan to ration healthcare by limiting coverage to a fixed list of medical procedures which produced real improvements in health, have been rejected. The Clinton administration is committed to producing a comprehensive reform plan for the US healthcare system within 100 days, and the governors have urged him to leave as much flexibility as possible for states. The NGA has produced its own plan, endorsing the managed competition approach which is also expected to form the core of the Clinton administration's proposals. The governors also urge greater federal support for primary and preventive medicine, including an expanded programme of vaccinations for children. The New York Times reported that Mr Clinton was considering a proposal for the federal government to become the sole buyer for vaccines, which it would then distribute free, either to public clinics or to private doctors. President Clinton yesterday named Mr Kenneth Brody of Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bankers, as his choice as chairman of the Export-Import Bank.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries sharply higher on solid demand Retail demand, short-covering by dealers, a dollar rally, news of higher weekly unemployment claims and rumours of a US invasion of Haiti all combined to push US Treasury prices sharply higher across the maturity range yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 5/16 at 84-27/32, yielding 7.537 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up 5/16 at 99 15/32 , to yield 6.015 per cent. Prices firmed from the start, with traders reporting solid demand from retail accounts in the wake of a modest dollar rally. The early gains soon forced some dealers to cover their short positions. Sentiment was aided by the announcement that weekly state unemployment insurance claim rose by 19,000, a much bigger increase than forecast, and the news that retail sales rose by 0.6 per cent in June, a slightly smaller increase than expected. The data encouraged those investors who believed the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates to slow the economy down, and spurred further buying, especially later in the session. Earlier in the day, prices had risen on a rumour that the US had invaded Haiti. Political unrest and the involvement of the US military in conflict abroad usually buoys Treasuries as investors rush to buy more secure investments. Although yesterday's rumour proved false, it was enough to provide investors with another reason to buy government bonds. European government bonds rallied strongly, boosted by the strength in US Treasuries, as the more positive mood of recent days continued. However, the gains came in thin, futures-driven trade, with the French market closed, and analysts were sceptical about how long the rally will last. 'Confidence has returned with a better outlook for interest rates and inflation and some institutional investors have come back to the markets relatively cash-rich. But it also has the elements of a classic bear squeeze,' said Mr Sanjay Joshi of Daiwa Europe. German bunds rose strongly in afternoon trading, on the back of US Treasuries and supportive comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank. Although the dollar regained some ground against the D-Mark, bunds continued to benefit from the German currency's safe-haven status. Mr Tietmeyer said the decoupling of international capital markets based on interest rate developments would not be easy, 'but when the fundamentals are right and a policy of stability is clear then it is by no means ruled out'. Mr Michael Buerk of Citibank said: 'These remarks are a sign that a key German official is hopeful, if not over-optimistic, that some decoupling might take place.' UK gilts rallied in late trading in line with bunds, and after the Bank of England announced that three tranches of existing government bonds had been exhausted. Today, the Bank is expected to announce details of its next auction, which analysts expect to be of seven to 10 years. Contrary to recent market recoveries when high-yielding bonds have outperformed the core markets, Italian and Spanish bonds tracked Germany at more or less stable yield spreads while the Swedish market weakened further. 'This is a sign that the long-term divergence trend remains intact,' said Mr Kirit Shah international bond strategist at First Chicago. The yield on the Swedish nine-year benchmark bond breached the psychologically important 11 per cent level to close some 18 basis points higher at 11.05 per cent. The 10-year yield spread over Germany widened by nearly 30 basis points to 425 basis points. The market was hit by a rise in the year-on-year inflation rate, an inconclusive special meeting of the parliamentary finance committee, and a lukewarm reception for the government's latest T-bill auction. Although Sweden's month-on-month inflation rate was unchanged, the year-on-year rate rose to 2.6 per cent in June from 2.3 per cent in May. Bonds also derived little support from the finance committee meeting, called in response to the recent falls in Sweden's financial markets. Meanwhile, at its auction of three, six and 12-month bills the National Debt Office managed to sell only SKr10.54bn of the SKr12.5bn offered. Italian bonds tracked the other markets and closed more than a point higher, but failed to deliver the performance some had hoped for following Wednesday's announcement of the government's fiscal plans. The budget targets for 1994 and 1995, and plans to offset this year's deficit by L5,000bn, had been discounted in the market. 'Details were conspicuous by their absence,' said Mr Ken Wattret of Midland Global Markets. 'The rally in the Italian market will be on hold until the details of the government's three-year fiscal plan are published next week.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Radio broadcasting to Ukraine of programs by the  radio stations Mayak, Rossiya-1 and Radio Moscow was stopped  today from 15:00.    Well-informed sources from the Ukrainian Communications  Ministry suggested in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine that  this was due to Russia's debt for relaying of the radio programs.    The same sources said the debt of Russia amounted to 2.3 Bn  rubles.    The Ukrainian Radio and TV Company's Vice President, Aleksey  Karpenko, sent a telegram to Moscow today saying that the  broadcasting would not be renewed until the debt was paid.</p>

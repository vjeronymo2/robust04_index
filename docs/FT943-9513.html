			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Irish braced for broadsheet broadside: Fears are growing of an invasion by quality UK newspapers The Irish newspaper industry is once again looking apprehensively across the Irish Sea at the broadsheet price war currently taking place in the UK. It is fearful that the British tabloid invasion, which began in the 1980s and which has grabbed a 50 per cent share of the Irish tabloid market, is now about to be repeated by an invasion of upmarket UK daily and Sunday papers. A small market by UK standards (Ireland's population is 3.5m), there are nonetheless almost 6m papers sold every week in the Irish Republic, with around 1.3m selling on Sunday alone. The UK papers currently have an overall market share of around 20 per cent. According to one Irish newspaper editor, 'there are enormous economies of scale in the UK industry. They can keep the presses rolling an extra half an hour and dump the extra copies in the Irish market at virtually no extra cost. The effect can be potentially devastating'. However, Mr Liam Igoe, a newspaper industry analyst with Goodbody stockbrokers in Dublin, believes the main threat is to Ireland's quality Sunday papers rather than the broadsheet dailies, the sector in which the UK price war is currently taking place. 'The quality dailies have a strong Irish editorial content, and it will be difficult to compete with these on price alone' he said. Mr Peter Murtagh, new editor of the Sunday Tribune, and formerly deputy foreign editor of the Guardian in the UK, believes that the strong Irish focus of the quality dailies and Sunday papers will be the key factor in fighting off the competition. 'Nothing will change the fact that the imports are British newspapers editorially controlled from London. This is a different country with a different perspective and a different agenda. Irish people want to read an Irish newspaper which reflects their perspective on events. At the same time, we have to be better at what we are doing and make editorial and presentation more attractive,' he says. Neither the Times, Daily Telegraph nor the UK Independent have gained significantly in market share since the outbreak of the broadsheet price war in the UK. Their combined circulation is still well under 10,000, compared with 90,000 for the Irish Times and 143,000 for the Irish Independent. A spokesman for Independent Newspapers, which publishes the latter,said: 'We can't be complacent, but we are not too fearful of the price war spilling over into the Irish market.' Even among Ireland's tabloid papers, the Star (jointly owned by Independent Newspapers and the Express Group) has managed to increase its circulation from 85,000 to 89,000 over the past two years, maintaining its share against the Sun and the Mirror which sell a combined 110,000 in Ireland, and despite being 30 per cent more expensive. Around 80 per cent of the Star's content has an Irish focus. Advertisers have also remained largely loyal to the Irish titles. Mr Steve Shanahan, media director of QMP, a large Dublin advertising agency, said: 'There is little evidence of a switch by Irish advertisers to the UK imports.' Despite higher advertising costs in the Irish market, it is still more cost effective to reach readers through Irish titles than through the UK imports. That loyalty could shift, however, if titles such as the Sunday Times, thought to be selling more than 50,000 now, continue to make inroads into the circulation of the Irish Sundays. Most at threat are the Sunday Tribune (90,000) and the Sunday Business Post (30,000). Ms Barbara Nugent, Sunday Business Post editor who also sits on the board of the National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI), the industry's umbrella body, said: 'It is a worry. We are talking about people with much deeper pockets than ourselves and it is vital for our democracy that the Irish newspaper industry survives.' Under pressure from the NNI, the government recently established a working group to investigate the competitiveness of the Irish newspaper industry, and to suggest legislation to protect it from what many Irish editors believe are 'predatory pricing' tactics from the UK. Whether that could square with European Union legislation remains to be seen, but according to Ms Nugent, 'we are in a unique situation in Europe. No other country faces the threat we do'.</p>

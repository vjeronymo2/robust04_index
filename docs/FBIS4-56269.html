			<p>BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy responded to  expressions of support from Colorado Party members from the  interior of our country, who were in his office this morning.  The president said he would guarantee the strike scheduled for  2 May.    During an open meeting at Lopez Palace, the presidents of  the  San Pedro, Caaguazu, Misiones, and Central Colorado Party  precincts asked the president for Education Minister Nicanor  Duarte Frutos' head. Colorado Party mayors and governors were  also present.    The Colorado Party leaders, including the controversial  Emiliano Garcia, who allegedly was the leader of a mob involved  in the attack against Congress [on 7 October 1993, to protest  the approval of a bill banning military people from becoming  involved in partisan politics], placed themselves at Wasmosy's  disposal for the 2 May strike.    The Colorado Party leaders said they were willing to  mobilize  if the president so orders. They even used indecent terms,  involving sexual positions, to describe their unconditional  willingness. Santani Colorado Party leader Victor Quintana  literally said: We are putting ourselves on all fours before  you. The Colorado Party grassroots leaders also asked the  executive branch for more assistance and the ability to appoint  and remove officials.    In response, Wasmosy began his speech by furiously attacking  the press. Concerning the strike, he said it has political  grounds. Wasmosy added: We will demonstrate that we can remain  calm. He also indicated that they were teasing a tiger, and  that the government would not be weak in its actions.    [Begin Wasmosy recording] I can guarantee you that we will  act firmly and abiding by the law. We will protect those  joining the strike because they have a right to strike.  Nevertheless, they have no right to prevent other people from  working, as do those professors, teachers, and movements  disguised as democratic that tell the students: Do not come to  school on 2 May because it will be dangerous, or because there  will be no transportation. These people are insincere  democrats. The Colorado Party is democratic.    Tell me if there is one journalist here who has been  harassed, if one medium has been harassed, or if one person with  a different political leaning has been harassed. They say what  they please, and even what they should not, every day from 0600  onwards. Nevertheless, the Colorado Party is great, and it will  always emerge a victor.    Gentlemen, we should actually take into account what has  been  raised here: a firm organization, with republican bases and  principles, an unequaled nationalist, agrarian, and republican  party. Nevertheless, we have been branded as having implemented  neoliberal policies, with being absolutists, when the party  actually takes the people into account, created solutions, and  proven itself.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vsevolod Vilchek: "Moratorium on Impeachment"] </F>   [Text] Although the data of sociological surveys (including  those of my own service) have to treated with great caution, I  feel that some things can nevertheless be judged quite  definitely--for example, what concerned the public most and  least in recent weeks.    The biggest worries were crime, inflation, and insecurity  (these were named by 40-60 percent of the 2,000 Muscovites we  polled). What worries them least are the political maneuvers "at  the top," including those connected with the treaty on public  accord (around nine percent of the respondents mentioned these).    This might seem paradoxical: After all, the accord of  various  political forces should give citizens a stronger sense of  security, promising perhaps not a bright future, but at least a  less dismal one. There is no paradox here, however. We asked:  "Do you believe that the different parties, social movements,  Duma factions, and branches of government can reach an accord  and work together constructively?" Only 7.5 percent said they  did believe this, 54.5 percent said they did not, another 25.5  percent did not say no, but did express doubts, and the rest had  no response.    Our fellow citizens have no doubt at all that the ceremonial  signing of this kind of paper could take place, but they have  strong doubts about the authenticity and significance of this  protocol of good intentions and, in general, are not inclined to  believe that the main participants in this undertaking represent  the public interest rather than personal and private interests.  This is shocking in view of the fact that it has been only 100  days since the election. When we asked the respondents whether  they knew the names of their deputies in the State Duma, only  seven percent answered that they did, and only five percent said  they still expected the deputies to live up to their  expectations.    If Yeltsin's persistent attempts to conclude a  supra-constitutional agreement with his opponents have not  aroused any public enthusiasm and clearly do not have the same  meaning as last April's referendum, what is their real purpose?  The sociological data suggested two interrelated hypotheses.    The society has reached a definite impasse. Today 65 percent  of the people in Moscow are living below the poverty line, and  around 10 percent do not have enough to eat. Hidden unemployment  in Moscow, judging by an extremely accurate indicator--the  abnormally high ratings of daytime television programs--has  already reached 15-20 percent and could take the form of clear  and obvious unemployment at any time. The people have endured  even worse problems in the past, of course, but not when they  have had to watch others race by in a Mercedes or have had to  see the advertisements for the Harlequin Night Club, for  example, offering businessmen erotic floor shows, roulette, and  a dinner menu including lobster and baby alligator ragout.    There are extremely strong feelings of nostalgia in the  society--no, not for the actual past, but for a lost social  ideal. The ratings for old movies of the socialist realism genre  provide a more precise indication of this than our ambiguous  surveys. In reality, however, the ideological vacuum is being  filled more and more by Orthodoxy, which is being inculcated as  the state religion, and by a brand of nationalism with an  emphasis on anti-Semitism, which one out of every four  Muscovites feels no need to conceal today.    The changes are irreversible, of course: Only 15 percent of  the inhabitants of the capital (half of them retired) believe  that Russia should get back on the socialist track. In other  words, people seem to be "in favor of reform." Only 14 percent  of the Muscovites, however, said that they had the necessary  qualities to succeed in life and that they feel like outsiders  in the society. The society seems to be stuck: It does not want  to go back, but it cannot move forward because it has not found  a suitable course to follow.    The only thing that unites the vast majority of people today  is their total ignorance of current developments. In the past  the public was told that the reforms were being obstructed by  the conflict between the branches of the government. What is  obstructing them today? Evidently, just one thing: their own  fundamental infeasibility. If members of the president's team  have not realized this yet, the purpose of the document on civil  accord is to provoke discord and find a scapegoat. If they have  realized this, then the agreement has another purpose: a radical  adjustment of the reforms, probably in the social democratic  spirit, to prevent social upheavals, and a consequent change in  political points of reference. It is the president's job to  achieve this change in a relatively peaceful manner by  sacrificing a few secondary officials who can easily be accused  of corruption and can then fill the vacuum in Lefortovo Prison.    There is one important fact, however, that raises questions  about the value of this hypothesis. We asked the 2,000  Muscovites whether B.N. Yeltsin had a chance of being re-elected  for a second term--15.5 percent said yes, 52.5 percent said no,  24.5 percent were not certain, and 11.5 percent had no response.  The president's staff probably has comparable data. They could  be obtained from the counterintelligence service, which managed  to come within 1-2 percent of the outcome of the December  election in its predictions. If this is true, then the  declaration of accord is certainly an ultimatum, as G. Zyuganov  said, but an extraordinary ultimatum, stipulating the terms and  nature of payment for the opposition's signature--direct access  to public opinion, signifying the start of the election  campaign. Because the text of the agreement says nothing about  any specific anti-crisis measures, which would warrant  agreement, the accord is essentially nothing more than a  moratorium on impeachment.    Incidentally, this is also a noble goal: The institution of  a  precedent in Russian history for a democratic change of  government.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Romanians clear the way to boost foreign investment THE Romanian chamber of deputies has amended the foreign investment law to allow foreign companies to own property in Romania and repatriate all profits, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. The bill must be approved by the Senate before becoming law but is expected to pass without difficulty, the Romanian Development Agency (RDA), the state body responsible for foreign investment, said yesterday. The amendment allows foreign investors to own property in Romania through joint venture companies or through locally registered subsidiaries. Existing legislation says Romanian economic agents may own real estate but does not specify that this includes foreign investors participating in local companies. Confusion has arisen because the country's constitution forbids ownership of real estate by foreigners. Mr Florin Bonciu, the RDA's director general, said the amendment would bring Romanian foreign investment regulations in line with those in other eastern European countries. He expected the bill would boost investment in Romania especially from medium-sized companies. Most of the Dollars 600m which has been invested in Romania to date had come from small companies with no need to own property, or from large companies such as Coca-Cola which are prepared to set up factories in spite of the ambiguous legislation, he said. Medium-sized companies did not have the resources to take such risks. The amendment allowing 100 per cent repatriation of profits made in both hard currency and in lei, the national currency, is not expected to make as big an impact on investors in the short term. Romania's acute hard currency shortages make it difficult in practical terms for companies to change lei into convertible currencies. Serbian harbour workers have ended an eight-day blockade of the River Danube, the Romanian Foreign Ministry said yesterday. Trades unions in the Serb port of Prahovo, protesting against UN sanctions, had prevented international river traffic from reaching the Black Sea since last Tuesday.</p>

According to a UN spokesman, Butrus-Ghali informed a  visiting  FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] delegation  yesterday in New York that he has already sent a letter to this  effect to Cristiani in which he also urges the president to  continue exercising his personal authority until his mandate  ends with a view to fulfilling all pending points of the peace  agreement.    The FMLN delegation visiting the United Nations, formed by  Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador Samayoa, and Rafael Moreno,  expressed concern over the delays and the failure to fulfill  certain agreements concerning the formation of the National  Civilian Police, the dismantlement of the former police force,  the return to society of former combatants, and the transfer of  lands.    The FMLN delegates also asked Butrus-Ghali to enforce the  mandate of the UN Observers for El Salvador mission and  reiterated their concern over delays in the issuance of  electoral identification cards in areas of the country where the  FMLN has its electoral base.</p>

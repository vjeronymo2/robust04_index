			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 4 (AFP) -- Government forces  killed eight Khmer Rouge and wounded 11 others when they overran  a guerrilla division base near the radical faction's former  headquarters of Pailin in northwest Cambodia, the state news  agency AKP said Monday.    The troops captured the guerrillas' 450 Division base in the  troubled Bavel district of Battambang province in the operation  last Thursday after an hour-long fight in which three government  soldiers were wounded, AKP said.    A guerrilla ammunition store, a vehicle and 20 huts were  burnt by the troops, who also took four prisoners and seized an  unspecified quantity of weapons, it said.    The capture of the division base near Prey Kpos in Bavel  district came as another blow to Khmer Rouge, on the heels of  the loss of the ultra-nationalists' headquarters at Pailin on  March 19.    Western defence attaches said a Khmer Rouge division can  consist of anything from just 100 to several hundred men.    The guerrillas in the Bavel area staged recent hit-and-run  attacks which government officers described as diversionary  strikes aimed at forcing the army to pull back men from Pailin.</p>

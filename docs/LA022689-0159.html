			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEWORK SUGGESTED;  </P> <P> A WEATHER UPDATE  </P> <P> "Viewing Upper Egypt From a Boat on the Nile" (Jan. 29), by Shirley Slater and  Harry Basch, was interesting and informative. As I am quite familiar with the  Nile Valley from Luxor to the Sudan at various times of the year, I was amazed  to read that October was recommended as the best month for weather, for October  is still very hot! January and February always have been recognized as the very  best months, with maximum temperatures in the low 80s and the nights quite  chilly. However, their advice on women's conservative wearing apparel should be  well heeded in all Arab nations.  </P> <P> PETER HUME  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

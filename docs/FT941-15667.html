			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Berlusconi dealt blow as Standa chief quits By Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, has received yet another blow following the resignation of Mr Gianfelice Franchini, managing director of the big Standa retailing group. Standa, controlled by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group, is Italy's second biggest retailer. The company has been gradually nursed back to profitability following its acquisition by Fininvest in the late 1980s. Mr Franchini joined Standa in 1992 in a complex deal linked to the acquisition of his family's regional supermarkets chain. In return, Mr Franchini, who has a strong reputation in the Italian retailing business, received a 7 per cent stake in Standa. This week's split follows differences over the future of the business. While Mr Franchini wanted to pursue heavy discounting, along the 'no-frills' lines of some big German groups, he is believed to have been opposed by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Giancarlo Foscale, Standa's chairman.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Nissan Motor 'may be at heart of fraud' NISSAN MOTOR Corporation, the Japanese carmaker, may have been at the centre of a multi-million-pound international tax fraud, it was alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday. The claim was made by Mr Michael Sherrard QC, counsel for Mr Michael Hunt, a director of Nissan UK, the former importer of the Japanese cars, who is accused of conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 97m in corporation tax. The prosecution has said that Mr Hunt conspired to cheat the Inland Revenue by dishonestly inflating freight charges to avoid tax, then laundering the money into Swiss bank accounts. Mr Hunt denies the charge. In a statement outlining Mr Hunt's defence Mr Sherrard told the jury: 'Keep your eyes and ears open for signs of a Japanese fraud.' He went on: 'We suggest that Nissan Motor Corporation of Japan and/or its subsidiary, Nissan Motor Corporation Carriers, may well have been right at the centre of a self-serving tax fraud by which the profits on the freight side were kept down and the equivalent of corporation tax in Japan reduced. 'You may well reach the conclusion that vast sums of cash were kept outside Japan, probably for the benefit of the corporation's business interests elsewhere in the world.' A number of signposts of the Japanese involvement had emerged since the Inland Revenue started its investigation into Nissan UK, the company set up by Mr Octav Botnar. The prosecution had claimed that in the early 1980s Nissan UK had changed the shipping agents that were party to the alleged fraud, Mr Sherrard said. The introduction to the second company of shipping agents had been made by a Japanese employee of Nissan Motor Corporation, he said. The prosecution had already said sophisticated fraudsters might seek to cover their tracks, he continued. In this case, there was much documentation, but a dearth of evidence from Japan. Mr Sherrard said a crucial question in the trial would be who controlled the two Swiss bank accounts where the money allegedly siphoned out of Nissan UK was eventually deposited. The jury would hear that a senior figure in Nissan Motor Corporation Carriers had told the Dutch authorities that the money in those accounts belonged to Japan, he said. The trial continues today.</p>

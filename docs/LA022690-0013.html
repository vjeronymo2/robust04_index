			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAME SONG, DIFFERENT VERSE FOR CLIPPERS IN 107-106 LOSS TO SPURS  </P> <P> The scene has been replayed over and over this season for the Clippers: close  call at the end, coaches get the tape immediately after the game and watch the  crucial play. No one leaves the room happy.  </P> <P> It happened again Sunday night, and the ending was no different, a 107-106 loss  to San Antonio at the Sports Arena. Maybe the Clippers should at least get  residuals because they're not getting any victories in these things.  </P> <P> "No matter how hard we play," Coach Don Casey said, pleased and frustrated at  the same time, "we need to get some W's."  </P> <P> The plot worked to perfection for a while, the Clippers having come from 13  points down late in the third quarter to keep pressure on San Antonio. They  even led one of the league's best teams, 106-105, when Ken Norman hit two free  throws with 15.4 seconds left.  </P> <P> And then . . .  </P> <P> San Antonio got the ball in the low post to David Robinson, who went left into  the lane. He collided with Charles Smith, who was standing with his back to the  ball while guarding another Spur. Referee Tommy Nunez called Smith for the  foul.  </P> <P> Robinson made both free throws with 7.3 seconds remaining to give San Antonio  the victory, the Clippers' final attempt having resulted in a Winston Garland  airball from the right baseline when the 7-foot-1 Robinson came out to  challenge.  </P> <P> And so it goes, the Clippers' sixth one-point defeat of the season. The routine  of close losses, not surprisingly, may be wearing thin.  </P> <P> "They are young enough to be resilient," Casey said of his team. "But we need a  win to get uplifted. I'm tired of these endings, and I think the players are,  too."  </P> <P> The Clippers haven't won since Feb. 8, the final game before the All-Star  break, in a run that stretches seven games. Even longer, they have lost 14 of  17, and are 21-33 overall.  </P> <P> But not always playing like it.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating, but we've been better the last few games," said Smith, who  played only five minutes in the first half because of foul trouble but finished  with 17 of his team-high 23 points in the final two quarters. "I saw a lot out  there tonight. I think we've got a team, and we are going to start a winning  streak."  </P> <P> What he, and the crowd of 14,041, saw was the Clippers falling behind by 12  points in the first quarter and 14 in the second. They came back to tie the  game by halftime, 62-62, with a 9-2 run in the final 1:51 of the period.  </P> <P> And then they scored 17 points in the third quarter, taking on another  double-digit deficit, including 84-71 with 2:57 left on Robinson free throws  for two of his 26 points, to go with 14 rebounds and five blocked shots. The  Clippers made five of 20 shots in the third period.  </P> <P> In the fourth, they cut the lead to three points when Garland, in his first  game as a Clipper after being acquired from Golden State last Thursday for two  second-round draft choices, connected on a 20-foot jump shot. But the San  Antonio cushion soon went back to seven, then dropped to one, and, finally, the  Clippers tied the score, 100-100, on Smith's jump shot from the foul line with  2:16 to play.  </P> <P> Their first lead since 2-0 came moments later when as Manning made two free  throws with 1:41 left in a 102-100 game. Rod Strickland made a layup, then  David Rivers sank two free throws to put the Clippers up, 104-102. From there,  no lead was bigger than one the rest of the way.  </P> <P> Strickland made a free throw with 1:03 remaining, and Robinson converted two  more with 33 seconds to play to give San Antonio the lead, 105-104. Norman hit  his two, and the Clippers were up.  </P> <P> That set the stage for Robinson and the final trip to the line in a  longer-than-usual 2-hour, 26-minute game that included 73 free throws, 43 by  the Clippers. Turned out, though, the game still ended too soon for them.  </P> <P> Two Clippers played 40-plus minutes, Norman and Benoit Benjamin, the latter a  big surprise. After missing four consecutive games with the flu, Benjamin was  expected to go 10 to 15 minutes in a reserve role, but he started and went 40.  </P> <P> "I was all right," he said. "A little bit rusty, but my wind was OK."  </P> <P> Benjamin was right on both counts. He made just four of 12 attempts, but did  manage three blocks and six rebounds -- including three offensive -- against a  very tough opponent, Robinson.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Winston Garland played 22 minutes and both backcourt positions in his Clipper  debut. He was most impressive at shooting guard while paired with David Rivers,  hitting three of four attempts to open the game and finishing five of 10 for 15  points, but three assists and six turnovers . . . The Spurs have won 11 of the  last 12 meetings at the Sports Arena . . . Despite problems at guard, the  Clippers continue to handle the ball well, or at least better than their league  average. Averaging an NBA-high 19 turnovers a game coming in, they had 14  Sunday, after 14 at Denver and 11 against Utah.  </P></p>

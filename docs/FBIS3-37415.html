Sergeyev rejected accusations of deliberate blocking of the  press.    He assured journalists that a new press centre, seating 150  reporters, will open in the government's new headquarters in two  weeks.    He promised to help journalists in arranging interviews with  cabinet ministers, but said government presidium meetings were  not a show, and will be accessible only to correspondents of  federal news agencies and state television.    Sergeyev stressed that the government was interested, as  never before, in making its decisions, popular or otherwise,  known and understandable to the people. He complained that the  press was keen on criticising the government and was reluctant  to promote educational publications about its activity.</p>

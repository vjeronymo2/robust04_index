			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "An American Fund Has </F> Appeared in the Investment Market: The Presentation of an  American Fund"]    [Text] Yesterday Austin Beutner, president of the  Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia (FLER), and Michael  Blumenthal, chairman of the Fund's Board of Directors, announced  that the Fund had begun its operations. This means that the  directors of FLER are ready to examine investment proposals that  have to do with developing production in privatized  enterprises.    The Fund was registered as a private corporation in the  state of Delaware in March 1994. It is managed by a board of  directors comprised of leading U.S. experts in investment and  banking, as well as venture capital investment. The Chairman of  the Board of Directors, former Secretary of the Treasury of the  U.S., Michael Blumenthal, was appointed personally by U.S.  President Bill Clinton. The Fund is financed by the U.S.  Congress (a $100 million grant has been received), as well as by  the Corporation for Private Investment Abroad, the Export-Import  Bank, and the U.S. Agency for Trade and Development (for now,  the money from these sources is limited to $150 million).    According to the management of FLER, the origin of FLER is  directly tied to the decision of the "big seven" countries  (adopted in Tokyo in July 1993) to support a program of  privatization and organizational restructuring in Russia. In  contrast to the already functioning Russian-American Fund for  Entrepreneurship (with a financial reserve of $340 million for  four years and area of interest in small and mid-sized  businesses), the new investment organization will concentrate on  mid-sized and large privatized enterprises. American investors,  through accumulated "risk" capital, may be able to take a  leading position in the Russian domestic investment market.  Obviously, this will also be facilitated by the fact that the  program for supporting privatization has been approved by the  presidium of the government; FLER already has its own niche. The  Fund will have to initiate commercial investments in capital  stock of enterprises located in regions that the Fund considers  as having the greatest potential. FLER experts firmly believe  that official support of their activities by the Russian  Government "will open all doors to them" in the most desirable  regions and will "guarantee access to necessary information."  Russian experts are assessing these possibilities more  sceptically. Nevertheless, even though they are counting on  protection by the Russian authorities, Americans are not  planning to use their own "risk" capital in a struggle to  purchase enough shares to control Russian enterprises. They  intend to divide the risk of capital investments between both  foreign and Russian investors and "will be open to any  interesting proposals."</p>

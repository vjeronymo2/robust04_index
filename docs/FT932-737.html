			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Cookery: Gorgeous gooseberries BANANAS and canned pineapple are to blame. It was shiploads of these 'exotics' that put paid, early in the 1900s, to what had been a thriving gooseberry appreciation society. In 1829, the Gooseberry Growers' Register recorded 722 different varieties grown in Britain. Today, it is rare to find more than one sort on sale, wherever you look - and that is likely to be an anonymous culinary variety as green as grass, hard as hail and picked horribly immature. Fortunately, all is not lost. The scene might be dire in the shops but treasure trove is to be found at Brogdale,* the Kentish home of the national fruit collections where more than 100 varieties of gooseberry are grown. My visit there was a revelation. I always knew I liked gooseberries, but it was not until Brogdale's Dr Joan Morgan opened my eyes (and my mouth) to the choice available that I realised just how splendid and richly varied this fruit can be. Gooseberry colours run the whole gamut of reds, from pink champagne through claret to nearly black. There are shades of amber and gold, palest jade and almost white. The fruit can be as small as a cultivated blueberry or as big as a gobstopper, perfectly round or elongated. A few types bristle with designer stubble, some are mildly hirsute, and others are as bald as a baby's pate. The tastes of the best gooseberries are rich and full, sometimes honey-sweet, winey, complex and lingering. And the names of them roll off the tongue like a litany: Snowdrop, White Champagne, Golden Gem, Hero of the Nile, Lancer, Leveller (one of the best golden orbs), Pitmarston's Greengage, Langley's Gage (which hangs well on the bush and so becomes very sugary), Halmon's Dumpling, Cope's Jolly Butcher, Pendleton's Bullock's Hearts, Slaughterman (there are a lot of bloodthirsty names among the reds), and Whinham's Industry (perhaps my favourite). Gorging on the real thing like these, ripened properly and picked freshly, whetted my appetite to serve a dessert of gooseberries - by which I mean three or four choice varieties, each displayed in its own basket or bowl, to be topped and tailed at table and popped into your mouth, like sweets, at the end of dinner. It might be a little much to dunk them in cream as well, but a few crisp little biscuits on the side do not go amiss - say, almond tuiles, macaroons or petticoat tails. Such a dessert is fresh, healthy, and very easy for the cook. But, of course, it all depends on having access to tip-top gooseberries. Next weekend, on July 3 and 4, Brogdale is holding a summer fruit festival with guided tours, displays, consultations with fruit experts and tastings of many summer fruits - strawberries, raspberries, cherries and currants as well as gooseberries. Visitors can, throughout the fruiting season, buy punnets of choice varieties to take home. Dessert gooseberries are not only rarer than culinary varieties but are doubly useful. They can be cooked as well as eaten raw; and just as dessert apples often make better puddings than cooking apples, so dessert gooseberries make excellent hot puddings on so-called summer days chilly enough to bring you out in goose pimples. The hot fruit salad in Elizabeth David's Summer Cooking is a lovely choice of gooseberry recipe for such days. It has, as she puts it, 'all the flavour and scent of a warm summer fruit garden.' Stew gently without water 1 lb topped and tailed red gooseberries and 1/4 lb red currants sprinkled with a little sugar. After five minutes, add  1/2 lb raspberries and cook for just two minutes more. Serve very hot with thick, fresh cream. For those who have access only to the little green gooseberries of commerce, I suggest my own adaptation of a classic apple pudding. LITTLE GOOSEBERRY CHARLOTTES (serves 8-10) This seems equally at home for Sunday lunch or a dinner party. Serve it on its own, handing round a bowl of cream whipped with a little elderflower syrup for those who want it. For a party, each castle-like pudding can be served surrounded by its own moat of pouring cream and crowned with florets of elderflower (if still in blossom) or a shake of caster sugar. Ingredients: 2 1/4 lb green gooseberries, topped and tailed; 2-3 elderflower blossoms or 3-4 tablespoons elderflower syrup; 4-6 oz caster sugar; 2 oz flaked almonds, coarsely ground in a coffee mill or food processor; a loaf of good white bread; about 8 oz butter. Method: Moisten a large, heavy-based pan with a couple of tablespoons of water. Add the gooseberries and cook very gently, with the blossoms buried among them if available, or add the elderflower syrup to the pan when the gooseberries have begun to pop and yield their juices. When the berries are soft, crush them into the pan with a potato masher to make a not-too-smooth puree. Add 4-6 oz sugar (the smaller amount if elderflower syrup was used) and continue cooking over a very low flame for several minutes until excess moisture is driven off, leaving a thick and intensely-flavoured pulp. The mixture will spit and plop as it cooks and will need frequent stirring to prevent catching and burning. Use a long-handled wooden spoon and protect your hand with an oven glove. Set the pan aside, uncovered, so evaporation continues as the mixture cools. Then, stiffen the fruit by stirring in the freshly ground almonds. Slice the bread thinly and cut out rounds to fit the bases of 10 cocotte dishes or dariole moulds of about 5 fl oz capacity. Fry the rounds in a little butter until crisp and golden brown and put them into the moulds. Melt more butter in the frying pan, dip pieces of bread into it to moisten them on both sides, and use them to line the sides of the moulds. The fit should be as neat and as tight as a jigsaw. Spoon the cold gooseberry pulp into the bread-lined moulds, packing it down firmly. Cover with lids of bread, again dipped in melted butter to moisten them, and place the little puddings on a baking tray. Bake for 30 minutes at 425'F/220'C (gas mark 7) until the filling is hot and the bread is crisp. Let the charlottes settle for 5-10 minutes after they emerge from the oven. Then, run a knife round the inside edge of each mould and invert the puddings on to warmed plates for serving. *Brogdale Horticultural Trust, Brogdale Farm, Faversham, Kent ME13 8XZ (tel: 0795-535 286).</p>

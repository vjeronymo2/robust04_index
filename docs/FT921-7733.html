			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Broader market fails to respond as Dow rises Wall Street US BLUE chips showed gains that the broader market was unable to register yesterday as investors, encouraged by January economic data, bought economically sensitive Dow constituent stocks, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 5.59 up at 3,230.32, after having posted a modest loss in the first half-hour of trading. On the big board, declining issues narrowly led advances by 950 to 756 after a fair New York SE volume of 234.8m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was just 0.88 firmer at 408.26, while secondary stocks posted losses on the day, with the Nasdaq composite finishing down 4.00 at 622.41. Hewlett-Packard, the computer company, jumped Dollars 9 1/8 to Dollars 73 1/2 after turning in first-quarter profits of Dollars 1.10 a share against 83 cents last year. Rohr, an aircraft component manufacturer, dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 18 1/8 . The company said it may face a federal indictment following a government investigation of faulty testing which might bar it from winning future government contracts. Among active blue chip issues, AT&amp;T gained Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 38, Ford Motor advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 and General Motors rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 3/8 . News of reduced reserve requirements lifted some bank shares for a second day. Citicorp added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 16 3/4 and BancOne Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 47 3/4 . Bank of Boston moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to a 52-week high of Dollars 17 7/8 after the stock was added to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's recommended list. News that Kroger, one of the largest US supermarket chains, plans to buy back up to Dollars 100m of high-yield debt had little effect on the company's stock, which eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 17 1/2 . Biotechnology issues led the secondary market lower. Centocorp plunged Dollars 8 1/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 in very heavy over-the-counter trading after the company said that the US Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about its important Centoxin drug to treat septic shock that might delay the release of the drug and reduce 1992 earnings. Centocorp also posted a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 1.19 a share. A series of disappointing corporate results also contributed to the secondary market's slide. Fleer fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 22 1/2 on the back of fourth-quarter earnings of 10 cents a share, compared with 27 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of about 30 cents in the latest quarter. Mail Box weakened Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 after turning in third-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share, below earlier estimates of 35 cents a share but above the 24 cents reported the previous year. Walt Disney declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 145 5/8 in spite of news that its 'Beauty and the Beast' film had become the first animated film to be nominated for the best picture category of the Academy Awards. The stock gained Dollars 3 5/8 on Tuesday after the entertainment group announced plans for a four-for-one stock split. Canada THERE WERE moderate losses in most sectors yesterday, sending the Toronto market lower for the seventh straight session. President George Bush's poor showing in the New Hampshire primary added to the market's negative tone. Analysts said the slim rise of only 0.1 per cent in the US consumer price index for January eased fears of a resurgence in inflation, but had little immediate effect on the market. The composite index closed 7.9 easier at 3,543.3. Falls outscored rises by 350 to 230 after volume of 25.8m shares.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Observer: Sock it to 'em The German electorate may have returned the same old chancellor at the weekend, but look to the 30 deputies from the Party of Democratic Socialism, successors to east Germany's former communist party, to inject a bit of fresh colour into the next Bonn government. Candidate for the gerontocracy is Stefan Heym, the 81-year-old writer, who, as the oldest member of the Bundestag, qualifies to deliver the opening speech when parliament reconvenes. The literary caucus is further bolstered by the presence of Gerhard Zwerenz, known principally for his steamy short stories. Heinrich von Einsiedel, the great grandson of Bismarck, should be relied on to deliver a piquant historical perspective, as, in a different way, should Rudolf Kutzmutz, who admits to having been an informer for the Stasi secret police. On the distaff side, meanwhile, the formidable Christina Schenk, an outspoken lesbian, will be rubbing shoulders with Christa Luft, the elegant Marxist economist. The PDS's parliamentary leader, Gregor Gysi, promises 'anything but a boringly unified fraction'. You could say that the heirs to the faceless grey communist party apparatchiks have come far.</p>

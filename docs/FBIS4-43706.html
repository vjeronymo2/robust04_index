			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Jean Carbonare, spokesman of the </F> International Human Rights Federation, by Patrick de  Saint-Exupery; place and date not given: "The French President  Knew..."]    [Text] The author of an official report published in early  1993 on early indications of genocide in Rwanda, Jean Carbonare,  accuses the Elysee [office of the president office] with  deliberately choosing to ignore proven facts.    "When one knows and remains silent, while continuing to  support a regime that systematically eliminates its opponents,  one is necessarily an accessory to the crime. Today I accuse  President Mitterrand of being guilty, at the very least, of  criminal conspiracy." Jean Carbonare does not mince his words  and yet he does not sound angry. "Now that people are talking  of bringing the perpetrators of this crime against humanity to  trial, I ask the question: `How far must we go?'"    A member of the commission of inquiry mandated in 1993 by  the  International Human Rights Federation (IHRF) to look into  Rwanda's "death squads," Jean Carbonare is, quite simply,  indignant. Being an expert in African affairs who has been  following the situation in Rwanda for some 20 years, he does not  understand why the Elysee refused to take proven facts into  account.    The IHRF report clearly showed how the militias operated; it  spelled out their crimes and identified the persons responsible.  It described how a "machine" was put together which could start  laying the country to waste at any time: "As early as 1993, the  machine was ready. All the government had to do to start the  madness was press on the gas pedal. This happened on 7 April;  it could have happened much earlier."    Several times after the IHRF report was published, Jean  Carbonare contacted French officials, especially the Elysee's  African department. He says: "They told me that things were  going to get better, that one had to be patient. They knew  perfectly well what was happening in Rwanda, but they had taken  sides. Shortly after our report came out, President  Habyarimana, whom we identified as one of the death squads'  sponsors, was received in Paris by President Mitterrand with  full honors."  <H5>  Elysee Denies Charges </H5>   Referring to a comment made to him by the Elysee about  Rwanda's rebels, Jean Carbonare says: "The RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front], we will crush it!" In other words: The  Elysee is totally behind the Habyarimana regime. Asked about  this yesterday, Bruno Delaye, the head of the Elysee's African  department, denied saying anything of the kind.    Jean Carbonare adds that "the French Army helped train those  responsible for the slaughter. These were people who knew --  and so did our ambassadors -- that the systematic killing of  opponents was being planned. According to our research, 10,000  to 15,000 people were probably assassinated between 1990 and  1993. We passed on this information. Why was there no  response?"    He "ruefully" notes that when the French Army intervened in  early April to evacuate foreign nationals, "Rwanda's army and  the militias hailed our troops. A few hours earlier, the very  men who were welcoming the country of human rights, had started  the slaughter."  <H5>  `France Should Keep Low Profile' </H5>   Today, Jean Carbonare commends the initiative taken by  French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, but regrets that it looks like an  attempt to patch up a self-inflicted wound. Today, France  "should keep a low profile and steer clear of any military  intervention, however well-meaning." France should also  "listen" to RPF officials. "These people are quite wary about  our country. They do not trust us at all. However, I still  think that it is possible for us and them to talk on a basis of  mutual respect."    RPF leaders find it extremely difficult to moderate their  men. Says Jean Carbonare: "RPF President Alexis Kanyarengwe  told me he had to send to the rear many young men who had `gone  off their rocker' after facing the horror during their  offensive."    Jean Carbonare tries to distinguish between "the RPF, whose  members did commit a number of war crimes, and the other side,  that of Rwanda's Government, its army, the militias, which are  definitely guilty of genocide."</p>

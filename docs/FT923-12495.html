			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Henlys forecasts significantly reduced losses after cost cuts HENLYS Group, the motor trading, coach and bus conglomerate facing a Pounds 26.5m hostile bid from rival T Cowie, promised shareholders a maintained 1p interim dividend in its defence document yesterday. It forecast a first half pre-tax loss of not more than Pounds 900,000, compared to a deficit of Pounds 3.6m in the first half of 1991 when the interim dividend was cut from 3p. Henlys told shareholders to reject the bid, saying that its new management team had a strategy to turn round the group's problematic bus and coach manufacturing business, while the rest of the business was performing well. It had already cut costs which would save Pounds 2.5m in a full year and had identified more savings of a similar size, which should be achieved by early 1993. Cowie said it thought the defence was 'weak' and it would write to Henlys' shareholders again early next week. Cowie's offer is of one new share for every two Henlys shares, and there is no cash alternative. Cowie's shares closed at 140p, making the offer worth 70p a share, and Henlys ended 1p above the offer value at 71p. One analyst said 'the offer on the table just is not good enough'. Henlys also went on the attack saying that Cowie lacked experience in bus and coach building and had not succeeded with its own bus and coach distribution subsidiary. It said that Cowie's balance sheet was heavily geared, and suggested that the offer was a way of strengthening Cowie's balance sheet by buying Henlys' assets at a discount to book value. Henlys said Cowie's profits growth was dependent on falling interest rates; it questioned whether Cowie's share price was sustainable. It said the Cowie pension fund had sold 1m Cowie shares in the past three months which it said was 'hardly a vote of confidence'.</p>

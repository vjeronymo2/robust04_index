			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Logitek and Microvitec talks may lead to deal LOGITEK, the computer services company yesterday announced that it had entered into talks which may or may not lead to it recommending an offer from Microvitec, the USM quoted maker of computer peripherals, which had launched a hostile takeover bid. The move comes just one day before the extended deadline for the offer expires. Microvitec has acquired just over 21 per cent of Logitek's shares, with the remainder concentrated in the hands of a few institutional investors. Logitek had rejected Microvitec's offer as 'misconceived' and claimed that it 'seriously undervalues' the group. Microvitec had trimmed its initial Pounds 5.9m 3-for-2 share offer to a 1-for-1 offer valuing the group at Pounds 3.3m, after Logitek shareholders agreed in March to dispose of Azlan, its computer networking offshoot in an attempt to reduce the high level of debt. Logitek has not, however, made any profit forecast ahead of day 39, after which companies subject to an offer can no longer release financial information, including, in normal circumstances, trading results.</p>

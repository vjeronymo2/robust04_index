			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa confirms jobs and cost-cuts programme LUFTHANSA, the loss-making German national airline, hopes to improve its results by DM700m (Dollars 500m) a year from 1993 through improved marketing and more flexible pricing, as well as making big savings through the job and operational cuts agreed this week. Its supervisory board approved the employment and cost-cutting programme put forward by Mr Jurgen Weber, chief executive, to haul the airline out of the red. Lufthansa made a pre-tax loss of DM542m in the first six months of this year, 66 per cent higher than in the same period of 1991. The airline confirmed its plan to shed 6,000 people over the next two years after 1,800 in 1992. This will be a cut of 15 per cent on the 50,000 at the airline, although the whole group has a labour force of some 60,000. Cuts in management would be especially deep. The total impact of its measures could be up to DM3bn a year from 1995. Lufthansa officials said concessions by the unions, including a one-year pay freeze and more flexible pay structures and working conditions, represented a marked change from the high wage demands made throughout industry earlier this year. The airline reached agreement with its two main unions, the DAG white collar union and the oTV public sector union, on Monday night. It said the favourable pay terms meant its new Lufthansa Express domestic operation would be a division of Lufthansa and not a separate company with lower pay levels than the rest of the airline. It threatened to take the latter move if unions did not go along with Lufthansa's requests for wage savings. Lufthansa's financial situation is more acute than at most big German companies. It must now retrench in line with the tougher economic and airline environment. Mr Weber said operating losses this year would be around DM1.2bn.</p>

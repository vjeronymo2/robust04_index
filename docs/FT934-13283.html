			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Technology: Doing away with excess data - Worth Watching The problem many finance departments or accountants face when using PC spreadsheets is that everyone in the department is working on a different copy of the software  - some of which can contain out-of-date or inaccurate information. With the move towards 'client-server' computing with one central database, Arbor Software of Santa Clara has developed Essbase analysis software which does away with the proliferation of data. Essbase holds the information on the server to be drawn down by each user as required  - 50 or more employees can gain access to the data simultaneously depending on the hardware configuration.

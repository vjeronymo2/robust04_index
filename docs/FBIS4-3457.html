			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (CNS) -- Sixty mayors and  vice-mayors from medium- and large-sized cities in some 27  provinces and autonomous regions as well as district heads and  deputy heads from municipalities gathered together today in  Beijing for a 50-day training course on socialist market economy  theory.    The 18th study course for mayors, the first of which was  held  in October, 1983, is being jointly held by the Organizational  Department of the Communist Party of China, the Ministry of  Construction and the China Association for Science and  Technology. So far more than 1,000 mayors, vice-mayors and other  officials have received such training.    At the opening ceremony for the class, the head of the  leading team for the training of the mayors and Minister of  Construction Mr. Hou Jie said that the current class would see  dramatic adjustments with the emphasis on particular basic  theories of the market economy based on increasing market  economy knowledge and on the level of knowledge shown by the  student mayors.    The main theme for this study involves the building of  socialist theory with Chinese characteristics, the principle of  market economy operation, the modern enterprise system, the  situation of foreign economic relations and trade and its  policies, reform of taxation, the restructuring of the financial  system, monetary policies, the legal system for the market  economy, the futures market, the securities market, the  employment and labour market situation and relevant policies,  the social security system, management discipline and leadership  discipline, urban planning and construction, as well as  comprehensive administration. During the current course, a  three-way seminar attended by representatives from enterprise  circles, government and theorists will be held in order to  discuss important issues in the country's economic life at  present.    Mayors of different cities have in recent years held  exchanges with one another, making progress in their study of  current economic knowledge. Following the establishment of the  association of mayors in August, 1991, exchanges of this kind  have tended to grow. The association of mayors will prepare for  the convening of meetings on new rising cities, seminars on  large cities attended by their mayors and social functions  attended by female mayors for friendly exchanges. Exploratory  visits to Germany by some mayors will also be organized this  year.</p>

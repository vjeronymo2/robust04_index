The minister stressed that he always opposed such  tendencies,  because especially in the period of the transformation of the  Army "they cause harmful chaos in the Armed Forces." He added  that if the political manipulations exceed a certain limit and  if in the near future, there is a culmination of unfavorable  phenomena, such as the budget debate which was unfavorable to  the Army, he may come to the conclusion that there is no place  for him in Warsaw. For the time being, however, "as long as his  hands are not tied," the possibility of resignation is out of  the question. Because he is not used to deserting because of  difficulties, "the caravan will continue," said Kolodziejczyk;  he carefully evaded answering the question of who exactly is  trying to politically dominate the Army and what the  manipulations are. He merely said that in recent days, he had  met with Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz in order to discuss  the issue of the final decisions concerning the model for  steering the Ministry of National Defense [MON]. These problems  will probably be resolved at the end of this month or the  beginning of next month, the MON head expects; he hopes that it  will be not a "contemporary model, but a model for years."    MON roughly estimates that the costs of the "Partnership for  Peace" program will amount to nearly 0.5 trillion zlotys [Z].  Approximately Z60 to Z80 billion are needed to establish our  military mission with the NATO leadership in Brussels. We would  have to spend Z420 billion for participating in this year's  training.    Kolodziejczyk is determined to maintain the civilian control  over the Army; the control should be such as it is envisioned in  the standards accepted by Western Europe and NATO. "It is with  disgust that I read reports on the alleged conflict on the  border of the civilian and military segments within MON," the  minister was backed up by General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the  general staff. He mentioned that there are sometimes  differences of opinion; however, in a situation in which  difficult problems must be resolved, this is entirely  understandable. Jerzy Milewski, first deputy of the minister  and head of the National Security Office, evaluates press  enunciations bluntly as "false and outrageous." "Well, I have  found myself in the ministry at the motion of Minister  Kolodziejczyk," explained Milewski; in addition, his superior  gave assurances that they had known each other for ages and the  cooperation between them was developing very well.    After one year's experiences in the area of steering the  Armed Forces in line with new rules, General Wilecki announced  on Wednesday [26 January] that there would be serious changes,  not only in the central establishments of the Army.    The General Staff, as the chief command body, will include  newly established inspectorates (or centers of command) of the  naval and air forces; the General Staff chief believes that this  will place these forces higher to the strategic level, which  will strengthen their position in the Army. Transforming the  model of the functioning of the quite extensive Air Forces and  Air Protection Forces will entail serious reductions of forces  and equipment; at least 20 airfields will become redundant.  "However, local communities increasingly often protest  liquidating the garrisons that the strategists decided should be  liquidated. Self-governmental authorities are willing to stop  collecting fees -- only if the Army stayed in the town," says  General Wilecki.    The establishment of the experimental "ground-air" Krakow  district will be continued; so far the process is half-way  completed (it is scheduled for completion in 1997). Within its  framework, the following formations will be established: 14th  brigade in Przemysl, 21st brigade in Rzeszow, 23d brigade in  Gliwice. In addition, the Krakow and Lublin garrisons will be  extended. The experiences gained in the Krakow district will be  useful in the future, in building a mobile brigade system,  adjusted to the structures accepted in NATO.    In the area of the Lodz Voivodship a division of armored  cavalry will be established. Three regiments: in Leczyca,  Tomaszow Mazowiecki, and Nowe Miasto will be equipped with  Polish "Huzar" helicopters, light anti-infantry, and antitank  weapons. This way some kind of fast reaction forces will be  established; General Wilecki calls them formations of "winged  infantry."    A committee that is working on the new model of military  education is completing its work. As early as this autumn, the  first officers cadets will be trained in line with new rules.  The number of schools will be decreased by half; some persons  of the didactic cadres will be transferred to "future-oriented"  schools.    Minister Kolodziejczyk estimates the redundant military  property that has been left over by the once-twice-as-big Polish  Army at Z2 trillion. After a period of great interest at the  beginning, no one wants to buy the empty barracks and  store-rooms (the Army, in order to protect them from  devastation, is spending its money). The minister hopes that  this government will see to this problem. So far there has not  been an appropriate agency that would free the Army of this  burden.</p>

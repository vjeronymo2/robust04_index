			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Scornful miners tell Willis to go back to London A CROWD of 200 'Tory haters' gathered outside Doncaster's Mansion House, where the TUC general council met yesterday, but they saved their real anger for their brothers from the London-based organisation. They jostled general council members and one aimed a punch at Mr Norman Willis, the TUC general secretary. For an hour they shouted: 'TUC get off your knees - organise a general strike'. But the general council - holding its first meeting outside London, apart from annual conferences - would have none of it. Mr Willis ruled out a general strike: 'There is no way the TUC puts its head into a legal noose,' he said, referring to the law banning secondary action. The TUC would urge workers to seek the views of their employers on the position of their businesses in the economy and to build a partnership for jobs on their National Day of Recovery on December 9. Even Mr Arthur Scargill, the National Union of Mineworkers president, confined himself to saying that he would demand a 'day of action' if any of the 10 pits earmarked for immediate closure were shut before the end of the present review procedure. Mr Scargill was nowhere to be seen in the bar of the Armthorpe Miners' Welfare, near the threatened Markham Main pit. Here a group from the general council had a cool welcome at an increasingly heated meeting with about 100 miners who were carrying Socialist Worker newspapers. They listened politely as Mr Willis criticised the government and repeated that there would be no general strike. But when he invited questions, he got several emotional speeches. 'Norman, please don't sit on the fence any more, because everyone is laughing at you,' said one. 'We need some more positive leadership. We are begging you for a general strike.' Another said: 'Walking around Hyde Park in the rain while the Tories are sat at home in front of the fire, drinking and laughing, is not enough. We need a strike.' Others shouted that Mr Willis would have no job had workers obeyed the law in history - there would be no TUC. 'Sod off back to London, Norman,' they said. An NUM official pointed out that his union had not yet called for a general strike, although it was aware of the anger of members.</p>

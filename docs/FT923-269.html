			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Smith wins backing on Europe: Labour rejects Maastricht referendum - Brown and Blair join NEC MR JOHN SMITH won a double victory yesterday when the Labour conference decisively rejected a referendum on Maastricht and his key lieutenants, Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, were elected to the national executive committee. The results of the voting will strengthen the new Labour leader's grip on the party machine and help reverse the setback of Mr Bryan Gould's resignation from the shadow cabinet over European policy on Sunday. Senior party officials did not try to disguise their elation with the election result, which saw Mr Gould humiliatingly ejected from the NEC on less than half the vote he received last year. That ballot, together with the defeat of Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwinger, after 14 years on the NEC, removed at a stroke two vocal critics of Mr Smith's firmly pro-European policy. It also leaves Mr Tony Benn as the sole hard-left anti-Maastricht rebel on the NEC. Labour's 'modernising' faction - personified by Mr Brown and Mr Blair, the shadow chancellor and home affairs spokesman respectively - was also strengthened by the election of Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader, who topped the poll. Describing the referendum vote and the rejection of a motion opposing Maastricht as 'a humiliation' for Mr Smith's opponents, Mr David Hill, Labour's communications director, said: 'It has been a very, very good afternoon.' Delegates at the Blackpool conference were plainly surprised by the NEC ballot results. Speculation had concentrated on the possibility of Mr Benn being ejected and the likelihood of a close battle between by Mr Blair and Mr Gould. The scale of the former heritage spokesman's defeat was attributed to growing irritation at his refusal to mute his criticism of Mr Smith's European policy position. Taken alongside firmer than expected opposition to a referendum on Maastricht demonstrated by the conference, Mr Smith has substantially increased authority in deciding tactics in the Commons when, or if, the treaty returns for ratification. It will also diminish significantly Mr Gould's efforts to rally opponents to Maastricht. Yesterday, several former allies were openly critical of his decision to resign, with many attacking its timing as politically inept. Today, Mr Smith will attempt to capitalise on the clear desire for party unity demonstrated yesterday by staking out Labour's claim to be the party of Europe. In his keynote speech, he will condemn Mr John Major's 'inactivity' in the EC presidency and argue that the role of government is actively to promote employment and growth.

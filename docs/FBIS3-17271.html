			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Mar 23, BNS -- Ex-Lithuanian Defense  Minister Audrius Butkevicius has publicly accused the Prosecutor  General's Office of illegal actions against him. In a written  statement presented to Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas,  the former minister said he will use "all legal measures,  including extreme ones" to defend himself against the  "self-will" of the prosecutor's office.    In order to avoid conflicts, Butkevicius demands to stop the  official investigation of the alleged financial violations in  the purchase of weapons for Lithuania's defense forces in  1992-93 and to stop legal proceedings against him. The former  minister also demands to return the property that was seized  during a search in his apartment.    Last week, over 40 searches were carried out in apartments  of  former and present Defense Ministry employees, including  Butkevicius.    In his March 21 statement, published by the RESPUBLIKA  newspaper Wednesday, Butkevicius said he did not commit any  crimes during his service as defense minister. Butkevicius said  he is prepared to explain how the weapons were bought, however  "not as criminal, but as a former Lithuanian defense minister."</p>

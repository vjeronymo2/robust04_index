			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: The warnings of a coming slump Sir, Your leading article ('The New Consensus', April 20) is incorrect when it states that, in contrast with 1981, there 'have been no howls of complaint' from the universities about unemployment. We, together and separately, have been warning for at least the past 18 months that the British economy was heading for a slump. In particular, we pointed out last July, in an IPPR pamphlet entitled 'Britain's Economic Problems in the 1990s', that it would be a strategic error of colossal magnitude to join the ERM in anything like the existing exchange rate. If Britain did so, we predicted that unemployment would eventually rise to well over 3m with severe long term consequences. These warnings and forecasts have subsequently been repeated on a great many occasions. For instance, in the New Statesman on January 18, we predicted a much larger and longer fall in output than other forecasters; in a post-Budget review we forecast that unemployment would rise to about 3.5m by the end of 1992. And contrary to what your leader suggests, these forecasts were accompanied by carefully argued, and strongly expressed, statements which explicitly disputed the proposition that 'macroeconomic policy cannot target real activity'. The Treasury has won no argument. Over the years it has made one wildly wrong forecast after another and, as a consequence, has undertaken policies which have already had extremely damaging short run and structural effects on the British economy. It is dangerous that the British establishment should only admit one way of thinking to be worthy of consideration at any given time, however wrong it has been in the past and however much the orthodoxy changes. At the same time it engages in a conspiracy of silence with respect to the expression of fundamental disagreement. In our view, the scale of the present downturn has, even now, not been properly appreciated. And we strongly dispute that there is nothing which can be done to stem the debacle.

[Cardenas] The Zapatist National Liberation Army made people  aware of the predatory system of unfairness and discrimination  that the indigenous communities have endured for centuries. It  also revealed that, from the socioeconomic viewpoint, the  neoliberal and technocratic schemes were unfeasible, as well as  the unpostponable need to end the current state party role  played by the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], which has  been corrupt, antipatriotic, and arbitrary. The uprising  revealed the existence of an obsolete and anachronistic regime.  It also showed an unpopular and isolated president (Salinas de  Gortari) who is aware of his illegitimate origin, who went from  a state of inaction to a state of meaningless and useless  action. The uprising awoke Mexican awareness. It is an  extremely painful experience due to the people who died, the  wounds it caused to the country's society, the abuses committed.  The executions, the common graves, the cases of torture could  have and should have been avoided by the government by means of  political leadership aware of its current and future military  and human duties.    [Lameirinhas] Did the demonstrations in Mexico City  demanding equal electoral and political opportunities by any  means spark the Chiapas uprising?    [Cardenas] The Chiapas uprising took place within a context  in which civilian society had been demanding, for the past five  years, a transition toward democracy and political reform. We  have asserted that the lack of political reforms and reliable  elections under Salinas' regime is unsustainable. These  demands, repeatedly made by the Mexican Armed Forces, are what  had been heard since the 1 January uprising.    [Lameirinhas] What is your party's stance regarding the  uprising?    [Cardenas] We want a peaceful, rewarding, and fair solution  for Chiapas, that is, a deep-rooted reform. We understand the  reasons that drove the indigenous communities to despair. They  were trapped by a deaf, blind, and despotic regime. Moreover,  we have effectively participated in the peaceful rebellion of  civilian society, which reasserted its choice for peace and  democracy and, at the same time, saved lives and avoided bigger  problems by getting the government to call a cease-fire and  start peace negotiations in the Chiapas region. The solutions  to the Chiapas problem have a national and foreign component.  It would be a mistake and risky to separate one from the other.  The local solution demands structural changes strongly linked  to the state and the region. This is not possible without  affecting unjust and illegitimate interests that have existed  for years. The communities must recover their rights and  assets. An exhaustive land reform is necessary, and the power  structure of the "bosses" must be changed so the people can have  the possibility of electing their own authorities. Moreover,  the great deficiencies in education, health, housing, and  highway services must be solved. Job opportunities and greater  equity in the trading of local products must be granted. The  privileges of large landowners must be eliminated. We favor  contributing to all forms of mobilization of the indigenous  groups and society in order to eliminate racism and the  depredation of natural resources.    [Lameirinhas] What does your party think about NAFTA?    [Cardenas] I want to make it clear that the PRD is not  against Mexico engaging in competition with the world market and  its participation in NAFTA. But it should be pointed out that  we need to assess the great impact this opening will have on the  agricultural sector and other productive sectors, especially the  micro, small, and medium enterprises that were not included in  the negotiations. We now must work on adapting to the new terms  of competition.    [Lameirinhas] The latest polls show you as the second most  popular candidate. Are these figures reliable?    [Cardenas] Polls in Mexico have never been very reliable  and, in the past, have been subject to manipulation. We also  have seen that people automatically answer that they will vote  for the official party in order to protect themselves from  possible retaliation by a repressive and authoritarian political  regime.    [Lameirinhas] Are there any chances of fraud in the August  elections?    [Cardenas] In order to guarantee the authenticity of the  elections, Congress must amend the 1990, '92, and '93  constitutional amendments that greatly distort the people's  choices. The PRD submitted a report on the 1994 electoral  process to the Federal Elections Institute General Council. The  report refers to the illegal aspects of the process based on:  first, discretionary control exercised by the government and  the PRI on the electoral organizations; second, control over the  right to vote through the partial manipulation of the voters  lists and registration of voters; third, unfair distribution and  discriminating control over resources supplied by the government  to the political parties; fourth, unfair access by opposition  parties and the PRI to the mass media, especially television;  and fifth, supervision of the electoral process, during all its  phases, by PRI and government authorities.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Overlapping radio messages between a pilot and air traffic controllers probably  led to a jet crash Feb. 28 in the Azores that killed all 144 people aboard,  Portuguese investigators said in Lisbon. They said that because of the  overlapping conversations, the pilot apparently descended to 2,000 feet when he  should have remained at 3,000. The American-chartered Boeing 707, filled with  Italian tourists on their way to the Caribbean, slammed into a fog-covered  mountain on the island of Santa Maria.  </P></p>

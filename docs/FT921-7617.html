			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Slack sales at Japanese breweries ASAHI Breweries and Sapporo Breweries, respectively Japan's second and third largest beer companies, posted small rises in parent company profits for 1991, due to slack beer sales. Since the success of Asahi's dry beer it has enjoyed a steady rise in sales, but the recent stagnation of the dry beer boom and the company's failure to introduce a new 'hit' beer stunted its earnings growth. Asahi's non-consolidated net profits rose 1.6 per cent to Y6.2bn (USDollars 48.4m), while pre-tax profits rose 1.2 per cent to Y17.4bn. Sales gained 1.1 per cent to Y739.1bn, and the annual dividend is being maintained at Y8 a share. Meanwhile, Sapporo Breweries' non-consolidated net profits edged ahead to Y4.07bn from Y4.01bn in 1990, although sales improved more than Asahi's with a rise of 8.2 per cent to Y533.29bn from Y492.63bn. Sapporo's pre-tax profits advanced 7.5 per cent to Y9.06bn from Y8.43bn and it is holding its annual dividend at Y5 per share. Asahi's beer sales, which account for 83.1 per cent of its total sales rose 2.8 per cent. Sales of its mainstay, Super Dry, fell 10 per cent and sales of its new 'Z' beer remained at 20m cases, failing to reach the original target of 30m. Asahi's problems started in 1990, when a premium-priced luxury beer launched by Kirin Brewery, the industry leader, arrived on the market. For the current year, Asahi expects a 0.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y17.5bn on an 8.2 per cent increase in sales. The company projects rising personnel, distribution and other costs, in addition to a deteriorating balance on financial items due to increased borrowings for plant and equipment investment which will squeeze profits. Sapporo expects a 10.6 per cent rise in parent net profits to Y4.5bn in 1992, on sales 6.9 per cent ahead at Y570bn.</p>

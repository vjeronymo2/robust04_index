			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah </F> by unidentified ETTELA'AT correspondent; date and place not  given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] One of the most  important issues in Lebanon and the Middle East is that of the  peace talks with the Zionist regime. How do you view the future  of these talks? What is Lebanon's role in these talks?    [Fadlallah] In my opinion, in Lebanon the dimensions of the  peace talks are far greater than in other countries because we  have factions that differ on the peace talks. There is a group  that accepts the concept of absolute peace and another group  rejects it in toto. Another group wishes to accept it  conditionally while yet another group wants to reject it if  there are any conditions. Thus, I believe that in Lebanon, any  cultural or political move on peace or other issues has far  greater consequences than in other countires.    As for the future of peace, the talks lack an element of  greatness and effectiveness which could culminate in some  definite outcome in the future. This is because the problems  between the Arabs and the Zionist regime have some difficult  conflicts that cannot be resolved in a year.    In any case, I do feel that the talks are moving toward  peace. This is because the regional and international  situations--with all they entail--exert pressure on all sides to  sign the peace accord. Of course, this pressure is directed more  toward the Arabs than Israel. The present political and  security situation in the region has endangered the interests of  the big governments, the United States in particular. [passage  omitted]    If the Arab and Islamic worlds were to wake up from their  prolonged slumber, it is possible that they could foil the U.S.  and Zionist plans, but the problem is that we do not see any  basic political revolution. What we see here is only political  talk or political plans. In fact, those who reject the peace  process do not have any definite or formulated program on how to  handle the various stages of the peace plan. Therefore what we  see are mere airy notions, slogans, plans and stances, most of  which have no relation to other stances and programs.    Thus, when we look at international realities and the  current  weakness in the Arab and Islamic world, as well as those who are  opposed to the talks, we conclude that in the course of one or  two years the talks will fall into the groove that was  envisioned for them. Many people believe that if the peace  talks do not yield any results by the end of 1994, they will be  postponed to after the U.S. elections, as the Americans usually  begin preparing for the next presidential elections two years  after a new president takes office. Meanwhile, the American Jews  will be able to take advantage of this opportunity to put the  necessary pressure on the talks, which will then halt these  talks. It is to the Zionists' advantage to keep the talks like  this and not to let them make any headway, but at the same time  they want to get whatever they want from the talks.    Lebanon does not have a fundamental role in these talks, as  it usually keeps in step with Syria with regard to relations  with the Zionist regime and on the subject of peace talks. It  is no secret that Lebanon's position is closely linked with the  Syrian stance. It is natural that this would prevent Lebanon  from falling into internal or external schemes for a separate  peace with the Zionist regime. This relationship between  Lebanon and Syria--even though it is considered to have some  weak points--has some positive aspects too.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you assess the latest events in Lebanon,  the revelation of those responsible for the bombing of Sayyidat  al- Najat Church, and the Lebanese Government's clash with the  Lebanese Forces led by Samir Ja'ja'? Is it expected that the  Lebanese Government will step up its confrontation with other  groups in Lebanon?    [Fadlallah] It is natural that there should be a U.S. plan  for Lebanon, namely, that the army take over the security bases  in Lebanon. This would enable it to exert political pressure.  The United States is seeking to do this with all its might. The  United States has chosen the Lebanese Army as a means to this  end.    It is not too farfetched to believe that on the domestic  level, there has been some sort of agreement with Syria. But  the Army's complete control or deployment is not as negative for  Lebanon as chaos and disarray would be harmful to it. But many  politicians believe that this Lebanese fear of chaos and  disarray may be misused to impose new restrictions in Lebanon,  which would not be in the interest of public freedom. We do see  such stances, which are opposed to freedom, in Lebanon.    In the newspapers, in the general political atmosphere, and  in some of the government sources in Lebanon, there is talk of  pressure on some groups, especially Hizballah. This is because  Hizballah is considered the representative of the opposition  forces, considered to be under Iran's support and orders. It is  the only armed group that still has its weapons, because its  weapons are used in the resistance of the occupation of south  Lebanon. This has prevented pressure from being exerted on it  by the Lebanese Government.    In the circumstances, the Lebanese Government will not  permit  the suppression of Hizballah or of the Islamic Resistance. This  is because the Islamic Resistance Movement has lawful local,  regional, and international reasons for existing and the  governments are forced to accept them. The Islamic Resistance  Movement is a popular movement that demands the withdrawal of  foreigners from these territories.    From this angle, the Lebanese Government, an ally of the  Syrian Government, cannot resort to crushing the Resistance,  because Syria would not agree. Any confrontation of the  Resistance by the Lebanese Government would also generate  problems, which could usher in a return to civil war in Lebanon.  Despite this and without resorting to tackling the issue of the  Islamic Resistance directly, the Lebanese Government will take  measures to implement some plans that would place Hizballah in a  position of weakness.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the role of the Islamic  Resistance in the south?    [Fadlallah] In my view, the Islamic Resistance Movement  enjoys freedom of action politically and militarily. But it may  encounter major difficulties if the talks achieve results and  peace with the Zionist regime. Then the conditions in the Arab  world will exert pressure on the Islamic Resistance. There  could be efforts to embroil the Islamic Resistance in  differences and internal dissent, just as we witnessed clashes  in the past between the Hizballah and Amal movements. The  Resistance will face greater hardships and problems but this  does not mean it will succumb to them. The Islamic Resistance  may have other choices in the resistance of the Zionist regime  and these may be different from those they have now.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the effect of the Gaza-Jericho  Accord and a regional economic accord between the Arab countries  and the Zionist regime on Iran, from the security and economic  point of view?    [Fadlallah] The Zionist regime is using the Gaza-Jericho  Accord as a gateway to the Arab world through the Palestinians.  The Zionist regime is using the Palestinians as a bridge to  link it with the Arab world by signing economic agreements.  This is why we see the Zionists giving greater importance to  talks on economic issues with the Palestinians, as their  objective is to gain economic influence in the Arab world and  the Middle East.    The U.S. role in this regard is to abolish the concept of  the "Arab world" so that it can create a strategic, political,  and economic region in the Middle East within an international  order which conforms to U.S. interests. It is for this reason  that the United States speaks of the Middle East and not of the  Arab world, and is considering using Turkey as a strong factor  in security, political, and economic transactions in the region.    I imagine that the future position of the Islamic Republic  of  Iran will be difficult as the United States is proposing to  embargo it unless it accepts U.S. conditions. In the U.S.  scheme of things, a toppling of the Islamic system is not  necessary, as long as it conforms to U.S. plans in the region  and retreats where U.S. policies are concerned. This is  something that Iran has not accepted so far.    Therefore, the current economic situation will exert greater  pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran as economic relations  increase. This will also be true from a security point of view.  Iran should be especially prepared, as this plan has some  dangerous elements. We have complete faith that the leadership  of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khamene'i, and  President Hashemi- Rafsanjani, will follow these developments  through the Supreme National Security Council or other bodies.  It is also the obligation of the Muslim Iranian people to ward  off these new plots -- that is the economic, security, and  political embargo by the United States -- and they should remain  steadfastly their leadership.

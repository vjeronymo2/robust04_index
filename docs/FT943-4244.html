			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: BCP tests Lisbon's sell-off policy - Judgment on the bid for BPA is due Portugal's government will decide within a few days on the most testing question it has encountered since it started to re-privatise the country's banks in 1989 - whether to block an attempt by the fifth largest bank to turn itself at a stroke into a dominant force. Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP), which has grown rapidly by concentrating on segments of the banking market, is making a hostile Es132bn (Dollars 825m) bid for 40 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), the biggest publicly-quoted Portuguese bank. The reaction of the government, which has been privatising BPA shares in tranches since 1990, reducing its holding to 24.5 per cent, is unpredictable. It is wary of appearing to halt the liberalisation of financial markets, yet it wants to protect orderly progress towards privatisation. A successful bid could determine the shape of the banking market, as a combined BCP/BPA group would hold 24 per cent of banking assets. Provided BCP's capital was not weakened by paying 2.4 times net asset value for BPA, it would form the most ambitious and tightly-managed Portuguese bank. Yet the outcome of the bid is not clear, even if sanctioned by the government. It depends on the reaction of 13 core shareholders who are industrialists in northern Portugal. Members of the self-styled Patriotic Front are insisting that the Es3,000 a share offer is too low. BCP's rationale for wanting to control BPA is simple. 'We want to grab a quasi-virgin customer base,' says one BCP senior manager. While BCP has sold a range of products such as life insurance, BPA has been slower to realise its potential. BCP, advised by Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, was formed by a group of BPA managers led by Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, its chairman. They believe they can adopt a similar strategy with BPA's 1.9m customers, thus raising BPA's return on assets and profitability. BCP managers believe that increased asset size will allow it to compete as an international bank. BCP also intends to release capital by selling BPA's stakes in industrial companies. Some of these stakes are in ventures by members of the shareholders' group. This is led by Sonae, the largest private sector industrial and distribution conglomerate, which holds about 6.5 per cent of BPA. The bid is not risk-free for BCP. It has built up strong capital and has been looking for an outlet since it failed in a bid last year to acquire 80 per cent of Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, Portugal's sixth biggest bank. A BPA purchase would leverage its capital and help to maintain returns. There are dangers. BCP's tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets would fall from 11.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent, leaving less of a margin to absorb any increase in non-performing loans. The bid turns on the reaction of core shareholders because the government intends to hold its 24.5 per cent stake, and a further 7.5 per cent is held by another shareholders' group organised by Credit Commercial de France. This means only another 40.5 per cent of equity is in play. BCP tried to turn the odds in its favour yesterday when it said its minimum acceptable stake would be 34.5 per cent. In public, the shareholders are sticking together. But this unity is under pressure. BCP has a history of acquiring minority stakes in banks at a high price, and then paying a lower one to mop up the remaining equity later. Supporters of BPA - which is being advised by Goldman Sachs and CCF - argue that this is unfair. Yet the core shareholders have a separate agenda. They have hired Union Bank of Switzerland to value BPA and its holdings, and plan to be more involved in management. BCP supporters argue that core shareholders have tolerated a passive BPA management in return for favourable treatment. BPA has lent money for projects such as a shopping and office complex in Lisbon being developed by Sonae. BPA argues such ventures provided good returns. BPA's managers say it has been held back by public ownership, but has embarked on reforms and technological changes which will bear fruit. Whatever the outcome of the bid, BPA will be a different bank by the time the dust settles.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / MPs condemn plan to restrict sea fishing THE government's controversial plans to restrict the number of days the fishing fleet can spend at sea are 'unnecessarily draconian' and should be abandoned, the Commons agriculture committee says today. The measures 'amount to little more than decommissioning on the cheap', it says in a report on the effects of conservation measures on the sea fishing industry. 'They carry the risk that the UK fleet will suffer a catastrophic financial implosion.' Instead of the measures, the committee proposes that each fishing boat be allocated an individual quota for types of fish its crew wish to catch. Fishermen would initially have to buy 'individual transferable quotas', possibly by government auction. 'The government could then intervene in the market by buying quotas to reduce fishing effort,' says the committee. 'Alternatively, as occurs in other quota systems, a percentage of each quota could be shaved off to reduce fishing effort.' The quotas could be traded, through the government or via a private-sector quota market, so that fishermen could buy extra quotas from colleagues to cover fish for which they did not have an allocation and which would otherwise have been thrown back into the sea. The restrictions, due to be introduced next January, affect all vessels over 10 metres. 'The government's position would have been far more defensible if it had only applied days-at-sea restrictions where an urgent need to protect defined stocks could unequivocally be demonstrated,' says the committee. The government is introducing the measures as part of its effort to cut fleet capacity by 19 per cent by 1996, under a European Community agreement to conserve over-exploited fish stocks. The government intends that the restrictions should achieve a capacity reduction of up to 8.5 per cent. The rest of the cuts would be obtained through a Pounds 25m programme of decommissioning and licensing controls on all fishing vessels. The committee, which took evidence from ministers, civil servants, fishermen's representatives, fish processors and retailers, and conservationists, describes the decommissioning scheme as 'half-hearted' and says more money should be made available. The committee, which is chaired by Sir Jerry Wiggin, Tory MP for Weston-super-Mare and a former junior agriculture minister, also argues for conservation measures such as larger mesh sizes for nets, so fewer young fish are caught. 'One of the most telling weaknesses' of the EC common fisheries policy is the discrepancy between member states' enforcement of conservation rules, the report says. The UK, for example, has 152 shore-based inspectors compared with only 12 for Spain, according to Euro-pean Commission estimates. It adds: 'Procedures must be improved to encourage openness and transparency in all member states' inspection arrangements, so that comparisons and judgments can be made between them.' Mrs Gillian Shephard, minister for agriculture and fisheries, welcomed the report saying it endorsed the need to conserve fish stocks, but any new measures would have to be accepted by the EC. She added that the industry had already rejected a proposal for transferable quotas.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POLICING THE SEAS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Shore-based      Inspection      Aircraft for                          inspectors     days at sea      surveillance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium                           3              30                 1 Denmark                         200             200                 0 France                           20             850                 0 Germany                          20             200                 0 Irish Rep                         7           1,000                 2 Netherlands                     180             100                 0 Portugal                         12             n/a                 3 Spain                            12             n/a                 0 UK                              152           2,500                 5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimates of existing resources and their utilisation.

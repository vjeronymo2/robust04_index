			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULD WOMEN PLAY BEST-OF-FIVE SETS?  </P> <P> Why is it that women finalists in the U.S. Open play three sets to the men's  five? Moreover, why do they get the same amount of winnings for less work? Come  on! Either play the same game or reduce the winnings proportionately. It's a  new concept called "equal pay for equal work."  </P> <P> JAMES L. RAHM, Chatsworth  </P></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Tory MP Names attack Lloyd's A GROUP of Tory back-benchers called yesterday for criminal proceedings 'if and where necessary' against any malpractice at the Lloyd's insurance market, David Owen and Richard Lapper write. The four MPs, three of whom are Names at Lloyd's, included Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West. They met Mr Neil Hamilton, a junior trade and industry minister, and urged independent regulation of Lloyd's. They also argued that the authorities at the market were failing to honour the Lloyd's Act because they were not looking after the interests of outside Names. Names are the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the market. The trade and industry department described Mr Hamilton's meeting with MPs and a subsequent meeting with Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, as 'essentially a listening exercise'. The MPs left Mr Hamilton with detailed questions about Lloyd's, and suggested that he put them to Mr Coleridge. Their questions covered Lloyd's brokerage charges and costs and the solvency of the market. They asked if the Lloyd's central fund was still adequate to cover all Lloyd's cashflow difficulties in the light of the forthcoming judicial review (being pursued by some Names). Mr Marland yesterday tabled a Commons early day motion alleging that professionals at Lloyd's had 'favoured themselves and their close relations' as well as other Lloyd's professionals by 'placing their own business on highly profitable and safe syndicates ahead of outside Names'. The motion mentions five leading professionals and notes that none is a member of any of the catastrophe reinsurance syndicates managed by such agencies as Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Devonshire and Rose Thompson Young. It says, however, that some of the five placed external Names on those syndicates. The five are Mr Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's and of the Sturge agency; Mr JM Donner, chairman of Donner Underwriting; Sir Peter Miller, chairman of Thomas R. Miller; Mr JP Tilling, chairman of Gravett and Tilling; and Mr Murray Lawrence, chairman of Murray Lawrence Members' Agency. SG Warburg, the merchant bank, confirmed yesterday that it had been appointed by Lloyd's to advise on 'narrow technical issues' arising from work under way on a plan to help Names hardest hit by recent losses. Warburg said yesterday that it was not playing a broad advisory role but would be assisting on an ad hoc basis. Lloyd's appointed the bank earlier this month. Mr Alan Lord, Lloyd's chief executive, announced at the end of April that it was examining the possibility of providing financial assistance to Names facing severe underwriting losses.</p>

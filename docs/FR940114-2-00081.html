In a companion study, male and female rats were fed 0, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 6 months and maintained on untreated feed for 11/2 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the conditions of these feed studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity1 of o-nitroanisole in male and female F344 rats that received diets containing 6,000 to 18,000 ppm for 6 months based on overall increased incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney, and benign and malignant neoplasms of the large intestine. There was a chemical-related increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats receiving diets containing 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 2 years. Marginally increased incidences of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms in male rats and forestomach neoplasms in male and female rats were considered uncertain findings. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increased severity of nephropathy in male rats, and increased incidences of focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and forestomach ulcers in male rats, and of transitional cell hyperplasia of the urinary bladder, focal hyperplasia of the forestomach, and hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis in male and female rats were associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Central Data Management at P.O.

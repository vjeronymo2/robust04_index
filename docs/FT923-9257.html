			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Wallace Smith Trust Collapse: Global labyrinth is explored - The long and twisting path of the merchant bank's connections A COMPLEX network of companies and family trusts centred in Canada and the UK has been uncovered as attempts are made to trace more than Pounds 100m of missing assets from the collapsed Wallace Smith merchant bank. KPMG Peat Marwick, the liquidator, which is suing the Royal Bank of Scotland and National Westminster Bank, is still trying to determine the extent of connections between Wallace Smith Holdings, the Canadian-registered company that received the transfers, and Wallace Smith Trust Company, to which the payments should allegedly have gone. Mr Nick Press, a US consultant who has been acting as chief operating officer of the Canadian-based Wallace Smith Group since June 1991, said that the Wallace Smith Canadian interests were organised in a complicated series of interlocked family trusts. He said he was brought in by one of the group directors to be 'a guardian of the gate' and that he was defending the Canadian company against litigation and making claims of its own against others. Wallace Smith Holdings, the subsidiary which received the disputed cash, is now Dundalk Investment Company, a subsidiary of Colchester Trust, which is in turn linked with other Wallace Smith trusts registered in Canada. The Wallace Smith Group is the parent of a string of subsidiaries, now mostly in liquidation, in the UK, US, Caribbean, Spain and Italy. The most important of these subsidiaries appears to have been the Wallace Smith Trust Company, which specialised in money market operations from its base in Winchester House, London Wall, in the City of London. The trust was closed last year amid allegations of fraud. Dundalk is listed as a creditor in the most recent published accounts of Herongrove and British Trusts Association, both UK subsidiaries of the Wallace Smith Group. The elusive nature of the relationship between the companies is shown in the auditors' reports in the accounts of several of the Wallace Smith Group's UK subsidiaries, which draw attention to 'professional advisory services to corporations controlled by a board of independent trustees of which a director was a minority trustee and a non-executive director'. The 1990 accounts for Wallace Smith Trust Group show that one of the directors within the group was paid more than Pounds 180,000 during the year, and a further five more than Pounds 90,000. Mr Smith, who is living in London and awaiting a court appearance on charges relating to a Serious Fraud Office investigation, was described by former employees as a quiet man. One former colleague said he had come from a family with Lithuanian origins which settled in the Alberta area of Canada. A former banker who had dealings with him said: 'When he was going to speak he would pause. He takes a long time to say anything.' Mr Smith spent much of his early career with Nesbitt Thomson, a Canadian broking company. He pioneered a UK arm of the company before breaking away in the early 1970s to set up another Canadian based company called McDunn Silcox. In recent years the group's most active companies in Canada were Wallace Smith Securities and Wallace Smith &amp; Co. The former specialised in trading Canadian securities. Most of the business of Wallace Smith &amp; Co was in the US, largely in the Euro-Canadian and foreign currency markets. Mr Press said that none of the Wallace Smith companies in Canada was actively trading. He said that business dried up last summer after the UK liquidation. According to Mr Press the UK liquidators petitioned a UK court a year ago to wind up two of the key Canadian companies, Wallace Smith Group and Wallace Smith &amp; Co. The petition was dismissed earlier this year. Mr Press said the Canadian group was suing Peat Marwick for between Pounds 5m and Pounds 7m, mainly for 'interruption of business'. In addition, Wallace Smith &amp; Co has a creditor claim of Pounds 1.2m against Wallace Smith Trust Group in the UK. Mr Smith's involvement as chairman of Wallace Smith Group Ltd in Canada, and director of some of the other companies, was severed the day after the British fraud authorities entered the company in April 1991. Garstangs, Mr Smith's Bolton-based solicitor, rejected suggestions in yesterday's Financial Times that its client enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle. The firm said last night that Mr Smith had made a successful application for legal aid to defend the criminal proceedings against him and denied that he had owned property in Chelsea and the Bahamas. Garstangs added that Mr Smith denied any dishonesty or fraudulent trading and was strenuously defending the proceedings against him.</p>

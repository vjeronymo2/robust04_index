			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Corrected Rule Reference <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 establishes that, in the event of a consolidation or reorganization of offices within the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), the OAC rules which now apply to the Division of Reclamation shall apply to and be the rules of any other Division or office which succeeds the Division of Reclamation as the administering agency for Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1513. Ohio is revising this rule to expand the specific references to the Division of Reclamation's rules to cover additional rules adopted by Ohio since OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 was first promulgated. There is no counterpart Federal rule. However, the Director finds that this revision will not render the Ohio program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Availability of Records <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ohio is revising OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10 paragraph (B)(2) to provide additional ways that members of the public may review Ohio's permit, inspection, and enforcement documents. Ohio is proposing that local district offices of the ODNR, Division of Reclamation, shall maintain copies of all documents pertaining to both existing and proposed mining operations within their jurisdiction, or post for public inspection a description of the information available for mailing and a procedure for obtaining such information. If Ohio does not maintain a district office in the specific county of the existing or proposed mining operation, Ohio shall either: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Make copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, and other subject information available for public inspection at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Post, at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the SCS, a description of the documents available for inspection and the procedure by which members of the public may request copies of these documents. At its own expense, Ohio shall promptly provide copies of documents by mail upon request of any resident of the area of the mining operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The counterpart Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.14(c) provides that the regulatory authority shall make copies of these documents available for public inspection or maintain a description of the information available for mailing and the procedure for obtaining such information at a Federal, State or local government office in the county where mining is occurring or proposed to occur. The proposed rule provides Ohio with options for meeting the obligation to make permitting documents available to the public in the county where mining is occurring or proposed to occur. The Director, therefore, finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than 30 CFR 840.14(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio has designed a public notice on availability of documents which Ohio would post at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the SCS as specified in OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10(B)(2)(b). This proposed notice clarifies that public comments on applicable permitting, inspection, enforcement, and regulatory documents shall also be available for public inspection and copying. Ohio is also listing in the public notice the counties which are under the jurisdiction of each of its five coal-regulatory district offices. The Director finds that the proposed notice satisfies the requirements of and is no less effective than 30 CFR 840.14(c)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. The Ohio Historic Preservation Office provided comments in support of the proposed amendment. No other public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

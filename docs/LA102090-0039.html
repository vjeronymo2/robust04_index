			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRS SEIZES PROPERTY FROM ALLEGED PORNO  KINGPIN  </P> <P> About $800,000 worth of artworks and other property has been seized from the  Van Nuys home of alleged pornography kingpin Reuben Sturman to help pay off his  $4.9-million tax bill, the Internal Revenue Service said Friday.  </P> <P> The property was taken Thursday from Sturman's sprawling home in the 13900  block of Weddington Street and will be sold at a public auction to pay the back  taxes, said Patricia Hudak, IRS assistant public affairs officer in Cleveland.  </P> <P> The IRS has also placed a tax lien against the football-field-sized property,  which is surrounded by a 5-foot fence.  </P> <P> Sturman was convicted in Cleveland last November of violating banking  requirements, conspiracy and tax fraud after an investigation by the IRS that  involved proceeds from an alleged pornography distribution empire. He was  sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $2.46 million, but remains free on  $1-million bail while appealing the conviction. He could not be reached for  comment.  </P></p>

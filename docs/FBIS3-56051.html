Talking with a UNIAN correspondent, he  pointed out that future negotiations testified to the fact that  Ukraine was recognized as a partner possessing equal rights.  The fact that negotiations were being held, in Volodymyr  Klymchuk's view, means that the United States and Russia agree  to make concessions, and it is quite possible that a decision  will be made that will be favorable for Ukraine. "Anyway,  political trading is better than war," the LDPU chairman said.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Granite state's voters warm to domestic issues: Prospects for Democrats and Republicans in today's New Hampshire primary ALL EYES turn to New Hampshire today as the granite state, so often the graveyard of presidential ambitions, holds the first primary election of the 1992 campaign. The results of the Democratic and Republican races are eagerly expected, not just because voters will deliver their verdict on President George Bush's three years in office. In a broader sense, New Hampshire marks the start of a landmark election - the first of the post-Cold War era, now that anti-communism, which has defined the political terrain in every US election since 1948, has seen its enemy vanquished in its own citadel. Domestic issues - primarily whether the US economy can produce a higher standard of living for future generations of Americans - have become paramount. Thus the performance of each candidate will show how voters rate their prescriptions on matters ranging from trade, industrial policy, tax cuts and health care. For Mr Bush, the stakes are high. Having looked invincible six months ago, he has appeared defensive, waiting like Mr Micawber for something to turn up to suggest an economic recovery. In New Hampshire, where voters are more conservative than elsewhere in the US, the president faces an unpredictable challenge from Mr Patrick Buchanan, the right-wing television commentator and former speech writer for presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. A strong showing by Mr Buchanan would increase the impression that Mr Bush is vulnerable, if not beatable, in the November general election. New Hampshire should be fertile ground for a protest vote. In three years, the state has gone from boom to bust: unemployment has tripled; bankruptcies have increased five-fold; the empty shopping malls which line the highways are a testimony to the over-building and speculation which characterised the 1980s. Mr Buchanan is counting on holding the president's support to something less than 60 per cent of the Republican vote, with his own candidacy locking on to more than 33 per cent. 'Anything less than a 2-1 margin for Bush is a win for us,' says Mr Frank Luntz, the young, bearded, Oxford-educated pollster for Mr Buchanan. 'It will allow us to raise the money to fight on in the south.' This prospect of civil war within the Republican party may not match the historic split forced by right-wing Senator Barry Goldwater when he took on liberal governor Mr Nelson Rockefeller of New York in the early 1960s. But it may herald the crack-up of the coalition forged by Mr Richard Nixon and Mr Ronald Reagan which led to five Republican victories in the last six presidential elections. The question is whether the current crop of Democratic candidates can present a credible alternative to Mr Bush, making a national leader who could appeal to the blue-collar workers and suburban middle-class voters who deserted the Democratic party in the 1970s and 1980s. During this period it was dominated by liberal factions more interested in catering to minorities and heavy public spending. On Sunday night, all five Democratic contenders showed off their wares in a strangely subdued debate. Former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, the front-runner, sounded more like a Republican with his proposals for relaxing anti-trust law, and support of free trade and a capital gains tax cut. But Mr Tsongas is a little too pious and self-conscious about his rise from obscurity. 'Anti-charisma only gets you so far,' says Mr Michael Barone, a political commentator. Mr Tongas has benefited from Governor Bill Clinton's troubles. Mercifully, the Arkansas governor was not asked about charges of draft dodging during the Vietnam war; but he needs at least a good second place in New Hampshire to carry on the fight in his native south. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the Japan-bashing liberal, would cut the US defence budget by 50 per cent in the next 10 years and introduce a Franklin Roosevelt-style public works programme. Whether voters buy the meeker version produced on Sunday night will depend on his closest rival for third place, or better, Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska. Mr Kerrey, Mr Harkin and their fellow Democratic candidate, California's Governor Jerry Brown, were yesterday criss-crossing the state, hoping for a last-minute shift in their favour and vowing that no matter what happened on Tuesday, they were in the race until the end. Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic party, says he expects the Democratic presidential nominee to emerge from the present field and plays down the chance of a late entry by an outsider such as Governor Mario Cuomo of New York. Judging by the thinly-attended 'draft Cuomo' event on Sunday night in Manchester he may be right. The risk is that New Hampshire will not offer a decisive result for the Democrats. But there are signs that the candidates are starting a coherent attack on the past 11 years of Republican control of the White House, when the US tripled its national debt, turned from being the world's largest creditor nation to the largest debtor, and saw its schools, inner cities and infrastructure crumble. However different their prescriptions, both Mr Buchanan and the Democratic candidates believe they can make a good case against Mr Bush, the guardian of the status quo. New Hampshire will offer the first clue as to whether they are correct, or whether the powers of incumbency will prove too formidable.</p>

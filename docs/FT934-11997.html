			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Union Carbide held back in quarter UNION Carbide's profit recovery remained stalled in the third quarter as the weak international economy and overcapacity continued to hold down demand for its main chemical products. The company, which three months ago said it was stepping up the pace of a three-year old cost-cutting programme, recorded net income of Dollars 36m, or 23 cents a share. Although an improvement on the Dollars 20m, or 14 cents a share, in the same period in 1992, the figure was down from Dollars 41m, or 14 cents a share, in the second three months of this year. Union Carbide also announced an organisational shake-up yesterday, scrapping its four operating divisions and creating nine new business units which will each report directly to Mr William Joyce, president and chief operating officer. 'Fewer layers of management and staff consolidation will help us reduce costs and speed up strategic and operations decision-making in our businesses,' said Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman and chief executive. Sales volumes had fallen 5 per cent in the third quarter compared with the previous three months, said Mr Kennedy. 'Prices for our most cyclical products - polyester glycol, antifreeze glycol and polyethylene - remain at historic low levels,' he added. Sales in the quarter, at Dollars 1.13bn, were down from Dollars 1.24bn previously. A Dollars 30m after-tax gain from the sale of the company's organo-silicon business was wiped out by a Dollars 30m after-tax charge from the shutdown of a manufacturing plant in Canada. Akzo, the Dutch group, and AlliedSignal of the US have agreed to set up a joint European carpet fibre venture, Reuters reports. Under the previously announced deal the two companies will bring their European interests together in a new company which will be majority owned and managed by AlliedSignal.</p>

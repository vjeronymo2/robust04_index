			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Opera house sounds note of change: A number of building developments are about to boost Edinburgh's economy When the curtain rises this afternoon on a gala performance of Tristan und Isolde at the new Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, the event will have more than theatrical significance. Nearly half a century after people first began to campaign for it, Edinburgh has finally created an opera house. But its opening is only the most spectacular of a number of developments which will strengthen the city's economy and demonstrate that it has finally shaken off the complacency and self-deprecation that previously obstructed progress. 'There's been a huge change of mood,' says Mr David Nicolson, president of the city's chamber of commerce and local managing partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants. 'I've lived here all my life, and what's happening is dramatic.' As well as the new theatre, Edinburgh will next year finish a long-postponed project to build a Pounds 30m conference centre that will seat 1,200 people. This summer a Pounds 37m scheme to rebuild and expand Murrayfield rugby stadium will be concluded, largely financed by debentures sold to rugby supporters. Much of the financial community has moved or is moving into larger new office buildings, filling long-standing gap sites near the city centre - but unfortunately leaving the Georgian Charlotte Square half empty. Some are moving from the centre to the city's western fringe, and much of the Scottish Office is moving to former dock land in Leith. The change in attitude began cautiously in the mid-1980s, with a crucial role being played by Edinburgh District Council, which came under the control of a group of Labour party pragmatists. It reversed past opposition to fostering the financial sector, Edinburgh's biggest employer, began issuing planning consents more freely and organised schemes to develop its own considerable land holdings in the city. Mr Nicolson believes a pivotal role in speeding the city's development has been played by Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise (LEEL), the local enterprise company formed in 1991 after the break-up of the Scottish Development Agency. LEEL marshalled the energies of Edinburgh district and Lothian regional councils and applied funds from its substantial budget to push through the difficult projects. 'The most important thing was that LEEL decided that the Festival Theatre and the conference centre were going to happen,' says Mr Nicolson. 'For years people had always found reasons for not doing them.' LEEL has led the Festival Theatre project, encouraging the district council to purchase the defunct Empire Theatre. This has been converted, at a cost of Pounds 22m, into a modern opera house that would have cost Pounds 50m to build from scratch and has a stage bigger than Covent Garden's in London. Other money came from LEEL, public-sector bodies including Lothian region and the Scottish Tourist Board, while the private sector has raised Pounds 4m. Will the theatre succeed, and has Edinburgh really changed? Lord Younger, former defence secretary and chairman of the Festival Theatre Trust, betrays a slight anxiety when he says: 'I'll be fully convinced only when I see Edinburgh people turning out for a performance on a cold mid-week February night.' Another Pounds 2m is needed from private-sector businesses and individual donors - the latter have already contributed more than Pounds 700,000. 'The list of donors is impressive,' says Mr Nicolson, 'but if you examine it closely you will see gaps.' While leading Edinburgh businesses such as Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland and United Distillers are large contributors, only three of the five Edinburgh-based life assurance companies feature in the list. 'I can't understand why some companies are not more supportive when they see the benefits these projects are bringing the city,' says Mr Nicolson.</p>

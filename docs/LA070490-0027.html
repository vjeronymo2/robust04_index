			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> PANEL BACKS CHANGE IN ADOPTION RECORDS  </P> <P> The state Senate's Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would strip the  confidentiality from California adoption records, revealing the identity of  thousands of parents who relinquished their children before 1984. The bill,  passed on a bipartisan 6-0 vote, would make original birth certificates and  court records open to the inspection of adoptees and their adoptive parents and  require the state Department of Social Services to release information on the  marriages and married names of the birth parents.  </P> <P> Birth parents would gain access to the amended birth certificate and other  records showing the names and addresses of the adoptive parents. The records  would only be available after the adoptees reached age 18. The bill includes a  provision requiring the state to conduct a yearlong advertising campaign  warning birth parents and adoptees to contact the state if they want to shield  their identity.  </P></p>

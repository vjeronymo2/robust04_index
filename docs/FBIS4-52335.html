			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikkei reporters Hiroyuki Maeda, Kenichi </F> Kawahara]    [Text] An increasing number of financial institutions seek  to dispose of bad loans through court-administered auctions.  This is because they have concluded that there is no other  method but to use the auction system in disposing of collateral  real estate where claims concerning the property present a legal  entanglement. However, the recession in real estate markets has  made buyers very reluctant to make offers. The Ministry of  Finance intends to authorize financial institutions to establish  subsidiaries for the purpose of placing winning bids for  properties to facilitate the disposition of bad loans through  auctions, but in the final analysis, subsidiaries will  eventually face the need to dispose of the collateral real  estate, which means that fundamental resolution of the bad loan  issue will be extended into the distant future.    Increasing applications for auctions by financial  institutions are apparent in the Tokyo area. According to a  survey by the Tokyo District Court, applications in Tokyo's 23  wards in 1993 totaled 5,543 cases, the highest on record. The  Tokyo District Court states, "Most of the increase came as a  result of applications from financial institutions." And, a  source at a trust bank comments, "Increasing numbers of  applications are from leading banks, which would have been  unthinkable in the past."    Banks have the option of disposing of bad loans  collateralized with real estate by transferring them to the  Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company, but that option requires  the consent of all creditors when there is more than one.  Accordingly, when claims present a complex situation, auctions  are an effective method of disposal.    However, in reality, in contrast to the sharp increase in  applications for auctions, progress in the disposal of bad loans  through auctions is extremely slow.    One credit union in Tokyo applied to the Tokyo District  Court  for auction of a building owned by an import-export firm in  Daito ward in the winter of 1992. The credit union had issued a  loan of 350 million yen and held a third-lien mortgage. The  credit union had expected that "some real estate firm would  promptly place a winning bid for the property and that losses  would be minimal," because it good-quality property located near  JR [Japan Railways] Okachimachi Station, but no buyer has been  found despite three auctions and 18 months after the initial  application, the property is undergoing additional auctions.    The minimum acceptable bid for the first auction was set at  2.5 billion yen, but the current value has dropped by 20-30  percent and the credit union is resigned to a situation where  "We would be happy if we could recover 100 million yen." And, it  is said that mortgagers such as credit associations with  lower-ranking liens "will not be able recover even a penny."    A total of five financial institutions such as city banks,  credit unions, and credit associations had loaned 4.5 billion  yen to this export-import firm. The company-owned building which  was used as collateral had a market value of about 5 billion  yen. No buyers exist, even with the price atl less than half of  the collateralized value, thus demonstrating why the bad loan  issue cannot be readily resolved even through the use of  auctions.    Another problem is that applications exceed court capacity.  An increase in the number of applications for auctions results  in a lengthy wait for the initial auction and there is a dearth  of developers willing to place winning bids. The result is a  lengthy process from auction application filings to receipt of  actual winning bids and recovery of loans. A source at one city  financial institution complains, "Not one bid has been received  for properties placed on auction during fiscal year 1993."  Moreover, the situation is such that hardly any of the  properties placed for auction in fiscal year 1992 and into the  second year have been sold.    District courts in Tokyo and Osaka have increased staffing  substantially in fiscal year 1994 to cope with the situation.  However, since applications for auctions are expected to  increase in the future, there is skepticism about any potential  for faster processing of applications.    Even in the case of auctions, which are generally considered  as having the potential to dispose of all claims, there are  aspects which are not covered by law. When a property is being  leased and is the subject of a winning bid, the current lessee  need not vacate the property for three years in the case of a  building and for five years in the case of land. Recently, there  has been an increase in the number of cases where that right is  abused. Mortgagees who learn of moves by the financial  institutions to auction collateral property sign leases with  friends and interfere with auctions using the lessee rights as a  legal basis. Such situations pose a nuisance to any developer  who hopes to place a winning bid.    Here is a sample case taking place in "T" city in the Tokyo  metropolitan area. An unknown individual built a shanty and is  exercising squatter's rights on a piece of land within the city  that a bank was about to place on the auction block. When bank  officials inspected the land, the squatter insisted that he had  a lease and refused to move. The bank auctioned the land despite  his presence, but developers hesitated to place bids because  large parcels involve carrying costs if they cannot be resold  expeditiously. Since the probability is high that the lessee  will exercise squatter's rights even after the lease expires,  any party placing a winning bid would need to undertake legal  removal proceedings, which means that a buyer will be difficult  to find.    Some properties that fail to sell at auction are being  disposed of by the filing of winning bids by affiliated or dummy  firms set up by financial institutions, using funds from the  parent institution.    The Tokyo District Court concludes that, "for the most part,  properties exceeding 100 million yen in value are subject to the  `sole-bidder process.'" The procedure symbolizes the banking  industry's dilemma of having no choice but to amortize bad loans  in the absence of buyers.</p>

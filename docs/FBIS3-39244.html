On the eve of the  meeting Felipe Gonzalez and Generalitat [Basque autonomous  government] Premier Jordi Pujol will be holding in order to  examine the turnabout in autonomy demanded by Catalonia, other  "fast track" autonomous communities have reacted by demanding a  new boost to autonomy. This is the case with the governments of  Navarre, Andalusia, and Galicia, which are demanding new  responsibilities, in some cases going beyond the autonomy  statutes themselves.    The finishing touch to this scene will be provided by  Galician Xunta [autonomous government] Premier Manuel Fraga, who  will meet with Gonzalez Thursday [3 February] in order to  present to him his single administration plan. The situation  worries the government, which lacks a clear stance on the new  autonomy avalanche.    The announced meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol to discuss  the turnabout in autonomy in Catalonia and the central  government's decision to transfer a package of 20 areas of  responsibility to the Basque government has encouraged other  "fast track" autonomous communities to demand another boost.  Last week, the government of Navarre, whose premier is Juan  Cruz Alli of the Navarrese People's Union (UPN), sent the  government a document in which it proposed the reopening of  bilateral negotiations to give its community new  responsibilities. Navarre's list of demands recalls the most  substantial part of the package of responsibilities demanded by  the Basque government. The transfers demanded by Alli include  official credit, the Social Security funding system, the  National Employment Institute, and the means of the  administration of justice. A spokesman for the Navarre  government told this newspaper that the responsibilities  demanded "are contained in the improvement of the fuero  [regional law code]."    The letter sent by the Navarrese government coincided with  the visit to Felipe Gonzalez by Socialist Manuel Chaves, the  premier of the Andalusian junta. The autonomy responsibilities  demanded by Chaves, who is pressured by imminent elections,  recall some of the proposals that Pujol announced he will submit  to Gonzalez at their next meeting. They include public health  funding, the coastline, and the reform of the state's peripheral  administration.    But the finishing touch is provided this week by Galician  Xunta Premier Manuel Fraga, with his meeting with Gonzalez next  Thursday. Although the meeting's purpose is the European  surcharge on the milk quota, Fraga will explain to Gonzalez his  single administration proposal. According to a Xunta spokesman,  the single administration plan -- a drastic reduction of the  state's peripheral administration, with the abolition of civil  governors and the concentration of power in the autonomous  governments -- "is virtually complete."    To this move that has emerged among the "fast track"  autonomous communities must be added the move by a "slow track"  community such as Aragon, whose premier, Socialist Jose Marco,  has announced the completion of the reform of the autonomy  statute for April.    The new situation that has been created worries the  government, which, two years after the signing of the autonomy  pacts -- which place the "slow track" communities almost on a  par with the "fast track" communities and whose process of  transfers is taking place now -- is seeing the autonomy process  being reopened by the "fast track" autonomous communities  without there being a clear stance laid down by the government.    Over the past few years, the government has expressed its  concern at the "fast track" communities' persistence in making a  normal procedure out of an exceptional procedure, such as  delegating exclusive state responsibilities to the autonomous  communities contained in Article 150.2 of the Constitution. The  current demands of the Basque, Navarrese, and Galician  governments have recourse to this procedure, which in the  opinion of government sources goes beyond the autonomy statutes.    Last week, Socialist Manuel Chaves made some points after  meeting with Gonzalez. He condemned effecting the autonomy  process by boosting one or several communities, and demanded a  "harmonious and balanced process" involving all of them. He  advocates setting up a conference of the 17 autonomous  government premiers as a way to organize the autonomy process, a  proposal which has been repeatedly delayed by the premiers of  Catalonia and the Basque Country, who are in favor of a  bilateral relationship with the central government.    The government has not yet commented on the new boost for  autonomy. A government spokesman transferred the responsibility  for the debate to the Spanish Socialist Workers Party Congress  in mid-March. On that occasion, a report from the Basque  Socialists suggesting an individual autonomy strategy with  respect to the nationalist parties and proposing making progress  in the complicated problem being created between each autonomous  community's singularity and the balance between all of them will  be debated.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (20): Household names among the fallen - Tom Burns discusses the poor showing of a country that has grown faster than the European Community's average for the better part of a decade / Spain THE SPANISH presence in the FT500 gives an adequate representation of the domestic corporate profile. There are few big Spanish companies and they are uniformly orientated towards the services sector. The FT500 includes just 21 companies in 1992, 10 fewer than in the previous year. It is a poor showing for a society that has one of the larger GDPs in western Europe as well as one that has grown faster than the European Community's average for the better part of a decade. Of the 21 companies present all save three - the state-controlled electrical utility Endesa, the similarly publicly-owned Banco Exterior and energy group Compania Espanola de Petroleos, Cepsa, - are lower in the rankings than they were in the 1991 FT500. Only six companies appear in the first 100, with the national telecommunications company Telefonica heading the list and ranked 47, and eight appear in the second half of the list. There are 13 departures from the list of which three make a reappearance as part of a merged group. This is the case of Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano which have come together as the Banco Central Hispanoamericano, BCH, to form Spain's largest banking institution. It says a good deal about the size of domestic banks that the BCH should be ranked 92 in the FT500. The Barcelona-based natural gas distributor Catalana de Gas also drops out of the list but it reappears as part of Gas Natural. This company, significantly ranked a lowly 200, is the result of the merger between the gas divisions of the state-owned energy group Repsol, of Gas Madrid and of Catalana de Gas. The only Spanish entrant to the FT500 that can be properly considered a new one is the retail group Centros Comerciales Pryca which is ranked 191. Pryca, which has a market capitalisation of Dollars 2.3bn, is, however, Spanish only up to a somewhat marginal point. More than 70 per cent of its stock is controlled by the French hypermarket giant Carrefour. Departures from the list include a string of companies that are household names in Spain. This is the case with the largest national insurance group Mapfre and with the twin giants of the domestic real estate market, Vallehermoso, which is controlled by BCH, and of Metrovacesa which is a subsidiary of the rival big bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV. Also out of the 1992 FT500 was Corporacin Financiera Alba, Spain's biggest private holding company which is owned by the March family. One of Alba's main income earners is the 10 per cent stake it holds in the Pryca hypermarket venture. Likewise squeezed out was Ebro Agricolas, the sugar and rice producer that has been one of the few profitable investments undertaken by the Kuwait Investment Office, KIO, in Spain and which is the largest domestic agri-business company. Aside from their comparatively small size and their lowered weighting, the main distinctive feature of the Spanish companies in the FT500 is that with the exception of the state-owned tobacco producer Tabacalera not one of them is involved in a non-energy manufacturing process. The business of the big Spanish corporations has to do with finance, with utilities and with services in general. Seven of the Spanish companies that appear on the list, a full third of the total domestic contingent, are in fact banks. A further five are electrical utilities and three are energy-based corporations. The others are Telefonica, Tabacalera, Pryca, the construction company Fomento de Construcciones, the Barcelona-based water utility holding Aguas de Barcelona and the highway toll-concession holder Autopistas, Acesa. An additional feature is that seven of the 21 companies on the list are state-controlled and a trio of publicly-owned companies, Telefonica, the electrical utility Endesa and the Repsol energy corporation are the highest ranked Spain representatives on the FT500. The poor Spanish showing is a reflection of the huge foreign penetration of domestic business. Non-Spanish companies, for example, control all the domestic car sector and some 75 per cent of the large components and accessories business that has grown up around it, eight of the top 10 domestic chemical companies and some 60 per cent of the domestic cement sector. Some of those Spanish companies that appear in the FT500 are likely in the future to see their weighting reduced. This could be the case with Telefonica for in 1991 just 1 per cent of its revenues came from business that was open to competition while by 1994 this proportion will have risen to 34 per cent due to deregulation. It could also be the case for the electrical utilities, likewise blue-chip Spanish companies, which have in the past weeks been nursing the impact of the peseta's devaluation on their borrowings.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                      BIGGEST PROFIT INCREASES: UK  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                             UK500    % Profit     Company                             Sr  Rank     increase  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1   Hartstone Group                    512   272       874.1 2   Howden Group                       561   379       505.7 3   Racal Electronics                  551   109       354.7 4   Airtours                           301   257       336.2 5   St James's Place Capital           122   262       327.9 6   Medeva                             433   198       316.8 7   Peel Holdings                      161   344       182.6 8   Burton Group                       491   185       170.1 9   Storehouse                         491   150       154.8 10  Frogmore Estates                   161   402       147.1 11  Kleinwort Benson Group             121   201       141.0 12  MFI Furniture Group                406   139       136.4 13  Next                               491   203       130.2 14  Tiphook                            303   229       129.9 15  Pentland Group                     171   168       123.9 16  British Airways                    301    49       119.2 17  Property Sec Invst Tst             161   377       118.0 18  Barratt Developments               614   351       110.7 19  HSBC Holdings                      112    10       107.1 20  Owners Abroad Group                406   392       106.7 21  Bryant Group                       614   255        97.1 22  Norweb                             221   134        96.2 23  Logica                             551   380        92.1 24  Transfer Technology Group          552   458        87.2 25  Hogg Robinson                      306   358        85.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------                       BIGGEST PROFIT DECREASES: UK*  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                             UK500    % Profit     Company                             Sr  Rank     decrease  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1   Commercial Union                   151    45     -4673.3 2   Costain Group                      613   495     -1358.2 3   Amstrad                            551   317      -451.9 4   Ansbacher (Henry) Holdings         121   499      -434.6 5   Laing (John)                       613   319      -424.9 6   Asda Group                         493   133      -316.8 7   Stakis                             461   451      -254.8 8   Astec (BSR)                        551   425      -220.7 9   Wimpey (George)                    613   227      -137.2 10  British Steel                      633    90      -121.7 11  British Aerospace                  523   173      -121.5 12  Amec                               613   333      -115.6 13  TSB Group                          112    54      -115.1 14  Vickers                            566   248      -112.8 15  Taylor Woodrow                     613   245      -103.2 16  Lex Service                        571   289       -94.5 17  BET                                171   103       -91.5 18  Mowlem (John)                      613   478       -91.2 19  Avon Rubber                        574   413       -90.9 20  Tarmac                             613   163       -89.0 21  Allied-Lyons                       421    24       -87.3 22  Christies International            495   300       -85.2 23  Legal &amp; General Group              141    64       -83.5 24  National Westminster Bank          112    21       -78.2 25  Royal Bank of Scotland Group       112    84       -78.0  -------------------------------------------------------------------- * Where percentage profit decreases exceed 100 per cent, these represent a change from profit to loss  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

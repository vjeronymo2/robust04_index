			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed L.M.: "Cheaper and Faster Production Through </F> Communications"]    [Text] Concurrent engineering supported by a technical data  management [TDM] system reduces expenditure and shortens  "time-to-market." Two leading electronics firms, Bull and  Sextant Avionique, bear witness to its advantages.    Today, most industrial strategy advisers recommend that  firms  implement concurrent engineering. This is probably why there  were so many TDM systems at the Productique 93 show, which was  held from 22 to 26 November at Paris-Nord Villepinte. This  software, supplied by Bull, IBM, Digital, and Win Technology,  allows the various sections of a company (design, methods,  production, sales) to communicate in real time and thus to be  able to work in parallel, which is the basis of concurrent  engineering. "TDM enables all those involved in the production  process to ratify each new stage of a project. The result is  that requests for technical modifications, particularly those  from the production department (which cost from 100 to 100,000  times more than in the development phase) are far less numerous.  The product therefore costs less and also comes onto the market  faster," explained Francois Ulff of Sherpa, a company  specializing in TDM, at a conference on the subject at  Productique 93. Bull, which both supplies a TDM product (called  Bull PDM) and uses such a product, estimates that the cost  saving can be up to 50 percent and that time-to-market can be  reduced by 75 percent. According to Sextant Avionique, which  has also acquired a TDM system, improved traceability is another  advantage of these systems: "To reduce our costs, we try, in  moving from one application to another, to reuse modules, and  TDM makes this easier as it allows us to store the entire  history of each module," explained the company's representative.  Although those present acknowledged that considerable  investment is required and that implementation takes time  because TDM involves all divisions of the company, they all  asserted that there is a rapid return on the investment. "After  around one year," they claim.</p>

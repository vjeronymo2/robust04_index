			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 5 May--In a telephone conversation with a  reporter from Polish Radio Three on Thursday, Zygmunt Wrzodak,  head of Solidarity in the Ursus tractor factory, said that one  should not hold talks with the present government but should  form strong structures attached to the Solidarity National  Commission, which will form an interim government in the future.    "The government has to be given an ultimatum: If it wants to  talk, then it should sit at the table and negotiate and fix some  dates for things to be solved. If not, then we have to remove  those people from the government and replace this government  with an interim one," he said.    According to Wrzodak, this is the opinion of a few people  from factory commissions in Mazowsze region, but the Solidarity  National Commission should make a decision. In his opinion, all  strikes should be clearly and properly coordinated.</p>

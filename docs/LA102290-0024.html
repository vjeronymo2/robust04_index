			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A SUBDUED SANTA ANA WARMS THINGS UP A BIT  </P> <P> The slightly cooler weather that came to San Diego Friday and Saturday  disappeared Sunday with the arrival of a weak Santa Ana that brought warmth and  sun.  </P> <P> A cold front late Thursday caused chilly nights, cloudy days and some gusting  winds in San Diego, but the front, which earlier in the week had dropped some  rain on the San Francisco Bay area, moved east out of the San Diego area late  Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.  </P> <P> The incoming Santa Ana, although weak and fleeting, raised Sunday's high  temperature downtown to 80 degrees, 6 above normal, and to 70 to 75 at the  beaches.  </P> <P> Other warm sites across the county Sunday included Spring Valley and Fallbrook,  90 degrees; Santee 88; Escondido, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Miramar, Poway, Vista  and the Wild Animal Park 87; Alpine and Chula Vista 85.  </P> <P> NWS forecaster Wilbur Shigehara predicted continued sunshine and days in the  high 70s through midweek, and clear and cool nights as the Santa Ana slowly  dissipates.  </P> <P> Today is expected to be sunny and warm, with a high of 79. Tuesday's forecast  calls for more sunshine and a high of 77.  </P> <P> Tonight and Tuesday night are expected to be clear and cool with a low  temperature of 57.  </P> <P> Hurricane Trudy south of Baja California will stir up the ocean surf slightly  near San Diego for the next few days, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> At the beaches, the weather is expected to be clear though Tuesday, with the  day temperature from 70 to 76 today, 69 to 73 Tuesday.  </P> <P> Ocean winds are expected to be from 8 to 16 m.p.h., and the ocean temperature  68 degrees, with the surf peaking at 4 feet at 10-second intervals, Shigehara  said.  </P> <P> In the coastal strip, the temperature will reach 77 to 84 Monday and 75 to 80  Tuesday, Shigehara said.

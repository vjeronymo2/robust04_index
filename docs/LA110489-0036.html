			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO NEWS FOR THE DEAF  </P> <P> After the Bay Area earthquake, television was accused of being slow to inform  viewers of what was transpiring in Northern California. If desperation was  suffered by viewers with hearing ability, think of the suffering of the deaf  and hearing-impaired viewers. At least the hearing were able to obtain snatches  of interviews and explanations.  </P> <P> Not one Times writer mentioned the situation of the deaf and hearing-impaired  viewers. No one seemed to give a thought to this significant portion of the  population.  </P> <P> The FCC, the television stations and the networks refuse to give the deaf and  hearing-impaired full access to the television media, even in cases of  emergency.  </P> <P> The technology is available and in the possession of the stations. They should  use it or lose their rights to broadcast. The airwaves belong to all the  people, not just those who can hear.  </P> <P> ABRAHAM GOTTFRIED, Century City  </P> <P> Spokesmen for several of the major television stations in Los Angeles said the  stations do not have the capability to broadcast captioned news in emergencies.  </P> <P> </P></p>

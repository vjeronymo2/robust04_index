			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> 8 TO RETURN PROFITS, PAY FINES TO SETTLE REVCO INSIDER CASE  </P> <P> Eight people have agreed to surrender profits and pay fines totaling $1.68  million for alleged insider trading in the stock of drugstore giant Revco D.S.  Inc., the Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday.  </P> <P> In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court, the SEC said Glenn  Golenberg, head of an investment firm that advised Revco management, told  outsiders that management was considering a debt-financed takeover of the  company before the public announcement of the proposed deal three years ago.  </P> <P> The information spread, with seven people or their clients eventually earning  $735,000 by trading in Revco stock, the SEC said.  </P> <P> It is illegal under federal securities laws to trade stocks on the basis of  non-public information.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Admission of Guilt  </P> <P> The SEC said Golenberg and the seven others accused in the case have agreed to  repay the illicit profits and nearly $1 million in fines without admitting or  denying guilt.  </P> <P> Revco, based in Twinsburg, Ohio, filed for bankruptcy protection last July  because it couldn't pay a $1.5-billion debt stemming from its management-led  takeover, a deal known as a leveraged buyout, that was financed mostly with  borrowed money. Revco became the first big LBO to run into such serious debt  trouble.  </P> <P> Golenberg is a member of Revco's board because of his stock holdings, amounting  to 150,000 Revco shares as of last May 28, said Kathleen Obert, a Revco  spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Golenberg agreed to pay a $470,000 penalty and consented to an SEC order  barring him from acting as a broker, dealer or investment adviser for at least  four years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'The Biggest Deal'  </P> <P> "Revco was the biggest deal of my life," he said in a statement after the SEC  filed the complaint. "It was constantly on my mind; something I lived and  breathed. Regrettably, I talked about it with a few people who did not have any  right to know what was going on. I now realize the seriousness of that lapse of  judgment."  </P> <P> The SEC also accused Golenberg of providing information to Steve S. Saltzman of  Cleveland about the proposed merger of two smaller firms, Magnetics  International Inc. and H.K. Porter Inc.  </P> <P> The commission said Saltzman made $6,850 buying and selling 2,000 shares of  Magnetics common stock and made $27,326 purchasing and selling Revco stock.  </P> <P> "I should have known better," Golenberg said of the portion of the complaint  dealing with Magnetics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Defendants  </P> <P> The other defendants accused of profiting from inside information about the  Revco buyout, are:  </P> <P> * Bernard Shavitz of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., a business associate of Golenberg.  The SEC said Shavitz made $214,000 buying and selling Revco stock and is asking  that Shavitz repay the money and pay a fine of $214,000.  </P> <P> * Van S. Weinberg of Memphis, Tenn., described as a friend of Golenberg.  Weinberg is accused of earning $65,000 trading Revco stock and leaking inside  information to the remaining defendants. The SEC required him to surrender the  profits and pay a $75,000 fine.  </P> <P> * Stephen Lightman of Memphis, accused of earning $215,218 trading Revco stock.  He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine.  </P> <P> * Lawrence S. Adler of Memphis, an account executive with the former E.F.  Hutton Group Inc., is accused of earning $38,188 for himself and $141,820 for  clients. He agreed to pay $180,008 in illicit profits and a $19,992 fine.  </P> <P> * Ray H. Dan of St. Louis is accused of making $31,000 trading Revco stock. He  agreed to repay the money and an equal fine.  </P> <P> * Carl D. Reiter of Germantown, Tenn., is accused by the SEC of making $2,625  with the inside information. He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine.  </P> <P> Obert declined to comment on the matter, saying "that's entirely between the  SEC and Mr. Golenberg." She said the company has prepared a five-year business  plan for reorganization but it has not been filed with the federal bankruptcy  court.  </P></p>

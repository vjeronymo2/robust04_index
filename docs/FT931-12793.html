			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water Yesterday's rights issue from Wessex Water is a reminder that privatised utilities are keen to broaden their horizons. As one of the tiddlers of the water sector, Wessex has more reason than most to escape the yoke of its regulated business. But the impulse is hardly unique; asking shareholders to fund non-core expansion with risk capital is the kind of strategy that pleases regulators. The market might reasonably wonder whether rights issues from other utilities are on the way. With the sector still not far below its high relative to the market - and the regulatory review of price limits due in 1994 - Wessex is right to see a window of opportunity to raise fresh equity. However buying into a growth business like waste management with the lowly rating of a utility poses a risk. Even allowing for cost savings and some cyclical recovery in land-fill prices, Wessex will have to work to justify yesterday's acquisition price. Without the benefit of cheap convertible funding put up by Waste Management International, the deal would look uncomfortably dilutive. With a relatively small core business and an ambitious partner in WMI, Wessex has at least a fighting chance of establishing some credentials as a growth stock. Its bigger rivals might be better advised to stick to debt.</p>

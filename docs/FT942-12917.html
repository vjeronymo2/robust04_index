			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Cyprus Amax encouraged Cyprus Amax Minerals, the biggest US mining group, yesterday produced 'encouraging results' for the first full quarter since it was formed from a merger in November last year. Earnings were Dollars 28m, or 25 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 588m, compared with Dollars 12m, or 24 cents, on revenues of Dollars 375m. Mr Milt Ward, chairman, said the group was well on course to make the planned annual cost savings of Dollars 120m. About Dollars 20m of these came through in the first quarter and all but Dollars 10m to Dollars 15m would be in place by year-end. On March 31 Cyprus sold its non-core oil and gas business to Union Pacific Resources for Dollars 819m gross or Dollars 750m net. In the first quarter these operations contributed Dollars 9m after tax. Mr Ward said Cyprus was in a strong financial position, with a cash balance of Dollars 833m at the end of the quarter and long-term debt at only 35.7 per cent of equity. Coal operations were on track to meet or exceed the 1994 production goal of 80m tons, 15 per cent higher than combined production in 1993. Coal contributed earnings of Dollars 25m, compared with Dollars 6m, excluding a 1993 pre-tax gain of Dollars 23m. Coal was sold for an average of Dollars 15.48 a ton, against a Dollars 14.17 average cost of sales.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRESPI WINS GAME AND A BERTH IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Call the Crespi High football team a lot of things, but through the past few  years, helpless hasn't been one of them.  </P> <P> The Celts beat St. Francis, 28-7, Friday night, but the postgame celebration  was put on hold for more than 30 minutes.  </P> <P> The Celts (7-3 overall, 2-2 in league play) had to wait that long before  results of another Del Rey League game between Alemany and St. John Bosco  filtered through to La Canada.  </P> <P> Finally, the news arrived that Alemany had beaten St. John Bosco, qualifying  both Alemany and Crespi for the Division I playoffs. A St. John Bosco win would  have meant a three-way tie among Alemany, St. John Bosco and Crespi at 2-2 with  only two playoff berths available. Instead, St. John Bosco fell to 1-3 and is  eliminated. Crespi finished third, one game behind second-place Alemany.  </P> <P> Leonice Brown led Crespi with an impressive performance, rushing for 134 yards  and one touchdown in 18 carries.  </P> <P> "This whole situation made us think about how bad we want to play football,"  Brown said. "We don't want our season to end now."  </P> <P> Sophomore quarterback Cody Smith completed 12 of 17 passes for 173 yards and a  pair of touchdowns. Tight end Christian Fauria caught six passes for 91 yards,  including a diving reception for a 24-yard touchdown in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Crespi limited the Knights to only seven yards in the first half and 114 in the  game.  </P> <P> St. Francis broke the shutout in the third quarter when quarterback John Willis  hit Mike Torres with a 14-yard pass to cut the margin to 21-7.  </P> <P> Lucas Freeman added a four-yard touchdown for the Celts in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The Celts took a 21-0 lead in a first half, but the margin easily could have  been greater.  </P> <P> Crespi outgained the Knights, 205-7, and ran 31 plays to the St. Francis 14.  However, the Celts lost two fumbles deep in Knights territory to squander  another pair of prime scoring opportunities.  </P> <P> Smith, a 15-year-old sophomore, completed 10 of 13 first-half attempts for 117  yards. Brown gained 84 yards in 10 carries.  </P></p>

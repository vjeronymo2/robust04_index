			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Billionaire imposes capitalist rule: President of Volga republic makes even Yeltsin seem timid IT WAS the line that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has perhaps always dreamt of delivering. With a dead-pan face Mr Kursan Khalmg-Tangch, the newly elected president of the Russian republic of Kalmykia, yesterday announced that he had sacked the government. 'We have offered them opportunities to become private farmers. They can do some useful business then,' he told a stunned press conference in Moscow. He calmly added that he would impose presidential rule, abolish most ministries, outlaw the KGB, cut subsidies, slash taxes - and dole out Dollars 100 (Pounds 65) to every citizen of the Kalmyk republic to let them join in a programme of radical economic reform. Tucked on the mouth of the Volga river, the Kalmyk republic, which is blessed with oil, sheep and caviar, first shot to political fame earlier this month when it elected Mr Khalmg-Tangch, a 30-year-old local businessman and rouble billionaire Running on a political platform that promised 'economic shock reforms' for the republic, Mr Khalmg-Tangch announced that he was 'neither a communist nor a democrat but a capitalist'. In practice, this translates into a vision that takes as its inspiration the rapid economic growth of South East Asia. Under the plans unveiled yesterday, the president will assume direct control of all economic enterprises. Local elected bodies will be abolished, political opposition discouraged, and foreign investors given free rein to engage in virtually tax-free business. Meanwhile, mindful of his Kalmyk Buddhist Mongol heritage, Mr Khalmg-Tangch will personally finance the construction of a Buddhist temple. He is also inviting the Dalai Lama to take up residence. A specialist in Japanese history, Mr Khalmg-Tangch has built a successful business career by specialising in joint ventures with South Korean and Japanese partners. With his own large financial resources and links with South East Asian businesses, Mr Khalmg-Tangch says he is so confident that he can finance reform that the republic will no longer accept subsidies from Moscow. But whether the 350,000-strong population of Kalmykia will be able to tolerate these radical changes remains more dubious. It also remains to be seen whether the Russian parliament will return the compliment and let Kalmykia's challenge pass unheeded. 'What Russia needs now is a strong leader,' said Mr Khalmg-Tangch, yesterday. He added that after lengthy talks with Mr Yeltsin, the Russian president had expressed an interest in Kalmykia's programme as a 'mini-model' for Russia.</p>

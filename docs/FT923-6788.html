			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Equitable secures new credit THE Equitable Life Assurance Society of New York, the large but troubled life insurer in which France's Axa group now owns a 49 per cent stake, said yesterday that it had secured a new Dollars 550m credit facility. The back-up loan facility is being provided by a 13-strong international syndicate of banks, led by Chase Manhattan, and will last for 364 days. The Equitable said that it replaced a Dollars 1.16bn facility, which was never used and intended primarily to support commercial paper sales. 'We have no plans to borrow against the new line,' Mr Richard Jenrette, Equitable's chairman, said. There were reports this month that The Equitable had been unable to arrange a Dollars 600m credit line, and was cutting the amount sought and maturity desired. In order to bolster its capital, The Equitable converted from mutual status to a conventional shareholder-owned company. Axa invested Dollars 1bn for its 49 per cent stake, but when The Equitable tried to raise additional money through the general flotation of its shares, it was obliged to cut the offering price from Dollars 11-Dollars 14 to Dollars 9.</p>

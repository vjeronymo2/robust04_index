			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Letter: A recipe for disaster Sir, The chancellor, Norman Lamont, has got it all back to front. Germany has a low inflation because it has a strong economy - not vice versa. Britain has a weak economy compared with Germany. If you impose low inflation on a weak economy like ours you will not produce a strong economy; you will produce a disaster. Louis Musgrove, 130 Woodbridge Road, Ipswich, Suffolk IP4 2NS</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Lending by banks and building societies falls LENDING by banks and building societies to the private and corporate sectors fell sharply last month. The fall was a further sign that the recession is continuing. Lending by banks and building societies, known as M4 lending, rose by only Pounds 400m, confounding City expectations of a monthly rise of Pounds 2.5bn. The slight increase brought annual credit growth to 5 per cent - the lowest annual growth rate since 1967. In February last year annual credit growth stood at 13.9 per cent. The figures from the Bank of England contrasted strongly, however, with separate data from the British Bankers Association. These showed that lending by the nine big high- street banking groups to the private sector (about 70 per cent of total bank lending) grew by Pounds 1.5bn in February compared with a rise of only Pounds 400m in January. Lord Inchyra, secretary-general of the association, warned against reading too much into its figure. 'Looking at longer-term trends, one should probably say no more than that the sharp decline in bank lending does appear to have bottomed out,' he said. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura Research, said the difference in figures could be explained by a collapse in building society lending, which is not included in the association's figures. But it was more likely to be the result of a fall in lending by overseas banks. Other measures of money supply from the Bank also pointed towards a stagnant economy. Narrow money (M0), which mostly comprises notes and coins and indicates underlying demand pressures, grew by a seasonally adjusted 2.2 per cent in the 12 months to February. Between January and February M0 grew by 0.2 per cent. Broad money (M4) - notes and coins plus sterling deposits at banks and building societies - grew by 6 per cent in the 12 months to February. This followed growth of 6.2 per cent in the year to January. In February M4 grew by 0.5 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULGARIAN TURKS  </P> <P> Thank you for your coverage (Part I, Sept. 4) of the plight of ethnic Turks who  are being expelled from Bulgaria. The campaign by the repressive Bulgarian  authorities to forcefully eliminate the ethnic identity of the Turkish minority  is an affront to humanity. The communist dictatorship of Bulgaria has found an  easy way to expropriate its citizenry: drive them across the border and leave  everything behind.  </P> <P> The more than 300,000 ethnic Turks who have come to Turkey so far represent the  largest political refugee population in Europe since World War II. That the  Turkish government has closed its doors temporarily, to negotiate an orderly  migration with the Bulgarians, is no surprise, given the limited resources of  Turkey.  </P> <P> We in the Western world can simply shake our heads in disbelief and go on with  our lives. Or, we can help lessen the agony of the refugees by supporting a  humanitarian aid campaign. Those who wish to contribute can send their checks  or money orders to ATA-SC Refugee Fund, P.O. Box 18200, Irvine 92713.  </P> <P> ORHAN GURBUZ  </P> <P> American-Turkish Association  </P> <P> of Southern California  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

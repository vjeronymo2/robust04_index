A Qol Yisra'el reporter says advances were made in the  areas of agriculture and taxation; however, the Palestinians  presented new requests in the area of banking. The Palestinians  continue to demand their own currency and a central bank, and  are opposed to Israeli representation at customs at border  crossing points. The two sides say the talks are due to resume  in 10 days.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTER ARRESTED NEAR FETE HONORING BEIJING REGIME  </P> <P> One person was arrested outside a Chinatown restaurant Sunday during a  demonstration protesting human rights violations in China. Inside, 600 people  were attending a luncheon celebrating the 40th anniversary of China's Communist  government.  </P> <P> Although several protests have been staged by Chinese students and others in  Los Angeles since troops crushed student-led, pro-democracy demonstrations in  Beijing in June, the rallies have generally been peaceful and without arrests.  </P> <P> Chich Jen Tung, 52, of Monterey Park, was booked on a misdemeanor charge of  interfering with a police officer in performance of his duties.  </P> <P> "He is from a group that is more strident, and we were unable to control him,"  said Ting Huang, a spokesman for the Chinese community groups and students  staging the demonstration.  </P> <P> Huang said that, as diners left the Golden Palace restaurant on North Broadway,  demonstrators shouted in Chinese, "We have to overthrow the Chinese Communist  Party!" and "How can you sit down and enjoy your meal when the meals are the  blood, sweat and tears of the Chinese people!"  </P></p>

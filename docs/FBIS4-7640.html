			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mioara Negescu report: "Pavel Grachev: `We Had a </F> Political Dialogue With President Iliescu'"]    [Text] On Tuesday [29 March] at Cotroceni Palace,  Romania's President Ion Iliescu received Army General Pavel  Sergeyevich Grachev, defense minister of the Russian Federation.  The meeting was attended on the Romanian side by National  Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca and presidential counselors  [Colonel General] Vasile Ionel and Traian Chebeleu.    In a statement made to the press after his meeting with  President Iliescu, the Russian minister noted that "we agreed  that our economic relations could be improved and enlarged, and  this may only be achieved if the prime ministers of Romania and  Russia meet in the very near future.    We had a political dialogue with Mr. Iliescu, during which I  briefed your president on the political situation in our  country, on the actions taken both by the [Russian] government  and President Yeltsin to solve various domestic and foreign  policy issues, as well as on the stage reached in the reform. I  asked President Iliescu whether he has a message to be conveyed  to President Yeltsin, and he very clearly replied that Romania  wishes to cooperate more closely with Russia and that he wishes  to meet President Yeltsin as early as this year. As a matter of  fact, Russia's intentions are identical, in the sense that it  also wishes to strengthen relations between our countries, as  from a certain moment those relations have unfortunately become  looser. Together with President Iliescu we also touched on the  issue of the Partnership for Peace. We share a number of views:  The Partnership ought to be based on the principles of equality  among its members, there should not be any teachers and pupils,  there should be a basic balance and mutual advantage, and all  European states, under equitable conditions for all, should be  involved in the ensuring of their joint security."</p>

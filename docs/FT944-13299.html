			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Gatt waiver sought for Lome The European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states have jointly applied for a waiver from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) fair trade rules for the Lome Convention, a European Commission official said yesterday. The official said the Commission was satisfied that the preferential trading arrangements of the Lome Convention, intended to aid 46 developing countries, were compatible with Gatt. He said the waiver request was a precaution in view of criticism of Lome by a Gatt panel which attacked the EU's banana import regime as contrary to world trade rules. The Gatt Council is due to consider the waiver request on November 10.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Li Zhurun and Zhou Genliang] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- China is formulating  a set of methods for more effective implementation of the  "Copyright Law," a senior legislator told XINHUA today.    According to Cai Cheng, vice-chairman of the Law Committee  of  the National People's Congress, also being prepared are rules  and regulations that aim at stepping up protection of foreign  economic and technical trade-related intellectual property  rights.    He said that these will allow customs a still bigger role in  preventing goods produced by infringing upon intellectual  property rights of others from being shipped out of China.    For now, the attention is focused on the "Copyright Law".  Cai added that law enforcement bodies will investigate "major  and important" cases in cooperation with departments of science,  technology, culture, public security, industry and commerce.    The legislator cited a recent circular calling for a  crackdown on counterfeit compact and laser discs.    The circular was issued by the Communist Party Central  Committee Propaganda Department and six government organs  including the State Planning Commission and the State Press and  Publications Administration. In response, Guangdong inspectors  shut down 400 CD stalls and 50,000 discs were confiscated along  with 3,000 video tapes.    The cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong  Province are setting up courts to try cases of intellectual  property rights violation, in the wake of the establishment of a  provincial court of the same type.    In addition to the Guangdong Provincial Court, intellectual  property rights courts are now operational in Beijing, Shanghai  and Shenzhen, the booming special economic zone adjacent to Hong  Kong.    The central government, for its part, will improve its  supervision of law enforcement by local authorities. "Problems  such as ineffective implementation of laws and too-lenient  treatment of law-breakers must be resolved," he said.    While the government strives to do its best, Cai said, the  non-governmental sector is encouraged to help.    Cai was referring to lawyers and auditors as well as  professional societies and associations in science, technology  and culture. "When organized, these can provide services,  including legal consultancy and investigation into complaints,"  he said.    Cai cited the Intel-Protect Services (China) Ltd., a  mainland-Hong Kong joint venture established last July, which is  China's first and until now only non-governmental agency  specializing in protection of intellectual property.    One of the company's clients was Hazeline, a British soap  producer, which late last year demanded investigation into  alleged abuse of its trademark.    Last month, IPS inspectors discovered the bootleg producer,  a  factory in Xiashan Town of Chaoyang City in Guangdong. Upon  receiving the IPS report, local police shut down the factory.    According to official statistics, an average of 13,000 cases  of trademark abuse and counterfeited goods are reported every  year, including 500 that directly affect foreign companies.    Cai attributed this to the fact that intellectual property  protection is still new in China. "But the country is sincere  and serious in its effort to improve and will always be," Cai  said.    He noted that laws and government decrees published so far  cover "almost every aspect of intellectual property."    The country is now a member of the World Intellectual  Property Rights Organization and has acceded to, among others,  the Paris Convention on Industrial Property Rights Protection,  the Madrid Convention on International Registration of  Trademarks and the Berne Convention for the Protection of  Literary and Artistic Works.    Cai's view is shared by Maria Wai-chu Tam, a Hong Kong  barrister-at-law, who is concerned with the mainland's  intellectual property protection work. "I'm optimistic," she  said.    "In just a few years China has made laws to go by and that's  no easy task," she said. "The question is how to ensure their  full implementation."    China is also increasing its international contacts on  intellectual property, cai said, citing an international  symposium in May, at which Chinese officials and experts will  consult their foreign counterparts on how to improve.    The symposium will be featured by reports on the current  situation and planned improvements in the protection of  trademarks, copyrights and patents as well as judicial work, Cai  said.</p>

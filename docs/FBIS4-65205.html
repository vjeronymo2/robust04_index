			<p>BFN     [Text] From Washington, where he is currently paying an  official visit, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has once  again stressed the need for economic aid to Algeria. Mr. Juppe  also issued a warning about what could happen in the event of  the fundamentalists coming to power. Alain Juppe:    [Begin Juppe recording] I have said very clearly that the  advent of an extremist, fundamentalist, anti-European, and  anti-Western government in Algiers will have very serious  consequences, not just for Algeria itself, and for France, but  for the whole of the Mediterranean region, and thus for the  equilibrium of this region. The Americans will evidently be  directly affected. So, what can one do to prevent this  happening? One can promote dialogue --the current Algerian  authorities are devoting themselves to doing this, and it is not  easy, of course--and above all, and this is no doubt the card  that we must play, one can help Algeria pull itself out of the  economic slump, the economic crisis, from which it is suffering  after 30 years of socialist management. It has done what had to  be done with the International Monetary Fund and devalued its  currency, it has taken courageous internal measures; it now has  to follow this up. This means an extensive rescheduling of the  debt, and also bilateral or multilateral aid to the Algerian  economy. France is making a great effort to this effect, the  Twelve have agreed to make a great effort, and I hope that  others will also join us in this action. [end recording]</p>

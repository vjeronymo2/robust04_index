			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance  [Hizballah parliamentary group] has described U.S. Beirut  Ambassador Mark Hambley's moves as "unacceptable defiance of our  people's feelings" and indicated that "it is the misfortune of  our time that the government is in a comatose state" regarding  what it described as the U.S. Ambassador's provocations.  [passage omitted]    The bloc noticed that Ambassador Hambley's actions with  respect to official quarters and his conveying to them of  warnings and threatening messages under the guise of calming the  situation and self-restraint aim "to undermine our people's  steadfastness and their valiant resistance, which alone  shoulders the responsibility for liberation and the honor of  confronting the enemy's designs."    The bloc said "we believe these suspicious moves by this  U.S.  diplomat constitute unacceptable defiance of our people's  feelings and impermissible intervention in the country's  domestic affairs. It is the misfortune of our time that the  government is in a comatose state regarding the U.S.  ambassador's provocations. It is natural that this ambassador  not be allowed to hurt the people's feelings and insult their  dignity." [passage omitted]</p>

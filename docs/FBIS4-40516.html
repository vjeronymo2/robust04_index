			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement Adopted by the Meeting of the Organization of </F> Ukraine's Idealists"; place and date not given: "They Do Not  and Will Not Succeed"]    [Text] The situation in the Crimea was created  artificially. It was instigated by secret "activists," who, by  stirring up interethnic conflicts, in particular, between  Russians and Ukrainians, are trying to accomplish their hidden  plans. We know well who (at any rate, during World War II)  dreamed about an "autonomous republic" in the Crimea. It would  be an illusion to see the present situation on the peninsula  outside the context of those dreams. To push the two great  peoples -- Ukrainians and Russians -- into a confrontation and  gain from that -- these are the schemes of internationalists  hiding the signboard of the Meshkov [Crimean president] quandary.    They do not and will not succeed.    Every Cossack, who arrived from Don, Kuban, or other places  to give support to the president of cossack extraction, must  know that he is fulfilling the role of that proletarian, who, in  1917, brought to power the Marxist-Leninist mafia, which then  drew the peoples of the czarist empire into the terrible turmoil  of self-destruction -- terror, civil wars, famines,  concentration camps, and the all- embracing economic and  political devastation.    We call upon all the peoples of the world that are exploited  by Jews [zhydy] to unite in the noble cause against the servants  of the Devil and localize them in their national state --  Israel. Let them show, to their full extent, the talents of the  people chosen by God. We are convinced that, as soon as they  get together in their own home, genuine brotherhood will prevail  on our planet, and benevolence and peace will reign among all  peoples.    The policy of Ukraine and Russia in the Crimean issue must  be  unambiguous: Not a single armed Ukrainian or Russian in the  Crimean conflict.    Our slogan: "Free Ivan Demyanyuk, or Rid Ukraine of Jews!"  helped release our fellow countryman from the Israeli prison  where he had been tortured for seven years.    Our slogan: "Peace to the Ukrainian Crimea, or Rid Ukraine  and Russia of Jews!" will caution the two Christian peoples  against the confrontation, which will be pernicious for them,  and which has been provoked by enemies of Christ.    Jews make a charming impression when they live in their  national state and honestly and conscientiously earn their bread.    We call upon all clergymen of Ukraine and Russia to hold  sermons for peace in the Crimea and pray to God so that He would  instruct Jews to take care of Israel on their own territory and  to pray for the triumph of a single holy United Apostle Church.    We call upon all political parties, public organizations,  and  all people of good will to hold rallies: "Peace for the  Ukrainian Crimea! Away With Insidious Provocateurs!" "Down With  Jewish Communo-Fascism!"    Let all states of the world cherish their national values,  their national spirit, and moral traditions proceeding from the  principles of humanism and good, and purify themselves from the  international evil.    Mykhaylo Mankovskyy, chairman of the leadership of the Lvov  Oblast Organization of Ukraine's Idealists.</p>

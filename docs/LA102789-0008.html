			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CRUX OF DEFENSE IS VOIDED IN ABDUCTION FROM SECT  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge, preparing for next month's trial of five people accused  of kidnaping a 23-year-old woman who the defendants claim was in the grip of a  religious cult, has struck down the legal arguments that were to be the heart  of the defense case.  </P> <P> Judge David B. Moon Jr. ruled Wednesday in pretrial motions that attorneys,  including those representing the parents and an older sister of Ginger Brown,  cannot argue that the defendants tried to rescue Brown for her own safety.  </P> <P> Nor will the defense attorneys be able to use the words "cult" or "thought  control" during the trial, which is scheduled to begin with jury selection Nov.  6 in Vista Superior Court.  </P> <P> Moon, saying he doesn't want the trial to be a philosophical battleground for  religious freedom, ruled that the defense team had not shown proof that Brown,  a member of Great Among the Nations, had lost her free will by joining the  small group, which now has its headquarters in Coronado.  </P> <P> The defense attorneys said they will appeal Moon's decision because it  essentially guts their defense of Brown's parents, Earle and Dorothy Brown of  Santa Cruz; her sister, Holly Brown; Clifford Daniels, a Los Angeles  deprogrammer, and Hank Erler, in whose Escondido home Brown was allegedly held  against her will for five days in May, 1988, as they tried to get her to  renounce her allegiance to the group.  </P> <P> The defense had hoped to show that the kidnaping of Ginger Brown was motivated  by her parent's concern for her well-being and that it was less evil than her  continued alliance with the religious organization.  </P> <P> But Moon said the elder Browns had not sought alternative, legal avenues to  remove their daughter from the group before they forcibly snatched her.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel said Moon's ruling will allow for a  straightforward prosecution of a kidnaping case. Dorothy Brown's attorney, John  Patterson, told Moon that, given his ruling, his client essentially has no  defense.  </P></p>

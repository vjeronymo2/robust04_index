			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK backs support for S Africa BRITAIN proposed yesterday that the IMF and World Bank be prepared to support South Africa once a planned interim government was in place. Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, told the development committee of the IMF and World Bank that he hoped the groups would consider positively future requests for help from South Africa in view of the pace of reform there. South Africa will not need IMF assistance as it has a balance of payments surplus. However, the UK wants the World Bank to react swiftly to any request for loans. Mr Lamont also made several proposals to help the poorest nations. He urged the IMF to adopt a flexible approach when providing aid on concessional terms to developing countries in southern Africa, which are suffering a prolonged drought.</p>

He described the bombing as a  "despicable and barbaric act," adding that while the authorities  were unable to positively establish responsibility, it was  internationally assumed Bosnian Serb artillery was to blame.    "Certainly the case for air strikes is becoming more  compelling, more irresistible," he told parliament. He said the  international community was hesitant to use air strikes because  it was unclear if they would be successful in removing threats  and could hurt humanitarian operations in Bosnia. "It is a  matter for very fine judgment for those who have their own  citizens at risk," he said.    "It is a matter for very fine judgment by everyone who has  the best interests of the Bosnian people deeply at heart.    "We in Australia will support any decision that is made as a  result of these proper processes working themselves out."</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Argentina makes a vice out of a necessity: The role of the plain envelope where government officials earn too little to live on EVERY month Argentina's cabinet office sends out plain envelopes containing the equivalent of Dollars 3,000-Dollars 4,000 in cash to 200-300 senior political officials, in most cases tripling their salaries. It is one of Argentina's worst-kept secrets that senior government officials receive these large illegal cash payments and that they evade taxes. It does little to credit the government's claim to be cleaning up the bureaucratic machine. Few officials can get by on their meagre salaries: President Carlos Menem himself earns the equivalent of only Dollars 2,400 (Pounds 1,590) a month. A minister gets Dollars 2,100 and officials at junior ministerial level between Dollars 1,600 and Dollars 1,800. Nearly all top political appointees therefore rely on additional payments known as the sobresueldo, the extra salary. It may be illegal, but the sobresueldo long ago became an established part of public life and shows little sign of disappearing. Although Mr Menem has raised civil servants' pay, he has repeatedly put off raising the salaries of their political masters, thus perpetuating the sobresueldo system. He is apparently worried about adverse public reaction to a big 'increase' in salaries. He is probably right: last year the media reacted in fury when economy minister Domingo Cavallo admitted that he received the equivalent of Dollars 8,000 a month after tax from Fundacion Mediterranea, a business-funded economic research foundation he led before entering politics. It also pays smaller amounts to nearly all his aides, most of whom entered government straight from the foundation. Mr Cavallo said he could not afford to live on less than Dollars 10,000 a month in Buenos Aires. By contrast, private- sector wages average Dollars 700 a month - barely enough to survive in one of the world's most expensive cities. Spurred on by an outraged media, prosecutors charged Mr Cavallo with receiving illegal gifts. But a judge rejected the accusation after Mr Cavallo argued that he and his team were on secondment to the government. The extra salaries are paid out of the president's Dollars 196.5m a year of 'reserved funds', which are disbursed without any outside control. Furthermore, income tax is not levied on the payments. Some officials are unhappy about the parallel wage structure, not only because sobresueldos are illegal, but because they contradict Mr Menem's claim to be promoting clean government. They are also uncomfortable about earning 'less' than their civil service subordinates. Senior civil servants earn Dollars 3,000-Dollars 5,000 a month, although some of them also get sobresueldos. Some officials continue to receive their plain envelopes even after leaving government. The practice is also widespread in Congress, where each party is assigned 'reserved funds' which they are free to spend as they please. Congressional staff are paid only Dollars 1,500 a month, a legislator Dollars 5,000. Here again, sobresueldos are paid, tax-free, to aides and staffers. The government even pays them to journalists. Reporters get cash hand-outs, roughly equivalent to their salaries, from the press offices of the ministries they cover regularly. Mr Cavallo's aides suspect one reason for the generally hostile press coverage was his order to ban these payments in the economy ministry when he took office in 1991. Companies habitually pay journalists for publishing favourable articles and some reporters even receive large regular retainers. Companies also pay politicians and civil servants. Sometimes they do so openly. In 1991, 73 local and multinational companies provided Dollars 300,000 to help modernise the civil service by hiring trained professionals. And some non-cash corporate 'contributions' are relatively innocuous. For instance, Mr Martn Redrado, head of the CNV securities watchdog, openly admits that it was the stock exchange that redecorated his new offices. Most people receiving sobresueldos consider them more a necessary perk than a bribe. Inevitably, though, the tradition opens the door to more serious forms of corruption. Officials 'borrow' luxurious cars or apartments from friendly businessmen. Companies consider it natural to make political contributions to tax-exempt foundations set up by politicians as cash conduits. This 'black money' is an important weapon in every politician's arsenal. It is used to reward close aides, buy journalists and media barons, pay supporters and fund election campaigns. Although Mr Cavallo's de-regulation and privatisation policies have significantly curbed corruption, company executives still say bureaucrats and members of Congress expect inducements to take - or not to take - decisions affecting their companies. For instance, a trade association of multinational companies recently rejected an approach by a congressional official with an 'offer' to approve an intellectual property bill stalled in Congress.</p>

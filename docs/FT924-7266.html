			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (12): Workhorses of the industry - Travel Agents BUSINESS TRAVEL agents are the workhorses of effective corporate travel management. The good business specialist should not only know the best deals on offer but also be able to secure them because of the muscle that agency has due to the volume of bookings. Good agents also are able to provide their client companies with a global reach to enable them to do business anywhere in the world - as well as providing detailed management information on who has travelled where and at what cost. Small wonder, then, that the accepted wisdom of business travel management is: if you find a good agent then never let that agent go. Unfortunately, good agents who do all of the above and more are not necessarily that easy to find. Corporate complaints about business agents range from executives who bemoan long waits for interconnecting flights when they find a colleague from another company has been booked direct through, to company accountants who cannot cope with the excessive amount of data provided by the agent when all they want is a brief summary. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that some leading buyers of business travel are negotiating directly with suppliers such as airlines, hotels and car rental companies to meet their needs. They believe that the volume of business and agency commission saved can give them a better deal. But the increasing complexity of business travel in the 1990s would make most companies, large or small, prefer to use a specialist agent. Small companies, however, have had problems in the past in gaining the support and benefits that specialists can provide. 'Companies which spend up to Pounds 600,000 on business travel have not, in the past, been offered by the industry the service levels and cost management opportunities they deserve,' observes Mr Bill Kirkwood, head of sales and marketing for Thomas Cook travel management. Thomas Cook commissioned research from Mori which found that small companies were often desperate for help to achieve the best price for travel in line with the needs of individual travellers. 'The research showed that some customers thought they had to go to a bucket shop to get the kind of air fares they see advertised in the newspapers,' says Mr Kirkwood. It also showed that smaller companies rated local service as being more important than global networks. According to the survey, the important criteria for a business travel agent were for easy booking, fast delivery of tickets and the opportunity for regular meetings to keep the agency appraised of the client's needs. Reliability and flexibility were also rated as critical. Thomas Cook has responded to this marketing niche by providing a 'fair fares policy' for small (and large) companies. It will quote a fare for the travel that has been requested and will also research other fares, guaranteeing to offer the cheapest alternative within the restrictions applying to the traveller. It is these restrictions - such as when you need to fly and whether you might need to change dates and times - that are usually the cause of higher fares being offered. The simple rule of business travel is that the more flexibility executives want built into their travel schedules, the higher the fare. But while small companies may represent a market not to be forgotten, there is little doubt of the growing demand for business travel agents to have world-wide clout. American Express, with an estimated worldwide revenue from business travel of more than Dollars 4bn, is probably the largest group which fulfils the travel agencyfunction of providing the interface between the supplier and client on an international basis. Vying for second place in the international league are Carlson of the US, which recently acquired the A. T. Mays agency chain in the UK although with most of its business travel turnover still in the US, and Wagons-Lits, which last year bought Pickfords Business Travel from NFC. Wagons-Lits owns agencies in 40 countries and has partnerships with agencies in a further 79 countries. Thomas Cook and Wagons-Lits used to have a formal marketing agreement which limited their spheres of influence: since that deal broke up a few years ago, both companies have made strenuous efforts to expand their global coverage. Thomas Cook, which does not own its operations in the US, can be expected aggressively to seek new world-wide coverage following its acquisition. Hogg Robinson, a UK-based service organisation, has also joined the trend towards globalisation through helping to develop an international network, Business Travel International. Mr David Radcliffe, Hogg Robinson's business travel director, makes clear that the new arrangement is customer-driven. 'Customer demands for greater cost savings have increased immeasurably over the past few years and through the purchasing power of BTI they can avail themselves of maximum savings,' he says. Newcomers to the BTI consortium this year include Japan's Nippon Travel Agency, Spain's El Corte Ingles, Global Travel in Singapore and Kuoni Travel of Switzerland. The drawback to increasing globalisation of travel agencies, however, is largely one of logistics: collecting information and exercising control over a large number of locations or operations. It is here that the development of Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) will play an increasingly important role in the 1990s.</p>

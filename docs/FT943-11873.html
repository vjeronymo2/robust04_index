			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Eggar to quiz industry on competitiveness measures Mr Tim Eggar, the new minister for industry and energy, is to launch an initiative to find out what crucial industrial sectors want from the government to help them improve their competitiveness. In his first briefing since last week's reshuffle - in which he took on the industry portfolio at the Department of Trade and Industry in addition to his energy responsibilities - Mr Eggar said the biggest issue for industry was competitiveness. One of his roles would be to look at how to take the issue forward following the publication in May by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, of the white paper on competitiveness. Mr Eggar said he had asked officials to find out from industrial sectors and sub-sectors the top three or four issues where government action could help them. The announcement does not amount to a change of policy by the DTI, and Mr Eggar said he wanted industry to identify the priorities. Mr Eggar's broader role follows the retirement of Mr Tim Sainsbury as industry minister, and he also takes on responsibility for the Post Office. Mr Charles Wardle, under-secretary of state for industry and energy, supports him on all industry, energy and regional issues.</p>

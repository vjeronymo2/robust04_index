			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Tory MPs urge limit on postal sell-off Conservative backbenchers who are opposed to the privatisation of the Post Office yesterday put forward a parliamentary early day motion opposing the sale of a majority shareholding, Roland Rudd writes. The move is an indication of the determination of some Conservative MPs to ensure that the corporation remains in the public sector with more commercial freedom. The motion, which has attracted all-party support, welcomes the recognition that the Post Office needs more commercial freedom but says it can be achieved without full privatisation. Mr Jim Lester, Tory MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire, said: 'I cannot see the economic case for selling off more than half the shares in the Post Office when it can have commercial freedom within the public sector.' Sir David Knox, Tory MP for Staffordshire Morelands, said the 'postal delivery service should continue to be protected by the state'. The government's preferred option is to sell 51 per cent of the shares in the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. Tory MPs opposed to this would compromise on a flotation of between 30 per cent and 49 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BREN TO GIVE UCI $1 MILLION MORE FOR FELLOWS PROGRAM  </P> <P> Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L.Bren will donate $1 million to a UC Irvine  endowment bearing his name during a press conference today, and distinguished  evolutionary biologist Francisco Ayala will be named director of the Bren  Fellows Program and its first fellow.  </P> <P> "I will continue my research and be an active director," said Ayala, a member  of the National Academy of Sciences, in confirming his new position Monday.  </P> <P> He declined further comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Created With Bren Gift  </P> <P> The Bren Fellows program was created last year with a $1.5-million gift from  Bren, the multimillionaire executive of the largest landholding entity in the  county.  </P> <P> A key to the endowment was an agreement with the Irvine Co. that removed a deed  restriction that had prevented UCI from commercially developing campus property  since 1960, when the company sold the land to UCI.  </P> <P> Plans for a 135-acre, high-tech research park on the property were announced in  May; under terms of the agreement, all lease revenues will be used for more  fellowships and to pay for research and teaching.  </P> <P> Bren's latest gift will endow a second fellowship and be used to attract a top  scholar to UCI, sources said.  </P> <P> Bren, who said last year that his earlier endowment would "place UCI in a  position of tremendous and virtually unparalleled academic strength," could not  be reached for comment Monday.  </P> <P> UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, who will participate in the announcement  today, would not comment Monday on the planned gift.  </P> <P> Peltason has described the planned research park as an important element of the  university's future as "a knowledge center." UCI, which will gain up to 2  million square feet of commercial space in the research park areas, expects to  lure biomedical companies that would conduct research in partnership with  scientists from UCI's College of Medicine.  </P> <P> The research park, in effect, will place UCI in competition with the Irvine Co.  for high-rent industrial tenants. The development firm owns much of the  property surrounding UCI, including some of the most commercially valuable land  in the county.  </P> <P> Ayala, a former Roman Catholic priest who left the church to study genetics,  has the contacts and credentials to recruit leading scientists and scholars in  his new position.  </P> <P> Since he was lured from UC Davis in 1987, Ayala has researched the genetic  causes of disease while aiding in UCI fund-raising. At a February meeting of  the UCI Foundation Board of Overseers, composed of some of the university's  most generous patrons, Ayala spoke briefly about his work and the need for  continued research money.  </P> <P> Ayala, 56, also organized the National Academy of Science's first West Coast  symposium in May, 1988, joining a lofty program of lecturers on biological  research and human values.  </P> <P> He has often battled creationists in his 24-year academic career and was a  major witness in a 1982 trial that resulted in the overturning of an Arkansas  law requiring public school instructors to give equal time to the teaching of  creationism and evolution.  </P></p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Porton shareholders say yes to Pounds 65.5m French bid Porton International's institutional shareholders yesterday backed a Pounds 65.5m recommended bid for the UK biotechnology company from Beaufour Ipsen, the family-owned French pharmaceuticals group. Shareholders controlling 88.9 per cent of Porton's shares, which are traded under the Stock Exchange's Rule 4.2, agreed to accept the French bid worth Pounds 13.40 in cash or notes by the 3pm deadline yesterday. Under a separate deal Speywood, a company set up by Beaufour and Porton's management to make the acquisition, has also agreed to acquire an additional 5.7 per cent stake in Porton. These shares, together with the valid acceptances of the offer, lifted the total number of Porton shares being acquired to 6.69m or 94.6 per cent of the outstanding capital, comfortably above the 90 per cent target . As a result, the offer has become unconditional and will remain open for further acceptances. The French group, advised by Lazard Brothers, held irrevocable undertakings covering 66.2 per cent of the equity, including a 36.6 per cent stake held by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie, Porton's founder and ex-chairman ahead of the deadline. Victory had looked increasingly certain after institutional investors, disappointed by Porton's financial performance, backed the bid which was recommended by Kleinwort Benson, Porton's financial advisers. Meanwhile, a potential rival offer for Porton from Scotgen Pharmaceuticals, the Anglo-US drugs company, failed to materialise. The acquisition has been structured as a leveraged buyout with Porton's management taking an initial 22 per cent stake in Speywood on completion. Subject to the company's performance, this management stake could could rise as high as 35 per cent.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Markets: Bond's the name, bank stock is the game - Wall Street AS THEY say in the baseball park: 'It ain't over till it's over,' a point the New York Yankees learnt the hard way in the dying moments of two games against the Kansas City Royals this week. Like the Bombers from the Bronx, the US stock markets also got hit by a bolt from the blue this week - but this one did more good than harm. Ten days ago, the bond market rally, which had proved a source of strength for equity investors for the best part of the year, looked to be over. The yield on the benchmark 30-year treasury bond, which had fallen to an all-time low of 6.72 per cent in early March, had jumped back up past 7 per cent and appeared to be heading even higher. Fixed-income investors were selling bonds because they feared inflationary pressures were building up again in the economy. The retreat unsettled equity investors, who had been looking to declining - or at least low - interest rates to provide fuel for economic growth for the rest of the year. Their concern peaked on April 2 when bond yields returned to 7 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up almost 70 points in one day, dropping below 3,400 in the process. This week, however, everything seemed to go in reverse. Reassured by recent low inflation statistics, and pleased bythe news from the White House that President Clinton was prepared to compromise over his economic stimulus plan, treasury investors began buying bonds again and pushed the yield down to 6.71 per cent - the lowest since the government began regular auctions of 30-years in 1977. The stock markets, delighted by this unexpected turn of events, rallied. In the 6 1/2 days since bond yields dropped back under 7 per cent, the Dow gained 75 points and is now trading above 3,450. Not surprisingly, interest-rate sensitive stocks - banks, other financial companies and utilities - have been at the forefront of the rally. Undermined initially by fears of rising rates, they all have rebounded in recent days. Bank stocks have been particularly buoyant, not just over the past week but for the entire year so far. The shares of a host of big commercial operators  -including Citicorp, Wells Fargo, Chase Manhattan, BankAmerica, Banc One and First Chicago - all are trading at, or close to, their 52-week highs. Improved asset quality and impressive earnings momentum have contributed to the boom. The improvement in earnings has been particularly spectacular - and industry-wide, judging by the first batch of quarterly bank reports out so far. Five banks posted the following percentage increases in their first-quarter earnings this week: First Union, up 158 per cent; First of America, up 125 per cent; NBD, up 94 per cent; Bank of New York, up 56 per cent; and Huntington, up 48 per cent. Anticipating such gains, investors have been buying bank stocks all year. According to American Banker, the market value of the largest US banks jumped 12.3 per cent in the first three months of the year, and the publication's index of bank shares climbed 10.7 per cent in the quarter, nearly triple the gains achieved by the Standard &amp; Poor's index. JP Morgan has been among the very best performers in the sector. Yet, the New York group has ridden the coat-tails of the boom in brokerage stocks this past week, an indication that the market regards JP Morgan stock as just as much of a securities industry play as a banking play. As one of the few US banks allowed to operate in the domestic securities markets, JP Morgan earns more from its underwriting of new debt and equity, and from its trading of securities and sophisticated derivative products, than it does from such traditional banking activities as lending. Its Wall Street-type business spurred the bank to pre-charge profits of Dollars 432m in the opening quarter, news of which helped to lift the shares Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 73 1/2 this week. Fortunately for JP Morgan, it is not identified so closely with brokerage stocks that when profit-taking hits the sector, as it did on Thursday, it gets trampled in the rush to sell. In the first three days of the week, investors could not get enough of brokerage stocks. Another impressive quarter from industry leader Merrill Lynch, which unveiled record three-month profits of Dollars 342m, had sparked the buying. By Thursday, however, there was a feeling that the buying might have been overdone and that it was time to take some profits in the sector. Even shares in discount broker Charles Schwab, which announced record earnings, were hit hard. To borrow another baseball saying, it seems as if the Fat Lady has sung for brokerage stocks - at least for now. Monday     3428.09 + 31.61 Tuesday    3444.03 + 15.94 Wednesday  3455.64 + 11.61 Thursday   3455.92 +  0.28 Friday     3478.61 + 22.69</p>

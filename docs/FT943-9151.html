			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Barclays plans loan repurchase Barclays Bank yesterday started the process of reducing its capital by proposing to pay back Dollars 800m in loan capital. The repurchase is aimed at rebalancing its capital ratios following a fall in its US dollar assets. Barclays has been considering a number of measures to reduce capital after raising its tier 1 ratio of shareholders' funds to risk-weighted assets to 7 per cent in the first half of the year from 6 per cent at the end of 1993. The loan capital purchase will not affect its tier 1 ratio but it will cut the overall capital to risk-weighted assets ratio to about 10.5 per cent from 11.1 per cent, and eliminate loan interest payments. Mr Patrick Perry, Barclays' treasurer, said it 'has quite enough capital to be going on with, so it seemed sensible to pay some dollar capital off'. It had 'no plans' to buy back another Dollars 500m such issue. Barclays is also thought to be considering buying back some Dollars 500m in perpetual preference shares included in its tier 1 ratio. It has a total of Dollars 940m of such shares and a call option to repurchase Dollars 500m can now be exercised. Such a move would require Bank of England approval, but could reduce its tier 1 ratio to about 6.6 per cent. It might not choose to cut its tier 1 ratio in this way if there was a strong growth in loan demand requiring more capital. The bank yesterday offered to purchase the two Dollars 400m issues of guaranteed capital notes through a fixed-rate tender. The offer is being made by Barclays North American Capital Corporation, and Lehman Brothers is the deal manager. The purchase price of the 10 1/2 per cent notes due 2017 will be calculated at a fixed spread of 25 basis points over the yield of the US Treasury 6 per cent note due November 1997. The price of the 11 5/8 per cent notes due 2003 will be calculated at a fixed spread of 30 basis points over the yield of the US Treasury 5 1/8 per cent note due April 1998.</p>

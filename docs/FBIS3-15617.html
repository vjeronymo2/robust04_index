For example, both the  countries preferred good relations with neighbouring states,  Brazauskas said.    Talking about Lithuanian economy Brazauskas noted that  Lithuania had increased its export to the Central and Western  European countries.

Brazauskas  expressed a hope that Romanian businessmen who came to Lithuania  together with their president would find their Lithuanian  business partners.    Iliescu noted that Lithuania and Romania were related by  their common wish to establish good relations with their  neighbouring countries and prevent them from becoming new  centres of political tension in Europe. Iliescu talked about  cooperation between Romania and Hungaria and Moldova. He  admitted that Romania was particurlarly interested in the  solving of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. He expressed  a hope that the important problems for both the countries would  be discussed at the Krans Montana Forum in Bucharest in April.    Iliescu and members of the Romanian delegation also met with  Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas and other officials. A dinner  was given in the honour of Iliescu. During the dinner  Brazauskas said: " Relations between Romania and Lithuania have  got a new impulse - the visit led to signing the agreements  between the two countries, the political agreement among them.  These are the first steps of the close cooperation between  Romania and Lithuania".</p>

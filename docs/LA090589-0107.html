			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SANTANA: SOME COOL MUSIC FOR A WARM NIGHT IN COSTA MESA  </P> <P> Carlos Santana and his band gave several thousand fans an intoxicating send-off  to summer at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa Sunday. The warm night and  the outdoor stage were the perfect setting for Santana's patented synthesis of  Latin, African and rock rhythms coupled with distinct jazz and blues  sensibilities. The Woodstock veteran didn't offer any surprises, but then his  vocal fans weren't asking for any; they were on their feet much of the night,  swaying to the propulsive beat.  </P> <P> Instrumentals, which made up the lion's share of the 2 1/2-hour program, ranged  from introspective pieces to breakneck percussive workouts, all cut through  with Santana's distinctively soaring guitar. At worst, the instrumental jams  percolated along amiably if somewhat aimlessly; at best, as happened several  times in the show, the band locked into a monster groove -- though two elegant  keyboard-and-guitar duets, "Blues for Salvador" and the plaintive "Goodness and  Mercy," were highlights as well.  </P> <P> Still, vocal numbers drew some of the biggest responses, most notably a pairing  of classic-rock staples from the "Abraxas" album, "Black Magic Woman/Gypsy  Queen" and "Oye Como Va", launched with a fiery duel between bassist Keith  Jones and drummer Wilfredo Reyes.  </P> <P> The tight and responsive band (Santana lineup number thirtysomething) was  rounded out by longtime members Chester Thompson on keyboards, conga player  Armando Peraza and singer Alex Ligertwood.  </P> <P> Santana himself cut a familiar figure as he frequently closed his eyes and  gently nodded his head to the music. The lanky guitarist spoke rarely and,  during solos, often faced his band instead of the audience, but he nevertheless  managed to project a warm and easygoing image on stage.  </P> <P> Certainly, at 42, he seems to have lost none of his musical prowess. While  lengthy instrumental jams generally have fallen from favor, Santana's  continuing popularity might be ascribed to his light touch. Others have given  in to bombast and pointless soloing, but Santana usually keeps his music moving  forward, and eminently danceable.  </P> <P> Sunday's set began to lose some of its focus toward the close, however, as  other band members took turns soloing. But a lengthy encore that ended with an  extended "Deeper, Dig Deeper" from 1987's "Freedom" album brought back some of  the punch.  </P> <P> Even though the set might have been trimmed back a bit, the holiday weekend  crowd (about two-thirds of the amphitheater's capacity) seemed in no hurry to  leave. All in all, it wasn't a bad way to spend a summer night.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMPLE CITY VAULTER MARSTON BATTLES BACK TO REACH NEW HEIGHTS;  </P> <P> TRACK: AFTER BATTLING A TUMOR AND MONONUCLEOSIS, HE RETURNS TO HIS SPORT AND  SETS A SCHOOL RECORD.  </P> <P> With his senior year at Temple City High winding down, everything appears to be  falling into place for pole vaulter Brian Marston.  </P> <P> For the first time since he was a freshman, Marston has been able to compete  for a full season and he is starting to see the rewards.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, the 18-year-old broke his own school record by vaulting 14-7  1/2 at the Rio Hondo League track final.  </P> <P> He has also advanced to the CIF Masters Meet Friday night at Cerritos College,  where he hopes to qualify for the state track championships for the first time.  </P> <P> Marston can also look forward to next season, when he will continue his career  as a pole vaulter at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> It's a future filled with promise that he never could have envisioned only a  couple of years ago.  </P> <P> For Marston, it was a nightmare that began innocently enough with a trip to the  doctor for dental X-rays early in his sophomore year in 1987.  </P> <P> Only in viewing the X-rays, he said, did a doctor discover an unusual growth  developing in his mouth.  </P> <P> "I went to get my teeth X-rayed and as far as the doctor could tell it looked  like I was missing a tooth," he said.  </P> <P> So he referred Marston to Dr. Leonard Churchman, a Pasadena dentist who  performed a biopsy on the growth in December of 1987.  </P> <P> "They went and did the biopsy and the doctor said he'd never seen anything like  that before," Marston said.  </P> <P> It was Churchman who told Marston to see Dr. H. William Fister, an  Arcadia-based facial tumor specialist who determined that a large malignant  tumor had formed in Marston's sinus cavity.  </P> <P> Fister recommended surgery to remove the tumor, and he operated on Marston in  early March, 1988, at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena.  </P> <P> "By the time I had the surgery, from the time it (the tumor) was first  discovered, it had really grown," Marston said. "They said that if it hadn't  been stopped it would've eventually grown into my left eye. It wasn't life  threatening but I probably would've lost an eye."  </P> <P> The surgery was successful but it was not without its side affects. To reach  the sinus cavity, the doctor had to remove half of Marston's palate and upper  jaw along with five teeth. In its place they inserted part a false jaw and  teeth.  </P> <P> "When they first took the biopsy I didn't know what to expect," Marston said.  "Even up to the major surgery, I didn't really know they were going to take all  of that out. I woke up from surgery and it was like, 'Wow! They did all that?'  "  </P> <P> After a one-week stay in the hospital, Marston was instructed by his doctor not  to start pole vaulting again for a minimum of three to four weeks. But after  another week at home, Marston was back vaulting again.  </P> <P> Said Marston: "I went back to practice that week and (my teammates) said, 'Can  you jump?' and I said, 'I don't know.' So I jumped and my mom was freaking out  about it because I wasn't supposed to jump for at least three weeks after the  surgery."  </P> <P> At the time, he said, he simply wanted to return to his normal lifestyle as  soon as possible.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to get started with my life again," Marston said. "I didn't want  to worry about it because if you let something like that bother you, you're  never going to get anywhere in life."  </P> <P> About the only thing Marston found that he couldn't do after the operation was  play the trumpet, which he had done since he was in the fourth grade.  </P> <P> So Marston channeled his musical energy toward the drums. He then become the  drum major in the marching band as a senior.  </P> <P> Since his surgery, Marston said there have been no signs of recurrence of the  tumor.  </P> <P> "It was a tumor but it wasn't cancerous," he said. "They got it all when they  went in there and I've had several CAT scans since then and they've all been  (negative)."  </P> <P> But Marston's physical problems were not over. It was midway through his junior  season when he developed mononucleosis.  </P> <P> That forced him to miss two weeks of school. The week after he returned,  Marston matched his season best in the pole vault of 13 feet, 6 inches. But he  said he never returned to full strength, which was a key factor in why he went  out at 12-0 in the pole vault at the Rio Hondo League final and didn't qualify  for the CIF preliminaries.  </P> <P> It didn't help that he had lost 15 pounds as a result of the illness. The  5-foot-11 Marston normally weighs about 150 pounds.  </P> <P> "My legs were about as big around as my arms because I don't usually lift  weights during the season," he said. "So I never really got the weight back."  </P> <P> His coach at Temple City, Bill Martin, said it has been an inspiration to the  rest of the team that Marston has made a smooth return to his event this  season.  </P> <P> "For a lot of people who had the kind of problems that Brian had, it would have  been very easy not to come back or to slack off," he said. "But I think Brian  has always been a believer in himself and he just wouldn't have it any other  way."  </P> <P> Marston credits his success to being able to practice every day. He practices  mostly with an off-campus coach, Brian Yokoyama -- a former Temple City pole  vaulter who works with several high school vaulters in his track club called  Team Ultimate High.  </P> <P> "I go off with Brian Yokoyama and the guys from Upland (High School) and you  wouldn't believe how much it helps to have some place to do workouts at all the  time," he said. "In pole vaulting, being out even a week can hurt you."  </P> <P> Although he has spent most of his career focusing on the pole vault, Marston  didn't start out that way. As a freshman, he ran cross-country along with a  longtime friend, Phil Sutliff. When Sutliff went out for track, he persuaded  Marston to try the pole vault.  </P> <P> "He was really into track and he wanted to pole vault," Marston said. "So he  said, 'Come on, let's try the pole vault.' As it turned out, I ended up being  very good at it and Phil didn't."  </P> <P> Marston said he started competing on the freshman-sophomore team, but was moved  up to the varsity after three meets. He posted bests of 12-6 as a sophomore and  13-6 as a junior although he never advanced past the Rio Hondo League final.  </P> <P> But he was a little concerned after he vaulted a school-record 14-5 1/2 early  in the season. That is, until the league final rolled around.  </P> <P> "I peaked real early in the season," he said. "I made 14-5 in a preseason meet  and I just went down after that. I wasn't really making the heights that I  should have. But then at the league final I went 14-7 1/2."  </P> <P> It was a case of good fortune, he said, that he has qualified for the Masters  Meet despite a below par effort of 13-6 at the CIF 2-A Division final last  week.  </P> <P> "I was real lucky to make 13-6 at the CIF finals," he said. "I made it on my  first try, too. The (assistant) coach from Northridge (Tim Warner) came by  afterward and said I snaked through -- like I just got it."  </P> <P> Martin said Marston has demonstrated marked improvement from last year to this  season, but said he can get better.  </P> <P> "He has some technical things that he can improve at but, technically speaking,  vaulting is one of the toughest events in track and field," Martin said. "It  might be the toughest."  </P> <P> When he first started thinking about college, Marston said he figured that he  would have to be content with attending Pasadena City College, a two-year  community college.  </P> <P> "I hadn't heard from anyone," he said. "So I was just going to go to PCC and  get some of my freshman work out of the way and then find a (four-year) school  where I could pole vault at."  </P> <P> That was until he received a call from Warner about attending Northridge.  </P> <P> "Coach Warner called me up and he asked me where I was going next year and  said, 'How'd you like to go here?' So I went out there and saw what they did  with their pole vaulters and I liked it."  </P> <P> Marston did not receive a scholarship to Northridge but said he will be a bona  fide member of the team in every other respect.  </P> <P> "It's not a scholarship, but this way at least I'll be able to get any pole  that I need," he said. "The poles cost from $200 to $250 and there's no  guarantee that they won't break."  </P> <P> Although he is looking forward to college, Marston hopes he still has at least  two more high school meets remaining. Having already reached the Masters,  Marston is approaching the meet in his typically optimistic manner.  </P> <P> "I think I can pull it off," he said. "I tied with three people at 13-6, so I  really only have to beat them and one of the people at 14-0. I think I have a  good chance knowing that I have already cleared that height."  </P> <P> While he realizes it will not be easy, Marston already has developed a track  record at meeting difficult challenges.  </P></p>

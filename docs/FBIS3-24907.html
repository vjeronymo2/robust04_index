Yesterday a number of dissatisfied Labor Party  parliamentarians threatened protest action unless a congress  decision in this regard is repealed. An LP spokesman, Mr. Peter  Hendrickse, said the party had decided unanimously at its recent  congress to fight the election under the ANC banner and said the  five caucus members who now wished to have the resolution  revoked had not raised objections to the resolution at the time.</p>

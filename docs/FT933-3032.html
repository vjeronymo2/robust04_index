			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / The Polish Election: Ex-communists get it right with wrong message IT WAS the sort of message that goes down well with the World Bank and foreign investors. 'Creating a free market is too serious a business to leave to right-wing liberals.' However, the speaker, Mr Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, an election candidate representing Poland's neo-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), was listened to with only polite attention by the audience of diehard communists, ageing workers and pensioners who had gathered in the town of Ciechanow, north of Warsaw, for his campaign meeting. With 40 years of party discipline behind them, they can be relied on to turn up at the polls on Sunday to vote for Mr Siemiatkowski, while around half of the Polish electorate is likely to stay at home. The mainly grey-haired audience has no desire to see the demise of Ciechanow's new shops, full of attractively packaged Polish products alongside expensive imported goods. But at the same time they want higher pensions, better health care and secure jobs for their children . At the 1991 elections, Mr Siemiatkowski won 16 per cent of the vote when the unemployment rate in Ciechanow province was 17 per cent. It has since risen to 22 per cent, with peaks of up to 56 per cent in the towns, where the closure and scaling back of state enterprises have greatly exceeded the creation of jobs by service industries and small businesses. On Sunday the SLD expects to gain around 25 per cent of the vote, provided the discontented do not opt for more radical alternatives with barely disguised anti-Semitic and xenophobic undertones, such as Samobrona, the rural 'self-defence' party, or Party X, headed by Mr Stan Tyminski, the populist Polish-Canadian, who gained more than 3m votes when he stood against President Lech Walesa in the 1990 presidential elections. Keeping his party together in the face of radical siren songs from both right and left promises to prove a difficult task for Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader. These strains first emerged earlier this year when he persuaded his party to support the coalition government in a vote for mass privatisation involving foreign investment managers. Mr Kwasniewski, a 39-year-old pragmatic former reform communist who played a key role in the peaceful handover of power to Solidarity in 1989, knows the SLD's internal divisions would widen if it wins enough votes on Sunday to become part of a future centre-left coalition government. He would then have to satisfy the aspirations of his core supporters for more social security spending and job creation schemes. But this would lead to higher inflation and destroy the party's credibility as a genuinely modernising force. Mr Kwasniewski knows that it will take time before economic growth can deliver the higher living standards his voters are looking for. So no matter how many votes his party wins on Sunday Mr Kwasniewski now says that he will only take part in a future coalition if it enjoys a majority strong and stable enough to run a full four-year parliamentary term. What he wants to avoid at all costs is to share the responsibility of power in a weak coalition with the prospect of having to face early elections before the economy is able to deliver the goods.</p>

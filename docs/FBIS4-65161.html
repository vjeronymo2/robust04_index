			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nicholas Wood report: "Hurd Offers Tory Sceptics </F> Pick'n'Mix Vision of Europe"]    [Text] John Major's vision of a Britain at the heart of  Europe was drastically revised by Douglas Hurd yesterday as he  mounted a new attempt to stifle Tory feuding before the June  European elections.    The Foreign Secretary dismissed Eurosceptic fears that the  country was moving inexorably towards a European superstate.  Instead, the impetus was towards a multispeed Europe in which  countries such as Britain would be free to move into the slow  lane at will.    Mr Hurd told the Scottish Conservative Party conference in  Inverness that the "new Europe" would be marked by greater  diversity and flexibility. Already, sub-groups of member states  worked together on matters of common interest while others stood  aloof. Examples included the ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism] --  where Britain and Italy were no longer members the frontier-free  customs union based on the Benelux states, and the Western  European Union -- the defence grouping excluding Ireland.    Mr Hurd said: "This is a multitrack, multispeed, even  multilayered approach which will increasingly be the way of the  future. It threatens no one. A more flexible Europe offers more  scope to involve countries which are not full members in the  activities of the union." Later, speaking to reporters, he  spoke of Britain "picking and choosing" from the European menu.    Although Mr Hurd denied that he was consigning Britain to  the  European slow lane -- shorthand for hardline Euroscepticism --  the clear thrust of his message was that the sceptics fears were  groundless and that Germany, for instance, was moving Britains  way over deregulation and subsidiarity. But these worries still  surfaced in the debate as Mr Hurd faced calls for a referendum  on a single currency and warnings that if the Government did not  heed popular alarm about loss of powers to Brussels it would be  "annihilated" in June.    The Foreign Secretary contrasted Tory defence of Britains  interest in Europe with Labour and Liberal Democrat alleged  readiness to accept a federal superstate. He also repeated his  warning to the party "not to scratch at old wounds" and  concentrate on the Europe of the future.    "As strong pro-Europeans we shall campaign on the open  trading, deregulating, co-operative Europe which we want. Our  opponents will stick to the out-of-date notion that the only  good European is one who transfers chunks of power to Brussels  at regular intervals until there is one centralised executive  and one centralised parliament."    Mr Hurd made jobs and the national veto his main themes. The  opposition parties would sign the social chapter and throw  people out of work. They would abandon the veto and "yield on  all points."</p>

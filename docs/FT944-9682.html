			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / China to overhaul social security China plans sweeping reforms of its welfare system to provide a social security net for urban employees, many of whose jobs are under threat in ailing state enterprises. The official Xinhua news agency yesterday reported that next year 'top priority' would be given to building a better insurance system for unemployment, pensions and medical care. China's plans to overhaul its existing rudimentary social security system reflects growing concern about the effects of changes that have all but wiped out the previous cradle-to-grave welfare arrangements based on individual work units. Municipalities such as Shanghai have been experimenting with new social security measures for the past year or so, but Beijing has clearly decided that political pressures oblige it to overhaul its existing schemes. Plans to construct a comprehensive social security net for China's approximately 100m urban workers come in response to strong pressures from increasing numbers of unemployed and under-employed workers. China's official urban unemployment stands at 2.6 per cent, but this figure vastly understates the problem. Numbers of jobless in some industrial cities may be as high as 20 per cent of the workforce. Under the proposed new scheme all enterprises, including state-owned, collective, joint venture and private ones, will have to take out unemployment insurance at a cost of 1 per cent of pay-roll. This money will be paid into a nationally administered fund. The government is also planning to establish new superannuation and medical care arrangements for pensioners. This move reflects official concern over the fate of many pensioners buffeted by rising prices. The authorities also announced they would set up a special insurance fund for people laid off from bankrupt enterprises and enterprises undergoing reorganisation. Beijing has made reform of its state enterprises, including liquidation of the worst cases, its main priority, but has hesitated to implement its plans because of fears of worker unrest. The establishment of a new system is an attempt to put in place social security arrangements for the long term. But China faces technical difficulties establishing such comprehensive schemes. New welfare arrangements are expected to be a drain on the budget as China proceeds with a painful rationalisation of its state sector where an estimated 50 per cent of enterprises are losing money. China has completed a draft law to cover safety in its nuclear power industry and expects the legislation to be ratified soon by its parliament, the National People's Congress, the official People's Daily said yesterday, Reuter adds from Beijing. The Nuclear Safety Department, responsible for drafting the law, has already announced 16 regulations governing nuclear safety and issued 60 documents to serve as guidelines for nuclear safety, the newspaper said. Nineteen more regulations on nuclear safety are still being drafted. 'This will enable administration of our nuclear safety to come on track through a law,' the newspaper said. China's fledgling nuclear industry has never reported an accident or polluted the environment, it said. China plans to have 10,000 MW of nuclear generating capacity operational or under construction by the year 2001.</p>

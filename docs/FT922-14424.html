			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / People: Musical chairs at Hillsdown Hillsdown Holdings, the international food group, is making a number of appointments to address the development of its North American business and the European single market. Charles Bowen is moving to Canada to run Maple Leaf Foods, the 56-per-cent owned North American subsidiary. Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, says Maple Leaf has reached the stage when the most of the rationalisation has been done and Bowen is the 'ideal chap to develop the business' as he had a lot of experience in North America and the group needed a main board director resident there. In Europe the group is looking at product categories on a Europe-wide basis not by market. Bart Constandse will become chairman of the Premier companies  -such as Cadbury's biscuits brand - in the UK and Europe, and will join the main board. Michel Buswell will be responsible for meat across Europe, Keith Lillington will take charge of canning and bottling on a European basis. Michael Teacher is appointed managing director of a new group set up to run the furniture and specialist companies.</p>

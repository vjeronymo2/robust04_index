			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Menu which caters for all tastes  -The Budget and Small Businesses IT IS a rare chancellor who can devise a Budget which satisfies the demands of small businesses. Keeping such a diverse group of business owners happy is a difficult task. It is, therefore, no small tribute to Norman Lamont that the menu served up on Tuesday drew almost unanimous approval from small business organisations. The one-person start-up, the established growing business and the entrepreneur on the verge of selling up - all were catered for. In their enthusiasm, they seemed willing to forget that nothing was done to introduce more generous investment allowances, reduce the impact of inheritance tax or to replace the business expansion scheme, to expire in December. They did get a carefully chosen mix of measures intended to simplify the tax system, reduce red tape and improve the workings of small business programmes. Some scepticism remains as to whether all these objectives will be achieved, but at least the intention is there. Few subjects raise temperatures among the small business community more than VAT, and the chancellor responded to this. Lamont reduced the qualifying period for bad debt relief from 12 to six months. He also increased the turnover ceiling for cash accounting - the threshold below which businesses do not have to pay VAT until they have received payment from customers - Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 350,000. These changes will give business a one-off saving of Pounds 150m. Other VAT moves will allow the business owner to sleep more easily at night. The draconian nature of the penalties which can be imposed by Customs &amp; Excise has been a source of serious concern. The chancellor has proposed reforming the application of the serious misdeclaration penalty so that it is used only against larger, persistent offenders. He will also allow Customs some discretion. Previously, the penalties were automatic and did not take into account the circumstances of the case. However, the chancellor was unable to raise the VAT threshold by more than the rate of inflation, to Pounds 37,600. Last year, he persuaded the European Commission to allow an increase in excess of inflation. Deregulation is in favour with ministers and several measures were intended to achieve this. Debate about removing the small firms' audit has continued for more than a decade, but there are signs that action finally will be taken. A discussion paper is to be produced by the department of trade and industry and it seems likely that businesses below the VAT threshold will be let off the audit hook. A desire to deregulate and simplify also lies behind plans to allow 8m self-employed and other tax-payers to calculate their own returns for the Inland Revenue. The aim is to reduce the amount of to-ing and fro-ing between the taxpayer and the taxman but cut out estimated assessments, appeals, postponements and revised assessments. Under the new system, which will not take effect until the 1996-97 tax year, most tax returns will be accepted by the Revenue - but it will have the right to check them if it has doubts. Taxpayers who are late with their returns or their payments will face extra charges. Taxpayers will pay tax on the current year rather than on previous years, removing the cash flow advantages. The response from business has been mixed. Some wonder if the self-employed really will feel confident enough to dispense with a tax adviser and compile their own returns. The uniform business rate has imposed a heavy burden on traders, particularly retailers in the south of England, and there have been pleas for an easing of its impact. The chancellor went some way to meeting these by agreeing to hold the rate of increase at the level of inflation for the second year running. No business will face an increase of more than 3.6 per cent. The loan guarantee scheme has always been regarded as a poor substitute for the more generous cheap loan packages available to small businesses in Germany but it has provided a life-line to many small firms which do not meet the banks' definition of a backable proposition. The easing of the scheme's terms announced by Lamont should make it more attractive, but this will continue to depend on the willingness of the individual bank manager to put it to use. The present premium of 2 1/2 per cent will be cut to 1 1/2 per cent for variable loans and only 0.5 per cent for fixed-rate loans. The maximum eligible loan will rise by Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000, while the proportion covered by the guarantee will rise from 70 to 85 per cent. The loan guarantee scheme tends to be used by businesses which are expanding but, for entrepreneurs at the other end of the business life cycle, the chancellor also had good news. Many feel locked into their business because of the high level of capital gains tax triggered when they sell. In response to lobbying from the venture capital industry, Lamont has agreed to allow roll-over relief so long as the proceeds of selling a business are re-invested in another unquoted company. 'A clever Budget in a difficult economic climate' was the general view of small firms' lobbyists.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Rumbustious style that cannot disguise harsh reality - Philip Stephens considers whether the chancellor has been weakened in the past days Mr Kenneth Clarke has lived at the Commons despatch box these past 10 days. It was the chancellor who opened the fateful debate on European Union finances which tore open the party's wounds over Europe. Then the Budget. Then a vain attempt to rescue the proposed increase in value added tax on domestic fuel. Finally yesterday came the 'mini-Budget' - or as he preferred to describe it, the 'corrigendum' - to plug the financial gap left by the government's worst parliamentary defeat since 1979. On each occasion Mr John Major had sat by his side - most of the time passive, sometimes scowling, occasionally chuckling, but always wondering whether Mr Clarke's combative self-confidence was helping or hindering his government's attempts to climb out from an ever deeper political hole. Behind the two men, Tory MPs on the restless, rebellious back benches have looked on with mixed emotions. Many have contrasted the chancellor's rumbustious dismissal of the government's calamities with the tired demeanour of the prime minister. Journalists in the Commons press gallery have nodded assent as Mr Clarke has soaked up the political punches from the opposition and Tory rebels alike. Ken, after all, is an insider's politician, relaxed, witty and never lost for a riposte at the despatch box. But the admiration has not been universal. Others in his party judge that Mr Clarke has been seriously damaged these past few days. Politics is often as much about perceptions as about reality, he declared during one of this week's Commons performances. But the chancellor cannot disguise the reality that he is the first holder of the post to lose an important tax measure since Mr Denis Healey in the chaotic final days of the last Labour government. Nor can he hope that yesterday's package of tax increases to fill the financial gap will be popular either in the country or with his critics on the Tory right. Some of his friends blame the party whips. They miscalculated, the argument runs, the extent of opposition from the nine Eurosceptic rebels exiled from the parliamentary party last week. But Mr Clarke too failed to appreciate the anger in the country at the imposition of higher-rate VAT on fuel - an anger which emboldened usually loyal Tory MPs to join the irreconcilables in the revolt. Then there is Europe. The original idea to make the vote on higher contributions to the EU budget a life-or-death affair for the government came from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. But Mr Clarke, a fervent pro-European, needed no convincing. Impatient at the appeasement of the sceptics during the battle over Maastricht, the chancellor is said to have assured rightwing cabinet colleagues that only one or two would defy the government in a vote of confidence. In the end nine lost the party whip, leaving Mr Major heading, technically at least, a minority government. Some on the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party see, as in most things, a dark conspiracy in all this. The chancellor, after all, wears his pro-Europeanism on his sleeve. He is the only senior member of the cabinet willing to admit he favours a single European currency. Somehow Mr Clarke has calculated that however damaged he is, Mr Major will fare worse. With the prime minister's leadership under threat again, the chancellor can demonstrate that he is made of sterner stuff. Not so. Mr Clarke has been true to his political instincts. He is not, as an old friend in the cabinet puts it, a man for measured argument. His pugnacious style is frequently a strength. But the delight he takes in antagonising opponents - the sceptics on the Tory back benches were brushed aside yesterday as mere Euro-rebels and Mr Gordon Brown, his Labour shadow, dismissed as infantile - is sometimes a weakness. Mr Clarke's relationship with the prime minister is good, though neither would describe it as warm. The chancellor consulted closely with Mr Major on the Budget but made it clear that he was the one running the Treasury. He would jump at the chance of the leadership if Mr Major fell but he is not plotting his removal. Mr Clarke judges that his best chance of the succession lies beyond rather than before the next election. He thinks the prime minister is determined to fight that election. He sees a common interest in the government winning. Then Mr Major probably would step down. As the man who delivered the economic recovery, Mr Clarke would be the front-runner to take over. Maybe. The assumption that the Conservatives still have a reasonable chance of winning the next election looks more heroic by the day. Mr Clarke's own prospects also look more uncertain. Income tax cuts before the election will repair easily the damage of the VAT debacle. But the chancellor's contemptuous dismissal of his party's growing band of Eurosceptics has narrowed his support among the electorate which will chose the next Tory leader. He is still favourite but he needs to start winning friends as well as kicking enemies.</p>

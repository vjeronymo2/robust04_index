			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100  GMT on 4 March reports that "today's Ramadan prayers on Temple  Mount were held in a perfectly orderly fashion. Only some  20,000 worshipers turned out, and when prayers ended about 20  minutes ago, most of the worshipers dispersed."    Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 4 March adds  that in a conversation with correspondent Aviv Bushinsky, Police  Commissioner Rafi Peled said "that the Israel Police reached  agreement with the Muslim waqf on the Temple Mount regarding  ways to prevent confrontations between the Muslim worshipers and  the police forces following Friday prayers. The commissioner  noted that this is one of the steps the police took to prevent  any violence. The other steps included the closure on the  territories, as a result of which only residents of East  Jerusalem attended the prayers. In addition, the police  deployed massive forces in the Old City.    "The commissioner explained that the police decided to  remove  the Jewish worshipers from the Western Wall plaza for a limited  time in order to ensure their safety. He stressed that this  measure was taken in a bid to safeguard the Jewish worshipers."</p>

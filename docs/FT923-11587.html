			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (7): Future hangs on guesswork - In the light of other large-scale projects, the environmental issue is critical PROFESSOR Osman Tekinel, of Cukurova University, likes to put on a slide show for his visitors: a compendium of images of apricots the size of peaches, and bees undergoing the discomfort of artificial insemination. Perhaps the most alarming is the one of the dessicated white soils of Turkey's south-east. It reveals, as the professor put it: 'what happens if we get the irrigation wrong'. Today the Gap project provides a range of puzzles for a whole range of Turkish scientists, from soil engineers to ecologists, hydrologists, even - it seems - bee experts. The area was, after all, part of the 'Fertile Crescent' in ancient times. Professor Tekinel and other members of the Agriculture faculty at Cukurova University are in little doubt that it can be part of it again. But no one underestimates the challenges. The environmental issue is of urgent concern, particularly in light of the experience of other large-scale irrigation projects - the most notorious example being the Soviet Aral Sea development. In the Gap region, humidity levels alone are expected to triple over a period of 25 years, as a result of evaporation once the irrigation canals are filled. What effect this will have on the micro-climate one can only guess at. Increased pesticide and fertiliser used on such soils will also result in higher pollution levels - affecting, in turn, the water sources. To assess the environmental impact of the expected industrialisation is a job for the future. Today it is the Gap authority's task to install a irrigation system. Surface irrigation currently looks like the chosen system, particularly if - as seems likely - the farmers choose to grow cotton, But surface irrigation consumes more water than sprinkler or drip methods. Drip, for example, is estimated to save 50 per cent of the water, and adds 30 per cent to the yield. Surface systems could also prove even more of a problem for the soils, as salt deposits increase with evaporation. With the low precipitation, the water table is currently at around 135 metres. However, during the irrigation season, there is normally ground water much closer to the surface, where there is an impervious clay band. If excessive irrigation acts to raise the water level, this will add to the salinity problems in the critical area of the plant's roots. At a 30 hectare research station in the Harran plain the university is experimenting on soil and seed types, planting and rotation patterns, and different water uses. Professor Tekinel, like many Turks working on the Gap project, remains optimistic. 'We have the world's largest wheat experiment - 110 varieties.' There are also 110 varieties of strawberries, mulched under plastic sheeting. 'He didn't believe we could do it, 12.8 tonnes of maize in one hectare,' he says, chalking up the name of the 'doubting Thomas' German professor on the lecture room blackboard. Some of his colleagues are more worried. 'The changes to the natural environment could be disastrous. We have to be very careful,' says Professor Ural Dinc, director of the remote sensing unit at Cukurova. Professor Dinc is conducting a detailed soil survey of the region, half of which has already been mapped using satellite imagery. It will be too late, he says, once the land comes under cultivation. His research will feed into policy decisions on crop patterns. 'This is less important for annual crops, where farmers will be given a selection of five or six different types. But for fruit trees it is critical to match the soil types." Professor Dinc's other concern is the impact of mechanisation, as farmers start to use tractors and other heavy harvesting machinery. His research is looking at the effect of compact soils, and on the disturbance associated with mechanisation. But both professors agree on the most important thing, extension skills. Unless the farmers are taught the new irrigated farming methods, the problems of salinity could easily arise. Studies in the Cukurova irrigated scheme show that farmers believe the more water applied the better the yield. Clearly one question is the pricing policy for the water. But - as Professor Dinc says - 'that is a matter for the politicians'.</p>

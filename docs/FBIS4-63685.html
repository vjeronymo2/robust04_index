			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, May 20, INA--Baghdad Mayorality has called  upon international and humanitarian organisations the world over  to take a swift action to save Iraq's environment and treat  environmental pollution that poses major threats to the lives of  Iraqi people.    In a press conference held recently, Baghdad Mayor Tahir  Muhammad Hassun shed light on the environmental hazards that  ensured from the direct and indirect effects of the U.S.-led  aggression against Iraq. In an urgent call to international and  humanitarian organisations all over the world, Mr. Hassun urged  for an immediate action to save the Iraqi environment.    The "Baghdad Call" aims at attracting the world's attention  to the great damage inflicted by the U.S.-allied war and the  continuation of the economic sanctions, the mayor said. He  added that Iraq's environment has been greatly affected by the  barbaric bombing by allied forces during the U.S.-led military  aggression, indicating that the destruction of electric power  faculties and water and waste water treatment plants has led to  a cycle of contamination.    The mayor added that Baghdad is calling for help because the  embargo has greatly affected the level of municipal services,  noting that Baghdad is some 900 square kilometres in area and  has a 4.5 million population. He said Baghdad city is divided  into some 1.3 [figure as received] municipal units has some 467  residential quarters. The mayor added that due to the  continuation of the embargo the average water delivery has  decreased from 45 liters per capita per day (L/C/D) before the  war to reach some 18 liters per capita per day after the war.    The mayor elaborated that severe damage has been inflicted  upon water and waste water treatment plants. Moreover, fresh  sewage is either overflowing in the streets or being discharged  into the Tigris and the Euphrates without any treatment.  Furthermore, allied bombing of roads and lack of spare parts  needed to carry out maintenance because of the sanctions had  caused cracks in sewer lines which in consequence caused ground  water contamination. Many of these systems are either out of  operation or operated at a reduced capacity because of pump  breakdown, said the mayor.    The ultimate threat is posed by the large quantities of  sewage which flow untreated into the country's two major rivers  and run downstream. These rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris,  constitute the main water sources of the country, said the  mayor, adding that some 50 per cent, that is some five cubic  metres per second sewage water is being pumped directly into  rivers.    He added that Baghdad outskirts are still suffering from  lack  of potable water, noting that about one-third of Baghdad city  lacks waste-water treatment system due to the stoppage of work  on sewage and waste-water treatment projects due to lack of  spare parts and materials due to the sanctions.    Moreover, the work of waste collecting vehicles is hampered  by lack of maintenance and spare parts causing in consequence  heaps of garbage in residential quarters of Baghdad, noting that  the number of workers has also decreased from 6332 to some 2500  ones.    Solid waste disposal has been disrupted, consequently  causing  air pollution because people often tend to incinerate rubbish,  said the mayor.    Mr. Hassun added that the sanctions have also brought work  on  renovation project of Baghdad city of a standstill, noting that  work on the said project has started in 1980s. He added that  the project aims at renovating and refurbishing ancient and  historical sites and holy shrines and historical mosques and  churches.    Mr. Hassun warned of the spread of epidemics saying that  people of Baghdad city suffer from the wide spread of epidemics  resulting from environmental pollution, the accumulation of  garbage and lack of municipal services, noting that Baghdad  hospitals hae reported a noticeable increase in communicable  diseases.    The mayor urged health organisations the world over to act  swiftly for lifting the 45-month-old economic sanction imposed  on Iraq.</p>

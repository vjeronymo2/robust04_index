			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminister Report: Legg refutes allegations of impropriety Mr Barry Legg, the Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South-West, was chief Tory whip during his 12-year spell as a Westminster councillor and thus played an important role in formulating council policy, David Owen and Peter Marsh write. Mr Legg said yesterday: 'I utterly refute any suggestion of impropriety. When the time comes for me to put my case I will be answering in full the matters raised in the report.' Mr Derrick Conner, treasurer of the Bletchley Conservative Club, which lies in Mr Legg's constituency, said: 'I can't pick any holes in his performance as an MP. As far as I am concerned he is innocent until proved guilty.' Since being elected to parliament in April 1992 for the new constituency of Milton Keynes South-West, he has made his mark as an astute member of the Treasury and civil service select committee and as a Maastricht rebel. A co-founder of the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward, he was among the hard core of Tory backbenchers who most uncompromisingly opposed the Maastricht bill's passage in the Commons last year. This stance will have won him few friends in the Conservative Whips' Office. Mr Legg, an accountant, is a former director of the food group Hillsdown Holdings, remaining as a consultant until last year. He received a Pounds 200,000 severance payment when he left the board after becoming an MP. Labour - which lost out last time by nearly 4,700 votes - would be disappointed not to take his seat even in a general election. If a by-election were to result from the shadow which yesterday's report has cast over Mr Legg's political career, it would expect to win with a large majority. He first ran for parliament in 1983 when he challenged Mr Derek Foster, now Labour chief whip, for the safe Labour seat of Bishop Auckland, losing by 4,300 votes. Mr Foster remembers him as a 'fairly conventional Tory opponent'. Last summer Mr Legg co-authored a radical pamphlet recommending ways of cutting Pounds 8bn from the social security budget. Ideas included raising the retirement age to 67 and integrating non-contributory benefits into a new 'whole-person' benefit.</p>

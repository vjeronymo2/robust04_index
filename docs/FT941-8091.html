			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia bursts aluminium balloon The aluminium market's balloon was burst yesterday by the Russian official who single-handedly pumped it up just a week ago. The metal's three month delivery price climbed to an 18-month peak of Dollars 1,332 a tonne last week following Mr Vladimir Kalchenko's assurance on Tuesday that his country's output cuts of 100,000 tonnes under the multilateral scheme agreed in Brussels last month would grow to 300,000 tonnes by the end of April. But yesterday, Mr Kalchenko, first deputy general director of producers' group Aluminiy, told the Reuter news agency in Moscow that Russia was suspending further cuts because it was not satisfied with other producers' compliance. The LME price quickly fell to Dollars 1,303.25 a tonne, down Dollars 18.25 on the day, but still more than Dollars 70 ahead of the level ruling at the time of Mr Kalchenko's original statement. 'We have already cut output by more than one third of what we promised,' the Aluminiy official said yesterday. 'We will continue only after we see other world producers doing the same.' He pointed to the failure of French producer Pechiney to give details on the size and timing of its promised output cuts as 'an exact example of what we are displeased with'. Pechiney said on February 10 that it would lower production temporarily but had not decided where the cuts would be made or how big these would be. Some of Brazil's aluminium producers are studying the possibility of reducing production but so far no new cuts are planned, according to company officials, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro. At a meeting of the Brazilian Aluminium Association on Friday, producers decided against industry-wide cuts and agreed that individual companies should be responsible for production levels. 'We have not decided whether or not to cut production,' said Mr Carlos Ermirio de Moraes, director of Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio, which produces 215,000 tonnes of aluminium a year. 'We do not think, however, that cuts should start with CBA'. Aluvale, an aluminium holding of state mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, was also considering cutting production at its two associated companies, Valesul and Albras, said Mr Francisco Pitella, the sales director. But he added that an early decision was not expected.</p>

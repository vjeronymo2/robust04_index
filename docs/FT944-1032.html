			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Down to earth and looking for foreign growth: Singapore Telecom's tough task of living up to lofty expectations Has Singapore Telecom, south-east Asia's biggest listed company, bitten off more than it can chew? When ST was partially privatised last year even the most sceptical brokers and analysts were impressed. The float of 11 per cent of ST (the other 89 per cent is held by the government) gave the island republic's telecommunications and postal group a market capitalisation of more than SDollars 55bn (Pounds 24bn). ST, servicing a country with a population of only 2.8m, was propelled into the top 30 of the world's largest companies, on par with British Telecom and above giants such as Ford and Unilever. Now the euphoria surrounding ST has disappeared. ST shares, which peaked at SDollars 5 soon after its October 1993 flotation, have dropped back to around SDollars 2.80. Some blame the fall on a general dip in the market: ST accounts for about 50 per cent of Singapore's total market capitalisation. But interim results announced last month showing a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to SDollars 900m produced little reaction. 'The results were a non-event,' said one analyst. 'ST is still trading at a price earnings ratio of more than 30. People who bought high should be worried. If they are going to get their money back it will be a very long-term affair.' The problem for ST is to live up to the high expectations evident during last year's flotation. ST's deputy president is Mr Lee Hsien Yang. The youngest son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, Mr Lee, who is in his 30s, joined ST this year. He points out that so far ST has achieved its profit forecasts. 'We said then that we would achieve 12 per cent profit growth,' he says. 'Last year it was 15 per cent and we can continue to perform well. The share price has underperformed. We are confident things will change.' Analysts say ST is a well-run, efficient company. It earns revenues per line of Dollars 1,750, against Hong Kong Telecom's Dollars 1,000 per line or Telekom Malaysia's Dollars 640. But with limited room for expansion in its home market there is concern about where future long-term growth will come from. ST has a monopoly on national and international communications until 2007 and on mobile services until 1997. 'Singapore should not be compared with countries like France or Britain but rather with other cities - like New York or Tokyo,' says Mr Lee. 'We still have some way to go to catch up with line penetration in those cities.' Singapore's telecoms network is among the world's most advanced. By 1997 the whole island will have access to a fibre optic network. Mr Lee says that the potential for add-on services, including multimedia, is considerable. In the last six-month period ST's add-on services grew more than 20 per cent. Mobile services are a strong growth area - up 40 per cent in the last six months. Seven per cent of Singaporeans have mobile phones, one of the highest rates in Asia, and 27 per cent have pagers - the highest rate in the world. ST knows that in the long-term it cannot rely on domestic operations for growth. It has been taking tentative steps outside Singapore with SDollars 600m of investments in 10 countries. ST is still a small player in international telecoms: profits from such operations as mobile services in Norway and a SDollars 200m investment in cable and telephony links in the UK will take time before they have an impact on earnings. ST is seeking to sell its expertise in fast expanding regional markets. But the regulatory environment in many Asian countries is still unattractive to outside operators. Just under 50 per cent of ST's total revenues come from international direct dialled (IDD) calls. In the latest six-month period international traffic grew 12 per cent, but the company is under constant pressure to revise its rates in line with the big operators in other countries, particularly in the US. ST's revenues are also being affected by the increasing use in Singapore of US-based callback services which allow users to direct overseas calls through the US to take advantage of lower rates. ST recently made IDD rate cuts, making some calls up to 48 per cent cheaper. Analysts say ST will have trouble recouping the drop in annual revenues of more than SDollars 200m. Mr Lee disagrees: 'We still expect the healthy growth in international traffic to continue. As for the callback operators, people are beginning to realise that they cannot offer the service of companies like ours and there are hidden costs involved.' But despite Mr Lee's optimism, the jury is still out on ST's long-term prospects. Some brokers say ST has become the victim of the government's aggressive share pricing strategy at the time of flotation. Fifty per cent of the offer was offered at SDollars 2 or under to Singaporeans who could buy shares for their provident funds. The rest was offered to locals and foreigners at SDollars 3.60. 'The government hyped up the flotation to unrealistic levels,' says one analyst. 'It reaped millions from the exercise. But ST is left holding the baby. There was talk of another tranche of shares being offered. But that looks doubtful in the near future. 'Most Singaporeans are holding on to their shares because they have been promised share bonuses. Those are going to affect the pricing still further. ST has to pull something fairly dramatic out of the hat to improve its market performance.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- YOUTH AND OPTIMISM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 6 months to Sep 30             1994            1993       Growth                        (SDollars m)    (SDollars m)          (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover                    1,750.9         1,529.5         14.5 Operating profit              885.3           737.9         20.0 Profit before tax             900.0           776.7         15.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Singapore Telecom  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

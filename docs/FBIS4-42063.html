			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DW"-signed report: "Raid on Leading PKK Terrorists"] </F>   [Text] Saarbruecken -- In a search for PKK [Workers Party  of Kurdistan] leaders, a special police unit stormed a secret  meeting of Kurds and temporarily arrested 62 Kurds in  Saarbruecken during the weekend. According to the federal  public prosecutor, all 62 Kurds, except one who has been staying  in Germany illegally, were released by Saturday [28 May] night.    Police had prepared the large-scale operation after being  tipped off about the secret meeting taking place in the building  of the Kurdish Cultural Association in Saarbruecken. Apart from  the GSG-9 antiterrorist unit, officers of the Federal Office of  Criminal Investigations and of Saarbruecken police were involved  in the raid. According to the Federal Public Prosecutor, there  was no major resistance to the operation.    The authority says it has been conducting investigations  since last autumn against PKK leaders who are suspected of  forming a terrorist association. The reason for this is a  number of offenses committed against Turkish institutions in  Germany in 1992, 1993, and 1994 .</p>

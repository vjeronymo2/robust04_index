			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Formation of 'incorporated Names' begins A Pounds 200m-Pounds 300m investment company that could develop the first 'incorporated Names' at Lloyd's is to be launched by Sedgwick, the insurance broker, in the autumn. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities house, announced yesterday that it was to advise Sedgwick on the formation of the company. BZW will work on the project with CLM, a Sedgwick subsidiary formed earlier this year, and aims to launch the investment company in the autumn in time to participate at the market next year. The new company will participate in Lloyd's through a group of subsidiaries, each of which would function as an 'incorporated Name', backing a number of underwriting syndicates. BZW will market the company among both institutions and individual investors. It intends to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The announcement of BZW's backing for the project represents an important fillip for Lloyd's, which yesterday announced that it was confident that the regulatory hurdles preventing the entry of corporate capital to the market would be overcome. Lloyd's announced in its business plan that it intended to persuade corporate investors to join the market in April, following the erosion of its capital base in recent years. The new document provides details not included in the business plan. For example, Lloyd's aims to limit the amount that an incorporated Name can invest on any one syndicate to 20 per cent of the syndicate's capacity (the amount of premium it is allowed to underwrite) while in the aggregate, incorporated Names will be allowed to provide no more than half of a syndicate's overall capacity. However, there are indications that Lloyd's, which last week posted a record loss of Pounds 2.91bn for 1990, has some way to go before it can convince existing Names to fully support its plans. Many Names attending the annual meeting of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the largest organisation of Names, believed that they were being discriminated against in favour of corporate investors. Mr Larry Scott, of Grimston Scott, a firm of Lloyd's advisers, said: 'There is enormous suspicion of corporate capital.' He said many Names were going through a crash course learning about Lloyd's business. There are indications that publicity linked to the mounting legal disputes involving Names has been hampering the efforts of financiers working on corporate capital schemes. Although bankers involved in a number of corporate capital schemes are bullish about the prospects for profits as a result of rising insurance rates, they say that some possible investors have been put off by adverse publicity linked to the legal actions.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> S&amp;P Downgrades Ford, Chrysler: Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Group  downgraded its credit ranking for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., signaling  sagging faith in the auto industry's finances.  </P> <P> Moody's Investor Services Inc. said it is considering whether to change  Chrysler's rating. The ratings reflect how Wall Street views companies' credit  worthiness. Lower ratings generally mean that firms must pay higher interest to  borrow in the credit markets. S&amp;P dropped Ford one notch to AA-minus from  AA, considered a high level of investment grade securities. Chrysler fell to  S&amp;P's lowest investment-grade, BBB-minus from BBB.  </P></p>

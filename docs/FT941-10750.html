			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Arts: Bedlam and bravery in Spring Collection - Clement Crisp finds dancers lurking around car bonnets and cranes, wheelchairs, and Indian tradition in transition at The Place and the South Bank La danse, it says on the programme cover, c'est une declaration d'amour. It is ninny-ish aphorisms like this which make me want to see heads on spikes outside The Place and the concrete hell of the South Bank. These were the weekend locations for an introductory tasting of 'British independent dance' being offered to audiences that included delegates from hither and European yon, in what I take to be a marketing exercise. And what, I wonder, did they make of 'Independent dance' that involved Bharata Natyam in transition, wheelchair performers, inept feminism, Hare Krishna posings, and messages about social identity? I saw three of seven performances on offer - La danse is also a declaration of stamina - and my comments are a first report on a burst of activity which occupies The Place for the next twelve weeks. (One item will be concerned with 'guilt; three men and a five metre steel crane'. The crane, I trust, has passed the age of consent). Friday night's opening seemed a fair enough sample of the problems - aesthetic and technical - that face our dance adventurers. Both Ben Craft and Gary Lambert are strong dancers. Their jointly-made Cold Ground Drifting  -titles are obscurantist, and so is much of the dancing, in these affairs - finds four dancers lurking around structures made of car-bonnets. Nothing much happens, though there is an air of menace to the piece, and the technical skills on view are fine. About Yael Flexer's Dot . . dot . . dot it needs just to be said that a small but stalwart girl dancer badgered a tall male violinist. The parent company is called 'Bedlam'. Enough] Two other pieces touched on ethnic identity. Jacob Marley tells us in British Jungle Dances that his parents were white and he was black, and he feared that he might be sent back to the jungle. The surprising result, given this statement, is a suite for Union Dance which is elegant, supple - movement curves in and out of gesture and pose - and very attractive as it responds to sophisticated African songs. Shobana Jeyasingh's Romance, with Footnotes was, by contrast, worthy, dull. Indian dance is in transition here - an inevitable development as women's identities change in society - and I longed for more of the bravura stampings and transcendent rhythms of Bharata Natyam, and something less compromised by cliches of modern dance. Saturday afternoon at the Purcell Room began in fine style with Mark Balwin's realisation of Poulenc's Soirees de Nazelles. Baldwin appeared as a guiding participant, with two excellent colleagues - Sara Matthews and Lee Boggess. His manner is oblique, and the score becomes an excuse for dances that touch slyly on the game of flirtation. Underneath the mocking there is sincerity, and though I found Baldwin's own stage persona somewhat petulant and limp-limbed, the piece is neat, off-beat, welcome. The rest of the afternoon was a vexation to the spirit. About Emilyn Claid's Virginia Minx at play I note simply that Miss Claid's performance was laboured in mime and stratospherically winsome, and that it was too soon after lunch to sit through such behaviour. (Frankly, it was too soon after the Big Bang). She was aided and abetted by Heather Joyce, who played the saxophone and keened. There was a sound-track by Sylvia Hallett hideously right for the event. The closing Corpus Antagonus was made by the admirable Russell Maliphant for Ricochet Dance. Two men, three women, with apricot outfits and sub-Hindu manners, looked like five characters in search of an Ashram. There were slow curvings and coilings, the ringing of tiny bells and jolly drummings, and the suspicion that someone somewhere was looking for a Swami. As the piece reached its climax, the bodies collapsed and curved onwards in thrilling fashion, but the sum effect was oddly dated - something lost on the hash-route to Katmandu and enlightenment in the 1960s. The day closed with Candoco, a company which unites wheelchair performers and able-bodied dancers, at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. I admired the troupe last year, and hoped that they might expand their activities with new choreographies. The first part of their programme showed this in a trio for Celeste Dandeker, chair bound, Adam Benjamin and Kuldip Singh-Barmi, made by its players, which spoke of love, reliance, pain, in vivid movement terms, not least in Dandeker's potent gestures. Equally good was a duet by Jodi Falk for David Toole who, without legs, is yet a vital performer, and Singh-Barmi. The dance explores mobility, response in partnering, perspectives on the world. I thought it brave, uncompromising. So, too, a study by Siobhan Davies to a Gavin Bryars' string quartet. Davies has seized on the possibilities of wheelchair movement - gliding speed - and the emotional interplay possible between physical freedom and constraint. The result is a subtly compelling view of what Candoco can do as artists. Yet everything that these three works established about the company - dignity, handicaps rejected, art born of difficulty - was destroyed by the final offering, Emilyn Claid's Back to Front, staged in collaboration with the cast, and set to a raucous accompaniment by Andrew Deakin. Vulgarity, cheap jokes, gimcrack sexuality and gratuitous violence, made the performers look what they certainly are not - objects for prurient gaze, and for the inane laughter the audience gave them. It is wholly unworthy. Spring Collection is supported by Northern Telecom Europe</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Output price rise lowest since 1986 Factory output prices barely changed last month, suggesting that inflationary pressures remain weak in spite of the longer-term inflation concerns voiced by the Bank of England last week. Producer output prices - the cost of goods leaving factories - rose a seasonally-adjusted 2.2 per cent in the year to April compared with the previous year, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. This headline rise was the lowest since December 1986, down from the 2.8 per cent rise seen in March. But though output figures are regarded as a good guide to future inflation, analysts pointed out that last month's result was slightly distorted by the absence of a March Budget this year. Measured on a monthly basis, excluding petroleum, tobacco, food and beverages, underlying output prices were unchanged in April, after small rises in the previous two months. The headline figure, which includes all goods, rose by 0.3 per cent in April compared with March. This measurement is regarded as less accurate because of the price volatility of goods such as petroleum. Input prices - the price of fuel and raw materials bought by industry - also remained subdued. The seasonally-adjusted input price index rose by 0.5 per cent between March and April. Measured over the year to April, input prices fell by 1.5 per cent annually, compared with a fall of 2.8 per cent in the year to March. The Treasury yesterday said the figures were evidence of a 'pretty good outlook' for inflation over the coming months. 'The figures are further evidence of weak inflationary pressures,' it said, pointing out that underlying output prices were now lower than at any point since the 1960s, barring a couple of months during the second half of 1992. The only worry, analysts said, was a rise in commodity prices, which contributed to a 0.4 per cent rise in the cost of materials and fuels during April. This was primarily due to the rising cost of imported materials, which grew by as much as 0.8 per cent in the food manufacturing sector. Analysts yesterday pointed out that the fact that these rises in input prices had not fed through to output prices. This highlighted the intense competitive pressures in the manufacturing sector - a pressure that was triggering a broader change in business culture, as companies sought to widen the margins by cutting costs rather than raising prices, they added. 'Companies would like to put prices up but they can't because of the competitive pressures in the UK,' said Mr Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist with Natwest Capital Markets. Mr Dicks believes prices are likely to start to pick up again in the summer, as the UK reaches the bottom of the inflation cycle.</p>

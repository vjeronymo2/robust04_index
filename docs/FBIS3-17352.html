			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Republic </F> of Abkhazia Supreme Soviet, by Svetlana Shipunova; place and  date not given: "Between Peace and War"]    [Text] I last met with Vladislav Ardzinba at the end of  August 1993, in Gudauta. At the time combat operations had not  yet ceased on the territory of Abkhazia, but everything already  pointed to the fact that Georgia had lost this war, and everyone  was living in expectation of imminent victory and long-awaited  peace. I talked with the Abkhaz leader about his vision of his  republic's future after the war.    The war ended 30 September. Over the six months since then  Abkhazia has not had time to heal its wounds and to restore  normal life, particularly as Russia has maintained an economic  blockade of the republic throughout the winter. And yet it has  survived! A bread-baking plant, a tobacco factory, and even  enterprises such as Sukhumpribor (the only plant in the former  Union to produce ballpoint pen refills) have been restored and  have started working. Public transport is functioning, and old  people on pensions are provided with three free meals a day in  enterprise cafeterias. In Sukhumi the seafront, public gardens,  and parks have been cleared of obstructions and traces of  fighting, and coffee shops and small stores have started  opening. Of course things are difficult, there is no fuel or  raw materials for enterprises, there is a food shortage, people  live mainly on what they themselves grow, and there is a  catastrophic shortage of money, since Abkhazia has been cut off  financially from both Georgia and Russia.    It is difficult to organize a normal life for people -- as  much as 40 percent of the housing is in an unfit state, blocks  have been destroyed, and apartments looted. A special housing  commission, which includes old people, representatives of the  intelligentsia, and participants in the war, is now working  under the Sukhumi Administration. Housing authorizations  (temporary ones) are issued primarily to families of deceased  persons, to people whose homes have been burned down, and to  invalids from last year's war. Refugees are returning little by  little to Abkhazia -- Russians, Armenians, Greeks, Georgians  (but only those who did not participate in combat operations  against it).    The agonizingly difficult process of restoring a peaceful  life is exacerbated by the fact that there has been no political  settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz problem, and Abkhazia's status  has not been defined.    With the onset of spring people have suddenly started  speaking once again of war and the possible resumption of combat  operations on Abkhazian territory. The situation in this region  has again started to exacerbate, and tension is increasing day  by day. I talked about this with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman  of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Abkhazia. He had just  returned from a big foreign tour -- he had been to Switzerland,  New York, and Moscow, where he met with officials and gave news  conferences.    "Surely not war again?" I asked him. "How do you rate the  likelihood of such a development of events?"    [Ardzinba] There are at least two circumstances that are  intensifying aggressive sentiment in the Georgian leadership and  prompting it to attempt to take revenge. These are, first, the  signing of the treaty with Russia and, second, the support which  Shevardnadze has once again received in the West, particularly  during his recent U.S. trip. I must remind you that, when the  war was still being waged in our country, the Russian leadership  made repeated statements to the effect that no treaty would be  signed with Georgia until the situation in Abkhazia and South  Ossetia had been settled in full. But, despite its own  statements and despite the fact that there has been no  settlement and, what is more, there is still a threat that  combat operations will be resumed, Russia signed the treaty. At  the same time it recognized Georgia's territorial integrity.  What does this mean from a legal viewpoint? Only that Russia  has no territorial claims on Georgia. But the Georgian  leadership interprets this as recognizing that Abkhazia is part  of Georgia, although that is another matter -- a matter of our  internal relations.    [Shipunova] Vladislav Grigoryevich, what danger do you see  in the treaty concluded by Russia and Georgia?    [Ardzinba] The fact that it contains articles on the  handover of arms to Georgia and on assistance for it in  reorganizing the army. Thus, this is a repeat of the situation  which existed in 1992, when Georgia obtained arms under the  Tashkent Agreement -- after which it at once unleashed  aggression. Today, by undertaking to arm Georgia, Russia is  again giving it carte blanche to wage war. Shevardnadze's  repeated statements, notably at a UN Security Council session,  that the situation could get out of control have certainly not  been accidental. Later he will most likely use them to justify  renewing combat operations, particularly as there have already  been several armed raids by Georgia in Galskiy Rayon, on the  border.    [Shipunova] And yet the treaty has not yet been ratified,  has it?    [Ardzinba] That is of no great importance, since a number of  agreements have been signed in addition to the treaty, including  agreements on the status of the border troops, on the status of  the Russian Armed Forces on the territory of Georgia, etc., and  these agreements include the same articles on military questions  as the treaty itself. So these agreements have already started  to be implemented, without any ratification. For example,  Georgian youths will now be drafted into the border troops and  will receive weapons; this work is already being developed.    [Shipunova] Did you make any attempt to prevent the signing  of the treaty, and did you have contacts in this regard with  anyone in the Russian leadership?    [Ardzinba] Unfortunately we are unable to have normal  contacts with the leadership of Russia. All our appeals and  warnings of the possible dangerous development of events have  gone unheeded. Yet not only we but also many political forces  in Russia itself have spoken out against the treaty! There was  the appeal by all factions in the State Duma on the eve of  President Yeltsin's trip to Tbilisi; all the North Caucasus  leaders, who also had a negative attitude to the upcoming  signing, gathered at the Foreign Ministry; there was the appeal  by a whole series of Federation Council members.... To our  great sorrow, all these opinions were also disregarded.    I would like to emphasize that, in the event of Georgia's  commencing combat operations, the responsibility for this will  also lie with those who secured the signing of the  Russian-Georgian treaty.    [Shipunova] What forces are they, do you believe, and who in  Russia could benefit by this?    [Ardzinba] Certain circles in Russia take a strange stand on  their own country's security and pursue a policy in the  interests of the West rather than of Russia itself. But the  West has no need either of a strong Georgia or of a strong  Russia; it is simply using the present situation in our country  to increase its own influence and even presence in this region.    [Shipunova] Do you have in mind the plans to send UN  peacemaking forces into Abkhazia?    [Ardzinba] Shevardnadze does not conceal the reason why he  wants the peacemaking forces. In order to disarm the Abkhaz  army, abolish Abhazia's state power bodies, and set up some  directorate to run our state. Thus, it is a question of  Abkhazia's occupation by UN forces and of those forces'  resolving the problems which Shevardnadze was unable to resolve  with his tanks last year. He evidently received assurances of  support in the United States. Shevardnadze's report to the  Security Council spoke bluntly about creating a precedent for  the use of "blue helmets" in hot spots in the former Union. As  we know, there are many such spots on USSR territory of the  USSR, and once it starts....    [Shipunova] You disagree with this version of a  "settlement." What, then, are your proposals?    [Ardzinba] The point is that our proposals and the Abkhaz  side's position in this conflict in general are hushed up and  distorted in every possible way both in Russia and in the West.  I saw this for myself during my trip abroad and my meetings  with representatives of international organizations. The  Georgian side portrays the matter as though Abkhazia is also  agreeable to the sending in of peacemaking troops throughout the  territory from the Ingur [Inguri] river to the Psou river. This  is not so, in actual fact. Whereas such troops really could  fulfill a disengaging role along the Ingur, which forms the  actual border between Abkhazia and Georgia, I cannot understand  against whom they will guard us on the Psou, which forms the  border between Abkhazia and Russia. Against attack from the  Russian Federation? Or is it that someone would like to station  his troops along Russia's borders?    Our version of a settlement is that the opposing sides  should pull back their troops a certain distance (3-5 km) on the  border along the Ingur and that peacemaking forces should enter  the corridor so formed. At the same time we have always said  that Russian, not UN, troops should be used as peacemaking  troops. International forces would be present here only as  observers. If the chief aim is to be viewed as preventing the  resumption of combat operations, this option is more than  adequate. But the trouble is that Georgia's aim is quite  different, because it does not seek a peace settlement and is  not abandoning its plans to crush and subjugate Abkhazia,  depriving it of its own statehood, i.e. it prefers the  strong-arm option for resolving the problem.    From November 1993 we held talks with the Georgian side in  Geneva and New York, and a memorandum and a communique were  prepared which said that the sides would no longer use force.  There were several opportunities to sign these documents, but  their signing was thwarted, the decisive role in this being  played by Shevardnadze's U.S. trip and by the U.S.  Administration's support for his plans. In the United States  Shevardnadze signed a joint statement with the Americans on  military cooperation, according to which the United States will  assist Georgia in reorganizing and arming the army, and a  document was also signed on the creation of a joint security  program (?!).    One gets the impression that UN membership gives a state the  right to carry out both aggression and genocide against another  people with impunity. Georgia started the war in Abkhazia two  weeks after its admission to the United Nations. It was  admitted contrary to the organization's Charter, being at that  time a country without a legally elected leadership since its  leaders had come in as the result of a coup d'etat. The  decision itself was adopted by means of a poll [oprosnym putem],  so it could be said that it was not Georgia that was admitted to  the United Nations but Shevardnadze, evidently for his past  "services." These violations also formed the basis of the  Georgian leader's further unpunished conduct in respect of other  peoples, moreover human rights are also being grossly violated  in his own country, where what is virtually an authoritarian  regime has been established and all dissidence is crushed.    [Shipunova] Shevardnadze called the Georgian parliament's  decision to dissolve the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet "hasty," thus  apparently dissociating himself from it. What do you think  about this?    [Ardzinba] This is his usual subterfuge, an attempt to  mislead. The decision adopted in Tbilisi stems directly from  Shevardnadze's UN speech, and these are all links in the same  chain. The Georgian parliament's decision is an unlawful  document, it is....    You know, it is a work of literature, running to many pages.  It contains such "pearls" as this, for example: "The  Abkhazians seized part of sovereign Georgia -- Abkhazia...." It  is illegal even from the viewpoint of their own constitution,  which does not feature any Abkhaz ASSR [Autonomous Soviet  Socialist Republic] or any autonomous entities at all. It was  by adopting such a constitution that they initiated the conflict  in the first place. Relations between Georgia and Abkhazia  ceased de facto two years ago. From a legal viewpoint Georgia  and Abkhazia are in no way linked today. There has long been no  Abkhaz ASSR. There is the Republic of Abkhazia with its own  constitution and its own legally elected organs of power.  Therefore it is possible to talk about one thing only -- the  restoration of interstate relations between the two republics by  concluding a treaty. We have been moving toward this, but such  a development of events does not suit Georgia's leaders. So the  Geneva talks are frustrated, the treaty with Russia is signed  regardless of our positions and interests, then comes the appeal  to the United Nations for military aid, and finally the totally  illegal decision of the Georgian parliament is adopted on the  dissolution of our republic's organs of power and even...on the  institution of criminal proceedings against Abkhaz deputies!    By all these actions the Georgian side unilaterally put an  end to the process of a peaceful political settlement.    [Shipunova] What do you intend to do in the present  situation?    [Ardzinba] My trip abroad had the purpose of conveying our  position to the world community and opening eyes to the actual  state of affairs, since Georgia misleads everyone about  Abkhazia's statehood and about our historical and present  relations. The concepts of "separatism" and "violation of  territorial integrity" do not apply to our situation. I met  with UN Security Council President Merimee, with UN Under  Secretary General Goulding, with the ambassadors of a number of  countries, and with representatives of the UN peacemaking forces  command and also of the U.S. Department of State. I believe  that the meetings were mutually useful, since Abkhazia's true  position on all questions of our conflict was explained, and the  Abkhaz leadership's official appeals to the Security Council  were handed over. A great deal came as a revelation to my  interlocutors, because hitherto they had listened to and heard  just one side here -- the Georgian side.    [Shipunova] It is known that you have also proposed to the  leaders of the Federation components in the North Caucasus the  holding of a meeting in Sukhumi....    [Ardzinba] Yes, and I received their agreement in principle  to such a meeting. We have not yet decided finally on the  venue, and the crux of the matter is not whether it is held in  Sukhumi or in one of the North Caucasus capitals. The chief  thing is that we are seeking support not abroad but from our own  compatriots and brothers. We intend, in particular, to invite  representatives of the peoples of the North Caucasus as  permanent observers in Abkhazia.    [Shipunova] Does all this mean that you are preparing for  war? Will a possible decision to send UN troops onto the  territory of Abkhazia mean the start of a new war?    [Ardzinba] I must declare most definitely that we will  perceive any decision to which the Abkhaz side does not agree as  an attempt at occupation, with all the ensuing consequences. It  is not hard to surmise what the result of this will be not only  in Abkhazia but also throughout the Caucasus region. Today we  have been forced to strengthen our defenses, but we are not  abandoning hopes and efforts aimed at resuming the talks  process. If the Georgian parliament repeals its illegal  decision, that will open the way to continuing the peace talks.  We do not want war, and we will do everything to prevent a new  armed clash. This also applies to the question of refugees.  Yes, we oppose the return to Abkhazia of persons who  participated in combat operations with weapon in hand and who  continue to pose a threat to Abkhazia's security. They cannot  return until there has been a full settlement of the conflict.  This insistence of ours is natural. The situation in Abkhazia  today is peaceful and calm. We are endeavoring to maintain it.  But, I repeat, much will depend on the stand that Russia takes  this time. [Ardzinba ends]    I was completing the preparation of this material for  publication when I learned of a statement made by UN Secretary  General Butrus Ghali. In it he admits that the necessary  conditions do not exist in Abkhazia at present for sending in UN  peacemaking forces. This statement inspires hope that common  sense and political realism will, after all, triumph in the  world community's attitude to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. But  Russia, nonetheless, will have the last say. It is still not  too late to prevent new bloodshed.</p>

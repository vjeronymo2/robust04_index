			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Books: Move over cyberpunk, here comes feminism - Science Fiction / Martin Mulligan finds a fantasy classic that Arthur C Clarke would have been proud of among a plethora of new releases IF ANY evidence of the genre's extraordinary vitality were needed, it was supplied in spades by Arthur C. Clarke's recent birthday celebrations in Somerset. The great man flew from Sri Lanka to fete his 75th anniversary at his birthplace in Minehead. The week-long party attracted more luminaries of science fiction than you could shake a zap gun at. The Minehead Space Age Festival comprised a tribute to the man who foresaw the era of the geostationary satellite. What would the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey make of the season's new offerings? One novel dominates the vista. Marge Piercy's Body of Glass (Michael Joseph, 406 pages, Pounds 14.99) elevates its author to the pantheon of haute SF alongside Doris Lessing and Ursula LeGuin. Body of Glass is an outstanding novel in its own right. The reviewer's reflex, confronted by a novel of this scope and size, is to drone on about the Hobbesian vision of the future it depicts; how it represents a tour de force of cyberpunk set pieces (such as the combat inside the computer; the clash with the organ pirates) et cetera. All this, in the case of Body of Glass, would be true, but Piercy's true achievement is to have written a sensitive contemporary novel about a woman assimilating the heartbreak of a failed marriage and scheming to recover custody of her son, and to have done so within the framework of the male-dominated sub-genre of cyberpunk. Now, that is extraordinary. Body of Glass is a remarkable novel, chiefly because it represents a woman invading the male turf of cyberpunk, the principal SF fashion of the 1980s, and reshaping it to convey a post-feminist vision. Cyberpunk's universe, in which computer hackers invade the booby-trapped databases of hostile corporations, and software entertainments plugged directly into the brain keep humanity satisfied and docile, will never be the same. What gives this novel its edge is the depth of feeling and experience from which characters and incidents spring. The novel's vision of a ruined earth dominated by high tech multinationals is interwoven with a parallel narrative about a rabbi sorcerer's creation of a golem to protect the Jewish ghetto of Prague in 1600, when the Counter Reformation was in full swing. That juxtaposition, oddly effective, sets up touching and thought-provoking resonances. The denouement of Body of Glass would bring a tear to even a cyborg's eye. I have not read a more disturbing or moving novel about an artificial intelligence since Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Anvil of Stars (Legend/Century, 442 pages, Pounds 8.99) consolidates Greg Bear's reputation as a writer capable of audacious imaginative leaps. In The Forge of God, he destroyed the Earth, but ensured that beneficent aliens saved many of Earth's children. Anvil of Stars describes the odyssey of revenge upon which 82 of those children embark to find and to annihilate the advanced alien civilisation responsible. Greg Bear has that rare gift: the ability to evoke the truly strange and render it plausible. His aliens are truly alien: the Braids, for example, are colony organisms resembling a mass of intelligent spaghetti, social beings down to their constituent cords. They communicate by releasing a range of odours. They are somehow extraordinarily likeable. At no point in Anvil of Stars does the suspense flag or the characterisation lapse. Colin Wilson's Spider World: The Magician (HarperCollins, 345 pages, Pounds 14.99) deserves mention for its curiosity value. Colin Wilson, the former populariser of existentialist theory, who wrote The Outsider in 1956, now writes science fiction for the mass market. Life is strange. So is the plot line of this volume, which concerns the efforts of the human Niall to find the murderers who jeopardise his peace treaty with the planet's dominant race of giant spiders, the so-called arachnids. A friend perusing Spider World shortly after the UK election deplored the absence of fuller details about arachnid political relations (do the spiders perhaps inhabit a Cobweb of Independent States?). Elsewhere, the darker side of Romanticism makes a comeback. Two recent manifestations of it are Greenmantle (Pan, 328 pages, Pounds 4.99) and Yarrow (Pan, 244 pages, Pounds 7.99) by Charles de Lint. These sylvan idylls-with-a-difference have a disquietingly sinister element. The psychological premise of these novels about city dwellers being stalked, possessed, even devoured by the pagan spirits of ancient forests is straightforward. The more civilised, sophisticated, and pent up in the metropolis our lives become, the more we yearn for imaginary pastoral and rustic simplicity, and myth and folk tales acquire a special magnetism. Such urban-rural tension can now be exploited as never before and takes strange shapes on the mass market. So far so good, but what spoils Charles de Lint's at first appealing fiction is the gratuitously nasty erotic element. The writing seems paced so as to caress the reader's sensibilities, then to shock, and finally to inebriate with vagueness. The formula leaves an unpleasant aftertaste which put me in mind of the words of the critic F. L. Lucas (in The Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal): 'I loathe this view of literature as a shelf of bottles each with a different brand of alcohol inside.' The antidote, mercifully, is also close to hand. Terry Pratchett's Small Gods (Gollancz, 272 pages, Pounds 14.99) extends his Discworld series even further along its comic axis. Laugh? I nearly passed my cigars round. The antics of Brutha, the Chosen One, and his temporarily embarrassed god, Om, who is accidentally marooned in the body of a tortoise, make Charles de Lint's leafy pagan fictions seem etiolated by comparison. If you are unfamiliar with Pratchett's unique blend of philosophical badinage interspersed with slapstick, you are on the threshold of a mind-expanding opportunity. If you have already entered his Discworld, you have another treat in store.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Books: Magic from the mundane - Fiction THE BURN: STORIES by James Kelman Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 13.99, 244 pages HARDIE AND BAIRD AND OTHER PLAYS by James Kelman Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 180 pages WHENEVER A new novel or volume of stories by James Kelman appears Scottish reviewers say 'brilliant' in chorus. South of the border most of us haven't taken heed. Kelman has now published 11 books, and it is high time we did. Kelman's fame started to spread a couple of years ago when the Booker judges put A Disaffection, Kelman's novel about a Glasgow schoolmaster, among their last six novels. It didn't win the prize, which was given that year (1989) to Kazuo Ishiguro, but the short-listing of Kelman's work prompted many people to read him for the first time and some even to compare him with Beckett. Jeremy Beadle, a reader who entered for our FT Booker Prize competition, took another view: 'What Kelman has achieved (he wrote) is to work outwards from the ordinary and the everyday in the manner of the great 19th century British and French novelists - to reveal the extraordinary in the human condition. Not for him the imposition of 'magical' or symbolic events. Patrick Doyle his hero tries to wrest magic from the mundane - a pair of ordinary pipes, a pointless romantic lust - and his failure provides an illumination which speaks directly to more people than any other novel this year.' The two books just published are an easier point of entry into Kelmanland for the first-time reader than that long novel. The Burn contains stories varying in length from one to 40 pages, the other book scripts of three plays produced on the Fringe at Edinburgh, on Radio Scotland and at the Traverse Theatre. The constraints imposed by the small-cast play and the short-story suit Kelman, and he handles them with great variety. The most substantial story in The Burn - 'events in yer life' - traces the career of one of Kelman's lame dogs with typical precision. The basic theme is that of a prodigal son - a Glasgow artist who returns home after a long absence for his mother's funeral. He tries to pick up the forgotten threads in conversation with his sister and his former mate. In his talk with both he suffers from a crushing sense of displacement, and gradually we see that his alienation is just as strong when he is away from Scotland. He now belongs nowhere. Continual intake of alcohol breaks down initial embarrassment and reserve to reveal how the fissures of the present are even greater than the traumas of the past, and all the while Kelman's dialogue crackles with insights. What should have assuaged his outsider-hero's guilt only serves to heighten it. An equal load of guilt - often far too much for any one person to bear  - afflicts all Kelman's chief characters. Sometimes it is inexplicable, Kafka-like as in 'Naval History' where a man is mysteriously framed for theft in the innocuous setting of a high street bookshop. In a longer story, 'A Situation', a young man has slept with his fiancee's sister. Here, as in 'Pictures' where a boy remembers a homosexual encounter in a public lavatory, the un-atonable moment is plainly identified. Both these, like many of Kelman's stories, are virtual monologues, peppered with the four-letter expletive that is Kelman's trade-mark. But the language, however demotic, is always disciplined. The local words like 'greet' for 'weep', 'wouldni' for 'wouldn't', are carefully placed indicators. One brief violent story is written entirely in dialect. And as is clear from Hardie and Baird, a moving play set in the 18th century, Kelman can when he wishes elevate his diction. Here, in occasional soaring flights of grandiloquence, he reconstructs the last days in prison of two weavers before they were hanged for insurrection. In a recent interview Kelman has described himself as an existentialist, citing authors such as James Hogg, Dostoevsky, Camus as his forebears. After reading these fables of unresolved guilt the label stands, but he might more accurately be described as an existential Jansenist, someone who believes that most of us are doomed to damnation however hard we try to avoid it. A bleak message, but one that is indelible in Kelman's work.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Zafer Kiraz video report from Brussels] </F>   [Text] The NATO summit meeting, which began yesterday,  ended with a final communique today. Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller also held a meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc  Dehaene today. Following this meeting, Ciller held a news  conference at NATO Headquarters and commented on the summit  meeting as well as her bilateral contacts. The Partnership for  Peace plan, terrorism, Turkey's membership in the Western  European Union [WEU], and bilateral contacts with U.S. President  Bill Clinton and her Belgian counterpart were among the  important issues addressed by Ciller in her news conference.    It was learned that the incidents caused by the PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan] in Brussels and the struggle against  terrorism were particularly stressed during the meeting between  Ciller and Dehaene. In a news conference she held later, Ciller  declared that the recent developments in the world have  increased NATO's importance and have raised the issue of east  European countries' relations with the alliance. Recalling that  the partnership for peace plan proposed by the United States  within this framework was accepted at the summit, the prime  minister noted that the plan brings a flexible approach to the  current situation. The implementation of the plan envisages a  premembership cooperation process for NATO's relations with  Eastern European countries, Ciller said. She pointed out that  this plan, which Turkey supports, does not exclude any of the  said countries.    In response to a question on her bilateral talks with  Clinton, Ciller said:    [Begin recording] As you know, Turkey is in the process of  assuming a position in the WEU. We want Turkey to become a full  member. We also want Turkey to occupy a position within the  European Union. Therefore, the relations between Turkey and the  West are extremely important. The support to be accorded to us  by the United States in this matter is still important. We  spoke within this context. We discussed the extent of Turkey's  future moves and possible U.S. support for these moves. We  focused on the importance of acting together especially with  regard to the struggle against terrorism in the Western world  and in the Middle East. Continued U.S. support in these issues  is important from the viewpoint of discussing the fight against  terrorism in the international arena. We had the opportunity to  dwell on these issues as well. [end recording]    Ciller announced that the embargo imposed on Iraq was also  discussed with Clinton:    [Begin recording] As you know, the United States has granted  us a series of opportunities on this subject. The lifting of  the embargo on Iraq is not a matter only between Turkey and  Iraq. This is an international matter and is dependent on  decisions which must be adopted by the United Nations. As you  know, however, various subcommittees are working between Turkey  and the United States. There have been certain developments as a  result of these talks. [end recording]    The prime minister stated that the relations between Turkey  and the United States are developing in a satisfactory manner.  Referring to Clinton's scheduled meeting with Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad, a journalist asked Ciller if Turkey has a request  from the United States on this subject.    [Begin Ciller recording] I conveyed to Clinton the general  views held by Turkey. I am pleased to say that the struggle  against terrorism was included in the NATO communique in a way  that will raise it on the international level. Moreover, we  obtained the support of the United States on the West and now  for the Middle East as well. [end recording]    Announcing that she held a bilateral meeting with Belgian  Prime Minister Dehaene today, Ciller said the following:    [Begin recording] We made a general assessment. We relayed  our views on the PKK. We again referred to the subject of  cooperation in the struggle against terrorism, a matter  underlined by NATO, the United Nations, and the entire Western  world. We are pleased to see that Belgium, too, is preparing to  undertake moves on this subject. The Belgian prime minister  stated that his government wants to cooperate in the struggle  against terrorism and is working on this. In other words, he  said that Belgium is preparing to combat terrorism and wants to  cooperate. He remarked that the PKK is not isolated from other  Kurdish associations. At the moment, however, Belgian officials  accept that the PKK is a terrorist organization and declare that  they will adopt the necessary measures. The PKK is not separate  from other Kurdish associations, Dehaene noted, adding that it  has been documented that the PKK is now a terrorist organization  and work is under way to adopt the necessary measures on this  issue. [end recording]    Answering reporters' questions on Iraq, Ciller said:    [Begin recording] Iraq's territorial integrity is extremely  important. Furthermore, energy reserves are concentrated in the  Middle East. Any border change for any reason in this area  could seriously threaten stability. We had the opportunity to  clearly explain all of these views. Our agenda consisted of  international cooperation in the struggle against terrorism,  cooperation in the international arena, the incorporation of the  Unites States in this cooperation, and the continuation of this  cooperation both in Europe and the Middle East. [end recording]    A reporter asked Ciller if Greek Prime Minister Papandreou  expressed any views on the Cyprus issue, to which the prime  minister replied:    [Begin recording] No, he did not express any views  concerning Cyprus. We would be pleased to see him in Turkey.  The important thing is the ability to act together on many  subjects. Dialogue is important for this. From Turkey's  standpoint, I believe that we will have the opportunity to  inform world public opinion that we have very solid views on  this subject. [end recording]</p>

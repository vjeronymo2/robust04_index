			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Microsoft to open four offices in drive to tap eastern Europe MICROSOFT, the world's largest personal computer software supplier, is opening offices in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Russia as it raises its profile in eastern Europe. The company is committed to developing software distribution channels in eastern Europe similar to those in the west. It does not expect to recoup its investment, of several million dollars, within three years. Microsoft is the developer of MS/DOS, the most popular operating system for PCs. Its Windows programme, which makes PCs easier to operate, is proving successful in western markets. The Moscow office will be opened on Tuesday. The last of the four, in Budapest, will be opened early next year. Microsoft, which had worldwide revenues of Dollars 2.98bn (Pounds 1.96bn) last year, including more than Dollars 1bn worth of sales in western Europe, has been operating in eastern Europe for some years, chiefly through agents. Mr Bernard Vergnes, president of Microsoft Europe, said sales in each of the four countries were between Dollars 1m and Dollars 2m. 'After the offices are opened, we expect to double or triple sales rapidly'. The company is adopting a special pricing policy to deal with software piracy. Prices in east Europe will be similar to those in the US; prices in the rest of Europe are higher, reflecting costs of conducting business across the continent.</p>

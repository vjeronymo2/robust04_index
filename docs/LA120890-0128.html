			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> LEWIS, WILSON INJURED IN PRACTICE  </P> <P> The Chargers catch a bye this week, and just in time.  </P> <P> In Friday's practice the team lost a pair of wide receivers, including starter  Nate Lewis.  </P> <P> Lewis, who scored a pair of touchdowns in the team's 38-17 victory over the  Jets, might have suffered a stress fracture in his right hand.  </P> <P> Rookie Walter Wilson, who started four games earlier this season, pulled a  hamstring.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Quinn Early had missed Friday's practice with a bruised heel.  Anthony Miller was kept on the sidelines all week to allow for an assortment of  bruises to heal, and injured reserve wide receiver Ron Heard has been lost  again after aggravating a quadriceps muscle.  </P> <P> "They are going to do X-rays on Nate's hand, but it appears it's a stress  fracture," Coach Dan Henning said. "It's in the bone that comes down to the  wrist. He just caught a pass and fell down and took the pressure with his hand.  </P> <P> "We think he will be able to play with some kind of cast on his hand, but we'll  have to see. He's a punt returner and a receiver, and if it's debilitating to  him, we'll have to go another way."  </P> <P> Lewis leads the team with a 22.5-yard average on 17 kickoff returns, and has  returned 13 punts with a nine-yard average. He's also caught 11 passes for 161  yards with one touchdown. Wilson has 10 catches for 87 yards.  </P> <P> "Wilson will miss time," Henning said. "He may be out a week or two. He didn't  have any range of motion at all."  </P> <P> Henning says the personnel department has began looking for help at wide  receiver, but no decisions are expected to be made until Monday.  </P> <P> The club released cornerback Joe Fuller, who was on injured reserve with a  muscle pull in his thigh, Friday. Fuller started against Houston earlier this  season and had an interception at Cleveland. T.J. SIMERS  </P></p>

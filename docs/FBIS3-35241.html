This was  disclosed by Minister Musa, who pointed out that Egypt and  Turkey are holding constant consultations over this issue.    Answering a question on the approaching deadline given to  the  Bosnian Serbs with regard to weapons withdrawal from Sarajevo,  the Egyptian foreign minister told news reporters that the Serbs  will have to withdraw all their heavy weapons to a distance of  20 km from Sarajevo. The removal of heavy guns, he added,  should be comprehensive and not partial.    The foreign minister said that in the case of the partial  withdrawal of weapons, the NATO's responsibility will continue.  With the expiration of the deadline, Musa said, one of two  things should take place: either the total withdrawal of all  guns or a strike at Serbian positions.    Asked about the situation in other parts of Bosnia, Minister  Musa said that decisions concerning Sarajevo should be  applicable to other besieged areas of Bosnia.    Concerning his meeting with the Israeli ambassador in Cairo  today, Minister Musa said that the meeting dealt with the  Palestinian-Israeli talks that will be held in Cairo tomorrow,  Monday.    Asked about reports of agreements or security arrangements  reached between Iran and some Gulf countries and how such a  development would affect the Damascus Declaration, Minister Musa  said that these arrangements are still just news reports. The  Egyptian foreign minister said that there is no indication of  official movement in this direction.</p>

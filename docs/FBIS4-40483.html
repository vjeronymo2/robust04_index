			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed response to Reader's Letter under the "Goods </F> and Services" rubric: "Is Radioactive Waste Being Stored in  Moscow?"]    [Text] Is it true that there are radioactive waste storage  facilities on Moscow territory?    [signed] A. Pecherskaya, Krasnoyarsk.    As we were told at the Russian Federation Federal  Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor],  there are 49 nuclear research installations on the capital's  territory. These include the research reactors belonging to the  Kurchatov Center, which is located in a densely populated part  of the city. The amount of radioactive waste stored both at the  center's own site and at other establishments is in excess of  200 tonnes. The Gosatomnadzor inspectorate for the capital  believes that all this waste represents a threat to the safety  of the city's inhabitants. However, the government has not  allocated the resources for removing the radioactive waste and  dismantling the reactors. It will cost around 15 billion rubles.</p>

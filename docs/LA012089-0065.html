			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Ronald Reagan leaves Washington today, but images of the retiring President by  nearly 40 artists, including Andy Warhol and Red Grooms, continue on display in  a new exhibit titled "Reagan: American Icon" at Bucknell University's Center  Gallery in Pennsylvania. The Reagan interpretations feature works done in the  past eight years and range from flattering to critical. "It's unprecedented  that a President has had contemporary artists do this many images of him," said  Robert P. Metzger, the gallery's director. The show includes two Warhol  screenprints of Reagan in Van Heusen shirt advertisements published during the  President's acting days, and a mock wooden toy by Red Grooms showing Reagan and  Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev standing on a missile connected to four  wagon wheels titled "Nuclear Nuts." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Leading Article: UK labour laws BRITAIN MAY or may not need another round of employment legislation, but it urgently needs rationalisation of the law which already exists. That is the message coming from Britain's engineering employers. A sound framework of employment law would protect employers and employees from unfair behaviour, without placing undue burdens on employers. The rights and duties of both parties to the employment contract should be expressed as clearly as possible. The foundations of British employment law are still rooted in a law of contract which requires many of the rights associated with collective organisation to be expressed as immunities from breach of contract. Britain has a system of 'collective laissez-faire' which for nearly 100 years has kept the law to a minimum, but which has also encouraged unions and employers to slug it out at the workplace. The basis of collective laissez-faire is being eroded by the decline of trade unions and the creation of new rights for individuals at the workplace. Contrary to much of the rhetoric at last week's TUC Congress in Brighton, most non-unionised British workers do not stand unprotected before the whims of their employers. But the main problem is that employees' understanding of their rights and their enforcement through the courts or industrial tribunals is increasingly defective. The Engineering Employers Federation argues that because of the way statutory provisions are drafted and amended, and because of the accumulation of case law, the understanding of subjects like maternity rights or redundancies has become increasingly problematic. At the same time, the industrial tribunals themselves have become bogged down in legalism, causing delays and uncertainty. The answer the EEF proposes is regularly updated codes of practice on employment law which would have greater authority than case law and would help unblock tribunals. One way forward would be for the government to conceive a form of Citizen's Charter for the workplace, setting out employee rights, to be attached to each employment contract. It could be supplemented by a voluntary code of practice, on matters such as employee consultation which are not covered by the law. A more contentious notion would be to convert existing collective immunities into individual rights, although that would raise the difficult issue of a right to strike, or perhaps more precisely a right not to be dismissed for striking for a certain period of time. To balance any such right, the government could restrict strikes in essential services and give employers greater flexibility in changing employment conditions without being subject to unfair dismissal proceedings. The EEF paper stops short of considering these complications. But it is a worthwhile contribution to which ministers should give serious attention.</p>

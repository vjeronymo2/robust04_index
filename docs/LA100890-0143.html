			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DEY TO SHUT HER 'L.A. LAW' BOOKS  </P> <P> Actress Susan Dey, who has played a judge and prosecutor as Grace Van Owen on  "L.A. Law," says her fifth season on the NBC series will be her last.  </P> <P> Dey, who was in Wichita on Sunday as national spokeswoman for the Institute of  Logopedics for children with communication disorders, said that she has decided  to leave the show after the upcoming season because her contract will expire.  </P> <P> She said she was not leaving because of any ill feelings.  </P> <P> "It's harder to take the risk and not to stay," she said. "I'm only (leaving)  because the play has run a long run, and I want to know who else is out there I  can play."  </P> <P> "It has enhanced this year for me, knowing that this is the last time to play  Grace," she said. "It made Grace more exciting to me."  </P> <P> Dey said her plans include making two movies through her own production  company, one of them about children.  </P></p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / A European spark for Marks: M and S is stepping up its international expansion It is a curious fact that at this time of year Marks and Spencer's store in Boulevard Haussmann, in the heart of Paris, sells more muffins than all its 280 UK stores combined. Other quintessentially British products, such as crumpets, pies and sliced white bread, as well as les slips, les boxer-shorts and les twin-sets en lambswool, also 'just walk out the door' - as retailers are fond of saying - helping to make Paris the second biggest selling store in M and S with annual sales of more than Pounds 80m. After 17 years of experimentation, M and S's 18 stores in four countries in mainland Europe are conspicuously coming good, vindicating the company's decision to expand its business overseas and prompting a further increase in its investment programme. At this week's annual meeting, M and S's directors will no doubt highlight the strong performance of its European operations, which, in spite of heavy opening costs, in-creased pre-tax profits 13 per cent to Pounds 23m last year on sales of Pounds 193.7m. They will also point out the potential they still see in mainland Europe, and their target of opening another 20 or so stores by 1995. M and S aims to build its European sales to Pounds 1bn in Europe by the end of the decade, producing profits in excess of Pounds 100m. Although this will still represent a small proportion of its total business it will be a crucial element in sustaining its growth momentum. 'We simply see faster sales growth overseas than in the UK,' says Mr Nigel Colne, the board director in charge of European operations. M and S's success at expanding in Europe and the Far East - where it runs four highly profitable stores in Hong Kong - contrasts sharply with its experience in North America. Its three Canadian businesses, acquired in the 1970s, have lost CDollars 50m (Pounds 22m) over the past four years and are now being severely pruned. Its two US companies, Kings Supermarkets and the Brooks Brothers clothing chain, which between them cost it Dollars 866m have  -as yet - failed to produce a return. M and S's varied international forays therefore provide a good illustration of the possibilities and pitfalls of expanding a retailing business overseas  -a task that an increasing number of UK retailers are attempting in the face of saturated home markets and the slowly evolving reality of the single European market. UK retailers need few lessons in how difficult it can be to follow the management maxim of the moment, 'think globally, act locally'. Over the past decade, scores of UK retailers, including Dixons, John Menzies and Sock Shop, have bought businesses in the US, having been seduced by the seemingly similar business culture and language. In 1980-88, UK retailers accounted for almost 60 per cent of the Dollars 14.8bn invested by foreign companies in the US retail sector. With a few exceptions, these investments have produced dismal results. Of course, the depressed market conditions for all retailers in North America have checked the progress of many UK companies. But there is also a more general management lesson to be drawn from their collective experience: that it is exceptionally hard to make overseas retail acquisitions work, especially when they are more than 3,000 miles away. Organic expansion in nearby countries - often facilitated by joint ventures or franchises - can be a far safer, if less pansion. M and S is certainly now convinced of this. With almost no debt and a triple-A credit rating it would be easy for the company to gear up to make a big acquisition in Europe - assuming one could be found. But so far at least it has chosen not to. 'I strongly believe in our current strategy of growing the business on an organic site-by-site basis. It may be relatively slower but it does enable us to learn as we go, to limit our mistakes and have a more profitable business at the end of the day,' says Mr Colne. Yet it has taken M and S a long time to be persuaded by its own success. M and S opened three stores in Europe - in Paris, Brussels and Lyons - in 1975. This early involvement, says Mr Colne, owed more to gut feel than science. 'In the early 1970s, the then chairman, Lord Sieff, instinctively thought that we ought to test ourselves internationally,' he says. The European stores initially encountered many problems: their products were panned for their high prices and poor style, and some of their trading policies - such as accepting returns of ill-fitting clothes - were simply not understood by customers. The absence of fitting rooms particularly rank-led the French, who insisted on trying on goods before they bought them even if it meant stripping down to their bras on the salesfloors. M and S was forced to install them. Most French retail outlets are either bazaars or boutiques; M and S is neither. It took shoppers a long time to understand what the company was all about. 'Our reputation for quality and value went before us in the UK as a result of our 100-year history. Here, we have had to earn it,' says Mr Jim McDonald, manager of the Boulevard Haussmann store. As a result of the initially poor investment returns from Europe, the head office's attention wandered across the Atlantic in the 1980s. But by the end of the decade, frustrated by the vagaries of the US marketplace, and with the European business beginning to post significant sales improvements, the board decided to make a greater commitment to mainland Europe. The rate of expansion has now accelerated. In a two-month period at the end of last year, M and S opened five new stores in mainland Europe, in Seville, Nantes, Toulouse Amsterdam and Liege, and completed a big extension. In the previous 15 years, M and S had opened just seven. Most of the outlets it has opened are wholly owned, but this policy is adapted to meet the needs of specific markets. For example, in 1989, M and S concluded a 60:40 joint venture agreement with Cortefiel, one of Spain's largest retailers. This led to the opening of one M and S store in Madrid and another in Seville. Cortefiel, which runs its own fashion chains and a clothes manufacturing business, had a deep knowledge of the fast-moving but relatively under-developed Spanish retail sector. M and S has also been rapidly expanding its network of franchises in small markets which do not justify the full M and S 'treatment'. The company has built up a franchise network in 17 countries, from the Bahamas to Norway, from Israel to Singapore with almost no capital investment on its part. Further franchising opportunities exist in eastern Europe and the Far East. One of the great advantages of having stores in Hong Kong, according to Mr Colin Buchanan, Far East manager, is to keep an eye on the 'huge demographic and economic shift' that is taking place towards Asia. 'It would not surprise me if we were trading in mainland China in five years,' he says. But in the immediate future the priority markets are France and Spain. Another Paris store in the Rue de Rivoli is planned, while Valencia, Nice, Rouen and Marseilles are also on the opening list. Further out, the company believes there will still be great scope for growth in Europe. The total clothing markets in the UK, France, Spain, Holland and Belgium - where M and S runs its wholly-owned stores - are worth about Pounds 70bn. The German and Italian markets combined are worth the same. M and S stresses that the creeping internationalisation of the business does not just bring in extra sales, it also strengthens its UK operations. By moving abroad, its management expertise improves, its retailing skills are more rigorously tested, and its buying knowledge becomes more sophisticated. M and S says the investment returns from Europe are comparable to those obtained in the UK although the financial profile of its continental operations is very different. Prices are up to 25 per cent higher than in the UK but then management and distribution costs are also greater. Sales intensities are lower because of the lesser number of customers. M and S obtains sales per square foot in excess of Pounds 500 in the UK  - considerably higher than all but the best of its European stores. Its mainland European stores also act as a test bed for its latest fashions, as the seasons start slightly earlier than in the UK. New concepts, materials and styles are quickly assimilated into the central buying information pool. But a vast melange of commercial and cultural differences continues to make international retailing a demanding business; M and S readily admits it still has much to do to improve the way it communicates with customers. The store's managers in Hong Kong were horrified to learn that the local Chinese were eating the pot pourri displayed in the stores, believing it must be some delicacy. Spanish customers discovered that brandy butter did not taste good on toast. The French did not appreciate Christmas puddings until they learnt they had to cook them. But successful as its European operations have been, they have not yet fully benefited from what in the UK is M and S's greatest source of competitive advantage: its dominant size. M and S's purchasing power concentrated on a relatively narrow range of goods, its 15 per cent share of the clothing market, and a constant flow of 14m regular customers enable it to derive big economies of scale. Although the European stores can feed off some of these strengths, they still lack the necessary support infrastructure to offer the full M and S catalogue of goods. In foods, for example, the company has not yet made the investment it needs to build a chilled distribution chain for its short shelf-life products. But there are signs that M and S is close to reaching critical mass in Europe, enabling it to broaden its appeal and become a true mass market retailer. At present, M and S's gross profit margin in Europe is 10 percentage points higher than in the UK, partly as a result of the higher prices charged overseas and the different product mix: the balance between sales of the higher-margin clothing and lower-margin food is 60:40 in the UK; 90:10 in Europe. 'Our philosophy for the years ahead will be to drive down margins to increase volume,' says Mr Colne. 'I would like to think that in five years we will have far more customers and so be able to reduce prices. We will then be able to repeat the virtuous circle we achieved in the UK both of improving value and increasing market share.'</p>

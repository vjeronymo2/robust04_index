			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / 'The area the judge has been probing is quite absurd' WHITEHALL INSIDERS are expressing unease about Sir Richard Scott's 'grand inquisitor' role and the way he is conducting his inquiry. Officials at the Foreign Office - subjected to particular scrutiny in recent hearings - say they are 'relaxed' about the inquiry's potential political impact, and hope some of its recommendations may lead to improvements in the efficiency of the government machinery. But they say that in his questioning of witnesses the judge has demonstrated a lack of administrative experience and appreciation of the complexity of Whitehall. One former member of Baroness Thatcher's government said this week: 'The kind of area the judge has been probing is quite absurd. There are meetings every week at the Department of Trade and Industry between officials and companies wanting to sell arms with the Foreign Office waiting in the wings. The companies win a few, they lose a few. It's nothing. 'I've been involved in keeping things from the press but I regard that as a public service, as a patriotic duty. If we had to explain ourselves every time we made a foreign-policy decision there wouldn't be any government.' Officials say the demands on government departments to produce documentary evidence are 'vastly expensive' and waste time which could be used on matters of policy. Whitehall departments are having to devote one and sometimes two officials to dealing with the judge's requests on a full-time basis. 'This is not what we are here for,' said one Whitehall insider. Another widely shared complaint is that the line of questioning by the judge and his team does not appear to take into account the political priorities of the mid 1980s, as opposed to those that prevailed in the aftermath of Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and the ensuing war. 'At the time we were trying to do our best to sell arms,' recalled one official. 'There were rumours that Kurdish villages were being destroyed by the Iraqis, but these were dismissed by our embassy in Baghdad at the time.' One former aide to Lady Thatcher said the former prime minister, who will give evidence later in the year, was 'unrepentant' about her government's conduct of arms policy during the 1980s and was preparing a vigorous defence on com-mercial and pragmatic diplomatic grounds. 'What we were doing was nothing compared to what the French and the Germans were doing, ' he said, adding that in the tortured world of Middle East politics, policy was having to be constantly fine-tuned to deal with changing circumstances. Other foreign observers remember that in September 1988, Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, Lady Thatcher's foreign secretary, said that the evidence of chemical weapons being used by the Iraqis against Kurdish civilians was 'compelling' The judge's terms of reference require him to consider not whether the government was trying to sell arms to Iraq - which it clearly was - but whether in so doing it was in breach of the law and its own declared guidelines.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Mountleigh in Pounds 124m Spanish disposal KPMG PEAT Marwick, the international auditing firm acting as receivers for the Mountleigh property group, has sold Galerias Preciados, Spain's second biggest department store chain and Mountleigh's largest single asset, to a group of Spanish investors for Pta21.2bn (Pounds 124m). Mr Tim Hayward, the receiver, said Galerias accounted for about 25 per cent of Mountleigh's assets; that meant that about a third of its total had now been sold. He was in no hurry to dispose of the entire portfolio. He was prepared to wait for some recovery in the UK property market rather than sell too cheaply those assets that were producing income. Although Galerias had been sold for less than it was worth - with 29 stores throughout Spain some analysts in Madrid were yesterday calling the sale price a giveaway - Mr Hayward had accepted the best price offered. Serious negotiations had been intiated with at least six other potential buyers since Mountleigh went into receivership last May. Galerias has been bought by a consortium lead by Mr Fernando Sada Gonzalez-Breto, Mr Justo Lopez-Tello Camara, who each have 36 per cent stakes, and Mr Santiago de Mollinedo Martinez, with 12 per cent. The rest of the shares will be distributed among other as yet unnamed directors. Mr Lopez-Tello, the best known of the three, is the majority shareholder in Mantequerias Leonesas, an upmarket supermarket chain which already has space in some Galerias stores. The three men would not disclose who was financing their acquisition and Mr Hayward was unwilling to say when he would be paid. Ironically, the biggest creditor of Galerias is Mountleigh itself, having guaranteed loans to Galerias worth about Pounds 85m in the last two years. Mr Hayward said Galerias had made 'substantial' losses so far this year but the buyers said they hoped to bring it back to profit within three years. The group is thought to have incurred losses of some Pta3.8bn. Their determination to hold the group intact will frustrate a number of foreign retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, who had hoped to be able to expand in Spain by buying some of Galerias' prime sites in major cities.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / German court's Maastricht ruling a win for all: Quentin Peel interprets the judgment on the European treaty ON THE face of it, Chancellor Helmut Kohl seems to have got pretty much what he wanted from Germany's august constitutional court, giving the green light for ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Of course the devil is in the detail, and after the 85-page judgment was delivered yesterday, both proponents and opponents of European union were claiming victory. The eight red-robed judges of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe gave their own interpretation on how the treaty, and the whole process of European integration, should and would be implemented. Yet their words appear close to what the German chancellor, and the German parliament, have already agreed. The end result is that all agree that the German Bundestag and Bundesrat, the two houses of parliament, should in future exercise stronger national democratic control over EC decision-making. In future, German overseeing of Brussels legislation will be similar to that in Britain and Denmark, and not the rubber stamp it used to be. 'The principle of democracy does not prevent Germany joining a supranationally organised community of states,' the judges said in their main guidelines. 'If an association of democratic states takes on sovereign tasks and exercises sovereign powers, it is principally the peoples of the member states who must legitimate this through their national parliaments.' The judges did pay tribute to the need for democratic control at the European level - through the European parliament - but without quite the same sense of conviction. 'Increasingly as European nations grow together . . . democratic legitimation is conveyed by the European parliament elected by the citizens of the member states,' they said. 'It is of decisive importance that the democratic basis of (European) Union should keep pace with integration, and that a vital democracy should be maintained as the integration of member states continues.' They then went back to stress the need for national democratic controls. 'If, as is currently the case, the peoples convey democratic legitimation through national parliaments, then the principle of democracy sets limits on the expansion of the tasks and powers of the European communities. The German Bundestag must retain substantial tasks and powers.' In weighting their judgment in favour of national control, the judges are following the inclination of the Bundestag and Bundesrat when they ratified the Maastricht treaty. In a considerable tussle with the German government, the two chambers have wrested constitutional powers to oversee all future Brussels legislation. The constitutional court judgment, by stressing that trend, may help to reinforce it. According to a new article of the German constitution wrung out of the government by parliament last year, the government must now 'consult and take into consideration' the opinions of its parliament. Moreover the judges have gone further in reserving their own right to keep a sharp eye on future developments towards European union. 'The federal constitutional court will consider whether legal acts carried out by the European institutions and organs remain within the sovereignty rights accorded to them, or whether they go beyond them,' they said. The court agreed with the German government that a loosely-worded article in the Maastricht treaty which allows the European Union to give itself the 'means' necessary to achieve its goals, did not amount to a blank cheque. Germany, and all the other members states, agreed that the statement was merely a compromise clause to allow future financing to be arranged, without a clear commitment. As for the transition to economic and monetary union, the court seems to be satisfied that the controls to be exercised by the Bundestag, and perhaps even more strictly by the Bundesbank, will be adequate. 'With ratification of the Union treaty, Germany is not subordinating itself to an unclear, automatic and uncontrollable mechanism leading to currency union. The treaty opens the way to a further step-by-step integration of the European community of law which depends at every further step either on conditions which the parliament can now foresee, or on further approval by the federal government, subject to influence from the parliament.' Mr Kohl could hardly have put it better himself.</p>

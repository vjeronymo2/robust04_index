The meeting resulted in the adoption of declarations which  call for solving ethnic problems and establishing relations  between Slovaks and Hungarians on new principles. "The  government's previous steps contributed to the worsening of  mutual relations," the declaration writes.    The meeting asked to embody the collective rights of the  Hungarian minority in the Slovak Constitution. It deemed  necessary for the development of the Hungarian entity the use of  the Hungarian language in administrative contact at any place  where Hungarians make up at least one-tenth of the population.  Hungarian should become, along with Slovak, the official  language in locations with a Hungarian majority. The  representation of Hungarians in state bodies and public  institutions should be in line with their number. The Hungarian  entity should be allotted a relevant share of state budget. The  political existence of the minority should be expressed in the  election of its own representative bodies.    The meeting expressed a claim to the "attribution of special  legal status for territory with a large number of Hungarians."  The implementation of ethnic rights in places where they  constitute a minority should be based on the principle of  mutuality.    Only two meeting participants voted against the  declarations.  The crowded arena applauded them because of their courage. The  meeting also passed an open letter to the Slovak president and  Slovak citizens, asking them to open a dialogue based on  equality, and an appeal to Hungarian parents to send their  children only to Hungarian schools.</p>

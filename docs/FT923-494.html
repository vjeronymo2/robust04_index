			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sir Robert Jones barred from trading RJI shares THE New Zealand high court has barred Sir Robert Jones, founder and former chairman of property group Robt. Jones Investments (RJI), from trading shares in the company. This is the first time such an action has occurred in New Zealand, and follows an application by the country's securities commission. The court prohibited RJI from registering transfers of shares held by Sir Robert or private companies he controls. Sir Robert recently said he held 13.82 per cent in the company. The interim order, follows an earlier finding by the New Zealand Stock Exchange's market surveillance panel that the company failed to inform the market about share dealings during 1990 involving RJI, as well as its employee unit trust and Sir Robert's private interests. Sir Robert said he was 'delighted' the commission had acted. He accused the stock exchange of mounting a 'kangaroo court' against him. The high court injunction is the latest in a series of legal actions against RJI and Sir Robert who on September 18 resigned as chairman of the company he founded 10 years ago. It is now one of the biggest property investors in Australia and New Zealand with a portfolio of buildings worth NZDollars 1.08bn (USDollars 598m). Fay, Richwhite shareholders have voted overwhelmingly to accept the National Australia Bank's bid for their company's 26 per cent stake in the Bank of New Zealand. NAB is offering 80 cents a share and 95 cents for each preference share. It is expected to confirm the offer this week.</p>

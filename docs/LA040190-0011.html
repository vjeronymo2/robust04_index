			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEFILE  </P> <P> Aidan Quinn and John Lithgow will play missionaries in the Amazon in the  ecological drama, "At Play In the Fields of the Lord," joining previously  announced Laura Dern and Kathy Bates. The Saul Zaentz production, directed by  Hector Babenco, is scheduled to get underway in Brazil mid-May.  </P> <P> Kris Kristofferson plays a police detective who befriends Drew Barrymore, a  teen-ager being stalked by her sister's killer, in writer-director Richard  Danus' "Tipperary." The film, produced by Alan Amiel, begins photography May 14  in a still undetermined urban location. Cannon Pictures distributes.  </P> <P> Eriq LaSalle, the young black actor who played Eddie Murphy's rival for the  hand of Shari Headley in "Coming to America," will replace Denzel Washington in  Sanford/Pillsbury's "Love Field." Washington dropped out last week, expressing  dissatisfaction with the development of his character. The film, written by Don  Roos and starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Brian Kerwin and 6-year-old Stephanie  McFadden (who plays LaSalle's daughter), begins filming in North Carolina  Monday under Jonathan Kaplan's direction. Orion will distribute.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Propaganda Films is about to launch its own "Love Field." Both  titles refer to the Dallas airfield where President John Kennedy landed that  fatal day, Nov. 22, 1963. While the Sanford/Pillsbury production concerns the  relationships a woman forms on a bus trip in the days following the  assassination, Propaganda's film focuses on Jack Ruby and his relationship with  Candy Barr, a stripper in his Dallas nightclub. English playwright Stephen  Davis is currently polishing his script for director David Fincher, a director  of music videos who will make his feature debut. Yoni Sighvatsson and Steven  Golin will produce. No production date is set.  </P> <P> Glenn Ford, who received the French Legion of Honor eight months ago, returns  to France to star opposite Alain Delon in the English-language political  thriller, "Black Sky." He plays the American ambassador to France in this  Italian-French co-production. Director Flavio Mogherini rolls cameras for  producer Gianni Massaro in Paris April 23.  </P> <P> River Phoenix will star in Warners' "Dog Fight," a tale of young Vietnam-era  enlistees whose wager over who will bring the ugliest girl to their favorite  bar on a Saturday night leads to unexpected consequences. Once on George Roy  Hill's calendar, the film will now be directed by Nancy Savoca, director of  last year's cult hit, "True Love." The film, written by Bob Comfort, begins  filming early May in Seattle.  </P> <P> Rachel Ticotin, Joanna Gleason, Philip Bosco and Kevin O'Connor join Bryan  Brown and Brian Dennehy in Orion's "F/X 2."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Toshihiko Kashiwa; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 Jun </F> Evening Edition]    [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun -- Japan and Russia held their second  trade and economic conference in Moscow on 2 June. In the  meeting, the two governments agreed to make mutual efforts to  settle at an early date the issue of Russia's delay in repaying  debts in trade with Japan. Russia's trade debts have become a  stumbling block to the promotion of trade between Japan and  Russia. In the meeting, the Japanese delegates reaffirmed its  proposal made by then Foreign Minister Hata in March that Japan  will invite Russian leaders -- in the position of deputy prime  minister or the equivalent -- to Japan. The two countries agreed  to coordinate the scheduling of a visit by Russian leaders  through diplomatic channels.    The meeting was attended by representatives from the  ministries concerned of the two nations. The Japanese delegates  were led by Deputy Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Hayashi  while the Russian side was headed by First Deputy Minister  Phratokov [as published] of the Foreign Economic Relations  Ministry.</p>

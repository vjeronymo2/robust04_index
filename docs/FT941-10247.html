			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Observer: Green Greek No sniggering, please. Yannis Paleokrassas, the new EC environment commissioner, tonight lectures the London School of Economics on 'Environmental crime and punishment'. Big subject, pity about the speaker. Paleokrassas, a former Greek finance minister and economist, tends to get the jobs no one else wants. He carried the can for not taking the tough decisions which might have prevented the Greek economy getting into a mess. Now he is in charge of a European environment policy which is not only far too ambitious but is not fully enforced on poorer countries - such as Greece. Given that he doesn't share the same politics as the current Greek government, it's most unlikely that he will be reappointed as Europe's environment supremo when his term expires at the end of the year. Maybe that explains the persistent rumour that he's thinking of quitting and standing as a Euro MP for Greece's New Democracy party. It all adds to the general impression, among environmentalists at least, that for the next year or so Europe's environmental criminals are likely to go largely unpunished.</p>

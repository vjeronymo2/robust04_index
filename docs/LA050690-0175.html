			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULVER CITY ELECTION COVERAGE CRITICIZED  </P> <P> I wish to criticize the Times' biased reporting during the recent Culver City  election. Through half-truths and innuendoes, The Times castigated several of  our city's leading citizens due to the honest mistake of one.  </P> <P> I invite a review of the articles in the April 8 edition, where the newspaper  portrayed a war between "slow-growth forces," "pro-growth forces" and also  "advocates of expanded development." It stated: "The names of those signing  Measure I were released by City Clerk (Pauline) Dolce to pro-development  forces. . . . "  </P> <P> Dolce did not release names to "forces," pro- or anti-development. The names  were given to one, two or perhaps three council members sometime in 1988,  before there was any discussion of competing slow-growth measures and at a time  when all involved believed that the signature list was public knowledge.  </P> <P> Although it may not be exciting, the truth is that the overwhelming majority of  Culver City residents share the same opinion on development: It must be  cautious, reasonable and beneficial. That is why Marina Place was so strongly  supported. An idiot could travel Culver City's borders with Los Angeles and  realized which community is pro-growth and which is pro-citizen.  </P> <P> ROBERT D. STEINBERG  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

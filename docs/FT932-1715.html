			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (31): Read all about them - Media PAPER TIGERS by Nicholas Coleridge Heinemann Pounds 17.95, 592 pages PAPER TIGERS - if you are interested in newspapers - is a perfectly readable, rather over-long collection of pieces about some of the people who own the world's press. Nicholas Coleridge, formerly editor of Harpers and Queen magazine and now managing director of Conde Nast in London, is an accomplished feature writer. This book is in effect a collection of interlinked articles about a selection of media tycoons, some of whom (not all) have given him an interview. It is - to repeat - readable stuff; it is a very superior form of gossip-columnery. The choice of subjects is rather odd, and never satisfactorily explained. There is a heavy initial emphasis on the US (no doubt for sound commercial reasons) - the Sulzbergers of the New York Times, the Grahams of the Washington Post, Otis Chandler of the Los Angeles Times, of course, but does the non-American reader care so very much about Dean Singleton in Texas or Jim Cox Kennedy in Atlanta? There is an interesting chapter on the three media families of India; a double-bite at the (uninterviewed) Warwick Fairfax, who caused such disaster in Australia; a non-piece about the absent Robert Hersant of Le Figaro; a section on Sally Aw Sian in Hong Kong and the mysterious and sinister Kamphol in Thailand; an absurd and unilluminating inclusion of Asil Nadir in Turkey; and a misguided attempt to portray the Aga Khan as a significant newspaper tycoon on the basis of his East African operation. Then there is the real meat of the book - Conrad Black, Rupert Murdoch, Lord Rothermere, Lord Stevens, Tony O'Reilly, all of whom make an excellent but deeply unsatisfying read; Robert Maxwell is not attempted seriously, which makes sense because he would need an obituary. These chapters might interest the European reader. (Be it noted, again, that the selection is absurdly arbitrary: no Thomson, no Italian or German, no Japanese, no Arab, no South African or South American.) So what does Coleridge have to say of his chosen handful? Not very much beyond the tittle-tattle of their lives. He is interesting on the underlying differences between British and US papers - the UK's distinction between quality and popular national papers as against the importance in America of very high penetration by monopolist local newspapers (which raises the associated issue of increasingly precise targeting of ever-smaller - and therefore more parochial? - district or regional markets.) He argues that proprietors are still all-powerful, though fewer in number, and by implication greater in clout. He discusses this point with a few of them and is promised that he need not worry. When challenged by public perceptions, Coleridge is usually reassured by his interviewee. He admits, for example, that Murdoch has many critics, but concludes that: 'The culture of his newspapers, particularly the tabloids, may indeed be brutal and chauvinistic and downmarket, but that is not quite the same thing as invariably moving the paper downmarket.' Conrad Black of the Telegraph, Sydney Morning Herald, Jerusalem Post and North Bay Nugget comes out of this book as the most interesting of the UK-oriented tigers, perhaps because he is the least known and also the big mover at present. Lord Rothermere of the Mail, the Standard and the Spilsby and Skegness Target is the most cuddly ('He is probably the only one who devotes any time to introspection'). Rupert Murdoch - who owns almost everything else - turns on the charm and Coleridge laps it up. This is, I hope it is clear, an unashamedly soft-centered portrait of various Streets of Shame. My objection is that there is no attempt to report, let alone analyse, the business operations of these people. Mr Coleridge may modestly feel that he is unqualified to attempt the task, but the snag is that the important part of the story is indeed their business deals. It is all very well to know that Murdoch denies being a 'born again' Christian (merely 'practising') or that Rothermere has a Korean lady companion, but the heart of the book should be something different: how, for instance, did Murdoch manage to roll over his debt burden at a moment when he faced disaster? What was the breakthrough point for the Mail on Sunday? In such terms, Paper Tigers is not a serious book - and, fair enough, it probably was not intended to be. There is a curious omission. The FT does not figure in these pages - surprising, since we surely have a role in the world more influential than Mr Nadir's Ekonomik Bulteno. Is it because we are not 'controlled' by a single proprietor, whatever that means? I would have thought that the effective control of a one-armed polo-playing peer - whom, in 30 years as an FT journalist I have never seen, nor expected to - would have been the stuff of Mr Coleridge's dreams. It goes to show that the Cowdray family has a genius for keeping out of the gossip columns.</p>

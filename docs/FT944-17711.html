			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bank disappoints Headline profits from Bank of Scotland were some Pounds 3m above the market's best expectations, but there was an element of disappointment with the 14 per cent dividend increase, which compared with some estimates that had ranged up to 20 per cent-plus. The dividend disappointment, plus the general slide in the stock market, saw B of S shares underperform the FT-SE 100 Index and drop 10, or 4.8 per cent, to 196p. The FT-SE 100 fell 1.5 per cent. The telecoms leaders were among the market's most resilient stocks, with NatWest Securities' 'add' recommendation for BT, based on the stock's defensive qualities and dividend potential, helping the shares close marginally higher on the session at 364p. Vodafone also attracted keen support after the strong subscriber numbers for the third quarter, which triggered widespread profits upgrades in the market. BZW was said to have been a big supporter of the shares yesterday. Cable and Wireless was a lone poor performer, slipping 7 to 382p in spite of news that Bouygues Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a 20 per cent stake, has been granted a licence to set up France's third mobile telephones network. Strauss Turnbull, the stockbroker, issued 8m American-style call warrants on the group and accompanied the issue with a strong recommendation on the underlying stock, which it said was 'seriously undervalued'. Retailing group Storehouse hardened a penny to 198p as brokers upgraded profits expectations following an upbeat statement on current trading to analysts and institutions. Storehouse said sales for its first half were likely to be near 7 per cent ahead of last year and gross margins across the group were being maintained. BZW was among brokers that upgraded, lifting its current year forecast by Pounds 4m to Pounds 80m, and the following year's figure by the same amount to Pounds 96m. However, Mr Tony Shiret at the investment bank remained cautious. He said: 'The statement was reasonably encouraging but the shares are fairly rated given the excess capacity coming on stream over the next few years.' Worries over the outcome of the price war among food retailers continued to overhang Kwik Save. The shares lost a further 7 at 539p. There was no shortage of institutional buyers for the rump of stock not taken up in Commercial Union's Pounds 322m rights offer. The issue was 91 per cent taken up and the remainder, some 6.4m shares, were easily placed in the market by Cazenove, CU's joint broker along with Hoare Govett, at 490p apiece. CU settled 3 higher at 497p. Other insurers fell away with the market, General Accident receding 5 to 531p, Royal Insurance 9 to 275p and Sun Alliance 7 to 309p. Merchant banks, severely mauled over the past two weeks after a series of profit warnings, staged a tentative rally but looked vulnerable at the close. SG Warburg finished only 3 up at 583p, while Schroders was 25 better at 1310p and Kleinwort Benson edged forward 3 to 436p. Securities house UBS was said to have downgraded Allied Domecq. The shares fell 9 to 557p. Bass eased  1/2 to 515 1/2 p as talk returned that it was to buy the Harvester chain of public houses from Forte, which closed 3 lower at 223p. There was also speculation that Scottish &amp; Newcastle was to buy Courage from Australian group Foster's. S&amp;N softened 2 to 479p. Among food manufacturers, Tate &amp; Lyle tumbled 21 to 419p in trade of 1.6m as the market reacted to Tuesday's 'reduce' advice from NatWest Securities. A note from the broker reflected on the near-term outlook for the company after the US government announced last week the establishment of sugar marketing allotments. Fresh produce group Geest bucked the poor market trend to finish 8 ahead at 202p on the news that the European Court of Justice had rejected a challenge to the European Union's banana import regulations. The challenge initiated by Germany could have led to stiffer competition for Geest. British Airways dipped 2 to 354 1/2 p on 5m shares traded following a better than expected 7.3 per cent increase for passenger traffic volume in September. Metals group A. Cohen jumped 30 to 540p ahead of figures due tomorrow. Expectations of good news at today's annual meeting was unable to prevent Ellis &amp; Everard, the chemicals distributor, shedding 3 to 258p.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 SUPERVISORS RAISE $140,000 FOR CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> The three county supervisors up for reelection next year report raising a total  of about $140,000 in campaign money, according to semiannual finance statements  filed Friday.  </P> <P> Supervisor Don R. Roth of Anaheim, who is so far running unopposed, has the  largest campaign fund with about $77,000.  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who represents Huntington Beach, Seal Beach,  Westminster, Cypress and Los Alamitos, reported cash resources of $56,662.  Nobody has formally announced a challenge to Wieder's reelection, but some  prospective candidates from Huntington Beach have expressed interest in the  seat.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who announced his bid for reelection to a fifth  term on Thursday, reported cash on hand of about $10,000. One possible  challenger to Riley is exploring a campaign but has not formally announced.  </P> <P> Riley's district stretches along the county's southern coast from Costa Mesa to  San Clemente.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa attorney Dana Reed had formed a campaign committee to seek Riley's  seat. But Thursday, Reed said he will drop his bid and support Riley.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the Dana Reed for Supervisor 1990 committee raised $60,249  since January and still has a cash balance of $42,984, the records show. Reed  said Thursday that he will return the money to his contributors when Riley  files for his office in February.  </P> <P> Wieder said she expects that her race will cost about $250,000. Roth and Riley  have not announced fund-raising goals. They said the amounts to be raised will  depend on the amount of competition.  </P></p>

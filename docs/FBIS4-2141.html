			<p>BFN     [Text] Police seized a Chinese student who tried to lay a  wreath in Tiananmen Square yesterday. The unidentified man  apparently entered the square -- focus of the 1989 crackdown --  at about 11 am.    One witness said: "The student was carrying an average-sized  wreath of the kind used to commemorate the dead." Another said:  "Police stopped him and requested his identification and he  immediately produced a university identification card. He was  then immediately bundled into a waiting police vehicle."    Tiananmen Square has been ringed day and night by police  since Monday.    The incident coincided with Ching Ming, when Chinese honour  their dead, and comes in a period of sensitive anniversaries,  notably of the April 5, 1976, uprising after Chinese leader Zhou  Enlai's death, and the April 15, 1989, start of pro-democracy  protests in Beijing.    Police were yesterday keeping a close watch on the families  of those killed in the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. "I haven't been  able to go out for Ching Ming because there are too many  police," said the father of one 19-year-old killed in 1989 whose  urn is in Wanan Cemetery at the foot of the Fragrant Hills.  "It's not that I'm afraid, just that I don't want trouble and  the mood is too tense," he said.    The families of Tiananmen dead are close to each other and  take turns visiting the cemeteries. Over Ching Ming, they meet  and telephone each other.    Ding Zilin, a philosophy teacher, goes often to Babaoshan  and  Wanan to tend the urns of young people massacred by the Army.  She lost her only son, Jiang Jielian, 17. But his remains do  not lie in a cemetery. Mrs Ding, who recently signed an open  letter demanding democracy and the release of dissidents, keeps  her son's ashes at home. "For me, Ching Ming is every day," she  said.    Hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents gathered at  Baboashan Cemetery west of the capital to honour the memory of  their ancestors. There were also a number of police, uniformed  and in plain-clothes, carrying still and video cameras and  portable telephones.    Families have been forbidden from burning incense for Ching  Ming because of official fears the accompanying laments might  degenerate into slogan chanting against the government. The  authorities have also been confronted by increasingly active  dissent, prompting a new wave of repression.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 9 (CTK) -- Both the Czech and foreign  options for the privatization of refineries entail high risks,  although they are not of such decisive strategic importance,  Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy says in today's  issue of the daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. When the crude oil  pipeline from Ingoldstadt, Germany, to Kralupy nad Vltavou has  been completed, they will quite certainly lose strategic  importance altogether, he added.    He said he rejected "the slightly naive interpretation" that  selling the refineries to a foreign consortium would be more  advantageous for the Czech Republic, because it would tie the  country closer to Western Europe. Dlouhy says he supported the  "foreign" option because it would in his opinion ensure a speedy  transformation of the Czech petrochemical industry, so that it  would be competitive in Europe. He says a foreign consortium  was offering several advantages, such as solid know-how, capital  "injections", an active trade policy and long-term ties to a  crude oil transportation system.    Dlouhy says that ministers finally chose the Czech variety  because the consortium took a long time to present an offer  which "a responsible government member could submit to the  government." The idea that if the profits are not re-invested,  they would most probably go abroad, was yet another disadvantage.    When commenting on the Czech option, Dlouhy says that if  there is systemic market pressure for a speedy increase in the  productivity and competitiveness of the planned holding company,  the Czech Republic will draw higher profits in the financial,  employment, and other areas than those offered by the foreign  consortium. He says that the ministries of industry and trade  and of privatization will give preference to projects relying on  production companies, not trading organizations.    The Czech option does not exclude foreign capital input,  Dlouhy stresses. "However, it is necessary to know in advance  what will not be possible", he added. It is necessary to  provide clear guarantees that strategic aspects will be  respected, he concludes.</p>

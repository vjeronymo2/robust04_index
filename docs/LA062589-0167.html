			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 31 KILLED, 50 HURT IN BRAZIL CAVE-IN  </P> <P> At least 31 people died Saturday and 50 were seriously hurt when a rural  highway caved in and two crowded buses tumbled into a 100-foot hole, rescue  officials said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred near the rural town of Estancia, about 1,150 miles  northeast of Rio de Janeiro.  </P> <P> The buses, each jammed with 48 travelers, were making the 56-hour, 2,030-mile  trek from the southeastern city of Sao Paulo to Natal, federal police officer  Luis Fernando Borges Santos said.  </P> <P> "They were riding along a high ridge when the road simply gave way beneath  them," said Borges Santos, who assisted rescue workers at the scene. "A hole  the diameter of two buses opened up and sucked them down the drop. It's pitch  black out on that highway -- the drivers probably never saw a thing."  </P> <P> One driver was killed but the other was pulled alive from the wreckage, Santos  said.  </P></p>

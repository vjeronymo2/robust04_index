The order was announced by the  president in his address at the 58th AFP Day Celebration at Camp  Aguinaldo.    According to the chief executive, the sums necessary for the  salary hikes, estimated at 3.2 billion pesos for the uniformed  personnel of the Armed Forces, the Philippine National Police,  and others in uniformed service in the Department of the  Interior and in local government, are already available from the  Compensation Adjustment Fund and from other fund sources  authorized in the 1994 budget.    The president also made clear that the national government's  civilian workers can also expect new adjustments in their  allowances, effective 1994, while a new salary standardization  bill is pending in Congress, and is being consolidated and  streamlined.    Yesterday President Ramos also presented a feasibility study  on the development of a new international passenger terminal at  the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).    The proposed $400 million master development plan prepared  by  Singapore Changi Airport Enterprise under a contract with Asia's  Emerging Dragon Corporation, outlines the necessity of immediate  construction of a new terminal, in the fastest possible manner,  in order to accommodate the expected huge increase in the number  of passengers at NAIA.    The development strategy is to build an initial facility for  24 aircraft stands and for 32 later stands in order to  accommodate the passenger demand of up to 10 million people  forecast for the year 2003, and of up to 15 million for the year  2010.</p>

A survey shows that the region has 9,180 such enterprises  employing 51,000 people.    Their gross income last year amounted to 310 million yuan,  an  increase of 24 percent over the previous year.    This highland region began to develop rural enterprises  later  than the interior parts of the country.    A local official said that the expansion of rural  enterprises  is giving the local people a faint sense of commodity economy  and helping to rationalize and boost the local economy.    The official acknowledged that Tibet's rural enterprises are  concentrated in cities and towns and are developing unevenly.</p>

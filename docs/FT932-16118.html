			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Torday &amp; Carlisle Pounds 13m in red and passes dividend TORDAY &amp; CARLISLE, the Newcastle-based engineer, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.3m for 1992 and passed its final divi- dend for the first time in a decade. The result, which compared with profits of Pounds 25,000, was heavily influenced by exceptional items relating mainly to Oldham Signs, for which the group failed to find a buyer last year. A provision of Pounds 8.21m for goodwill previously set off against reserves on the acquisition five years ago of Oldham was transferred to the profit and loss account, following reassessment of its underlying value. The group stressed the transfer had no effect on shareholders' funds or group borrowings. An exceptional charge of Pounds 3.47m for reorganisation costs included Pounds 2.6m for the restructuring, completed in late December, of the sign subsidiary. Operating losses were Pounds 679,000 (profits of Pounds 1.44m) on turnover of Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 42.8m). Year end gearing rose to 109 per cent. Bank borrowing facilities have been agreed for 1993. Shareholders' approval is to be sought 'as soon as appropriate' for a reorganisation of parent company reserves, said to be necessary before a return to the dividend list. Mr Paul Torday, chief executive, described 1992 as a 'grim' year for the group and said it had decided it would be prudent to 'take the hit' this year rather than be faced with write-offs should it sell Oldham in the future. DMI, the engine repair business, made an operating profit of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 2.2m); Elfab Hughes, which makes pressure relief and safety equipment, raised opera- ting profits to Pounds 775,000 (Pounds 718,000). Oldham Signs incurred an operating loss of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 772,000); the operating loss on central costs was Pounds 679,000 (Pounds 661,000). The 1991 figures were restated to include central costs. Mr Torday said he expected DMI and Elfab Hughes to trade profitably this year; the objective for Oldham, which is now exceeding sales targets, is to break even. The final is passed (3p) leaving no distribution (4.5p) for the year. Losses per share were 81.8p (4.58p), or 30.8p (4.58p) before the goodwill provision.</p>

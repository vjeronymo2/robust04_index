This Selective Enforcement Audit was conducted in complete conformance with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR part 86 and the conditions of the test order. No emission related change(s) to production processes or quality control procedures for the vehicle configuration tested have been made between receipt of this test order and conclusion of the audit. All data and information reported herein is, to the best of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Company Name)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge, true and accurate. I am aware of the penalties associated with violations of the Clean Air Act and the regulations thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Authorized Company Representative) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. A new &sect;86.610&hyph;98 is added to subpart G to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;86.610&hyph;98  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and failing criteria for Selective Enforcement Audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A failed vehicle is one whose final deteriorated test results pursuant to &sect;86.609&hyph;98(c) exceed at least one of the applicable emission standards associated with the test procedures pursuant to &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pass/fail criteria <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The manufacturer shall test vehicles comprising the test sample until a pass decision is reached for all of the pollutants associated with all of the test procedures pursuant to &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a) or a fail decision is reached for one of these pollutants. A pass decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for each pollutant is less than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. A fail decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles for one pollutant is greater than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of vehicles tested are determined by use of the tables in appendix XI of this part appropriate for the annual projected sales as made by the manufacturer in its report submitted under &sect;600.207&hyph;80(a)(2) of this chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations). In the tables in appendix XI of this part, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. Once a pass decision has been made for a particular pollutant associated with a particular test procedure pursuant to &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a), the number of vehicles whose final deteriorated test results exceed the emission standard for that pollutant may not be considered any further for purposes of the audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) CST criteria only. For CST testing pursuant to subpart O, a pass or fail decision is determined according to the pass/fail criteria described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that for each vehicle, the CST in its entirety is considered one pollutant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Passing or failing of an SEA audit occurs when the decision is made on the last vehicle required to make a decision under paragraph (c) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (c) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

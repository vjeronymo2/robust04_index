			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar again testing DM1.50 THE DOLLAR rose over a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, buoyed by stronger than expected US durable goods figures and signs that German inflation is falling, writes James Blitz. The US currency was boosted by data showing that new durable goods orders had risen 2.3 per cent in June after a revised fall of 2.2 per cent in May. Some analysts said that this underscored suggestions that the economy was no longer in danger of a double dip recession, while others remain sceptical about whether this alters the depressing outlook for the US economy at all. However, the bulls clearly had the better of the argument yesterday as the dollar closed over 1 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM1.4995. The dollar is looking much more comfortable this weekend than it was five days ago. Monday's central bank intervention was highly successful, turning the market around at a moment when many dealers were short of the US currency. There are also signs that German inflation data for July, due out next week, will be lower than expected. Several German states reported low inflation figures yesterday and the market believes that the July number will be down 1 per cent to an annualised rate of 3.3 per cent. Nobody is too hopeful that these factors will scotch another Lombard rate rise. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said yesterday that there was a possibility that the Bundesbank would 'relax policy in the foreseeable future,' but the remark was later withdrawn by German Finance Ministry officials who doubtless found it a little exuberant. However, Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew, was reasonably optimistic about the upside for dollar/D-Mark. He said that while the US currency may dip in the immediate short term, it could soon test DM1.55 on the upside. That will also alleviate tensions in the European Monetary system. Yesterday's dollar rise weakened the D-Mark on the crosses, and sterling had its strongest day of the week, closing up 1 1/4 pfennigs at 2.8500. But dealers say that the pound is still intrinsically weak and very much at the mercy of dollar trading. If the US currency falls back to DM1.47 or DM1.46 in the short term, this will put pressure on sterling. The Italian lira would also suffer. Like sterling, it closed stronger against the D-mark yesterday at L757.70 compared to a previous close of L758.6 The dollar defied apparent intervention from the Bank of Japan to move higher against the yen after another sharp drop on the Nikkei stock market and more talk of a Japanese interest rate cut. The dollar rose to Y127.65 from a previous close of Y126.60.</p>

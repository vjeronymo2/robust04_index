			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Churchill China raises just Pounds 7.5m in placing at 280p Churchill China yesterday became the third Staffordshire-based china company to float this year - but the state of the new issues market sharply curbed its ambitions of just three weeks ago. At the time of the pathfinder prospectus on October 5 the company was aiming to raise Pounds 15m through a placing. Yesterday Hoare Govett placed a total of 2.68m ordinary shares, fully underwritten, raising just Pounds 7.5m. Mr Peter Siddall, chairman, described the new issues market as 'not very receptive. We took the view that we had got this far, and we wanted to go ahead.' The shares were priced at 280p to give Churchill a capitalisation of Pounds 29.7m. Earnings are forecast at 25.4p, giving a prospective multiple of 11. Mr Siddall said that when the flotation process was started, the company had been looking at a 'significantly higher' multiple. Of the shares issued, only 1.25m are new, with the remainder being sold by the Roper family that controls the company. There are three Roper brothers on the board, and together with their families and family trusts, they continue to hold the bulk of the 10.62m shares in issue following the placing. The family, which was planning to sell Pounds 10m worth of shares, has sold just Pounds 4m. New money for the company, net of expenses, is Pounds 2.9m. This compares with the Pounds 5m originally expected to help pay for an investment programme to improve capacity and quality. Mr Siddall said yesterday that the company would press ahead with the programme, although the reduction in money raised might lead to some rescheduling. Churchill is forecasting pre-tax profits, before bonuses to directors, of not less than Pounds 3.6m for 1994. This compares with last year's Pounds 2.9m, struck on turnover of Pounds 36m. The notional dividend is 9.86p, giving a notional yield of 4.4 per cent. Dealings begin next Tuesday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [PASASON 5 March Editorial: "Wholeheartedly Welcome for a </F> High-Level Delegation of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of  Cambodia"]    [Text] In response to the invitation of His Excellency  Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly of the Lao  People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], Samdech Chea Sim, chairman  of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and his  delegation will begin an official friendship visit to the LPDR  from the morning of 5 March.    Regarding this important and meaningful event in the  Lao-Cambodia relations, the people of Vientiane and all the  multiethnic Lao people throughout the country are very pleased  and overwhelmingly joyous. They also feel highly honored to  have an opportunity to welcome the high-level delegation of the  National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia. This official  friendship visit to the LPDR by Samdech Chea Sim and his  delegation occurs after the high-level delegations of the  Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Government of the  LPDR [words indistinct]. This shows that the relations and  cooperation in various fields between the LPDR and the Kingdom  of Cambodia in the new era are developing significantly,  especially between the governments and the legislative  institutions of the two countries. The party, state, and  multiethnic people of Laos have always closely followed  developments in the Kingdom of Cambodia, regarding it as our  close neighbor. We all realize that Cambodia is a nation of  energetic and courageous traditions. During the period of the  Khmer Kingdom a world wonder was erected -- the internationally  famous Angkor Wat. Despite hardships in the course of history,  due to the determination of internal factions coupled with  international support, the Cambodian people have now entered a  period of national construction and national reconcililation.  At present this process has reached another step. With the  said responsible determination of various factions, the  fraternal Cambodian people in the Kingdom of Cambodia under the  leadership of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Voraman will  convincingly succeed in making the Kingdom of Cambodia a kingdom  of independence, peace, and neutrality. Together they will  bring progress and prosperity to their country and develop  friendly relations with other countries, beginning with their  neighbors.    The traditional relations of friendship, solidarity, and  cooperation between Lao and Cambodian peoples, have existed for  quite a long time since the ancient days. They have been passed  along from generation to generation from our ancestors. The Lao  people have always firmly nourished such relations and still  have honest and unchangeable intentions to continuously improve  the existing good relations and make them flourish steadily.  Nowadays, Lao and Cambodian peoples are attentively  implementing the principles of the joint communique issued in  July 1993 and the joint statement signed by the two governments  in November 1993 of an agreement on economic, scientific,  technological, and cultural cooperation between the two  countries. The main purpose is to serve the interests of the  peoples of Laos and Cambodia who share many similarities, such  as cultural, traditional, and religious aspects. Suffice it to  say the two countries deservingly enjoy their brotherly and  neighborly relations and solidarity.    On this glorious occasion, all Lao people wish the people in  Cambodia to attain a greater new victory and make a new life to  further create national conciliation and build up the Kingdom of  Cambodia under the monarchic leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk  Voraman with everlasting progress and prosperity. We wish the  visit to the LPDR by Samdech Chea Sim and his delegation  glorious success. We are all confident that through the visit to  the LPDR by the high-level delegation of the National Assembly  of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the relations between the  legislative institutions of the LPDR and the Kingdom of Cambodia  will develop into a new stage that corresponds with economic,  social, and cultural development of each country.</p>

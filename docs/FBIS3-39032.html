			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Giacomo Bonessa report: "Occhetto: `League Comrades: </F> Turn to Me'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] These are the details of the  prestigious game that PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  economist Visco has played.    Decentralize Tax Yields -- Taxes will not be decided and  collected by the government only. Half of them will end up in  Rome and the other half will be set and administered by the  regions and the municipalities, which until now do not have any  responsibility. The local authorities will thus have to be  directly responsible for the services rendered to the citizens  in proportion to the taxes raised. This project will be easy to  realize because it already exists in federal states like the  United States, Canada, Germany, and Switzerland.    End to the Fiscal Jungle -- The system of the thousand heavy  taxes which obsesses taxpayers will be drastically simplified.  Local income tax, ICIAP [local tax for professionals], health  tax, various health contributions, regional surtaxes. The tax  system will also be simplified because a shopkeeper should not  be required to carry out the same bureaucratic tasks as a large  company. The financial administration will be called to  undertake a major effort to hit evaders with maximum severity,  but also to provide reimbursements in time.    Less Tax for Everyone -- Our companies are the most heavily  taxed in Western Europe. The tax rate will be reduced from 52.3  to 40 percent. Receipts can be maintained at the same level by  simply doing away with the laws which favor tax dodging and  removing provisions for special categories and reductions like  the one which [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi had made to  measure in order not to pay tax on assets allocated to TV from  1985 to 1990. There is also a need to untax social security  contributions and reduce indirect burdens for all those  activities (like many craft activities) where the income is  below the average. Another need is for incentives for companies  to take on registered unemployed persons or workers looking for  their first jobs.    Taxes on Treasury Certificates and Wealth Worth -- These are  categorically excluded, even if the tax on government securities  and bonds will be standardized at 12.50 percent. The hard line  of the Communist Renewal which insists on a "wealth tax" will be  softened.    Taxes on Shares -- This is the magician's trick which has  backfired. Visco assures people that there will not be a  worsening in relations with the stock exchange, but at the same  time he states that he will shift the tax burden from the  companies to the companies' owners, that is, onto the  shareholders.    In short a program which, on paper, can please the worker as  much as [industrialist] Agnelli. And indeed the day before  yesterday, Mandrake-Occhetto came out triumphant from his  meeting with the Assolombarda [Industrial Association of  Lombardy] industrialists: "We have passed the exam," he  announced in a conference. It is a pity that the economy is not  just a conjuror's illusion.</p>

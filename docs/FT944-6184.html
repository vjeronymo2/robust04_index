			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tackling 'artificial price' - Stock valuation Rules on the valuation of stock when a trade is discontinued and sold or transferred to a connected person come under scrutiny . The intention is to counter avoidance of tax by enabling an artificial price placed on the stock in these circumstances to be over-ridden for tax purposes. The change will take effect in any case where a trade is discontinued on or after today. It is estimated that the measure will yield Pounds 20m in the tax year 1996-97. At present, when a business is discontinued and its stock in trade is sold to another trader the price of the stock agreed between the parties is regarded as a trading receipt of one and a trading expense of the other, whatever the value of that stock. Where the parties are connected with one another (for example, by means of a family or proprietorial link) the price of the stock is sometimes manipulated to produce an advantageous overall tax result. Typically the stock is sold at undervalue to create losses to carry back against profits in earlier years or to defer the tax liability by transferring it to the purchaser. But occasionally the stock is sold at overvalue to create a profit to absorb earlier trading losses of the vendor and effectively to pass on losses to the purchaser. It is recognised that there may be circumstances where the arm's length rule would impose tax on potentially substantial unrealised profits even though no tax advantage was sought. The rule was introduced in 1938 to ensure that a trader who had stock which had appreciated in value since its acquisition did not escape paying tax on the profits represented by that growth in value by arranging for a disposal of the whole business. It is now, itself, being used to avoid or defer tax, by manipulation of the price agreed between connected parties. The Chancellor produced proposals to protect the capital gains charge which may arise when a company leaves a group, with the intention of closing a loophole in the 'degrouping charge' which may apply when a company leaves a group holding an asset which it acquired from another company within that group. The changes proposed would apply when a company leaves a group on or after today. The Inland Revenue explained that the move was designed to counter a new variation of the 'envelope trick' blocked in previous legislation. One company transfers the asset to a shell subsidiary and both companies then leave the group but in such a way that the group does not in fact lose economic ownership of the degrouped companies. Such artificial degrouping can be achieved by, for example, an outside financial institution subscribing for new shares in the shell company. These new shares would carry negligible economic rights but would cause the two companies to be degrouped for capital gains purposes. No degrouping charge arises because of the let-out for associated companies leaving a group at the same time.</p>

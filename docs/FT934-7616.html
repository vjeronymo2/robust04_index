			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Clinton got his backing at a bargain price  -The administration won the support it needed in congress for Nafta without tying its trade negotiating hands IT WAS a deal the president could not refuse: support for his tax programme from the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee in exchange for approval of a sugar price support scheme. That was the bargain made in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, the proclaimed free trader, with Senator Russell Long of Louisiana. The effects are still being felt. The tax cut added billions to the US budget deficit and the sugar programme curbed developing country exports to the world's most lucrative sugar market. The deals cut by the administration of President Bill Clinton to get House approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement pale in comparison. As set out in a letter to various congressmen, they are long on expressions of concern but carefully hedged by conditions which ought not tie US negotiators' hands in the Uruguay Round. They could result in some industry protection, but mostly the pacts appear useful in providing political cover for pro-Nafta congressmen. On textiles for example, the president promised to dedicate an additional Dollars 15m for enforcement of Customs regulations and the hiring of 136 new Customs Service employees to detect transhipment and other illegalities. He reassured congressmen that China would get no quota increase from the Uruguay Round until it becomes a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 'and agrees to open its markets to US textiles and apparel'. He vowed to negotiate the longest possible phase-out of textile quotas. If the six-country Association of South East Asian Nations, the Caribbean countries and Ireland will support a 15-year phase-out period, the US will seek to re-open the current text 'to negotiate acceptance of such a proposal'. With respect to textile tariff cuts - a key to the tariff reduction talks in Geneva - the president says these should be staged over a period 'at least as long as the phase-out of the MFA (the Multi-Fibre Arrangement)'. Furthermore, he promised not to include 'sensitive products', such as wool, until the end of the phase-out period, and to work with the industry and Congress to determine which products are the most sensitive. In talks between the US and European Union industries, the president 'would not anticipate going substantially beyond our current proposals on sensitive products'. On another deal concerning imports of peanut products from Canada, the president ordered the agriculture secretary to begin talks with the Canadian government 'to remedy the increase in imports'. He also requested the US International Trade Commission, an independent bipartisan agency, to investigate the imports to see if they are undermining the US price support programme. This ultimately could lead to higher tariffs or quotas against Canadian peanut butter. Congressmen involved in a deal over citrus would not release their presidential letters. However, one said it contained a promise not to cut the US citrus tariff by more than 15 per cent in the Uruguay Round. Backers of beef producers were also reluctant to release their letters. However, one said the president had promised to abide by an established US-Mexican agreement, predating Nafta, which would allow US meat inspectors to visit Mexican facilities during on-going investigations without advance notice. He also agreed to boost the number of inspectors from 250 to 350. One of the most satisfied deal makers was the Florida Congressman Clay Shaw, who had demanded extradition from Mexico of a man wanted in California for the rape of a child. He said he had received assurances from the Mexican government that the extra-dition treaty would be honoured.</p>

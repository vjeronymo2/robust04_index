			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 (YONHAP) -- North Korean President Kim  Il- song promised Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1991 that  Pyongyang would not develop nuclear weaponry, the MAINICHI  SHIMBUN reported from San Francisco on Monday.    The newspaper quoted a senior U.S. official as saying that  Kim clearly told Deng his country had neither the intention nor  ability to develop nuclear arms during a visit to China in  October 1991. Based on this pledge, China is continuing to  respect North Korea's position until it can be proven that  Pyongyang broke its promise.    China notified South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, during  his trip to Beijing last March, and the U.S. Government of Kim  Il-song's nuclear promise. Beijing also informed the two nations  that it would take decisive action if Pyongyang broke its  promise, according to the paper.    Senior Chinese leaders told President Kim Yong-sam that they  opposed international sanctions against North Korea and asked  Kim to understand their position, MAINICHI said. The newspaper  said the Chinese emphasized to South Korea's president that "if  things that impair the honor of China happen, then China will  take decisive action." The paper noted that China also explained  its basic position to Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary  for political and military affairs, during his recent visit to  China. The Chinese leaders told Gallucci that it was too early  to prepare sanctions against North Korea.</p>

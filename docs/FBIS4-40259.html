			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and </F> Vladimir Konoplitsky]    [Text] Blagoveshchensk June 15 TASS -- President Boris  Yeltsin is expected to sign a decree soon on a new phase of  privatisation, Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov  told journalists on Wednesday.    Yeltsin is to apply to the Federal Assembly and initiate a  bill on a new phase of cheque privatisation which will meet both  the interests of the country and those of regions and large  cities.    This step by the president, in the opinion of the press  secretary, develops and furthers the privatisation ideology  worked out by the State Property Committee, and clearly  differentates between federal, municipal and private property.  Thus, the very dispute about privatisation methods at various  levels will be politically settled.    Tackling this problem, the president proceeds from the  assumption that under privatisation conditions, it is federal  property interests first of all that must be upheld. No  personnel reshuffles at the State Property Committee are  expected. So, Anatoliy Chubays and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov  will have nothing to argue about any longer, Kostikov said.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ernest Green falls to Pounds 342,000 Ernest Green and Partners Holdings, the USM-quoted engineering consultancy, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.11m to Pounds 342,000 in the six months to December 31. Turnover was lower at Pounds 5.82m against Pounds 4.03m. The company blamed the recession in the UK construction industry and said it could see no sign of an upturn. Staff had been cut by 30 per cent over the past year and further reductions may be necessary. A Pounds 142,000 provision for redundancies was taken as an exceptional charge. Earnings per share came out at 2.9p (8.8p) and the interim dividend is held at 2.75p. There was an extraordinary credit of Pounds 133,000 from the gain on the sale of a property less head office relocation costs.</p>

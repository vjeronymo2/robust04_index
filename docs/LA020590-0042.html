			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIANS BREAK OFF TALKS, DECRY AZERBAIJANI PRESSURE;  </P> <P> ETHNIC STRIFE: DELEGATES HEAD HOMEWARD. DISAGREEMENT CENTERS ON TWO KEY  VILLAGES.  </P> <P> Armenian negotiators broke off informal peace talks with Azerbaijanis and  headed home Sunday after accusing them of pressuring Armenians to evacuate two  villages in Azerbaijan, a participant said.  </P> <P> Armenian leaders also said that the Armenian All-National Movement is refusing  to ratify an agreement to seek a peaceful settlement of the conflict and  exchange information on hostages.  </P> <P> The talks, held in Riga, Latvia, without the participation of the Soviet  government, began Friday with mediators from people's fronts movements in the  western republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Direct talks followed on  Saturday.  </P> <P> "Everything went well until there was a pause in the talks. Then the leaders of  the Armenian All-National Movement in Yerevan told the negotiators to cut the  talks," said Ints Upmacis, a Latvian People's Front leader present during the  meeting.  </P> <P> The Armenians headed for Yerevan early Sunday, Upmacis said in a telephone  interview.  </P> <P> The Armenian political movement in Yerevan accused the Azerbaijan People's  Front of pressing Armenian residents to evacuate the villages of Azad and Kamo  in the Khanlar region of Azerbaijan, the official news agency Tass reported.  </P> <P> The residents were told they are in danger of being attacked, and the Armenians  contend that the army said it is unable to guarantee their safety, Upmacis  said.  </P> <P> "The Armenian National Movement board does not find it possible to continue  joint consultations in Riga," a statement issued by the movement's press center  in Yerevan said. "Joint consultations and talks can be possible in the future  only on condition of the termination of such actions."  </P> <P> When informed that the Armenians were planning to leave the talks, the  Azerbaijani negotiators agreed to try to verify the Armenian claim, but  Communist Party officials and Soviet army officials reached in the Azerbaijani  capital of Baku said they had no information to support the charges.  </P> <P> The Azerbaijani delegation said it is ready to resume talks with the Armenians  and departed for a meeting of representatives of pro-democracy groups in the  Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, Upmacis said.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Azerbaijani People's Front in Baku could not be immediately  reached to comment on the Armenian decision.  </P> <P> Outbreaks of ethnic violence have plagued the two southern republics for two  years after Armenia's demand for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a  predominantly Armenian enclave located inside Azerbaijan.  </P></p>

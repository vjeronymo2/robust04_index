			<p>BFN     [Text] The personnel appointment regarding the post of  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. [NTT] president, which  developed into a dispute among political circles because of the  Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's [PTM] attempt to promote  Shigeo Sawada, NTT vice president and former administrative vice  minister, to the position, reached a conclusion after NTT  President Hitoshi Kojima chose to remain in his current post.    On the surface, the PTM is generally viewed as having  yielded  to the "criticism of bureaucrats' practice of amakudari" [a  practice known as 'descent from heaven' in which former senior  bureaucrats receive high-paying jobs in the private sector or in  public corporations]. However, the PTM is not that weak-kneed.    Strengthening their grip on NTT is an absolutely necessary  card for PTM officials to "promote competition in the domestic  telecommunications market," which is an important issue. That  they will compromise before the public's criticism of  bureaucrats is unthinkable. It should be considered that their  judgment was calculated in relation to the resumption of  Japan-U.S. framework talks.    In the "government procurement" sector, which is one of the  three priority areas of the talks, Japan and the United States  are sharply at odds over whether to include NTT's procurement of  materials as a negotiations topic, along with government  procurement. The U.S. side demands: "NTT is a semi-government  agency whose stocks are held by the government, and the Japanese  Government should promise [to open] NTT's procurement of  materials [to foreign suppliers]." The fact that NTT's  procurement, which amounts to more than 1 trillion yen a year,  is far more profitable than government procurement, is too  obvious for the United States to overlook.    In response, Japan has been refuting the U.S. side saying:  "NTT is a company that has already been privatized. If the  government guides its procurement, it will be a managed trade."    Having said that, if a former PTM official were appointed to  the post of NTT president, the Japanese Government might end up  adding fuel to U.S. criticism that "the government and NTT are  one." That is why the PTM posed as making a concession this  time.    Of course, the PTM has not given up its "NTT President  Sawada" plan. This can be inferred from the fact that the PTM  blocked a move toward shelving Sawada to the post of chairman  with all its strength.    There is strong indication that PTM maneuvering, including  personnel appointments, will become active again, once the  negotiations between Japan and the United States are concluded.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Managers' pay doubled under Thatcher THE THATCHER years saw British managements double their earnings and become less Oxbridge-dominated and better qualified, according to a survey of British Institute of Management members published today. At the same time, they changed jobs more often and had to work longer hours. Managers were five years older on average in 1990 than in 1980. By the end of the decade he - she remained very much the exception - was more likely to work in commerce, rather than industry, to own part of his company and to have mellowed in his attitude to trade unions. In 1980 the average manager's annual earnings were Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000. By 1990 that had grown significantly more than inflation to Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 30,000. The study finds that reductions in the higher levels of taxation during the decade contributed to greater affluence, particularly for senior managers in the private sector. Middle-class origins still prevailed at the end of the Thatcher reign but - her successor will be cheered to learn - 'not to such an extent (as) to suggest that there is no possibility of social mobility within our society'. More than half of all managers had degree-level qualifications by 1990, compared with about a third in 1980. Oxbridge representation among those with degrees fell from 14 per cent at the start of the decade to 7 per cent at the end. A shift to the sciences was pronounced. In 1980, 12 per cent of managers had a science qualification, compared with 27 per cent in 1990. The survey authors, two Cardiff Business School professors, nevertheless point out that British managers cannot afford to be complacent about their academic achievements. They say: 'Managers are significantly better educated than the population generally, but equally it is clear that they do not compare with the learned professions, where almost 100 per cent of today's professionals are graduates.' Working hours have increased, according to questionnaires completed by more than 800 BIM members. In 1990 nearly a third said they worked between 51 and 60 hours a week, compared with nearer a quarter in 1980. The authors note that the trend does nothing for family life or equality of the sexes. The sharp decline in trade union influence in the Thatcher years is reflected in the benign tolerance British managers now feel able to express towards their former adversaries. In 1980, 82 per cent of mangers thought trade unions had too much power, compared with 32 per cent in 1990. British Management in the Thatcher Years.

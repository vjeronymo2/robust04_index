			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Bank approves Dollars 300m loan for Peru THE World Bank has approved a Dollars 300m (Pounds 165.7m) loan to Peru to assist in the refinancing of the country's total foreign debt of about Dollars 22bn. The credit, the first of a series totalling Dollars 900m, comes much sooner than expected. The loan will not be physically disbursed, since it is part of an internal accounting mechanism - similar to the 'rights accumulation' scheme employed by the International Monetary Fund - to cover Peru's Dollars 900m arrears with the World Bank. Once the total amount has been approved, Peru will be eligible for fresh credits. The early decision on the loan demonstrates World Bank approval of the speed of economic reform under President Alberto Fujimori. Since Mr Fujimori took office 18 months ago, import tariffs have been dramatically reduced and simplified, export subsidies ended and state monopolies and trade controls eliminated. The World Bank credit is repayable over 20 years with five years grace. It is at a variable interest rate, currently around 7.7 per cent. In what is being interpreted locally as a further sign of support and approval on the part of the international financial organisations, Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, will visit Lima next week. President Fujimori, due to begin a visit to London today, says his economic programme and anti-guerrilla strategy will defeat a Maoist insurgent movement, Reuter reports from London. 'Return to the world financial community, the relative success of our anti-inflation programme, structural reforms to make the state more efficient and re-estabishment of a sense of authority are achievements which mark a defeat for terrorists who fanatically seek to create chaos,' Mr Fujimori said.</p>

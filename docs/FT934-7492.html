			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Drink a day keeps doctor away Sir, I wonder which bureaucrat dreamed up the requirement for Britain's already over-worked general practitioners to report twice-yearly on the number of alcoholic drinks consumed by each of their patients? It could, of course, be a cost-cutting exercise. As the moderate consumption of alcohol can be beneficial to health, perhaps the objective is to encourage increased consumption, thereby decreasing the necessity for visits to the surgery and lowering prescription costs?

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Men for whom Guinness proved a poisoned chalice THE END of the final Guinness trial leaves the seven men charged earlier in the case to get on with rebuilding their personal and professional lives. Some have returned to prominence in the City, others may never recover from the impact of the charges on their careers. Mr Ernest Saunders was convicted in the first trial on 12 counts of theft, false accounting and conspiracy, and sentenced to five years in jail, later reduced to 2 1/2 years by the Court of Appeal. He was released after serving 10 months. Since his release from Ford open prison, Mr Saunders has acted as an independent business consultant. Fiercely critical of the roles played by his prosecutors and the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Saunders has lectured on the problems facing businessmen whose conduct comes under question, and given evidence to legal bodies. He is preparing to launch a legal action in the European Court, in effect asking for a judicial review of the roles of the DTI, SFO and other legal processes brought against those accused of serious fraud. Mr Roger Seelig, a former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, yesterday condemned the system which disrupted his life: 'What must be fundamentally wrong is the length of time it has taken to bring it all to a conclusion. To take seven years over a regulatory matter of this instance may have been politically necessary at the time, but it cannot be a sensible way of tackling it.' His trial on fraud and false accounting charges was abandoned after he broke down due to the stress of conducting his own defence. Further charges were dropped. Mr Seelig has not made a public return to the City, although he has been involved in consultancy work. He was yesterday appointed a director of Norman Hay, a small engineering company, and said he hoped to return to the City in a professional capacity shortly. Charges of fraud and false accounting against Lord Spens, a former corporate financier at merchant bankers Henry Ansbacher, were initially left on the file after the collapse of the trial due to Mr Seelig's ill-health. After a long High Court battle, Lord Spens secured his acquittal, although this has yet to be formally granted. Lord Spens has yet to make a comeback to the City since he is presently dealing with fall-out from the Guinness affair. He is trying to win back legal costs in excess of Pounds 300,000 and has issued writs against the Bank of England and Henry Ansbacher relating to his dismissal from the Bank. He is also preparing a paper on long fraud trials to be submitted to the Lord Chancellor's Department. It will contain 'very hard hitting' criticisms of his prosecutors, he promises. Mr Gerald Ronson, founder and chairman of the Heron group, was fined Pounds 5m and served six months of a one-year jail sentence at Ford open prison, after being convicted on theft, false accounting and conspiracy charges. After his release, Mr Ronson returned to the helm of Heron, but the company was suffering serious financial problems. He is negotiating with banks over restructuring Heron's Pounds 1.4bn debts. Mr David Mayhew, a partner at Cazenove, the stockbrokers, is the only Guinness defendant whose career was not interrupted by the affair. He was arrested in 1988 on charges relating to the purchase of shares in Distillers by Pipetec, a Swiss company, but his employers were convinced of his innocence. By permission of the Securities and Futures Authority he was able to continue working at Cazenove's, under the supervision of colleagues, while charges were outstanding against him. The charges were dropped in February 1992, before the case came to court. Mr Mayhew remains a powerful figure in corporate finance, as head of Cazenove's syndicate department. Mr Anthony Parnes was convicted on four counts of theft and false accounting, and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail, reduced to 21 months by the Court of Appeal. He was released after serving 11 months, but has found it impossible to find his way back into the City. Following his conviction the Securities and Futures Authority has refused to relicense him to engage in any stockbroking work. Mr Jack Lyons was fined Pounds 3m after being convicted on six counts of conspiracy, false accounting, and theft. Sentencing him, the judge said only his ill-health had saved the financier from a prison sentence. He was stripped of his knighthood. Still suffering from illness, Mr Lyons has retired from his business career and is now living in Switzerland.</p>

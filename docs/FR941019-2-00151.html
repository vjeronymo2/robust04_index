			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Why Will English Law Be Permitted To Govern All Important Questions of Law? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Persons, companies and entities who become assignees/sublicensees under License Agreements with a member of the Pilkington Group may become subject to the choice of law provisions contained in the original License Agreements. While DOJ has challenged the Pilkington Group's contracting practices, the Final Judgment does nothing to change a central feature of the License Agreements. Even more ominously, the Final Judgment introduces vagueness and ambiguity concerning these features leaving the Defendants free to argue entirely different meanings in venues outside the jurisdiction of the District Court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout the proposed Final Judgement, particularly in reference to the issue of Confidential Information, the phrase ``applicable'' law appears. Under the License Agreements available to Commenting Party, the Pilkington Group chose the laws of England to govern the interpretation and application of such License Agreements. It is highly likely that this choice of law appears in all relevant License Agreements and will through the assignment/sublicensing process sought by DOJ run through any future relevant Agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the words ``applicable law'' appears in the phrase'' *&blank;*&blank;* trade secret under applicable law *&blank;*&blank;*.'' What does this mean? The learned treatise  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The Legal Protection of Trade Secrets <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (the ``English Treatise''), at Section 2.2.5 says ``The term trade secret is not really a term of art in English law in contrast with its usage in American law *&blank;*&blank;*. Thus, the effect of the Final Judgment appears to be that the laws of England will apply to the interpretation of the concept of ``trade secret'' and such English law does not use such words as a ``term of art.'' Does this mean that Defendants' lawyers will be free to fill in for English arbitrators (the Final Judgment makes no attempt to eliminate the London venue and English arbitrators that have apparently been used with such anti-competitive effect in litigation with licensees) what the term means? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The English Treatise offers two (2) formulations of the concept of ``confidential information.'' Which of the two rules will apply? Which of them, if either, furthers the purposes of the Final Judgment? Why will the Defendants be left with the power to argue their interpretation of what ``trade secret under applicable law'' means to arbitrators sited in London? Why should the District Court be confident that the purposes of the Final Judgment will be given effect by English arbitrators interpreting the vague and ambiguous language of an order of, to them, a foreign court? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue also is raised in another context by Final Judgment Article IV.B.1. which refers to restrictions on competition under ``applicable law.'' If English law governs this issue too, how will the District Court be assured that such law is consistent with the purposes of the Final Judgment? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, these vague and ambiguous formulations favor the Defendants and the perpetuation of the contractual regime challenged by DOJ. The Final Judgment obscures this issue by not disclosing that English laws governs every Agreement that is important in the future assignment/sublicensing activity sought by DOJ. Nothing in the Final Judgment purpose to guide (much less control) the arbitrators in their interpretation of the License Agreements and assignments/sublicenses under them in light of the Final Judgement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 6. The Final Judgment should expressly reserve jurisdiction to the District Court to decide what laws are applicable in any future litigation involving the Defendants and any person, company or entity that is an assignee/sublicensee under any Agreement derived from a License Agreement with a member of the Pilkington Group. The Final Judgment could permit interlocutory appeals to the District Court of any questions of interpretation and expressly subject the arbitrators to the District Court's jurisdiction. The Final Judgment could permit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> de novo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  judicial review by the District Court of any decisions of arbitrators respecting any such assignees/sublicensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 7. The Final Judgment could also replace the arbitration venue provisions of the License Agreements with the venue of the District Court. This would ensure that any arbitrators are subject to the District Court's jurisdiction. The Defendants are already subject to the District Court's jurisdiction and venue and there is no hint in the Stipulation that the venue is inconvenient to the members of the Pilkington Group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Why Is Retributive Conduct Not Prohibited After Expiration of the Final Judgment? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Article VII.A. of the Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment will expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry. What happens then to persons, companies or entities who have invested millions of dollars in obtaining the purported benefits of the Final Judgment by assignment and/or sublicensing under License Agreements? There will then be no prohibition against the Defendants enforcing their contract and other rights. Upon such expiration, can the Defendants enforce all of their suspended rights to the extent that they haven't lapsed by application of any applicable statute of limitations? What is the applicable statute? Does the phrase ``applicable law'' mean that this issue is governed by the laws of England. If English law governs, The Limitation Act of 1980 provides for a six (6) year statute of limitations for breach of contract claims. Will this not mean that assignments and/or grants of sublicenses by U.S. Licensees in year five (5) after the entry of the Final Judgement are subject to suit in year eleven (11)? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Is the applicable statute of limitations tolled during the effectiveness of the Final Judgment? Is it the intention of the Final Judgment to bar certain claims, not to suspend them? The Final Judgment should make this clear, whether by providing that the Defendants shall not assert that the Final Judgment has tolled any statute of limitations, or otherwise. Alternatively, the Final Judgment could simply be made permanent with respect to all facts and circumstances arising during the ten (10) year period the Final Judgment is effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 8. At the least, Article VII.A. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. This Final Judgment shall expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry provided, however, that not withstanding such expiration, the Defendants and their present and future affiliates and subsidiaries shall not thereafter take any action prohibited by this Final Judgment with respect to any License Agreement or any other Agreement entered into by any Licensee respecting assignment and/or sublicensing under any License Agreement prior to such expiration date. This Final Judgment does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  toll any statute of limitations as to any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> existing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  claims or claims of the Defendants that, but for this Final Judgment, would have risen during the time this Final Judgment is in force. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Is the Necessary Float Technology Really in the Public Domain? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 9. What is the basis for the conclusion set our in press statements by DOJ that the Float Technology embodied in Patents expiring in 1982 and before and other technology in the public domain is sufficient to enable a prospective entrant to construct and operate a competitive Float Glass plant? There appear to be hundreds of Pilkington Group Patents in the United States and hundreds of others in foreign countries. Has DOJ in consultation with anyone in the Float Glass industry or who is a prospective entrant, determined that none of these Patents describes Float Technology needed for a competitive Float Glass plant? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

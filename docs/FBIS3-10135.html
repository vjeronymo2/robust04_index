At the moment of its  enforcement on 1 March, the URV will be worth 647.50 real  cruzeiros. The decision to implement the URV as an index  currency seeks to avoid judicial pleas at the time of converting  salaries and other prices to the new index.    The MP also creates a "Stabilization Council," which will be  comprised of the Central Bank president and directors and three  people with demonstrated knowledge about monetary policies. They  will be in charge of suggesting a new monetary system and the  way of backing its currency.    The government wants the currency to be backed by exchange  reserves. In other words, the amount of real to be issued must  have its equivalent in reserves, otherwise it will not be  issued. This is how the economic team plans to make the real a  strong currency: any attempt to increase prices will not be  sanctioned by an equivalent increase in the amount of  circulating currency. More demand for currency will make the  cost of money -- the interests -- go up, thus discouraging  consumption and forcing businessmen to reduce prices.    Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso plans to launch  the real before May. Cardoso's advisers believe that the URV  should be in force for, at least, three months. This period  already is a compromise to Cardoso's political considerations.    According to the economic team, the Stabilization Council  will also guide the government on how to end the use of the URV  and to convert contracts in real cruzeiros to the new currency.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Who Knows Whom to be SA bestseller: ANC links in a publishing joint venture WHEN does a fledgling investment company with no track record, no assets to speak of, inexperienced management and no publishing expertise become the perfect joint venture partner in a potentially lucrative publishing deal? When that company has the probable future government of South Africa on its side. Thebe Investment Corporation, a black-managed company which has strong links with the African National Congress, this week announced it had reached agreement with Macmillan of the UK to launch an educational publishing company. Thebe will own 42.5 per cent of the new company, Macmillan 47.5 per cent and an existing small black-owned publisher, Skotaville, 10 per cent. Though all parties to the deal deny this, rivals believe that Thebe will use its excellent contacts with the ANC to see that the new company gets lucrative contracts to publish school textbooks - just as the ruling National party has for decades steered important public sector contracts the way of Afrikaner businesses which have in turn helped bankroll the party. The party channeled state business to other members of the white tribe of Africa, with the aim of lifting Afrikaners out of poverty and strengthening their hold on power. The Thebe deal has caused consternation in South African business circles, because the only apparent rationale for it is political. Many South Africans fear the country's new rulers will take their principles of governance straight from the National party. Black empowerment - the mirror image of Afrikaner upliftment - is Thebe's primary goal, says Mr Vusi Khanyile, managing director. Mr Khanyile was formerly head of the ANC finance department; another member of the Thebe board, Mr Tokyo Sexwale, is a chairman of the ANC in the powerful region around Johannesburg and is one of its most prominent leaders; a third board member, Mr Enos Mabuza, has strong personal links to the ANC though he holds no official position. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, and Mr Walter Sisulu, deputy president, are trustees of the Batho-Batho trust, Thebe's sole shareholder. Mr Khanyile angrily denies suggestions that Thebe is an ANC company, and insists that the political affiliation of Thebe board members is irrelevant. 'Our links with the ANC have nothing to do with the viability of our business or the market share it will have,' he says, denying that Macmillan can expect privileged access to the R500m (Pounds 100m) educational publishing market. Still, he adds: 'Business must ensure that it is in harmony with the environment in which it operates. Thebe tries to remain in harmony with that environment. So we wouldn't go out of our way to make enemies with any political organisation.' Thebe was set up late last year, relies almost entirely on loan capital and has been plagued by frequent press reports of financial problems and alleged irregularities since its launch. Asked why Macmillan should strike a deal with a company such as Thebe, Mr Khanyile says only that Thebe is the biggest black investment company. This claim is impossible to assess, as Thebe discloses no financial details of its operations. In any event, Thebe is not the only black company Macmillan could have chosen. It is simply the best connected. Mr Christopher Paterson, chairman of Macmillan's southern African operations, says of the deal, which will involve an initial investment of R2m from the three partners: 'It is a conscious act to come in and redress the balance in educational publishing by starting a company which in its demographic make up reflects that of South Africa' and which gives a high priority to black employment. Other businessmen dismiss these as 'pious platitudes'. One director of a leading corporation says: 'It's but a step to a Nigerian situation where no business is done on commercial logic. It's all done on . . . who you know.' 'Thebe adds no value to this deal,' says another. 'It could well lend itself to abuse.' A disgruntled publisher adds: 'One group of nationalists are just taking over the levers of power from another group of nationalists.' Many fear that in this, as in other areas of public life, the new South Africa could end up having far too much in common with the old.</p>

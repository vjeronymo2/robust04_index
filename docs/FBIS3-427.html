The IFP said any further steps in its participation in the  electoral process would be conditional on mediation to try to  resolve outstanding consttational differences, mediation on  amendng the 1993 constitution "and rationalisng the electoral  process and timetable to translate constitutional agreements  into a fair and free election in which all parties can compete  on an equal footing".    Mediation had also to relate to whatever steps Zulu King  Goodwill Zwelithini might decide upon to secure the interests of  the kingdom of kwaZulu, the IFP decided. It added that mediation  was also required on the constitutional resolution and the  investigation of criminal violence.    The IFP said it would inform leaders of its partners in the  Freedom Alliance of its decision and would "seek their agreement  and co-operation in developing a satisfactory way forward".</p>

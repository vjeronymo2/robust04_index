Liaoning Province is one of the country's major industrial  bases. Its state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises  account for almost one tenth of the country's total.    As the pillar of its economy, industrial enterprises have  been pushed to the forefront of Liaoning's reform and opening.    The Liaoning provincial government has actively absorbed  foreign investment, introduced advanced technology and adopted  new operating mechanisms in local industry.    So far, 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in funds have been  earmarked  for technological transformations in industrial enterprises all  over the province.    Instead of simply buying up advanced technologies from  foreign enterprises, a number of Liaoning's major industrial  enterprises also stress developing new technologies of their own.    As a newly developed economic sector, high-tech industries  in  Liaoning have scored great achievements.    Nanhu science and technology development zone in the  provincial capital city of Shenyang, one of the first zones of  its kind approved by the State Council, has seen the  establishment of 1,100 high-tech enterprises.    Technology exports from Liaoning last year topped 100  million  U.S. dollars, as compared to previous years when the province  was a technology importer only.    Economic structuring within enterprises has also been  readjusted to meet the needs of the market. Although heavy  industry still holds sway in Liaoning, light industry has gained  substantial growth and some heavy industrial enterprises have  even begun to produce light industrial products as a complement  to their traditional production lines.    Export-oriented sections of state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises have also burgeoned.    Technology-intensive and investment-intensive productions  have flourished while labor-intensive ones have shrunk.    Readjustment of the industrial structure has correspondingly  promoted the rationalization of product mix. The output ratio  of primary products to finished products now stands at six to  four, as compared with the original eight to two.    At present, half of Liaoning's products for export are  finished products, whereas in the past 85 percent were raw  materials.    Reform of labor and personnel systems and the introduction  of  shareholding systems have further invigorated state-owned  enterprises.    The reform and opening drive has laid a solid foundation for  Liaoning's industrial enterprises to implement a modern  enterprise system and to better adapt to international markets.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investment plans dim paper hopes - Capacity boosts may stall recovery The disclosure last week that two of Sweden's big pulp and paper groups are planning significant new capacity investments sent shivers through a market that is just getting used to the idea that the good times are back. Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper company, said it was starting design work on a new 290,000-tonnes-a-year board machine - an investment that would cost around SKr2.8bn (Pounds 240m). MoDo, meanwhile, is expected to confirm next month that it will go ahead with the construction of a SKr2.1bn newsprint machine, with a capacity of 270,000 tonnes, at its Braviken plant. These are by some margin the biggest investments to be announced by Swedish forestry groups this year. But the news did not go down well with the market where memories of the severe downturn in the forestry cycle between 1991 and 1993 are still painfully fresh. 'Last time it was not lack of demand that drove operating rates down - it was excess capacity,' says Mr Mads Asprem, forestry analyst with Morgan Stanley in London. He says much of the optimism now surrounding the industry assumes there will only be limited construction of new capacity. The reason for this optimism is simple: prices in virtually every pulp and paper segment are on the rise and in an industry characterised by strong cyclical patterns there is every indication that the market is firmly on the road up to its next peak two or three years hence. The price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, the industry staple, has already reached Dollars 700 a tonne, up 80 per cent from Dollars 390 at the end of last year. Prices for fine paper, of which pulp is the major constituent, have been increased five times in 1994. Now the trend is feeding further down to the chain to newsprint and magazine paper grades where rises of 10 and 20 per cent have either been implemented or notified. The upturn has been demand-driven in line with the recovering world economy. Increased volumes first boosted operating rates and are now lifting prices. In Finland, the forestry industry is effectively running flat out with an operating rate of 94 per cent, compared with 88 per cent last year. The recovery is at an early stage and prices are still below the levels reached at the last market peak in 1989-1990. 'Paper and board prices fell by 30 to 35 per cent between 1991 and 1993,' notes Mr Jarl Kohler, managing director of the Finnish Forestry Industries Federation. The pulp price reached Dollars 840 a tonne in 1989, and although most pundits believe that peak may well be scaled during the current upswing, they warn that progress is unlikely to be even. 'There is a serious chance of an inventory-driven correction in the second half of 1995,' says Mr Asprem. There is also a strong possibility that companies will be unable to get the price rises they are seeking in full. For example, analysts say newsprint producers may be optimistic in hoping for a 20 per cent price increase from the start of next year. Buyer resistance could limit the rise to between 10 and 15 per cent despite stronger demand and a surge in waste paper prices. Although Nordic forestry groups are back in profit, the turnaround has stemmed from cost-cutting, volume increases and currency factors. In the first half of this year, higher prices were only just starting to feed through to the bottom line. There will be a more pronounced impact in the second half, although much of the gain will be offset by the recent strengthening of both the Finnish and Swedish currencies. With some segments - uncoated magazine paper, for example - prices are almost certainly going to be lower in local currency terms in 1994 than they were in 1993. Stronger currencies are not the only worry for the Nordic producers. Their costs are going up - particularly for pulp wood, which has risen by around 15 per cent since the market trough. There is also a widespread expectation that the 1995 wage round is going to be a difficult one as employees seek their share of the sector's upturn. Finally, there is the dampening effect of high long-term interest rates. Mr Kohler notes that every 1 per cent interest rate increase costs the Finnish forestry industry FM650m (Pounds 85m), every 1 per cent rise in the markka FM400m, every 1 per cent rise in wood costs FM120m and every 1 per cent increase in salaries FM100m. He also points out that although Finnish pulp and paper companies will earn more than FM3bn this year, income will be well short of the 'normal' FM7bn level required to cover investments, debt repayments, R &amp; D costs etc. A spending spree in the late 1980s and early 1990s left most of Finland's big forestry groups heavily in debt and they have been in no hurry to announce new investments this time round. Instead, the talk in the country's forestry industry has been of streamlining and mergers. Even so, the return to profitability and low short-term interest rates are fast reducing the debt burden and the strengthening markka is cutting the cost of servicing the foreign currency element of it. It may not be long before the Finns are tempted to follow the example of their neighbours by ordering new machinery.</p>

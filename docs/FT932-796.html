			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Warm reception for French bank share flotation CREDIT Local de France, the French banking group, yesterday said its FFr4.2bn (Dollars 750m) sale of state-owned shares had been heavily over-subscribed, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The domestic tranche drew applications for 113m shares, or 17 times the number available. The international tranche generated applications for seven times the 4.4m shares allocated to foreign investors. Some FFr2.4bn will go to the government, while FFr1.8bn will go to Caisse des Depots, the public-sector financial institution which sold the rest of the shares.</p>

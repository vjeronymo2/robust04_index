			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Nervousness again pervaded stock index futures which dragged down the cash market as the June contract dipped below the psychologically important 3,100 level, writes Christine Buckley. Although the June contract on the FT-SE 100 began trading firmly and climbed to its intraday high of 3,156 early in the session, sentiment proved weak for the rest of the day. One derivatives specialist blamed a high level of proprietary trading and panic selling for the volatility which is seeming to defy reason. Curiously, selling of the contract set in shortly after the small cut in the German repo rate was announced. Then the higher than expected rise in average earnings sent June heading south fast to fall below 3,100. 'It is almost as though people have given up thinking,' said the specialist. June struggled with the 3,100 mark throughout the session, constantly slipping beneath it. Its lowest point was 3,092 and it closed at 3,094 with a pick-up in turnover on recent sessions to reach 16,378 contracts. Options were steady with 36,948 lots traded. In a fast market, which has affected futures trading recently, all operations of Liffe - including the clearing house system - operate as usual, except screen prices are not firm.</p>

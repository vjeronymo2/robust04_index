			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Olivier Lauvige: "Secrets of the Renault Sport </F> Semiautomatic Gearbox"]    [Text] In racing, it cuts gearshifting time in half. On a  passenger car, it frees the driver from the "acrobatics"  required for each shift. The scene is the Limousin Rally, on 10  October 1993. Approaching a tricky hairpin turn, Jean Ragnoti,  official driver for the Renault team, is manhandling the  stickshift of his Clio-Williams and frantically stomping on the  clutch for a fast downshift. At the same spot, and with the same  type of car, his teammate Philippe Bugalski, presses lightly  with his fingers on a "joystick" without letting go of the  steering wheel, and downshifts three speeds in record time. His  advantage? A semiautomatic gearbox born from a collaboration  between Renault Sport and Magneti Marelli. Tested in races, it  should soon be installed on certain mass produced cars.    It is in fact a device which activates a conventional  gearbox  in place of the driver. It consists of two components: one is  mounted on the box and the other on the clutch. The shift  linkage is replaced by an electric-hydraulic mechanism with five  small actuators (two linear and three rotary) which select and  engage the six speeds of an H-pattern gearbox. Also, the clutch  cable is replaced by an actuator controlled either by a solenoid  or by the left pedal, thus leaving the driver in control of  clutch release at certain times, such as when starting the car.    The pressure needed for these operations is obtained from a  150-bar hydraulic pump which is coupled directly to the  camshaft. Gilles Lallement, head of development at Renault  Sport, explained that "we opted for this solution in spite of  the great complexity presented by its implementation. The fact  is that the very high power of these components makes it  possible to build actuators that are sufficiently compact and  fast, characteristics that are essential to such an application."    The driver therefore no longer has to expend any effort to  shift gears. He merely has to pull up on a small handle located  near his steering wheel to upshift and pull down on it to  downshift. Instructions are sent to a computer which also  receives data concerning engine speed, the speed of each wheel,  the hydraulic pressure... about thirty parameters altogether.  The computer then calculates the shift sequence.  <H5>  Adapting Engine Speed </H5>   To shift up by one or several gears, the computer sends  instructions to the injection system which then adapts the  engine speed to the rotation speed of the driveshaft. As soon as  this synchronization is achieved, the shift is allowed and the  computer activates the sequence of rotary and translation  motions needed to engaging the selected gear. The driver can  thus go from first to fifth while still flooring the gas pedal.  The strategy is somewhat different for downshifting: In this  case the computer has to enable the clutch actuator before  engaging the gear.    Patrick Landon, head of the Renault Sport racing department,  states that "the advantages of this semiautomatic box are  undeniable in racing." Notably, it cuts in half the time needed  for shifting: from 0.28 seconds manually for an experienced  driver to 0.13 seconds in automatic. This means a gain of 0.38  seconds per kilometer on a custom car!    For the average motorist, shaving off a few tenths of a  second from his commute may hardly seem worth it. But he may  well be attracted to some of the advantages of this gearbox.  Adapted to a passenger car, it reduces physical fatigue. It is  estimated that in city traffic, a driver shifts an average of  fifty times per kilometer. Pushing the clutch each time, his  left foot expends a cumulated effort of 100 to 150 newtons,  which over a distance of 12 kilometers corresponds to moving a  load of about 7 tons! With only one leg...  <H5>  No More Acrobatics </H5>   In addition, the optimization of shift sequences increases  the life of the gearbox while software safeguards prevent  downshifting above 8500 rpm to protect against racing the  engine. And finally, freed from the acrobatics imposed by any  gear shifting, the driver can concentrate totally on steering  his vehicle.    These advantages are enough for Magneti Marelli to undertake  the implementation of a version which is intended for "Everyman"  and which can satisfy the expectations of the luxury car driver  without frustrating lovers of the stickshift. The possibility of  adapting it to any existing box without modifications would  enable car manufacturers to offer this automation as an option,  at a price lower than that of a completely automatic box. One  version has already been unveiled at the Frankfurt Salon on an  Alfa Romeo. Volvo also is said to be thinking of installing it  very soon on one its top of the line models.  <H5>  An Enticing Market </H5>   Other equipment makers are just as convinced of the success  of "semiautomation" for European drivers. Thus Valeo is devoting  intense efforts to implementing a similar system. Benoist Hue,  marketing head of the clutch division, says that "we are already  putting a mass produced electronic clutch on some Ferraris. And  we have a number of projects underway to get it installed on  European cars during 1995. But we will have to wait until the  following year for completely robotized mass production of  gearboxes."    This is an extremely attractive market for the French  equipment maker who estimates that by the year 2005,  semiautomatic gearboxes will have taken over some 12 percent of  European production. It remains to be seen whether Old World  motorists can live with a joystick in their hands instead of a  shift lever...</p>

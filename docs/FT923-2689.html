			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India to give tea credit to Russia THE INDIAN tea industry is expecting the federal government to release a fresh tranche of technical credit of Dollars 38m (Pounds 17m) to Russia in order to enable it to buy about 19m kg of tea. The government has acceded to the tea industry's plea to sanction further technical credit following Russia's agreement to supply between 800,000 tonnes and 1m tonnes of crude oil from November. The Russian buyers will be returning to the auction centres in north and south India next week mainly to buy bolder CTC brokens, orthodox and medium Darjeeling teas. Since the prices of all varieties of tea fell sharply following the Russian withdrawal from the auctions in the third week of August, their return is expected to boost market sentiment. Russia, which until its withdrawal had purchased about 16m kg of tea using a technical credit of Dollars 32m, is to buy 65m kg of tea this year under the trade protocol. Although tea sale to Russia has been deadlocked, Indian tea sales for re-export to Russia have increased, according to Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for brokers. Indian tea export to Poland in the current year is expected to be 20m kg, against 12m kg last year. The Indian tea industry is hopeful of finalising an agreement with Iran shortly for the export of 2.5m kg of packet tea. Iran has already bought 15m kg of bulk tea from India and it is believed India may sell it a further 8m kg of packet tea this year. Meanwhile, India's tea output in the first seven months of 1992 declined by nearly 28m kg to 326m kg. With high temperatures slowing down tea plucking in Assam and West Bengal, this year's tea crop could be as low as 690m kg, against last year's record crop of 741.7m kg.</p>

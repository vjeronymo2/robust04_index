			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T. O.: Network Interconnections: Cisco-IBM </F> Agreement"]    [Text] Cisco is offering an IBM channel attachment card for  its Model 7000 router, that includes emulation of the 3172  network controller. Developed together with IBM's Mainframes  Division, this card together with the 7000 router eliminates the  need for a 3745 front-end computer, the operating cost of which  still brings shudders to the users of the 50,000 type 3270  systems in service throughout the world.    The new Cisco card is immediately available and is expected  to improve routing performance--between a TCP/IP network and  [IBM's] SNA [Systems Network Architecture] protocol, for  example--but still without providing SNA type PU 4 routing,  which the 3745 is equipped to do. This function will become  available only with support of APPN's, expected by the end of  next year on the 7000.    This apparent allegiance on the part of IBM (if one  considers  that it could be prejudicing the success of its own routers) is  backed by an agreement between Cisco and IBM's Maintenance  Division providing for the installation of routers equipped in  the United States. This agreement, which is to take on worldwide  scoop very soon, will constitute a not inconsequential trump  card for Cisco in the duel to the bitter end that its 7000  router is waging against Wellfleet's Backbone Node.    This is not the first time that a supplier of routers has  offered a direct "attachment" to an IBM mainframe. Network  Systems has been offering one on its Model 6800 for the past six  months. But it is the first time that IBM has manufactured an  Escon card (136 Mbits/sec fiber-optic link) in cooperation with  one of its most direct competitors in the routing sector. Marc  Essinger, of IBM's Communications Service, says it is in keeping  with Big Blue's most recent decisions, and that it means:  "Furnishing an immediate solution to its clients, even if it  appears, a priori, to prejudice the company's own interests."  Two suppliers of concentrators--Cabletron and Chipcom--are also  expected to announce "channel" links to improve the offering of  mainframe/local network connections. Chipcom supplies the basic  components of IBM's 8750 router.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Work scheme 'would cut crime' Most of the cost of a national 'citizens' service' community scheme for young people would be offset by a reduction in crime and an increase in the employability of young people, according to two reports published today. A cost-benefit analysis by the Henley Centre, the independent forecasting organisation, says Pounds 13.5bn could be saved over five years through less crime and Pounds 298m by reducing long-term unemployment. The Henley Centre report, written for the Community Service Volunteers lobby group, envisages a voluntary work scheme costing Pounds 300m with 250,000 places each year for people aged 18 to 21. It would pay Pounds 20 a week plus a lunch allowance. Meanwhile, Labour's Commission for Social Justice yesterday backed a citizens' service scheme lasting three months for up to 150,000 young people. The cost, says a commission report, would be Pounds 2,000 per person including a Pounds 50 weekly allowance. Such a scheme should not become a public works programme, or be a means of substituting for paid labour, but would bridge the gap between education and work, break down social and ethnic barriers, and encourage more involvement in public service. Labour is likely to strongly back such a scheme at the next election. Mr David Blunkett, Labour chairman, yesterday said: 'There are 1m young people not in work, training or further education. We need to offer them some real hope.' Henley Centre report. CSV, 237 Pentonville Road, London N1 9NJ. Pounds 2.95. Commission report. IPPR, 30-32 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA.

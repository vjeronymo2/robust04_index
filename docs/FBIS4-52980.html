			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today says  the recently exposed concealment of pure plutonium enough for  the manufacture of nine nuclear bombs in Japan shows its  shamelessness and craftiness.    The analyst says:    It was for the purpose of veiling its nuclear arms  development that Japan spread the rumor that North Korea had  manufactured nuclear weapons, crying for international pressure  and sanctions against it.    The reality clearly indicates that the nuclear threat does  not comes to Japan from the DPRK but comes to the latter from  the former, assuming a very serious nature.    With Japan accelerating nuclear armament, the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would be meaningless  and the joint declaration on denuclearization signed between the  North and the South of Korea would be a dead duck.    Japan's concealment of plutonium was disclosed for the first  time.    It was from several dozen years ago that Japan put its first  nuclear facilities into operation. Nobody knows how much  plutonium Japan has systematically concealed in this period.    The Japanese authorities have vaunted that Japan was "a  model" in accepting inspections of the International Atomic  Energy Agency, claiming that the inspection of the DPRK was  "insufficient" and it must accept "an additional inspection."    This was a crafty trick to dull the strictness of the  agency's inspection of Japan and make it to keep a sharp watch  on the DPRK so that the plutonium concealed by Japan  systematically might not be uncovered.    The more desperately Japan provokes the DPRK the more fully  the latter's transparency will be proved and the clearer Japan's  sinister, shameless intention be revealed.</p>

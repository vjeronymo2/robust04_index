			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Hamas' overt and covert  operations in Jordan are no secret, certainly not to Israeli  intelligence. Israel has been familiar with this activity --  including that of the military headquarters in Amman -- since  Hamas' establishment in December 1987. In Jordan, Hamas is  enjoying the support and aid offered by its patron, the Muslim  Brotherhood -- which operates openly and legally in this country.    We must recall that in the first clause of its covenant,  Hamas defines itself as "one of the branches of the Muslim  Brotherhood in Palestine. The Muslim Brotherhood is a worldwide  movement and the largest Muslim movement in the modern era."    Late in 1988 Hamas opened operational branches in several  Arab states: Iran, Sudan, Lebanon, Yemen, and Jordan. Muhammad  Nazzal from Qalqilyah, one of the prominent Palestinian members  in the Muslim Brotherhood -- who moved to Jordan in the early  1980's -- was appointed Hamas' official representative in Jordan  late in 1988. He received the special status also accorded to  the PLO representative in Amman. His official office turned  into a headquarters for all intents and purposes.    The overt activity of the Jordanian office was mainly  directed at recruiting to Hamas Palestinians living in Jordan,  as well as funneling funds to the territories. The office did  not settle for this activity, however, and during 1990 there  were several infiltration attempts by Hamas terrorists into the  Jordan Valley. All this activity took place under the direction  of the Amman office.    The Hamas office in Jordan also included a branch of the  military command, which recruited and operated terror squads,  especially in the West Bank. Some of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's  most senior terrorists, including the two commanders in Samaria  -- 'Abd-al-Karim Hanini and Zuhayr Jubran -- were operated by  the Jordan headquarters.    The car bombs which exploded in Mehola and Ramat Ef'al, and  the plans to activate car bombs in the Hasharon junction, near a  large Jerusalem department store, and Tel Aviv's Defense  Ministry complex, were all initiated and planned by the Hamas  headquarters in Jordan. Jubran was the man who operated the  squad whose members murdered Nisim Toledano and policemen Dani  Hazut and Mordekhay Yisra'el.    Since late 1988 the Jordan headquarters has been the seat of  Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, an East Jerusalem engineer who  moved to Jordan after the Six-Day War. Since then the office  has turned into Hamas' information, public relations, and  propaganda center. Over the last year Hamas' leaflets and  directions to the Palestinian public in the territories have  been disseminated from his office. Official Hamas statements --  including those of a military nature -- also emanate from Jordan.    Until the end of 1992 the international Hamas headquarters  --  including the military command -- operated from Washington and  London. These locations were the source of operational  directives to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's murder squads. Through  fax machines and telephone calls directives were also conveyed  to other Hamas apparatus. The Jordan headquarters was only a  subordinate transit station for relaying directives onward.    Following the detention of two senior American Hamas  activists -- Muhammad Jarrad and Muhammad Salah -- in Israel in  January 1993, and due to the uncovering of fundamentalist Muslim  terrorism in the United States, Hamas' main military command was  transferred from London and Washington to Yemen and Jordan.    Muhammad Khazim Sawalihah, Hamas' military commander, at  present operates from Jordan. He is being aided by several  Hamas deportees who preferred not to return to the territories.  Among them is Dr. Musa al-Aqtam, who was a senior lecturer in  Nabulus' al-Najah University and a senior Hamas commander in the  territories. Hamas terrorists caught by the Shin Bet during the  last year divulged in the interrogations that they received  their orders, funds, and operational directives from the  Jordanian headquarters.    Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of Hamas international, passes his  time both in Damascus and Amman. Most of his time is spent on  furthering the military operations and other covert Hamas  operations in the territories.    The Jordanian headquarters also handles Hamas' financial  operations. Contributions from all over the Arab world reach  Jordan, and from there -- via money changers -- to Hamas  activists in the territories. The funds serve to buy weapons,  pay rent for hiding places for fugitives, and finance their  activities.    The Jordanian headquarters transfers huge amounts of funds  to  all the Hamas-controlled civilian institutions on a monthly  basis. These institutions, such as education and medical  institutions, trade unions, and sport clubs, serve as a legal  cover for Hamas activity in the territories and a pool for  recruiting activists and terrorists.    As will be recalled, Hamas pledged to carry out five attacks  in retaliation to the Hebron massacre. Two have already been  carried out. Jerusalem hopes that the uncovering of the links  between the Jordanian headquarters and the attacks, and pressure  exerted on King Husayn will hamper the activities of the  Jordanian headquarters and indirectly contribute toward  decreasing Hamas terrorism in the territories and in Israel.    [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 17 April, in a page 1 and 2  report by Hemi Shalev and Shefi Gabay on Hamas activity in  Jordan, adds that "Israel has relayed to Jordan intelligence  information regarding Hamas activity in Amman and inside  Israel."]</p>

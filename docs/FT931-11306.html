			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Mexico's air traffic control deal flies into flak: The award of the contract for the country's new system has called up a storm MEXICO'S crowded air corridors are one manifestation of the country's economic recovery. But air traffic is growing far faster than the economy, and that is putting Mexico's air traffic control system under immense strain. Some 700 flights a day used Mexico City airport last year, with commercial traffic 32 per cent up on 1991. The air traffic control system was designed in the late 1970s to handle less than half that. The computers used by the system in the main air traffic control centres are not integrated, so as a result operators have to talk to each other through a hotline about flights passing from one zone to another. Mexico's air traffic control agency last year began briefing air traffic technology companies on plans for a radical upgrading of the system, including - most importantly - the integration of the system's computers. However, the awarding of the prestigious contract to the two European companies which installed the current system has brought strong protests to the Mexican government from competing US and Canadian companies. IBM, Westinghouse and Raytheon's Canadian subsidiary have formally complained about alleged irregularities in the tender process which resulted in the award of the Dollars 21.1m contract to Thomson of France for the data processing system and Alenia, a subsidiary of IRI of Italy, to provide the radars. The tender, announced in August, was cancelled at the last moment on November 19 because, according to the official explanation, none of the seven contenders complied with the technical specifications. Seven bids to supply data processing equipment and radars were made: IBM, which bid only to provide data processing equipment, Calmaquip offering Westinghouse technology, Raytheon Canada, Thomson, Plessey (Siemens), Toshiba of Japan and Alenia. Mr Roberto Kobeh, head of Seneam, the state company in charge of air traffic control, said experts from his agency, the Mexican Institute of Communication, an independent government body, and the Canadian company Martin Marietta signed a document outlining where the companies had not complied with the tender requirements. He showed such a document to an FT reporter but would not let him read it in full, nor identify where these companies were not complying. However, an agent acting for IBM claims he was told before the cancellation that the tender would be called off unless he paid money. According to the agent, Mr Kaveh Moussavi, an Oxford-educated entrepreneur with homes in the US and UK, three men - apparently Mexican officials - arranged to meet him in his hotel, the Nikko in Mexico City. They initially asked for Dollars 1m and then for lower amounts, according to Mr Moussavi, eventually suggesting a donation to the Mexican government's anti-poverty programme, Solidarity. Mr Moussavi says he declined to entertain the proposals of the men whom he described as well-informed about the tender. He told them that if they were officials seeking a bribe or were going to pay over the money to officials, it was illegal under US law for a US company to make such a payment. There is no independent corroboration of the meeting. IBM, Calmaquip and Raytheon vehemently deny that their bids did not comply with the tender requirements. Mr Armando Paz, chief financial officer of the Miami-based Calmaquip, said: 'Westinghouse and IBM use the newest, most advanced technology in the world. . . If someone says you do not comply that is unacceptable and you fight to the end. It is a slight to our reputation.' IBM in its protest says: 'Contrary to the evaluation reported in the referenced letter, IBM believes it is fully compliant with the specification.' Raytheon is of the same opinion. An IBM spokesman also said the protest argued that the government, in awarding the tender, had failed to take account of the cost of the system over its lifetime - including maintenance and spares - which Seneam had originally said would significantly influence its decision. According to the US company, the second tender was awarded only on the basis of the system's acquisition cost. In the first tender offer, the protesting companies and diplomats who have seen the relevant documents say Thomson offered to supply the computers for the air traffic control system at Dollars 33m - making it by far the most expensive system on offer. IBM says it offered Dollars 21.5m in the first offer, with Raytheon offering still less. Mr Kobeh of Seneam says the Dollars 33m figure is too high, and that Thomson offered to supply the computers at Dollars 25m. Thomson refused to comment on this or any other matters relating to the case. The government called a second round of bids in December with reduced specifications. There was consternation among competitors when the winning Dollars 13.2m bid by Thomson for the computer system was made public. 'I can't see how any company can reduce its bid by that amount of money,' says Mr Paz. The other contenders reduced bids by a maximum of 9 per cent, against the reduction of 47 or 60 per cent by Thomson in the computer bids. Together with Alenia's winning Dollars 7.9m radar bid, the combined bid was just Dollars 600,000 below the next-lowest combined bid of Dollars 21.7m by Raytheon. Calmaquip says it believes Thomson did not comply with specifications in the second bid, since the Thomson system is not fully operational in another country - one of the conditions of the tender. Mr Kobeh said Thomson's basic technology is used in many parts of the world, but claimed all of the systems offered were tailor-made to suit Mexico's needs. Thomson's refusal to comment has made it difficult to know whether some of these claims reflect the frustration of US companies of not being able to offer such attractive terms as a state-owned European group, such as Thomson. Aggressive pricing in such tenders is not unknown and may simply reflect the importance of the business for the European company. If, as Mr Kobeh claims, there were no irregularities in the bidding process, the unwillingess of the Mexican authorities to release promptly all the relevant documents has left the US and Canadian companies feeling cheated. At the least, the bitter complaints and report of requests for money in a hotel room feed a common - if still to be substantiated - view that favouritism and corruption clouds awards of many government contracts in Mexico. Nafta will over time open up most of Mexico's public sector procurement to US and Canadian companies. But critics of Nafta have long argued that as long as corruption plays an important part of business, companies that play by the rules will not benefit fully from such market opening. While the business climate has improved immeasurably in Mexico in recent years, corruption remains a way of life for many well-placed lower and middle-level officials, and is rife in the police force, and parts of the judiciary. If a company loses a contract for not influencing the right people, it will find it difficult to use Mexico's legal system to recover damages. And if corruption comes to light, it is often when the official concerned is out of political favour. Those blessed with a powerful patron usually remain well-protected.</p>

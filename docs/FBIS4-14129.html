			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Hamas terrorists are threatening to carry out a  wave of attacks and kidnappings if all Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] prisoners are not released from jail. The threat came  in a leaflet claiming responsibility for last week's murder of  Israeli soldier Shahar Simhoni. The leaflet carries a photocopy  of Simhoni's ID card. Meanwhile, arrests are continuing in the  Janin area, of Hamas members connected to the Hadera bombing.  More on these developments from reporter Alan Ben-'Ami:    [Ben-'Ami] The Hamas leaflet distributed in the Gaza Strip  says that members of 'Izz-al-Dan al-Qassam's Squad No. 6  kidnapped and killed soldier Shahar Simhoni last week.  According to the leaflet, which reproduced the soldier's ID  card and driver's license, the terrorists passed themselves off  as Jews, grabbed Simhoni, who was on his way to his girlfriend  from his Army base, and after a short struggle, killed him.  [passage omitted]    The leaflet is addressed to Prime Minister Rabin and demands  that he immediately release all Hamas prisoners, especially the  Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin and Hamas members captured in  recent weeks. If not, the leaflet warns, the killing or  kidnapping of Israelis will continue. The threats are coming  against the backdrop of a major crack down on Hamas by security  forces. [passage omitted]</p>

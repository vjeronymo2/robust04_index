			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> About 6,500 Savannah River Plant workers got $80 million in severance and  vacation pay as E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. handed over operation of the  nuclear weapons plant to Westinghouse Electric Corp. Du Pont, which built the  plant near the Georgia border at Aiken, S.C., and managed it for the government  for 38 years, announced last October it was not renewing its contract with the  Department of Energy amid continuing reports of safety problems. Du Pont issued  the checks Thursday and Friday, even though most employees will stay on. About  1,200 workers decided to retire. The Savannah River Plant is the nation's only  manufacturer of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to make nuclear  weapons at other government defense plants. Its three reactors have been idled  for nearly a year because of safety and structural problems.  </P></p>

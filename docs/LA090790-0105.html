			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: ATTORNEY GENERAL;  </P> <P> LUNGREN MODIFIES TV ATTACK ON SMITH  </P> <P> Republican state attorney general candidate Dan Lungren has modified the  wording of his first TV campaign ad, which was criticized in editorials by  major California newspapers as "dirty," "exploitative" and "a cheap shot"  against his Democratic opponent.  </P> <P> The 30-second spot skewers San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith for accepting a  plea bargain from a onetime campaign contributor accused of drug and sex  charges involving teen-age prostitutes.  </P> <P> Since the ad was unveiled early last week, editorials in the San Francisco  Examiner, the Sacramento Bee and The Times have said that it unfairly indicates  that Smith approved a light sentence for the influential defendant, Donald  Werby, in exchange for campaign contributions.  </P> <P> The Examiner, in its editorial, wrote that "in essence, Lungren is accusing  Smith of a crime, of throwing a case. This marks a new low in campaign ads. . .  . Not a shred of evidence is offered."  </P> <P> The new ad makes clear that Smith has returned Werby's campaign contributions.  Lungren said Thursday that as a result of questions posed by reporters, he  changed his ad even before the first editorials were published last Friday.  </P> <P> "We were frankly surprised when some people said that to us," said Lungren.  "None of us even conceived of the idea it would be looked at as an allegation  of a quid pro quo or that there was a bribe accepted by Arlo Smith."  </P> <P> Smith's campaign manager, Marc Dann, demanded Thursday that Lungren publicly  apologize for the ad. "Dan Lungren's ads are an insult to the intelligence of  the voters," said Dann. "He is a liar and he hasn't the guts to face up to it  when he gets caught."  </P> <P> Werby, contending that he is innocent, also requested this week that Lungren  remove the ad from the air. Indicted last year by a San Francisco grand jury on  22 felony drug, sex and bribery counts, Werby said he pleaded guilty to four  misdemeanor charges only "to preserve as much as possible the shattered privacy  of myself and my family."  </P> <P> In a letter to Lungren, Werby, a multimillionaire partner in the Four Seasons  Clift Hotel and Gray Line bus tours, added that he was prosecuted despite  substantial evidence of his innocence "precisely because I had been a (Smith)  campaign contributor."  </P> <P> "Smith was so terrified of appearing to go easy on me that he brought a case  which was untenable," Werby wrote.  </P> <P> Smith, who had received $7,500 from Werby, his brother and their businesses  during the formative stages of his campaign last year, returned the  contributions long before the plea bargain was accepted.  </P> <P> Despite the furor, Lungren said he still stands "by the accuracy of the  original ad."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The race: Attorney general. Whose ad? Republican Dan Lungren.  </P> <P> Lungren has modified his first TV campaign ad, which has been branded deceptive  in several major newspaper editorials. The 30-second spot attacks his  Democratic opponent, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, for accepting a  misdemeanor plea bargain from one-time campaign contributor Donald Werby, who  had been indicted on 22 felony drug, sex and bribery counts involving teen-age  prostitutes.  </P> <P>  Elements of the Lungren ad, with an analysis by Times staff writer Paul  Feldman:  </P> <P> Original ad: "San Francisco D.A. Arlo Smith allowed Werby to plea bargain. No  jail, just some community service and a fine. This, after Werby and his brother  had given thousands to Smith's political campaign."  </P> <P> The modified ad: "San Francisco D.A. Arlo Smith allowed Werby to plea-bargain.  No jail, just some community service and a fine. Although Smith returned  Werby's political contribution, he should have turned the case over to the  state attorney general because of potential conflicts of interest."  </P> <P> Analysis: Werby, his brother and their businesses donated $7,500 to Smith's  campaign before Werby's indictment in August, 1989. The Smith campaign returned  most of the contributions before Werby, 63, was indicted. Despite the Werbys'  initial contributions and the fact that Smith's campaign manager was called to  testify before the Werby grand jury, Smith maintains that his office had no  legal problem prosecuting the case.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kyrgyz </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The referendum day scheduled for 30 January by  President Askar Akayev is approaching. In this connection, our  correspondent interviewed Turar Koychiyev, president of the  Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Turar  Koychiyev, what do you think about President Akayev's decision  to hold the referendum?    [Koychiyev] I think it is a necessary step. We are building  democracy in our society, and I think that Akayevich is  absolutely correct because it is a very important political  question. The president needs to know the public's opinion.  Our reform process seems to be developing. The path chosen for  our development is diametrically opposed to what we had before.  I think we passed one important stage in these three years and  are finding ourselves at the second stage of our social and  economic development. Our president is doing his best to  improve the situation in the country. On 30 January, those who  want (?equality) and prosperity for Kyrgyzstan should support  President Akayev's policy.

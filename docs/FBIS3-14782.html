Piotr Ivanov, acting  secretary of the district Executive committee, told BASAPRESS.  Despite forecasts, there was a high turn-out at all polling  stations. Ivanov pointed out that the voters did not follow the  political games of certain local leaders who called on people  not to participate in the elections. Ender Arat, general consul  of Turkey in Moldova, arrived in Comrat a day before election  day. He called on all political forces and movements during a  meeting with local leaders to be reasonable. Also, Arat  emphasized the importance of Gagauzians in creating the new  Moldovan Parliament.</p>

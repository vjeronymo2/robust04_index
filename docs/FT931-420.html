			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Computer People drops to Pounds 145,000 COMPUTER People, the London-based information technology consultancy, saw pre-tax profit plunge from Pounds 1m to Pounds 145,000 in 1992. After a tax charge of Pounds 280,000 the group was forced into a loss of Pounds 135,000 (profit Pounds 758,000), or 0.97p per share (earnings 5.48p). The final dividend is omitted, leaving the year's payment at 0.65p (5.4p). Mr Rupert Bayfield, chairman, explained that only a nominal amount could have been added to the interim, so it was believed better to employ the funds in the business. Turnover was 7 per cent down at Pounds 62.7m (Pounds 67.7m). Operating profit fell to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 1.22m) but interests payments came to Pounds 350,000, up 61 per cent on 1991. Gearing was 92 per cent (52 per cent). The group started life as a computer recruitment agency and a recruitment service is still provided in the UK; the bulk of the business, however, involves supplying consultants in the US and UK. The business has been hard hit by the recession in both markets; in 1989, for example, pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 4.22m. Mr Bayfield said the group returned to profitability in the second half of 1992. In the UK, which contributed 63 per cent of turnover, revenues were back to 1990 levels, but competition and declining recruitment business forced down profits. In the US, the volume of business was lower than in earlier years but reduced overheads resulted in improved operating profits. The high tax charge stemmed from the lack of a current tax benefit in the US on the interest on loans made to the American subsidiary.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (9): Benefits remain intangible - The verdict / While physical changes are visible, profits arising from the Olympics have been modest BARCELONA'S Olympic Organising Committee (COOB) liked to emphasise that it was following the example set by Los Angeles in its approach to the Games, except in one respect: it was not seeking to declare a profit. The benefits to Barcelona would come in the form of infrastructures and reputation. When the COOB eventually closed its books - at a ceremony on Montjuic which included the screening of the Olympic film Marathon - exactly a year after the opening of the Games there was a surplus of Pta 358m. But while citizens could see the physical changes, the intangible benefits, though potentially as great or greater, have yet to be realised. Lluis Bassat, a leading advertising agent in Barcelona and a shareholder of Ovideo Bassat Esport which designed the Olympic ceremonies, has calculated that the advertising from which Barcelona benefited in the three-and-a-half hours of the televised inauguration of the Games alone could be valued at USDollars 3bn. But on the whole, the profits of the companies most closely connected with the Games seem to have been modest. According to Tony Camin, a director of Ovideo Bassat Esport, the company made Pta 3,500m on the staging of the ceremonies, a margin of 6 per cent on the total cost. The fact that the COOB planned originally to give preference to local companies for sponsorship deals, but found offers from multinationals too good to turn down is some measure of the competition that arose among those wanting to be involved in the Games. Local restaurateurs and small businesses, - expecting a huge influx of trade during the Games - found that, except in the areas of the city frequented by the Olympic family, July and August were slow months: the city hall campaign to avoid congestion had been so effective that many of the residents left the city. The sector in which most money was invested was undoubtedly construction. The private sector accounted for Pta 313bn of the total Olympic investment and construction groups such as FCC were employed on projects such as the complete overhaul of the airport which was funded by the central government. The profits made by construction companies softened the blow once the market slowed down. 'They made a lot of money in the last few years,' said Manuel Ludevid, director of economic promotion for the city hall. This, he added, was why they were able to survive now. But the intangible benefit is beginning to be noticed by businesses with a more tenuous Olympic connection. In the textile industry, for example, designers say they have found it easier since the Games to sell their goods abroad. According to Salvador Maluquer, director of the Spanish Intertextile Council, Catalan designers are successfully using the leitmotif of the Games at international trade fairs. 'The direct effects are difficult to quantify and could be of little importance beside the indirect ones,' he said. It is hoped that this will eventually more than offset the cost of servicing the debts the city hall has run up. At Pta 242bn, it represents a threefold increase since 1987, during which time there has been a 71 per cent increase in municipal taxes. But the 20 per cent of income that is spent on paying interest is not so high that it has yet damaged the council's reputation for prudent financial management - Moody's rates its short-term debt A2 - built up by an innovative financial team headed by Pilar Solans.</p>

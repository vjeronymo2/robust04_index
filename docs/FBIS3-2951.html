			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special feature" by Shao Ling (6730 7227): "China Takes </F> Steps To Revamp Banking System"]    [Text] Hong Kong 10 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A piece  of information from Beijing states that the People's Bank of  China recently refused to make loans to the Finance Ministry to  clear the national debt. A person in charge of the bank pointed  out that the state budgetary deficits must be covered through  issuing state treasury bonds. Earlier, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji,  who is also governor of the People's Bank of China, said: "No  bank should be treated as a teller or an accountant for the  government or a government department." All the above  information suggests that China is trying to set up a relatively  independent Central Bank, policy-related banks, and commercial  banks, so as to meet the needs of the market economy and bring  about the convergence of China's financial system with the  international financial system.    Without doubt, the first step China is to take in financial  reform is to change the People's Bank of China into a real  Central Bank, to set up policy-related banks, and to change  professional banks into commercial banks. As the central bank,  the People's Bank of China will have two major functions:  Stabilizing the currency and supervising financial matters. In  the future, the People's Bank will not provide funds to  government departments or supply money directly to industrial  and commercial enterprises to help solve their problems.  Instead, it will focus on the efficient exercise of its powers  to supply money, adjust reference interest rates, manage central  funds, and control the total amount of credit, while the  functions of its branches will include supervising and managing  financial matters, conducting investigations, compiling  statistics, making analyses, laterally adjusting the money  supply [heng xiang tiao cun tiao ji 2897 0686 7333 1407 6148  0495], managing the state treasury, providing funds, controlling  foreign exchange, and settling combined accounts.    The second step is to set up three policy-related banks --  the State Development Bank, the China Agricultural Development  Bank, and the China Import and Export Credit Bank -- which will  be placed under the supervision of the central bank. The three  banks will have their capital provided by the Finance Ministry;  they also can raise money through issuing bonds to banking  institutions. The sole function of these three banks is to  provide loans on government instructions for the purposes of  production, development, and foreign trade. They are expected  only to break even, rather than to make profit.    The third step is to gradually change the existing  professional banks into real commercial banks. The Bank of  China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the  Agricultural Bank of China, and the People's Construction Bank  of China, which are existing professional banks on the mainland,  gradually will be transformed into commercial banks. A number  of commercial banks have been set up on the mainland over the  last few years, including the Communications Bank of China, the  CITIC (China International Trust and Investment Corporation)  Industrial Bank, the Everbright Bank, the Huaxia Bank, the  Zhaoshang Bank, the Fujian Xingye Bank, the Guangdong  Development Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, and the  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. The total capital of all  these national and regional commercial banks, some of which are  collectively owned or joint-stock enterprises, has reached 100  billion yuan. These banks enjoy a more rapid capital turnover  and a higher rate of loan recovery because they only provide  mortgage loans under their systems of fund management. However,  as these banks have gone into operation for a short period and  the government has yet to formulate appropriate laws for  commercial banks, their management remains to be standardized  and improved.    While commenting on changing the way the bank operates, Wang  Qiren, chairman of the board of directors of the Bank of China,  believed that it is necessary to draw on the experience of  foreign banks, especially commercial banks in Hong Kong and  Macao. He said: "The mainland and Hong Kong banking industries  have built closer and closer relations. A total of 13 Hong Kong  banks have set up 35 branches, 24 offices, and six joint-venture  banking institutions on the mainland, while various mainland  professional banks, such as the Bank of China and the People's  Construction Bank of China, also have set up branches in Hong  Kong. It is necessary to make appropriate use of Hong Kong  commercial banks' experience in management and operation.  However, we must change the operational mechanism gradually."    Since the beginning of this year, the National People's  Congress has stepped up financial legislation and will  promulgate the "Law of the People's Bank of China," the "Banking  Law of the People's Republic of China," the "Law on Commercial  Banks," the "Stock Law," and the "Bill Law" in turn, indicating  that China is planning to put banking system reform onto a legal  basis.</p>

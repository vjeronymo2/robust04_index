			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ALASKA HAS HIGHEST STATE, LOCAL TAXES, SURVEY FINDS; MISSISSIPPI HAS LOWEST  </P> <P> Residents of Alaska pay the most in state and local taxes on a per-capita  basis, and Mississippians the least, a survey found.  </P> <P> Commerce Clearing House reported in its State Tax Review that per-capita tax  burdens rose in the District of Columbia and 47 states in fiscal 1988 -- the  last year for which data were available -- and declined in only three states:  Oregon, West Virginia and Wyoming.  </P> <P> California collected the most tax money -- $55.2 billion -- followed by New  York, $52.5 billion; Texas, $25.2 billion; Illinois, $20.7 billion;  Pennsylvania, $19.5 billion, and Florida, $18.8 billion.  </P> <P> Alaskans were burdened with the highest per-capita tax bill -- $3,605 -- with  property taxes accounting for $1,263 of that figure.  </P> <P> District of Columbia taxpayers had the second-highest tax burden, $3,339,  followed by New York, $2,934, and Connecticut, $2,281.  </P> <P> Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Dakota and Tennessee all  had tax burdens of less than $1,300.  </P> <P> The median burden for all states was $1,627, up $97 from 1987, while the  average was $1,772, up $107. The Commerce Clearing House determined the average  burden in each state by dividing total tax collections by the population.  </P> <P> Mississippi reported the lowest per-capita tax burden, $1,088.  </P> <P> Per capita increases in 1988 ranged from $443 in Alaska to $22 in California.

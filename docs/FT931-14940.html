			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Lesson on the fax of life Pillow-talk should be sacrosanct. What people say to one another in intimate mo-ments is no-body else's business. The question of the week is - how can the personal privacy which is surely everyone's birthright be protected? The answer is not readily apparent. It is certainly not to be found in Sir David Calcutt's report on the British press, published yesterday. For technology has made our bedroom walls transparent. The tapes purporting to record conversations between Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker-Bowles are said (nothing is sure about any of this) to have been snatched from the airwaves by equipment able to receive and record conversations carried out on mobile telephones. The same result might conceivably have been achieved using other familiar gadgets, such as bugs, directional microphones, or ordinary telephone taps. The rapid growth in use of portable phones has, however, vastly increased the potential yield from electronic eavesdropping. The relative cheapness of scanners and receivers has multiplied the number of amateur listeners-in. Add in faxes, and you change everything. Attempts to prevent disclosure of the contents of the 'Prince Charles' tape in England would have been difficult enough when foreign publications were willing to print the prurient material in full, as many did. Facsimile transmission has made effective censorship virtually impossible. Once the transcript had been published in Australia, it was in the global public domain. Copies were quickly faxed to friends and contacts in Britain, where most newspapers shrank from full disclosure, at least for a while. A slightly older device, the photocopying machine, assisted distribution in London and elsewhere. Within half a day of the appearance of New Idea magazine in Sydney the contents of the tape were being distributed in buildings not five minutes' walk away from Buckingham Palace. This is the samizdat of the western world. We may have to live with it. If we want to stop it, we have to invent rules not yet thought of. We are confronted with new fax of life. Sir David's report makes a breathless attempt to catch up with these un-pleasant side-effects of the microchip. He notes that the latest generation of mo-bile telephones, which use digital technology, incorporates a 'sophisticated encryption system', which will be 'beyond the means of casual users of radio scanners to break'. Possibly, but for how long? In any case there is no way of telling whether the snoopers who recorded the recent conversations ascribed to both Prince Charles and Princess Diana were 'casual users' of scanners or professional spies. Lord William Rees-Mogg has suggested that the appearance of such high-quality tapes, free of atmospheric interference, is an indication that the security services must have produced them. The heads of the services have denied this. We may choose to believe them, but if the material is genuine, and if it is on some government tape, it would take only one disgruntled spy to steal it. In short, electronics is more powerful than the law. Sir David ruminates about banning the sale of scanners, but acknowledges that this might be contrary to the Treaty of Rome. I would add that, while gadgets exist, people will find ways of acquiring them. Continental pornography is available by satellite in Britain to those who buy unscramblers. It cannot be kept out. Sir David notes that the Interception of Communications Act is supposed to protect private telephone conversations. If the attorney-general had wanted to prosecute whoever recorded the so-called Princess Diana tape (assuming it to be a private citizen, and assuming that he or she had been caught), it would have been necessary, he says, to establish that the callers 'did not intend their conversation to be intercepted'. He advises the government to think about strengthening the law on telephone bugging. It has already accepted this advice. It should, however, think long and hard before adopting any of Sir David's recommendations. Fortunately the heritage secretary, Mr Peter Brooke, intimated in the House of Commons yesterday that there is to be no statutory press complaints tribunal. Sir David went too far there. As to the rest, the prime minister made up his mind long before yesterday's report - probably when the telephone conversations of his friend Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, were tapped. Physical intrusion into private property is therefore to become a criminal offence, unless a public interest can be shown. That means no more foot-in-the-door, bugging or stealing snapshots with a telephoto lens. To stand a chance of being equitable, such a law should apply to all citizens. It should not be specific to the media. The government has been divided about a privacy law, which the lawyers in the cabinet rightly perceive to be extremely difficult to draft. No longer. It will now consider the idea, although Mr Brooke acknowledged that such a law would have to take account of a wide range of 'human and technological activity'. I have written here in favour of introducing a tort of infringement of privacy, if it applied to ordinary citizens rather than public figures. There would be a public interest defence. Sir David favours something on these lines, but fails to add the other half of my proposed trade-off: a Freedom of Information Act. Since there is to be no such deal, the press opposition to all of Sir David's recommendations is likely to be fierce. The Tory tabloids that helped put the Conservatives back in office last April have been fighting against the government for half a year now. Peace is not in sight. Yet the press needs public support. People buy the scandal sheets, and devour their contents, but hate the purveyors. Popular newspapers should practise the self-restraint that they discovered for a few nervous hours as they awaited Calcutt this week. If they do, they may yet see the proposed privacy bill fade away. Once I would have mourned its passing; now, under the rule of the scanner and the fax, I wonder whether it will make any difference whether we have one or not.</p>

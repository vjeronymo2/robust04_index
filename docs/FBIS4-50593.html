			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Zhejiang Carries Out Propaganda Activities Marking 10th </F> Anniversary of Promulgation of `Military Service Law'"]    [Text] The Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang  Provincial Party Committee and the headquarters and political  department of the Zhejiang Military District recently issued a  joint circular calling on the entire province to carry out  propaganda and educational activities on the occasion of the  10th anniversary of promulgation of the "Military Service Law."    The circular pointed out: The "Military Service Law" is the  basic law of our military system. Since its promulgation, the  current "Military Service Law" has played an important role in  perfecting our socialist legal system and our military service  system, promoting the modernization of our armed forces, and  strengthening the reserve force. In the new situation in which  we are deepening reform and establishing a socialist market  economic structure, to further seriously implement the "Military  Service Law" is of great immediate significance to stepping up  national defense construction, promoting the all-people national  defense concept, raising citizens' awareness of their military  service duties, and spreading patriotism and revolutionary  heroism. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the  promulgation of the "Military Service Law," all localities and  all units should do solid and effective work in publicizing it  in light of their realities. With these propaganda activities,  we should strive to encourage all people to show concern for  national defense construction and support national defense  construction; we should make all officers and men dedicate  themselves to the cause of national defense; and we should lay  an ideological foundation for promoting the implementation of  the law and for promoting the building of the military district  units and the province's reserve force.</p>

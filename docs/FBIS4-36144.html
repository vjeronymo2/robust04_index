			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Security Council's  Resolution Helps the Continuation of War," the newspaper  AL-ASWAQ says: The UN Security Council was not expected to  condemn the secession in Yemen because it did not meet for this  purpose in the first place. The preparations for convening this  council would not have succeeded had its [draft] resolution  highlighted both [Yemeni] unity and the need for all parties to  commit themselves to it.    National unity in any Arab country means stability,  impregnability, dignity, and the possibility of construction.  Moreover, pan-Arab unity means a radical solution to the  political, economic, social, and even demographic impasse now  experienced by the Arab countries. It has never been an  objective of the UN Security Council to achieve such noble Arab  goals.    When addressing our national and pan-Arab issues, the UN  Security Council used to stand alongside the parties opposed to  the [Arab] nation and its future. Even when compelled to  flatter us in some resolution, the Security Council used  diplomatic language that meant nothing on the ground and was  devoid of any applicable mechanisms. Successive Security Council  resolutions on the Palestine question are the best examples of  resolutions issued only to be entered in the archives.  Meanwhile, resolutions serving the interests of the big powers  are immediately implemented.    AL-ASWAQ adds: The formula used in Security Council  Resolution [No. 924 on Yemen] will achieve only one objective,  namely, to deepen the secession and fragmentation, perpetuate  the [Yemeni] war, and expand its scope from Aden to Sanaa. As  we do not rule out the presence of the desire and interest by  one or more international party to perpetuate and expand the  Yemeni war, we will continue to find it strange that some Arab  positions advertently or inadvertently foster the continuation  of war and encourage the secession. The fire raging in Yemen is  close to every Arab house, although some people may think it  will not expand.</p>

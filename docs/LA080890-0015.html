			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WAGE WAR ON PLASTIC FOAM PACKAGING;  </P> <P> WASTE: THE EFFORT COMES AS A NORTH COUNTY ORGANIZATION FACES WHAT COULD BE THE  END OF ITS CURBSIDE RECYCLING.  </P> <P> Two environmental groups are stepping up the war against plastic foam packaging  by organizing a citizens' campaign to replace polystyrene products with  biodegradable paper alternatives.  </P> <P> Solana Recyclers and the North County Coastal Greens will hold a public meeting  at 7 p.m. today at Solana Beach Presbyterian Church to launch a campaign in Del  Mar, Encinitas and Solana Beach to educate businesses about the health and  environmental hazards of polystyrene and other plastic foam packaging.  </P> <P> In a related environmental issue, curbside recycling collection in North County  appears in jeopardy.  </P> <P> The Encinitas Community Advisory Board voted 4 to 1 Monday to deny Solana  Recyclers' request for a permit to continue operating at its present site and  to expand its plant capacity nearly fourfold.  </P> <P> Solana Recyclers, the area's only curbside recycling collector, charges 55  cents a month to 27,000 housing units, or 60% of all households in Solana  Beach, Encinitas and Del Mar, said Brooke Nash, executive director of Solana  Recyclers.  </P> <P> the Encinitas City Council in 1987 assisted the company in arranging to lease a  quarter acre owned by the county at 135 N. El Camino Real, Nash said. The  site's zoning allows a mixture of commercial, residential and public works  facilities. The county staff already approved the company's expansion. Three  residents opposed the permit request.  </P> <P> "This vote was unexpected," Nash said. "We were shocked. If it is upheld, we'll  have to shut down. There won't be any curbside collection in the area."  </P> <P> The Community Advisory Board's recommendation goes before the city's Planning  Commission in September. On appeal, the City Council has final say. The  recycling company will appeal the recommendation, Nash said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the anti-polystyrene campaign will continue. Its goal is to persuade  restaurants, markets, vendors, delicatessens and other takeout food  establishments to use paper packaging products instead of polystyrene food  packaging and containers for items such as egg cartons, meat trays, coffee cups  and fast food.  </P> <P> Polystyrene foam packaging is chemically synthesized from petroleum, producing  hazardous waste byproducts. The North County Coastal Greens is a chapter of a  national anti-nuclear, ecology movement. Solana Recyclers is a nonprofit  organization founded in 1983.  </P> <P> Leading the campaign will be Solana Recyclers' block leaders, who have helped  persuade 60% of residents in Del Mar, Encinitas and Solana Beach to participate  in the group's curbside recycling program.  </P> <P> Restaurants and other users of plastic foam packages have been reluctant to  switch to paper products because of expected cost increases, but substituting  paper products would not substantially raise expenses, Nash said.  </P> <P> Nash cited the increasing number of fast-food restaurant chains that are  switching to paper-product containers as evidence that the changeover is  economically feasible.  </P> <P> "It would cost only a few pennies more (per customer purchase)," Nash said. "I  think if you ask people whether they would spend an extra nickel, they would  say yes."  </P> <P> Cris Weatherby, a recycling block leader, said many restaurant owners  mistakenly believe some plastic foam packaging products are environmentally  safe.  </P> <P> "I've encountered only resistance to switching, so I think the main goal is  educate them and show them there are alternatives," Weatherby said.  </P> <P> Organizers plan to solicit contributions and services from businesses to print  informational brochures and lists of alternative paper-packaging products. The  brochures will be given to restaurants, bars, markets and other food and  beverage merchants.  </P> <P> Consumers will be encouraged to ask merchants to switch to paper products or  lose their patronage.  </P> <P> Nash said this would not be a direct boycott of businesses that refused to stop  using polystyrene, but she said boycotts are a possibility.  </P> <P> She called the campaign a "positive appeal to make the right environmental  choice" and said businesses that cooperate will receive some sort of  certificate or window decal to display.  </P> <P> The campaign will rely on environmentally conscious residents selling their  neighbors and local restaurants and markets on using paper products, which are  biodegradable and renewable, said Patricia Grimes, community outreach  coordinator for Solana Recyclers.  </P> <P> "We have to get away from the throwaway mentality, that there is an endless  supply of resources," Grimes said. "It's hard to do, but we need to get people  to change their habits."  </P> <P> Nash said the campaign plans to take advantage of what she described as the  public's growing concern about the ecology. She cited UC San Diego's decision  last year to ban polystyrene and other forms of plastic packaging on campus.  </P> <P> "I think public interest is up, and that businesses are hearing consumers'  concerns about the environment," Nash said. "Consumers have unlimited power  with their buying practices, and they can band together to influence businesses  and the manufacturers of plastic products."  </P> <P> Organizers said the campaign will be modeled on similar ventures that have  succeeded in Berkeley and other communities.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ford Expands Sales Incentives: Ford Motor Co. notified its dealers that it is  adding $1,000 rebate offers on two full-sized cars until further notice in  attempts to spur their slowing sales and curb growing inventories. The rebates  on its Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis sedans and wagons are the first  buyer incentives placed on those cars since 1983, and underscore the softening  sales so far this year in the large-car market, as well as the entire industry.  Ford also announced a $750 rebate until further notice on its full-sized Bronco  sport utility vehicle, adding it to current incentive offers on a wide range of  light truck models that also expire July 31.  </P></p>

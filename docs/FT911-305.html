			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Middle East peace effort falters US officials were last night gloomy about progress towards a Middle East peace conference after six hours of inconclusive talks between Mr James Baker, secretary of state, and Syria's President Hafez al-Assad. A senior official said there had been 'no particular progress' on critical issues such as Arab insistence, against Israeli objections, on United Nations involvement in a proposed peace gathering. Mr Baker, who is on his fourth visit to the region since the end of the Gulf war in March, left Damascus for Cairo where he held a 'working dinner' last night with Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister. Mr Baker is due to visit Jordan and Israel in the next few days. Washington and Moscow are collaborating in efforts to organise a regional peace conference, but these are in danger of collapsing because of wide differences between Israel and the Arabs, especially Syria. Mr Baker tried unsuccessfully yesterday to persuade Mr Assad to show greater flexibility on the details of the proposed Middle East conference. Mr Assad wants the full application of UN resolutions requiring Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land, including Syria's Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 war and subsequently annexed. A spokesman for Mr Assad, seeking to put the best face on unpromising discussions with Mr Baker, said that 'President Assad reiterated Syria's real desire to establish a just and comprehensive peace in accordance with UN resolutions . . . He also affirmed the continuation of Syria's readiness to co-operate with current efforts to achieve the best formula that would push forward the peace process.' Mr Baker, in concert with Mr Bessmertnykh, is trying to increase the pressure on Israel and the Arabs to bury their differences, but he is battling against a long legacy of bitterness and distrust. US officials in Cairo were pessimistic about chances of Israeli co-operation. will know exactly what separates the parties and then we will determine what the next steps are,' one official said. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's premier, re-stated his determination at the weekend never to yield territory seized in 1967. 'We will not give up, not only Jerusalem, but any portion of the land of Israel,' Mr Shamir said in a speech. Mr Baker received what amounted to a glimmer of good news on the eve of his latest Middle East shuttle when the Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia announced they would send an observer to a proposed peace conference. The six Gulf Co-operation Council states also said they would participate in discussions with Israel on such issues as disarmament, water conservation and the environment. US officials described these undertakings as something of a 'breakthrough', since the Gulf states had never before signalled a willingness to sit down at the same negotiating table as Israel; but in a statement that is certain to displease the Americans, a senior Israeli yesterday described the GCC announcement as unimportant.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLEGED DRUG SALES FROM NAVY FRIGATE INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> Nine sailors from a Long Beach-based guided missile frigate, including the  vessel's top law enforcement officer, are being investigated by the Navy for  various drug related offenses, including allegedly running a drug distribution  network and tampering with mandatory urinalysis tests, a Navy spokesman said  Saturday.  </P> <P> The Navy is expected to bring charges against some or all of the sailors as  early as this week, according to Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser, a spokesman for Rear  Adm. Alvar Gomez, commander of the Long Beach Naval Station.  </P> <P> The allegations include the use and distribution of marijuana and  crystal-methamphetamine (commonly known as ice) both on and off the frigate  John A. Moore, Chesser said.  </P> <P> He declined to specify how many of the sailors were involved in each of the  alleged offenses. The Navy would not release the names of any sailors involved  in the investigation.  </P> <P> Seven sailors, including the ship's master-at-arms or "head policeman", have  been restricted to barracks at the Terminal Island installation since March 15,  when special investigators concluded the seven-month undercover portion of the  operation, he said.  </P> <P> Two sailors have been allowed to remain aboard the frigate, which has escorted  oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and now serves as a naval reserve training  ship. Navy investigators have interviewed at least 18 of the ship's 160 crew  members during the last three weeks, and there may be additional suspects,  Chesser said.  </P> <P> "The Navy certainly regards this as serious," Chesser said. "When we become  aware of something like this, we take vigorous action to correct it."  </P> <P> Chesser said allegations involving drug use on Navy ships in Long Beach have  dropped dramatically since the early 1980s, when the Navy began conducting  random drug tests on all of its vessels. He said, however, the military remains  keenly aware that problems persist.  </P> <P> The investigation of sailors on the John A. Moore was launched by the ship's  commanding officer, Cmdr. William Hickman, and involved the Naval Investigative  Service, the civilian detective arm of the Navy, Chesser said. Hickman was out  of town and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Chesser would not provide details of the investigation, but he said some of the  sailors are suspected of swapping urine samples "that might not be clean" for  drug-free samples. The Navy tests its sailors randomly about three times a year  for the use of six drugs, including the two drugs allegedly used by some of the  sailors.  </P> <P> Chesser said at least one witness is present when sailors give urine samples,  and various other regulations are supposed to be followed to ensure samples are  not altered. Among the sailors suspected of tampering with the tests on the  Long Beach frigate, he said, is the ship's master-at-arms, whose duties  included supervising the testing program.  </P> <P> The investigation has forced the Navy to cancel at least one weekend mission at  sea.  </P> <P> Hickman, the ship's commander, determined last month that it was unsafe to take  the frigate from the naval station for a scheduled training mission because of  the missing sailors, Chesser said. A substitute training session was held at  the pier, he said.  </P></p>

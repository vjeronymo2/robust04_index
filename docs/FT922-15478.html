			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Braced for a second dose of deregulation - An uneasy welcome to plans to further liberalise Australia's airline industry LESS than 18 months after the Australian government swept away decades of strict regulation, the country's aviation industry is struggling to come to terms with a further dramatic dose of deregulation. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, appeared to offer something for everyone when he announced plans to 'revolutionise' the industry by creating a common aviation market in Australia and New Zealand. The announcement followed calls from New Zealand for greater access to the Australian domestic market, and it seemed to offer significant opportunities to the three big Australian airlines. However, the Keating plan has added to the confusion in the industry as it counts the cost of two years of economic recession and a bitter fares war sparked by deregulation. And while the airlines involved have been careful to welcome the proposals, they seem daunted by the dangers of open competition in a joint market of just 20m people. Under the Keating plan, Qantas, the government-owned international carrier, would gain access to Australian domestic routes next year, and the Tasman Sea route to New Zealand would be opened to Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic carrier, and Ansett Australia, a private domestic carrier jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation. A second stage, to be completed by 1994, would create a common aviation border, within which Australian and New Zealand airlines would have unrestricted access to all routes, including the Tasman. The plan also reverses a government ban on cross-shareholdings between the three Australian airlines, raising the prospect of equity links between Qantas and one of the two domestic carriers. Mr Keating told parliament that these 'great changes to our national transport system will make our continent smaller and our nation greater'. But, in the short term, the plan seems more likely to compound the industry's problems. Australian and Ansett are still struggling to come to terms with the abolition of the duopoly they enjoyed until October 1990, when the government deregulated domestic aviation as the economy was heading into recession. Only one new airline - Compass Airlines  - entered the market, but its entry sparked a price war which helped push both big airlines into losses in 1990-91, and ended with the collapse of Compass just before Christmas. Although fares have since stabilised, Sir Peter Abeles, joint chairman of Ansett, says the airline is likely to make a loss for the year to June because of heavy losses in the first half. Analysts say Australian is in a similar position. Both airlines face the possibility of renewed competition from mid-year when Compass is expected to re-enter the market following a deal between the liquidator and Southern Cross Airlines, another potential new entrant. Several other airlines are thought to be at the planning stage. Competitive pressures would intensify if Qantas and Air New Zealand joined the domestic fray. Qantas has about 15,000 vacant seats a week on the Australian legs of international flights, compared with about 120,000 on the two domestic airlines. The Keating plan raises questions over the government's efforts to privatise 49 per cent of Qantas and 100 per cent of Australian. The sales have attracted informal interest from British Airways and several Pacific region airlines, including Air New Zealand, Garuda Indonesia, Singapore Airlines, Japan Air Lines and North West Airlines of the US. However, the regulatory changes will delay progress towards formal offers, while the potential bidders consider the unpredictable consequences of the new regime. Qantas, for example, might gain from the ability to sell empty seats to domestic passengers, but could lose from increased competition on the Tasman. Mr John Ward, chief executive of Qantas, says the announcement leaves the privatisation process 'confused'. Officials say the sales will almost certainly have to be put back to next year. 'It's a mess,' says one. New Zealand is threatening to block the creation of a common Australasian market unless Air New Zealand is given full international rights for flights passing through Australia. Mr Rob Storey, New Zealand's transport minister, says these so-called 'beyond rights' would 'form an integral part' of a single aviation market, and would have to be granted in advance by Australia. Officials will begin discussions on the issue shortly, but the omens for compromise do not look good. 'The Kiwis are just trying it on; there is not a hope that we will agree,' says an Australian official. Even if the beyond rights dispute can be overcome, there seems to be limited scope for further competition on the Tasman, where Qantas and Air New Zealand are already sharing aircraft on some routes because of over-capacity. Against this background, the package left the airlines distinctly under-whelmed. In the five weeks since Mr Keating announced his proposals, none has come forward with plans to take advantage of them. Ansett, for example, says it may seek to fly across the Tasman to link its Australian and New Zealand domestic services, but would consider other international operations only in exceptional circumstances. 'It has got to be a very special operation because . . . the European and American markets are so oversupplied with airlines now that it will be a cut-throat operation for a long time,' says Sir Peter. Nor would Ansett seek to purchase a stake in Qantas, because of the government's intention to retain a 51 per cent shareholding. 'We like to have control,' Sir Peter says. Mr John Schaap, managing director of Australian Airlines, told an aviation conference recently that Australian would not 'charge in at the first opportunity, at any cost' just because it had been given the right to compete for international routes. 'To do so would be a very risky exercise, in which we would be seeking a slice of somebody else's business, and they would seek to protect themselves, possibly by seeking a slice of our established business,' he said. In spite of their caution, the airlines will be investigating their options over the next few months. But with the example of Compass before them, they are unlikely to lose sight of the possible consequences of another fares war caused by overcapacity. Such a battle, says Mr Schaap, could easily 'destroy' one of the airlines. And that, the airlines all agree, is not likely to be in anyone's interests.</p>

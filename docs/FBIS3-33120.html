			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] Bayardo Arce, a member of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front [FSLN] National Directorate, has presented to  the public the FSLN Program Commission's official proposal,  which will be discussed in May during the extraordinary meeting  of the FSLN Congress.    According to Arce, the commission has worked on the basis of  what was agreed upon during the FSLN's first congress, held in  1991. Then, the delegates demanded the redrafting of four  aspects of the FSLN program.    The aspects that were changed in the FSLN's program platform  are those related to the FSLN's position on relations with the  United States, the Nicaraguan Government, the land issue, and  its social role as a party.    The presentation of the document was preceded by a strong  debate on these and other topics that clearly established that  there are, at least, three clearly defined different tendencies  within FSLN ranks.    According to Arce, this document is only a proposal, but it  is the official proposal and will be discussed as such by the  party members. "The other documents presented will complement  the discussion," Arce added.  <H5>  Relations With the United States </H5>   Regarding the FSLN's relations with the U.S. Government, the  document suggests "establishing a new relation between the  United States and Nicaragua in which mutual interests will  prevail."    According to the document, the relations with the United  States consist of two essential components: Nicaragua's  unrestricted respect for the principles of self-determination  and noninterference in other states' internal affairs, and the  United States' unequivocal respect for the Nicaraguan people's  sovereign and democratic decisions.    These aspects are related to the remarks made to the  Sandinist government regarding its support for Central America's  revolutionary movements and the history of U.S. military and  political interventions in Nicaragua.    The document also supports the incorporation of Nicaragua  and  Central America into NAFTA.    The programs commission coordinator has denied this part of  the document is influenced by the belief that it is necessary to  be in good standing with the United States if one wants to be a  true electoral alternative.    The second aspect, related to the position with the  government, concerns the outright rejection of a government  similar to the Somozist. In addition, it deals with the fight  against corruption and favors an honest public administration  and obedience to the Constitution and bylaws.  <H5>  "Honest Opposition" </H5>   To face the crisis and reactivate the country, the document  proposes an honest strategy against the government policies that  prostrate the country.    Concerning the phrase "honest opposition," Arce has said  these two elements will have to be discussed in depth and  outlined by the congress.    "The only way to overcome the vulnerability of the  democratic  process and ensure its stability is to base it on a nonexclusive  economic and social project in the economic democratization," he  has said, adding "the state's economic policies should be  consistent with this objective."  <H5>  The Electoral Way </H5>   Regarding taking political power, the document states  clearly: "For the FSLN, elections are the only valid means to  accede to the government. Consistent with our democratic  commitment, we hereby declare there is no room or justification  for the current armed struggle in Nicaragua."    Regarding the controversial property issue, the document  proposes truly novel points that will surely lead to very  intense debates in the FSLN.    "The FSLN respects and defends the stability of private  property. Similarly, the FSLN encourages the development of all  forms of cooperative, associative, and community property,  regarding these forms as an expression of the socialization  process."    Consequently, the document proposes "a commitment with the  country's economic and social agents to face the property issue  problem being linked to political stability."    The document also proposes an immediate legalization of  workers and peasants' property by allocating the property to  them and to compensate fairly "the sectors that have been  suffering from the uneven distribution."    Regarding the composition as a party, the program proposes  assimilating organically the societal makeup, which is being  defined as plural. [sentence as published]    Finally, the document extends an invitation to define the  policy regarding the various social sectors, not only to social  classes.    Arce has said this is the official proposal, which should be  enriched in a debate that opened long before the official  documents were presented.    The proposal on the statutes is scheduled to be presented  this week, Commander Arce has reported.</p>

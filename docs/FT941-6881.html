			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Bank probes manufacturing investment The Bank of England is studying the intentions of about 250 of Britain's biggest manufacturers to find out if lower inflation is causing more companies to change their investment strategies. The unpublicised survey reflects concern among some Bank and Treasury officials that companies' investment intentions may not have altered to take account of the possibility of lower price pressures over the next few years. The survey was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry which in the past year has warned that companies may not be stepping up investment quickly enough to help a full recovery from the recession. Since manufacturing investment hit a peak in 1990 it has fallen by nearly a quarter, with only a modest rise expected this year compared with last year. Information from the questionnaire about the investment strategies of companies will be fed into the routine reports sent by the Bank to the Treasury. One company chairman who has taken part said he was 'slightly cynical' about the exercise. He added: 'It seems that the Bank is using this as a way to point out to industry that it should be pushing ahead with investment faster than is happening.' His company had already reduced the rate of return it expected from investment projects from 20 per cent to 17.5 per cent. The chief executive of another company said the survey was a 'welcome sign' that the Bank was taking more of an interest in manufacturing. His company had reduced its expected rate of return from 30 per cent to 22 per cent. The Bank said the questionnaire was part of its normal intelligence gathering operations. 'It fits in with our efforts to feel the pulse of what is going on,' it said.</p>

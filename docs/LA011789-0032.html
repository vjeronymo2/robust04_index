			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> Perhaps the market is experiencing the January effect -- by which small stocks  rebound from late-year drops spurred by tax-loss selling -- or maybe it is  moving contrary to the consensus of economists' forecasts, suggested Irving  Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> But, for whatever reason, some San Diego stocks have done quite well during the  first two weeks of the new year, Katz said.  </P> <P> Five San Diego stocks have attained 52-week highs:  </P> <P> * Cohu hit $13.25 after announcing it had joined a consortium of American  companies working on a compatible high-definition television technology.  </P> <P> * PS Group hit $34.375 after announcing that it was selling a substantial  portion of its oil and gas properties.  </P> <P> * Beeba's Creations rose to $10 in continued response to a profitable first  quarter.  </P> <P> * Pancretec, which was the largest percentage gainer of any San Diego stock in  1988, added $1 to last year's closing price, making a new high of $9.50.  </P> <P> * First National Corp., which closed 1988 at $10, made a new high of $11.75  </P> <P> A good gain was also made by General Microelectronics, which closed 1988 at $2  and has risen $.875 during the past two weeks.  </P> <P> Rohr Industries continued to move up and down on repeated merger and takeover  rumors.  </P> <P> Smaller gains were made by Infrasonics, which gained $.375 after press reports  of adverse effects bothering some competitors who also manufacture infant  ventilators.  </P> <P> Humphrey Inc. gained $.25 as the company reported its largest backlog.  </P> <P> BSD Bancorp likewise gained $.25. This undervalued stock continues to sell at  two-thirds of book value.  </P> <P> On the down side, a 52-week low was recorded by Imperial Corp. America, at  $7.50, in continued reaction to the announcement of $50 million in  fourth-quarter write-offs.  </P> <P> Price Co., which holds its annual meeting today in Phoenix, was down $1.50.  Advanced Marketing Services, which supplies books to warehouse clubs, was down  $1.75 for the week.  </P> <P> For those investors still attempting to understand Henley Group, old Henley  shareholders now own .225 shares of new Henley "A" stock -- which is selling at  $70.25 -- and one share of Wheelabrator Group -- which closed Monday at $7.75.  </P></p>

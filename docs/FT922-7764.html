			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Foster's wooed in ADollars 5.7bn merger SA BREWING, the Australian drinks and manufacturing group, yesterday proposed an ADollars 5.7bn (USDollars 4.3bn) merger with Foster's Brewing, the brewing, pastoral and finance group formerly controlled by Mr John Elliott. The merger would create Australia's fifth biggest company, and largely resolve the financial problems of Mr Elliott's International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private company which owns 38 per cent of Foster's. Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, said he had 'initiated and developed' the proposal, which is conditional on the appointment of SA Brewing nominees as chairman and chief executive of the merged group. However, the merger also forms the central element of a debt rescheduling plan presented yesterday by IBH to its banks. IBH has debts of about ADollars 2.5bn, acquired to finance the purchase of Foster's shares now worth ADollars 1.6bn. The board of Foster's said it would consider the offer, but is almost certain to reject it. The board is understood to have turned down a similar approach from SA Brewing in March. The offer will also face scrutiny by the Trade Practices Commission, which indicated that it was concerned about the possibility of a further reduction of competition in the highly concentrated beer market. The plan provides for a new holding company to issue one share for each SA Brewing share, and one for each 1.5 shares in Foster's. There would be no cash alternative. The offer values Foster's shares at a premium of three cents to last night's closing price of ADollars 1.90. SA Brewing shares would be worth ADollars 2.90, compared to the market price of ADollars 3.07. However, SA Brewing believes the deal would unlock substantial extra value for shareholders by removing the uncertainty about IBH's financial position, which has depressed Foster's share price for the last two years. This would be achieved through the reduction of the IBH stake in the merged company from an initial 28 per cent to 7.5 per cent. IBH would exchange its rights to about 14.5 per cent of the merged group for perpetual convertible notes, exchangeable for shares after two years. The merged group would then underwrite the sale by IBH of about 6 per of its remaining holding. If its bankers approve, the deal would provide IBH with about ADollars 345m in cash for immediate payment of overdue interest, and allow it to secure the bulk of its debt against the convertible notes and remaining shares. IBH would also gain a reliable stream of dividend and interest payments. SA Brewing said the 'significant financial strength' of the merged group would provide 'substantial benefits' to shareholders of both companies. Mr Wilson said the deal was expected to take at least five months to conclude. The merger is dependent on the approval of the directors and shareholders of both companies, and the creditors of IBH, led by Hongkong Bank Australia, Citibank, and BHP, Australia's biggest company. SA Brewing is a diversified Adelaide-based company, which dominates the south Australian beer market, and has substantial interests in home appliances and packaging. Foster's, Australia's biggest brewer, owns Courage in the UK and half of Molson Breweries in Canada. The group has been in turmoil since losing a record ADollars 1.3bn in 1989/90, largely as a result of write-offs connected with non-brewing activities acquired during Mr Elliott's reign as chairman and chief executive. The group has since sought to refocus itself as a pure brewing operation, but has been unable to dispose of non-core assets worth about ADollars 2.8bn. The board warned last week it may be forced to write-down the value of non-core assets again this year, which could affect its ability to pay a dividend.</p>

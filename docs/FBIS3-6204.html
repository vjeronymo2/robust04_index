The president made the remarks in a meeting with figures  from  various walks of life before being briefed on Kangwon Province's  administrative plan for this year.    Kim clarified anew the strict application of the political  reform laws, saying, "I will see to it that a candidate who  spent a lot of money will never be elected as a lawmaker or  chief of a district self-governing body."    He also commented on his meeting Friday with Yi Ki-taek,  chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party.    Kim said, "It is significant in and of itself that I met  with  the opposition party chairman to frankly exchange views. The  meeting has important meaning in the country's political history  since it was realized after ruling and opposition party  lawmakers unanimously passed the political reform bills at the  National Assembly."</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Coming to terms with the Hillary factor - London WHAT HAS happened to the Wellcome share price over the past month is a case of the market kicking a company when it is down. The shares were over 930p in mid-March. Yesterday, they closed at 700p, a drop of 25 per cent. There are three forces at work, all negative. First is the cloud hanging over the sector as a whole, personified by Hillary Rodham Clinton. She is drafting the blueprint for the promised US health care reforms; significantly, US health care stocks reached their peak, relative to the market as a whole, in the first weeks of 1992 just as Bill Clinton's campaign for the presidency started to look credible. Even without political impetus, drug prices face downward pressure as insurers, employers and health systems round the world become increasingly reluctant to write the industry a blank cheque. The result is poor performance by drugs stocks, worldwide. During the first quarter of 1993, the healthcare stocks covered by the FT-Actuaries World index have dropped 10 per cent in local currency terms, while the world index as a whole has risen 4 per cent. Within the UK, fears about pricing are not the only factor affecting the sector. A second influence is the shift by investors out of defensive stocks and into cyclical ones, as the economic upswing begins. Pharmaceuticals companies are classic defensive stocks - steady demand, pricing protected by patents and regulations, a growth path dictated by what comes out of the labs rather than what is in the customer's pocket. As the economy dived into recession, the big internationally minded UK drug stocks  -Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - benefited hugely from their defensive status. As demand picks up, though, steady earnings growth looks dull by comparison with recovery stories. Companies in the sectors most affected by the economic cycle stand a chance of doubling or tripling their earnings overnight; drug stocks do not. The relative performance of the health and household sector of the FT-Actuaries All-Share, dominated by the big drugs stocks, shows how this works. In the first half of 1992, as hopes of economic recovery emerged, the sector weakened relative to the market. As the summer fears of a continuing recession set in, the sector started to gain once more. When devaluation made eventual recovery more certain, the relative slide resumed, to gather pace in recent weeks. Wellcome's performance shows what happens when you add specific company problems to those general concerns. On Thursday of last week, the outlook suddenly worsened for sales of Wellcome's most glamorous drug, its anti-Aids preparation Retrovir. Preliminary data from a Franco-British study indicated that, for patients who had not yet developed full Aids, Retrovir had little to offer. The share price fell immediately; since the study appeared, it has dropped 8 per cent. Drug companies frequently encounter setbacks to important drugs, and the market usually over-reacts. After a few days, investors remember that the company has other eggs in its basket, and the share price recovers. Earlier this week, it looked as if just that process was under way. On Monday, for example, when the stock market as a whole was down sharply in the aftermath of Friday's slide in New York, Wellcome managed a healthy recovery. The worst seemed over. On Wednesday, however, the pattern of recovery was jolted. Wellcome met analysts to put its case over Retrovir, but the audience was not convinced. The share price resumed its slide: it dropped another 23p, closing at 698p. On Thursday, it recovered to 703p, a net rise of 8p since the previous Friday. The Retrovir issue aside, Wellcome and others in the industry have some bumpy weeks ahead: Hillary Clinton's health-care plan is due by early May. The stock has some protection, however, in its relatively unglamorous rating: at 19 or so, the price/earnings ratio is the lowest it has been since the company was floated in 1986, leaving Wellcome trailing behind such stocks as BICC, Thorn EMI, or ICI. And, though the yield at 2.3 does not sound particularly generous, it is the highest since the stock was first available to the public. Such valuation calculations are also applied to the market as a whole. Econometric research just published by Goldman Sachs explores the extent to which they are a useful indicator of whether shares are cheap or dear. Looking at the UK market as a whole, the Goldman analysts conclude that the best indicator is the yield ratio (the ratio of the yield on long-term government bonds to the dividend yield on equities). This will not come as a surprise to the equity market, since the yield ratio is probably its most common rule of thumb. More interesting, perhaps, is Goldman's creation of a Composite Valuation Indicator, which bundles together all the measures commonly used to assess the market's value, assigning each the importance justified by how successful it is in 'explaining' stock market movements. This indicator works, the Goldman analysts say: trading on the basis of the indicator over the last 20 years would have doubled your money compared with a simple buy-and-hold strategy. At the moment, the indicator suggests the UK stock market is undervalued by around 10 per cent. No one seemed to be paying much attention to that sort of calculation this week: the FT-SE 100 index closed on Thursday at 2821.8, a drop of 48.1 points since Friday and a decline of 4 1/2 per cent since its peak earlier in the year. Investors were partly marking time before the holiday, partly peering edgily ahead to find the good news already implicit in share prices. As the Wellcome tale shows, that sort of market is easily spooked.</p>

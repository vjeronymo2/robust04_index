			<p>BFN     [Text] Could Russia unilaterally suspend sanctions against  Serbia? Here is Yevgeniy Prokhorov, director of the  International Law Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry to  speak on this from the point of view of international law.    [Prokhorov] It would be quite a difficult thing to do for  one  simple reason: We would have to leave the United Nations. The  decision of the Security Council is of a compulsory nature and  applies to all states of the world, even should they disagree  with one or another decision. Therefore it would be impossible  to unilaterally stop implementing sanctions adopted at the  decision of the Security Council without violating the UN  Charter.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Built from the bargain basement: Philip Coggan says price-cutting is accompanying recovery If you are a skirt-wearing, meat-eating shopper with a penchant for electrical appliances, this has been a good year. Prices of women's clothes, lamb chops and stereo systems have all fallen in the past 12 months. Across the UK economy, companies are growing accustomed to the idea that this recovery - unlike previous returns to prosperity - will not automatically lead to higher prices. The habit learnt by consumers and corporate customers during the recession - that it rarely hurts to ask for a discount - is dying hard. Last month, a survey by market research group Verdict estimated the average family had saved Pounds 150 a year on food over the past year, thanks to supermarket price battles. Why are consumers able to get such good deals? The answer is twofold: the state of the UK, and world, economy; and the retail sector's problems. July's surprise 0.5 per cent fall in the retail prices index, announced this week, means that underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, has fallen to an annual rate of 2.2 per cent, its lowest level for 27 years. Even that measure of underlying inflation - which is affected by indirect tax changes, such as the introduction of value-added tax on fuel - may overstate the core figure. The British Retail Consortium of leading stores says the annual increase in the price of retail goods was just 0.9 per cent in July. Such a low level of inflation means some prices must be falling. Some recent bouts of price-cutting have occurred in traditionally cut-throat areas, such as travel, where operator Thomson and agents Lunn Poly and Going Places announced reductions in package holiday prices for next summer. In other areas, price reductions have resulted from new entrants trying to break into competitive markets, such as supermarkets' introduction of own-label cola. Newspaper price cuts may indicate another trend: the end of the recession and the lowering of interest rates have given companies the financial strength to attack their competitors. 'Now that companies such as News International (which publishes The Times and The Sun newspapers) have got their balance sheets in order, they can invest to gain market share, which is the strategy a price cut often represents,' says Mr Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the independent research group. In the high street, seasonal sales to attract cautious consumers are a biannual event. The timing of this year's summer sales, concentrated in July rather than spread over two months, may account for the apparent sharp fall in prices. Nevertheless, annual price falls in goods from bread to furniture indicate that pricing pressures are still intense, even though the recovery is in its third year. In part, these pressures are due to a change in consumers' attitude. Continued fear of unemployment, now at a seasonally adjusted 2.6m; the shift to part-time jobs, up by 183,000 in the year to spring; earnings increases, running at about 3.75 per cent this year; and debt levels which remain high, at about 110 per cent of disposable income, all contribute to a cautious consumer outlook. Mr Colin Evans, chief executive of clothing chain Austin Reed, says: 'In our experience, consumers are very price conscious. But they're not just looking for a bargain. They're much more aware of the price-quality ratio.' He thinks the market is splitting in two: 'Consumers look to certain retailers, which offer good value all the time and twice-yearly sales, while others are offering virtually continuous discounts and promotions.' Retailers in the latter category may find it difficult to escape the downward pricing spiral. One Southampton department store manager says: 'Some retailers have created pricing problems for themselves, having got through the recession by launching endless sales.' Even those shops not making price cuts find it difficult to raise prices. Large store groups such as Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Kingfisher have run 'value for money' strategies under various titles. Ladies' wool blazers and prawn sandwiches have stayed at Pounds 85 and 99p, respectively, for the past two years at M&amp;S. 'Our underlying philosophy is we're not trying to be the cheapest, but we are trying to provide the best quality at the best price,' says Ms Sue Sadler, corporate press officer at M&amp;S. One leading retailer says: 'This is the environment that we're going to have to get used to. You win by efficiency, by your systems, by controlling costs. You improve your margins by buying better.' Small retailers have found this strategy hard to implement. They lack the bulk-buying power to compete. Price wars are usually won by the strongest players, because they can afford to sit out the initial loss of revenue involved in the hope of higher volumes to come. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says that small independent retailers (which account for about 11 per cent of total sales) face 'continuing difficulties' and report little increase in year-on-year turnover. Profit margins across retailing as a whole are slimmer. The Bank of England's quarterly inflation report, published this month, estimates that retailers' margins declined by almost 10 per cent in the year to the second quarter of 1994 - the seventh successive quarter to show a decline. 'Retailers' margins as a proportion of output prices are probably at historically low levels,' says the report. It is not all doom and gloom for retailers, however. Retail sales volumes rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 cent in July and were 3.8 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Personal sector lending grew by Pounds 51m in July for the fourth successive month - the first time such consecutive increases have been achieved since 1991, indicating consumers are becoming more confident. In the past, when consumers have gone on a spending spree, the result has been higher inflation as the supply of credit has outstripped the supply of goods. Whether a sharp rise in inflation results from the current recovery depends on the tricky question of how much spare capacity - the so-called output gap - there is in the economy. Once the economy gets close to full capacity, bottlenecks appear and prices are forced up. Professor Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research, an economic forecaster, believes that UK output is still 3 per cent below the economy's long-term growth trend, which makes it 'very difficult to see why inflation should rise in the medium term'. But Mr John Marsland, UK economist at UBS, the securities firm, thinks that capacity constraints will start to bite on manufacturers towards the end of this year. This will knock on to retail prices in six to nine months. A bout of general inflation would be the outcome of this scenario, which would probably be good news for most store groups. 'Retailers have never been afraid of a modest bout of inflation,' says Mr David Simons, chief executive of Somerfield, the supermarket group formerly know as Gateway. But even pessimists think the upturn in inflation is still a year away. In the meantime, shoppers hunting for cheap blouses and cuts of meat should not be disappointed.</p>

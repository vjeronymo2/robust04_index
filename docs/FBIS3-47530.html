In a note lodged to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and  International Cooperation of the Royal Cambodian Government, the  Vietnamese Embassy quoted a source from the Overseas Vietnamese  Association in Kompong Chhnang as saying that on Dec. 29, 1993  Khmer Rouge troops kidnapped Mrs Le Thi Hung, 45, and her  brother Mr Le Van Sen, 33, while they were fishing on a river  near the town of Kompong Chhnang.    The note strongly condemned that criminal act taken by the  Khmer Rouge against the Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, and  requested the Cambodian Government to immediately take drastic  measures in order to bring the criminals to trial and stop such  actions of the Khmer Rouge to ensure the lives, property and  normal life for all Vietnamese residents in Cambodia.</p>

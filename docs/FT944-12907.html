			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: Corrupt Europe, sleazy Britain - How nations respond to misbehaviour Corruption pages proliferate. They appear all over western Europe. One wonders at times which country produces which comment: 'Shady financing . . . is eating away at the state. That means many existing political careers, if not all, have been made in dubious circumstances. The discredit which has rebounded on the political class is now being purged. Such a medical exercise, however disagreeable, can only end by pepping up a profession which has terrible need of it.' That appeared in Liberation in Paris this week. It could have appeared in Spain or Italy. But not in Britain. In Britain there is sleaze, not corruption. Here, for the benefit of non-British readers, is an account of what sleaze might be in Britain. Mr Kettle MP and the businessman Mr Black become firm friends while sharing a tent on a camping holiday. Subsequently, Kettle is made a consultant for Black and asks questions in parliament, at Pounds 2,000 a time, about the poor management of the state-owned British Pots Corporation. Kettle rises to industry secretary and privatises BPC. Black becomes chairman. Kettle retires from the House and, as Lord Kettle, is made a director of British Pots PLC. The company donates Pounds 250,000 to the Conservative Party. Black, now knighted, retires to Liechtenstein with a Pounds 3m handout from the company. Lord Kettle heads the new Suburban Government Commission. Black is appointed by that commission to be chairman of the Surrey Development Agency, a one-day a week job paying Pounds 50,000 a year. None of this is true, and even if it were it would not be illegal or corrupt. So the government has set up a standing commission to stamp it out. I hope all is now clear. In France, by contrast, nearly every report of corruption is leading to prosecution. The spread of corruption is blamed on decentralisation. In recent years the central government has handed many of its functions over to regional bodies which have had considerable sums to spend on local development. Fortunately, the head of an institute of decentralisation, Pierre Richard, was there to put the record straight this week. In Liberation he wrote that extending powers to the regions had nothing to do with corruption. 'Let us say loud and clear: the tree which is composed of certain officials who have, either through imprudence or indelicacy, sinned, cannot conceal the forest of honest and efficient managers.' The accompanying story was that of the gigantic bridge at Nantes. In 1987, 'commissions' worth anything between FFr7m and FFr20m were allegedly, and possibly indelicately, offered to those who might have had some influence over the contract. The papers have already regaled us with the complex history of the earlier Nantes water supply contract. The 'one tree of imprudence' seems to cast a long shadow. But Richard has a number of solutions. He wants to create a ministry run by an administrative judge, 'organised in specialist sections to deal with public contracts, urban affairs etc and accountable directly to local citizens'. That would be underpinned by more powerful regional audit offices. And there should be an increase in 'the powers and prerogatives of the central anti-corruption service'. Most people, I imagine, would prefer corruption to anything like that. Governments in such circumstances usually turn to this sort of thing - the 'crackdown' approach, pioneered by Italy. But it easily gets out of hand. An economy can run into difficulties when a large proportion of its most dynamic and enterprising citizens languish behind bars pending further inquiries. Then there is the alternative, but doomed, 'return to morality' solution. In Britain there was the ill-starred 'back to basics' campaign which started a year ago and collapsed three months later. Corruption was not its target but it ran into the sleaze factor. In Italy 'back to basics' was translated as a fascist renascence. In France it is promoted by the prime minister, Edouard Balladur, under the formula known as 'the moralisation of public life.' One has to turn to the unscathed Germans for guidance. The Paris correspondent of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote this week that Italy had provided an example to France - once judges and magistrates had a free hand they could really tackle the problem. But Balladur's approach was failing because it lacked an essential element. 'What is decisive in the struggle against corruption is the political will for sharper sanctions.' Except in Britain, of course. There all measures have been taken to ensure that nothing untoward continues to happen. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

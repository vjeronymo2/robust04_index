			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with the duration of waivers, the complex range of policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues, design methodologies, and unanticipated events also makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it very difficult to establish a single Department policy on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation. This Department is committed to a policy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful evaluations using a broad range of appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation strategies (including true experimental, quasi-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimental, and qualitative designs) and will be flexible and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project-specific in the application of evaluation techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy will be most evident with health care waivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within-site randomized design is the preferred approach for most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AFDC waivers. The Department will consider alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation designs when such designs are methodologically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable. The Department is also eager to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation process be as unintrusive as possible to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries in terms of implementing and operating the policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to be demonstrated, while ensuring that critical lessons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are learned from the demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Cost Neutrality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's fiduciary obligations in a period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extreme budgetary stringency require maintenance of the principle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of cost neutrality, but the Department believes it should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible to apply that principle flexibly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Department will assess cost neutrality over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of a demonstration project, not on a year-by-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, since many demonstrations involve making ``up-front'' investments in order to achieve out-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Department recognizes the difficulty of making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate baseline projections of Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditures, and is open to development of a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology in that regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In assessing budget neutrality, the Department will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule out consideration of other cost neutral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements proposed by States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;States may be required to conform, within a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time, relevant aspects of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrations to the terms of national health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reform legislation, including global budgeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, and to the terms of national welfare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reform legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Timeliness and Administrative Complexity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is committed to minimizing the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden on the States and to reducing the processing time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver requests. In order to accomplish this the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted a number of procedures, including_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Expanding pre-application consultation with States;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Setting, and sharing with applicants, a well-defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule for each application, with established target  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dates for processing and reaching a decision on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Maintaining, to the extent feasible, a policy of one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidated request for further information;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sharing proposed terms and conditions with applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before making final decisions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establishing concurrent, rather than sequential, review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of waivers by all relevant units of the Department and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with other relevant Departments and the Office of Management and Budget;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Expanding technical assistance activities to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Developing multi-state waiver solicitations in areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority concern, including integrated long-term care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system development, services for adolescents, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services in rural areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will continue to follow and develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, and commit internal resources to reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration proposals, necessary for a sound and expeditious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. State Notice Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department recognizes that people who may be affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a demonstration project have a legitimate interest in learning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about proposed projects and having input into the decision-making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process prior to the time a proposal is submitted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department. A process that facilitates public involvement and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input promotes sound decision-making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

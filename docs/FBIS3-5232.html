On the other  hand, the EU has been conducting investigations into alleged  dumping-margin sales of Korean products in EU member nations.    According to a dispatch from the Korea Trade Promotion  Corporation (KOTRA) branch in Brussels, the EU executive  committee said in a report on the bloc's automobile industry  that European car manufacturers have found it difficult to  export their products to Korea due to the high tariffs and  excise tax plus the frugality campaign aimed at curbing imports  of luxurious foreign cars.    The committee claimed that Korean makers sold 90,000 cars in  Europe compared to 532 units sold by European manufacturers in  Korea last year. To retaliate against the alleged import  restrictions, the EU is considering revoking the GSP for Korean  cars from July, the KOTRA dispatch said.    An Association of European Automakers (ACEA) also revealed  last week in a Belgium newspaper that they are considering  investigating dumping margin sales of Korean car exporters, the  Korea Foreign Trade Association said.    A Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry official said the major  reason why European car sales are poor here is their high prices  amounting to 70 million won or more a unit. He cited an  increase of 40 percent in sales of U.S. cars last year, adding  that Ford Sables are attractive to Korean customers thanks to  their reasonable price of some 20 million won.    Aware of the EU's complaints about alleged frequent tax  probes into owners of foreign cars because of the frugality  drive, the official said, the tax administration chief in  February made it clear that tax investigations would not be made  for the reason of owning a foreign car to wipe out such  suspicion.    He also said, "It's nonsense to revoke the GSP favor on  autos  for that reason." The official also noted that Korean  automakers will not be hurt by the withdrawal of the GSP as they  have already completed their exports to the EU under it.    The EU is also considering withdrawing the GSP favor on  exports of Korean textiles from July in retaliation for the  increase in tariffs on imports of European furs from eight  percent to 19 percent for this year.    Leon Brittan, vice EC commissioner for external trade,  claimed at talks with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in Seoul  last November that the hike of tariffs violates the principle of  the GATT and UR [Uruguay Round] accords which ban any increase  in tariffs from the current level.    The EU has informally notified the Korean government that it  will withdraw the GSP favor on Korea's textile products for six  months, starting July 1, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry  official said. The damages from such action are estimated at  $30-50 million, he said, adding that the EU is expected to make  a formal decision by the end of this month.    The EU in principle claimed that Hong Kong, Singapore and  Korea should graduate from its GSP favors as they have outgrown  their developing nation status, the official said, adding that  the hike in tariffs on fur products cannot be used as a reason  for scrapping the GSP favor on Korean textiles. But in a  medium-term view, Korea is ready to graduate from the tariff  benefits as it plans to join the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1996, he explained.    The EU has recently announced it will impose a 70.6 percent  tariff on large-sized aluminum-made batteries being exported by  Daewoo Electronics and five other Korean firms on grounds that  they have sold their products at below local market prices. The  EU launched anti-dumping investigations into them last March.    "European excavator makers are expected to file a suit  against alleged dumping-margin sales of Korean products this  month," said Na Chan-yop in charge of European trade information  at KOTRA.    Korea is the third largest anti-dumping sufferer with 16  cases under investigation or anti-dumping rulings, following  Japan and China, Na said quoting EU statistics disclosed last  year.    Na pointed out that domestic manufacturers should closely  watch import trends in the bloc and Korea's market share to  avoid anti-dumping rulings on their products in Europe.    He said, "Korea has followed Japan which showered its  exports  on Europe at cheap prices. China now follows Korea. As a  result, the three countries face a large number of anti-dumping  investigations and rulings in Europe."</p>

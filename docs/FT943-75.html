			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI upgraded ICI shares put on a resolute performance in the face of the sharp market slide, finishing only 7 cheaper at 828 1/2 p. The stock attracted keen institutional support, triggered by a series of profits upgrades and recommendations as the company has embarked on a series of meetings with leading broking houses. Hoare Govett raised its earnings forecast for the current year from Pounds 450m to Pounds 495m and that for 1995 from Pounds 600m to Pounds 650m, and moved the shares from 'undervalued' to 'buy' after a strong showing in the third quarter. 'Current momentum is suggesting a share price move to 900p over the coming quarter,' said Mr Martin Evans, chemicals analyst at Hoare. NatWest Securities also hoisted its earnings expectations, by 11 per cent to Pounds 500m for the current year and by 3 per cent to Pounds 670m for 1995.</p>

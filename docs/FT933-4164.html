			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / BA presses for curb on European subsidies BRITISH Airways is putting pressure on the European Commission to adopt tighter restrictions on government subsidies supporting financially troubled national flag-carrier airlines. Sir Colin Marshall, BA chairman, said yesterday the UK airline would argue strongly, before a recently formed group of EC 'wise men', that recovery for European airlines was achievable without the need for further protection or state support. The group was set up to analyse and propose possible cures for the European airline industry, which lost Dollars 700m (Pounds 454m) last year. 'Some Dollars 3bn have been pumped into three European airlines in the last three years,' he said, adding that, as long as governments continued to support their national carriers, there was little hope of getting airlines in Europe 'fit to compete against the big US carriers'. Apart from the Dollars 3bn in state support to Air France, Sabena of Belgium and Iberia of Spain, other European carriers are waiting for state support. These include Aer Lingus of Ireland, Air Portugal, Olympic of Greece. Sabena may seek additional funds. The UK government is expected to back vigorously BA's position on state subsidies and to oppose any re-regulation in the now liberalised European airline market. The EC group of 'wise men' was set up this summer after a similar initiative by the US administration. In Brussels yesterday, the group started hearings, which will continue next week. United Airlines, one of the big three US carriers, yesterday also warned the 'wise men' that many European airlines were looking to their governments for relief and protection from further competitive inroads by other carriers. Mr Larry Nagin, United's general counsel, argued such action would be counterproductive. 'The public cost of securing, for a favoured airline, some transitory relief from competition would outweigh the public benefits which the protection would provide,' he told the EC committee. BA is also continuing to press for an agreement by the UK and the US governments to clear the way for the completion of its partnership agreement with USAir. Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, is to hold further talks in Washington next week on a revision of the existing air service agreement between the UK and US, so as eventually to complete an 'open skies' accord by the two countries.</p>

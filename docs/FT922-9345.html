			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / People: McMahon joins DC Gardner DC GARDNER GROUP, the training and outplacement company, yesterday completed a fundamental restructuring of its businesses and senior management with the appointment of Tim Inglefield as group finance director and Sir Kit McMahon (above) as a non-executive director. Sir Kit, currently a director of Taylor Woodrow and Pentos, is the former chairman of Midland Bank and a former director of Eurotunnel and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. He has long taken an interest in financial training. Inglefield, a former director of Lloyds merchant bank, joins the company from Genus Training, an information technology and software training consultancy. The appointments come after months of work by Barry Topple, group chief executive appointed last year, which have led to the departure of all but one of the previous executive directors of the company. At one stage last year DC Gardner had ten directors. Its current chairman is Stephen Johnson, and its other non-executive directors are David Rosebery and Peter Walker, the former secretary of state. Professor Edward Gardener has resigned. 'It is not particularly helpful to go back over our historical position,' he says. 'We now have a new management team in place and a sound financial base, with gearing reduced from 200 per cent to 40 per cent.' There was a Pounds 1.9m restructuring provision and a Pounds 1.5m property write-down in last year's accounts to reflect the costs of these changes.</p>

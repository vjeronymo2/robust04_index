			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Inflation down in W Germany Western Germany's annual inflation rate in July slipped below 3 per cent for the first time since April 1991, the federal statistics office said. Confirming a figure of 2.9 per cent calculated earlier from preliminary data, the office said the rate was 2.7 per cent if seasonal goods were excluded. Housing costs were 4.6 per cent higher than a year earlier, while services were 4 per cent dearer, although the month-on-month rate of increase had slowed this year. Car running costs were 4 per cent up on the year, thanks largely to fuel tax rises, while the index of retail prices was only 1.1 per cent higher. The annual inflation rate in eastern Germany was unchanged in July at 3.2 per cent, the office added. French gross domestic product rose by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1994, the state statistics institute Insee reported. This compares with an initial estimate of 0.5 per cent. The increase partly reflects a change in Insee's methods, but also an unexpectedly strong performance by the service sector and, to a lesser extent, by manufacturing. The Danish government has upgraded its growth forecast for this year to 4.4  per cent from 4 per cent in May. However, it has revised down its 1995 forecast to 3 per cent from 3.4 Spain's registered unemployment fell by a record 85,000 in July,  but 16.5 per cent of the workforce is still idle, labour ministry figures showed. The jobless rate in the Czech Republic rose 3.2 per cent in July from 3.1 per cent in June. The total number of registered unemployed stood at 160,202.</p>

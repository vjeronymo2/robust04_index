			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News analysis" by Wang Genbao] </F>   [Text] Damascus, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Syria has rejected  Israeli proposals conveyed by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher Saturday on a phased withdrawal from the Golan  Heights that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and  annexed in 1981.    Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said at the end of two  rounds  of talks between president Hafiz al-Asad and Christopher over  the weekend that Syria will not accept a phased peace with  Israel and that it insists on withdrawal from all the occupied  Arab territories as a precondition for peace in the region.    Syria's categorical rejection can be attributed to its  consistent policy and stance of opposing unilateral deals and  compromise settlements which, Damascus believes, can abort the  peace process from the foundation.    Syria is also unwilling to repeat the Oslo experience. It  contends that Jericho will never witness peace as long as  Israeli repression and intimidation continues in other parts of  the occupied West Bank.    It argues that neither Jericho nor Gaza or Majdel Shams on  the Golan Heights are isolated isles but they are part and  parcel of the Arab territories.    While renewing syrias commitment to the peace process based  on UN resolutions and the principle of trading land for peace,  Damascus makes no secret of its rejection of unilateral and  partial settlements and comes out forcefully in favor of a just  and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    It also demanded that the South Lebanon issue be settled  through unconditional Israeli withdrawal in accordance with UN  Security Council Resolution 425.    In addition Syria believes that a breakthrough in the  current  deadlocked peace talks is only possible after Israel stops  derailing the peace process and completely drops all ideas and  proposals for unilateral deals and phased withdrawal.    Damascus vows never to accept compromise deals over the  Golan  Heights and insists on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan and other Arab lands.    Meanwhile, Syria has provided Israel with proposals which,  it  said, could lead to lasting peace. The proposals were brought  to israel by Christopher Sunday [1 May].    Israel's positive response to these ideas and UN Security  Council resolutions related to the Middle East peace process  could help in achieving peace, Radio Damascus said.    The Syrian proposal, it said, "emerges from a real desire"  to  establish a just and comprehensive peace that would guarantee  the rights of all parties. Details of the proposal were not  disclosed.    Christopher, who is shuttling between Israel and Arab  states,  said in Cairo today that "very considerable gaps remain" before  a settlement can be reached between Israel and Syria.    He has indicated his readiness to return to the Middle East  in two weeks to advance peace talks between Israel and Syria.    Christopher's decision is apparently based on the assumption  that progress so far is enough to prompt him to continue his  efforts to advance talks on the Syrian track.    Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad told Christopher that he is  ready for "normalization with Israel" at the end of full Israeli  troops pullout from the Golan Heights.    "There is serious engagement, but there is a long way to  go,"  a senior U.S. official said of the positions of the two sides.</p>

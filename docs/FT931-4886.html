			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / British talks with PLO prompt Israeli protest ISRAEL last night summoned the British ambassador to protest at the UK's decision to resume top-level contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation which were broken off following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Mr Yossi Beilin, the deputy foreign minister, said that the action 'might harm the chances to resume the peace process' in the Middle East. An Israeli foreign ministry statement described the move as 'a prize for the Palestinians who have yet to announce their readiness to return to the process'. British officials were dismayed at the reaction and stressed that the decision was taken solely to assist the peace process. The break in relations between the PLO and Britain was in protest at the organisation's support for Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Britain has hinted for some time that the ban on top-level contacts was under review. Mr Douglas Hogg, a minister of the Foreign Office, will today meet Mr Faisal Husseini, the leading Palestinian in the Arab territories occupied by Israel; Mr Afif Safieh, head of the PLO delegation in London, and an official from PLO headquarters in Tunis. On Thursday Mr Hogg will meet Mr Beilin. The Foreign Office said: 'The peace process is at a delicate stage. We are urging all sides to agree to an early resumption of negotiations. The PLO will have an influence on important decisions.' The PLO has warned that it cannot resume peace negotiations with Israel until substantial progress has been made towards resolving the crisis over the 396 Palestinians deported by Israel to southern Lebanon in December. A visit last month to the region by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, failed to overcome the obstacle but he is expected soon to issue formal invitations for a resumption of negotiations in Washington during the second half of April. Syria, Lebanon and Jordan have all expressed their willingness to attend.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALIAN 'FELT BAD' ABOUT LEAVING REFUGEES, NAVY TOLD  </P> <P> A U.S. Navy captain on trial for not rescuing Vietnamese refugees was  remorseful at not picking them up but said Navy rules did not allow him to do  so, a defense witness said Monday.  </P> <P> "He felt bad about it. He had picked up people before. . . . He felt sorry, I  guess, that these people didn't meet the guidelines," Bruce Butterfield said at  the court-martial of Capt. Alexander G. Balian.  </P> <P> Balian, commander of the amphibious transport Dubuque, is charged with  dereliction of duty for failing to rescue a boatload of refugees encountered by  his ship in the South China Sea last June.  </P> <P> Refugees said they turned to cannibalism after the Dubuque left them. Just 52  of the 110 who left Vietnam survived the journey.  </P> <P> Butterfield was captain of the Kilauea, a civilian ship steaming behind the  Dubuque.  </P> <P> "He expressed to me remorse. I guess it was disappointment" that he had to  leave the refugees behind, Butterfield said, recalling the radio conversation  he said he had with Balian after the incident.  </P> <P> U.S. naval ships, according to Navy rules, may pick up refugees if their craft  is unseaworthy, if there are sick or injured aboard or if the refugees face  imminent death.  </P> <P> Butterfield said Balian advised him he was not picking up the refugees but had  given them food, water and navigational assistance. He said his impression from  Balian was "these people were not in distress" and that the boat was seaworthy.  </P> <P> The trial, in its second week, is being held at the U.S. naval base at Subic  Bay. If convicted, Balian faces a maximum prison sentence of four years and  three months, thousands of dollars in fines, discharge and loss of naval  benefits.  </P></p>

(Respondent), proposing to revoke the pharmacies' DEA Certificates of Registration, BF1426306 and BA2097562, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and to deny any pending applications under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged that Family Pharmacy was not licensed in New Jersey, the state in which it is registered, and that the continued registration of Respondent would be inconsistent with the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent, by counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Newark, New Jersey on April 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 19, 1994, Judge Tenney issued his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended ruling in which he recommended that the registration of all Drugs Pharmacy, Inc., be revoked and any pending applications of Nasir Gore be denied. No exceptions were filed and on August 19, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record of the proceedings to the Deputy Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, enters his final order in this matter, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrative law judge found that detectives from the Kearny, New Jersey Police Department received information from a confidential informant that Respondent was selling tablets of Ativan, a Schedule IV controlled substance, to people off the street for one dollar per tablet. Subsequently, in September and October 1992, police officers conducted three controlled purchases of Ativan at Family Pharmacy. Each time, Mr. Nasir Gore, owner and operating pharmacist, provided a confidential informant with Ativan in exchange for cash. Mr. Gore testified at the proceeding that he had given the informant ninety controlled substance tablets, but that the confidential informant had told him that he had prescription which he would bring in later. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that on November 6, 1992, Nasir Gore entered into a Consent Order with the New Jersey State Board of Pharmacy that he cease and desist from the practice of pharmacy in the State of New Jersey. On October 18, 1993, before the New Jersey Superior Court for Hudson County, Nasir Gore pled guilty to a single felony count of distributing or dispensing controlled dangerous substances in violation of N.J. Revised Statute 2C:35&hyph;5A(1) and 5b(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge also found that DEA conducted an accountability audit of Family Pharmacy based on records seized by the Kearny Police Department. However, Judge Tenney found ``chain of custody'' problems with respect to the records audited and determined that the evidence DEA provided was not persuasive to support allegations of inadequate recordkeeping with respect to Ativan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In October or November 1992, Family Pharmacy ceased operation as a Pharmacy. Therefore, the administrative law judge found that the DEA registration of Family Pharmacy, BF1426306, terminated by operation of law prior to the initiation of the proceeding. 21 CFR 1301.62. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that Nasir Gore was operating All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc. in November 1993, and that he had been observed acting as the pharmacist-in-charge. Mr. Gore testified that he had sold the pharmacy to his brother-in-law, Tariq Matin, on November 3, 1993, and he produced a copy of a contract and related documents. However, the pharmacy was operating under a New York State pharmacy license issued to Mr. Gore, that indicated that Mr. Gore was the sole pharmacist and owner of All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc. Judge Tenney found that there was not evidence of money or other consideration exchanging hands, no evidence of inventory transfers, and no evidence that the DEA or the state was advised of the change of ownership. In addition, Mr. Gore continued to work at the pharmacy and continued to write all checks for he pharmacy. Judge Tenney concluded that there was no true sale. Mr. Gore also testified that the pharmacy had ceased operation in March 1994 and that he had transferred all controlled substances for destruction. The administrative law judge found no preponderating evidence to support a finding that the pharmacy is no longer in operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors shall be considered: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Henry J.

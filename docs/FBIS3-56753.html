To Remain in Government or Go Into Constructive  Opposition?"]    [Text] Whatever the end of the "rotation" of cadres saga  which began as a result of Yegor Gaydar's resignation statement  Sunday, the very fact of this "incident" already speaks volumes.  It feels like a new revolt or coup, or Zhirinovskiy's final  victory at some future elections, has just been announced. And  this is despite the fact that, even without Gaydar, the  government managed to maintain its reformist course in the first  nine months of last year. But now is not September 1993 but  January 1994.    Last fall it seemed that the market coordinates had finally  been plotted and that the government's policy had been entirely  formalized in this sense. The elections in December 1993  confirmed the forecast of virtually all sober analysts that  opposition in society could not be eliminated through coercive  methods and the situation of September-October 1993 would be  repeated more than once according to the same pattern. And  therefore it would be just as difficult to carry out a liberal  economic policy as before the October events and the elections.  As it turns out, it is even harder.    Can it be that Gaydar, whose intellect is equal to the sum  of  all three presidential analytical centers now undergoing reform,  did not realise this? Can it be that his resignation was  predetermined even before the December elections?    Let us suppose that Gaydar will stay in the government, or  return to it. What will this change? It is extremely difficult  to carry out a liberal economic policy today given the present  composition of the government. The combination of Gaydar,  Zaveryukha, Soskovets, and Chubays produces, in Yegor  Timurovich's own words, "an indeterminate state." Economically  irresponsible decisions -- for which, as always, no one knows  who answers -- brought about the "breakdown" of this politician,  dubbed in journalists' circles "the Iron Winnie the Pooh." Even  "iron" politicians have emotions.    It is quite another matter that the presence of Gaydar in  the  government, given his entirely understandable unwillingness to  take responsibility for inflationary decisions, in itself might  have become a factor maintaining the reformist line in a more or  less acceptable form. But Gaydar is going to the Duma. And  here there is an element not only of emotions but normal  political tactics. However, will the economic price of this  tactic -- a budget deficit -- not be too high? And has not too  high a price for the elections already been paid in a political  sense?    As Gaydar himself once remarked, a government of like-minded  individuals is a rare phenomenon. Such a government arises in  specific situations, such as, for example, the situation of  November 1991. Is not Gaydar preparing to return to the  government in precisely such a situation -- but to a homogeneous  rather than a coalition government?    There are two fundamentally different tactics for the  reformers. The first is to remain in the government and carry  out their promises: 5-7 percent inflation by the end of the  year, financial stabilization, ensuring a favorable climate for  investments, slowing the production slump and gradually boosting  production -- but not by printing money.    Taking account of the emerging composition of the  government,  the hints of a soft reorientation of economic policy, and the  gamble of the cabinet's conservative wing on economic populism,  the reformers cannot be confident that it will be possible to  fulfill this program. Naturally, they have no desire to share  responsibility for economic failures with the proinflationists.  Which means that they have to leave the government -- that is  the second tactical option. And not simply leave, but become  parliamentary oppositionists and criticize expenditure  decisions, pumping money into production sectors, growing  hyperinflation, and other such socialist "measures" that will  inevitably follow their resignations.    No one knows how events will develop. Which of the reformers  will remain "hostages" in the government is also not yet clear.  It cannot be ruled out that the logic of reforms will again  return key reformers to Chernomyrdin's cabinet, as happened in  1993.    In the final analysis, it is too early to speak about a  reorientation of the policy and the views of the incumbent  premier -- after Yeltsin the second most notable political  figure of the past year. It also cannot be ruled out that  another team of reformers will take over the executive levers --  we all know which team I am talking about.    Complex political horse-trading lies ahead. All the same,  the last word will probably belong to the president.</p>

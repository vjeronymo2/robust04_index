			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets: The only way is up - or maybe down - London Markets GLOOM abounded this week. The largest all-British oil company announced its first loss. A huge property group teetered on the brink of collapse. Retailers warned that there were few signs of life in the high street. Dividends were cut or paid uncovered. And the stock market . . . umm . . . start again. Glorious sunshine on the May Day bank holiday set the tone for the week in the stock market. New records were set as the FT-SE 100 index steamed through 2700 and closed yesterday at 2725.7, up 65.9 on the week. Base rates were cut on Tuesday morning, as were mortgage rates. Sterling blazed against the German mark. Reviving consumer confidence lifted new car sales in April for the first time in 30 months. Local government election results confirmed the Tory victory in the general election. Listen to a few stockbrokers and it is soon clear that the next significant move in the market will be up - or, possibly, down. That's what makes a market, they say. The bulls are still charging towards 3000; the bears are selling at best. A record high provides a good moment to look at the two sides of the argument. As the chart shows, the last cut in base rates, in September, coincided with the market reaching an all-time high. It then retreated for the rest of the year. Will share prices follow the same pattern this time? The bull case is that the British economy is starting to pick up, and this time that is definite. Although the revival will be slow, the UK stock market should do what Wall Street has done - anticipate the recovery. At the same time, foreign investors are now persuaded that Britain is a politically stable place to put their money with the added prospect of a rising stock market. Cuts in interest rates attract, rather than deter, funds. Sterling rises as cash flows in; that allows further rate cuts, stimulating the economy, and so on round the virtuous circle. Britain has looked more attractive to international investors as the situation in Germany has worsened. As the former model of financial rectitude was yielding to union demands, the large international securities firms advised clients to shift their European portfolios to the UK. Now for the other side. The bears agree that there are some signs of economic recovery. But, they say, the stock market has more than discounted this already, and the same event cannot be discounted twice. At the all-time high last September the market was on an historic p/e of 14 1/2 . Now it is on a multiple of 16 1/2 times, the difference caused by the sharp drop in earnings reported between the two dates. The market is already at a high valuation, and it will take concrete earnings growth before the p/e falls enough to make it worth buying again. The bears explain this week's rise by summoning up the twin spirits of foreign buyers and squeezed market makers. As far as the bears are concerned, foreign buyers rate just above taxi drivers in their understanding of the stock market, and a squeeze on the market makers is dismissed as 'technical factors'. The phlegmatic bears just see the week's rise as an even better selling opportunity. They were feeling rather exposed for most of the week, but yesterday afternoon's sale by Hanson of its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI gave a boost to the bear case. On Tuesday the base rate cut brought an early jump in the market, but the high for the day was at 8.38am. By the close the FT-SE 100 was only 2.4 points higher. That suggests that UK investors were unexcited about the rate cut once it had happened - or possibly that they had taken Tuesday off work as well as Monday. The buying started in earnest on Wednesday as the foreign investors - the theory goes - read about the interest rate cut in their newspapers. They found the market makers short of stock and pushed the index up 36.5 points to a close just short of 2700. Thursday was another dull day, with a 3.2 point gain just tipping the index over the 2700 level, and then yesterday saw another surge after the local election results. Certainly there has been little to inspire confidence in the week's company news. On the positive side, the prospect of a real bid from Lloyds Bank for its rival Midland is still being dangled tantalisingly. That is even after the apparent setback to Lloyds of the probable different treatment by competition authorities of its bid, and that from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. But elsewhere there are further reports from the recession front line. British Petroleum made a first quarter loss but maintained its dividend. Trafalgar House, the property, construction and engineering group - which owns the Ritz Hotel and the QE2 as well - halved its interim dividend in spite of an 18 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 54m. The new dividend rate is more likely to be sustainable. Tate &amp; Lyle, the sweetener group, suffered a dip in interim profits, from Pounds 94.7m to Pounds 92m, after some years of strong earnings growth. Retailing is still not a happy industry with Sears, the shoe shops to Selfridges group, reporting a 45 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 81.2m - and that is before the housebuilding business was pushed below-the-line. British Gas discovered what it is like to operate in the new low-inflation environment, when it was told by its regulator to cut prices. Analysts estimated a 2p a therm cut would knock Pounds 250m from annual profits of over Pounds 1bn. Meanwhile, in the casualty ward, Olympia &amp; York, with property assets which could be called liabilities, and WPP, whose assets go home every night, both think their banks would like to swap some of their loans into shares. Is that top of the market talk?</p>

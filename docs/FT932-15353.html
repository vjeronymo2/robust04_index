			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 4: A forest for the future - A look at county planning problems COUNTY planners are forced to tread a narrow line between the desire to foster economic growth and the needs of the countryside. Their latest attempt is in the updating of the county structure plan which will establish the main land use patterns into the next century. Their favoured approach to economic development is to concentrate it in the urban areas and, 'of the smaller amount of new development which occurs elsewhere, most should be in locations along the transport corridors.' These corridors include the railway lines, among them the new Ivanhoe Line, and the A6 road between Leicester and Loughborough. Apart from development related to junctions 23a and 24 of the M1, near East Midlands International Airport and where the M42/A42 and M1 join, planners dislike development along main roads unless related to existing urban areas. Mr Richard Phelps, who conducted a public enquiry into the provisions of the structure plan last autumn, was broadly sympathetic to this approach At any rate, development will not be allowed to rampage through the countryside. But Leicestershire has particular problems with minerals. Not that it has none - it has. As the county council explains, they 'can give rise to adverse environmental impact unless sites are carefully chosen, operated and monitored.' The county is an important aggregates producing areas of the UK, home of British Coal's Ashfordby superpit. As opencast operations are not necessarily friendly neighbours, there has been considerable local agitation about opencast coal and quarrying planning applications. The planners wanted to restrict coal operations to one important major coal site and have the coal transported by rail. And, because most of the rock quarries and most of the reserves are in areas of 'high scenic value', the planners are prepared to consider extensions to existing quarries but have come out against new greenfield sites. Mr Phelps was less restrictive. He would have none of the council's proposed restrictions on the transport of coal, questioned how a site would be defined as 'major' and recommended that 'planning applications for opencast coal mining should be considered on their individual merits.' So the mineral arguments are likely to continue in the county. British Coal has identified only one area, in the north west of the county, as being of open coal interest. But in an effort to still the arguments, the local authorities, British Coal and private operators have been talking about how to devise a long term coal programme which will meet their interests and satisfy environmental considerations. North West Leicestershire, indeed, is one of the county's priority areas for development. The underground coal mines closed during the 1980s. Around 50 per cent of employment is industrial, but jobs have been disappearing during the recession so that the proportion of long term unemployed is a third of the jobless total. Economic growth in the 1980s by-passed the area. In an area where the straggling coalmining villages provide a sharp contrast to the prosperous, manicured settlements of the eastern part of the county, there is little desire to snuff out employment opportunities, whether they come from opencast mining or not. But it is because the area has become rundown that it has become part of one of the UK's boldest environmental initiatives. If the initiative started by the Countryside Commission succeeds, it will create that virtuous circle of economic development and environmental care which the county council wants. This is the creation of a new National Forest over 194 square miles in Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire: It is an attempt both to rehabilitate the countryside by creating wooded land with a mix of uses, rather than pure forest, and to give new life to an area turning its back on past industry without seeing the future clearly. 'Clean up the environment and make it attractive and this will attract investment,' said Mr Alan Tuppen, the County Council's economic development officer with - at the back of his mind - a vision of small woodlands business parks. 'The mining villages have been isolated but they could be brought back into the economic ambit by the A42 (recently brought up to near motorway standard and linking the M42 to the M1), the Ivanhoe Line and the National Forest,' Mr Tuppen suggests. But the National Forest is a long term venture which has barely started, although the first indications of willingness among farmers to turn land over to trees are beginning to emerge and companies like East Midlands Electricity and, for that matter British Coal, are supportive. The unemployment rate in Measham, a North West Leicestershire mining village, is running at over 20 per cent, the highest in the county outside inner Leicester wards. Economic decline set in when the local pit closed in 1985. The problems of rural areas in the county, by contrast, have been emerging more gradually. Just as there is a decline in industrial employment, so there is in agricultural employment. Leicestershire Training and Enterprise Council (TEC) notes: 'The national decline in agricultural employment will have the greatest impact on the more rural districts of Leicestershire - Harborough, Rutland and Melton.' In the same way as the pit closure in Measham set off a search for economic diversification, farmers have been travelling down the same road, prompted by the erosion of once assured markets and by the reduction of subsidies. But the farmers appear to have gone further. The Leicestershire TEC, in conjunction with neighbouring TECs and agricultural training organisations, found after a survey of farms in the county that that 44 per cent had diversified into - by order of frequency - contracting, retail outlets, farm building developments, leisure activities, holiday accommodation, transport and distribution and added value produce. But the TEC warns: 'It is uncertain as to whether diversification activities will either increase employment opportunities or fully employ existing labour in the long term.' That will strike a chord in North West Leicestershire. But the difference between the mining villages and the rural areas is that the former must create a new environment to provide a future while the latter have to preserve and manipulate the existing environment.</p>

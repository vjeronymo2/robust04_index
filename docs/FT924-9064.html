			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: BET sells US textile business for Pounds 42m BET, the business services group, yesterday sold Initial USA, its US textile services business, for Pounds 42m as part of an on-going programme to dispose of loss-making subsidiaries. The group said National Service Industries, the textiles company based in Atlanta, Georgia, had agreed to buy Initial USA's 11 plants and 19 service departments in the central and south eastern US for Pounds 37m. BET, meanwhile, will retain Pounds 5m in notes from other companies which had bought parts of Initial USA in recent years and which should mature in the next three years. The US disposal reflects BET's decision to streamline its five divisions and portfolio of 110 companies following a collapse in profits last year. Yesterday's announcement also marked the biggest BET disposal since it sold Biffa, the waste management company, to Severn Trent in 1991 and was the first disposal since BET's Pounds 200m rights issue in August, which was designed to restore order to the group's balance sheet. Although Initial USA broke even last year on a turnover of Pounds 58.5m, BET said it had suffered further setbacks in the recession and the group decided to sell the company to raise capital for reinvestment elsewhere. 'BET is redeploying its resources away from under-performing businesses towards those with better potential for the group,' Mr John Clark, chief executive, said yesterday. 'Initial USA was not going to meet BET's corporate performance standards because it was not large enough to fully exploit its potential in the industrial market of the US,' he added. By comparison, National Service Industries (NSI) reported a Dollars 426m turnover in the last quarter of 1992 with a net income of Dollars 20.9m. The sale of Initial USA, however, did not signal moves to scale back BET's other textile businesses in countries such as France, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands where it dominates the market in renting and servicing textile products. 'This move should not be interpreted as leading to a withdrawal from the UK and continental European textile rental market to which we remain fully committed,' Mr Clark said. The group, which expects to sell a number of smaller subsidiaries in the coming months, said its disposal programme should be completed by the end of next year.</p>

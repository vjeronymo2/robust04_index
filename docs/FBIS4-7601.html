			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Today Sulejman Ugljanin, the chairman of  the Muslim National Council of Sandzak [Muslimansko Nacionalno  Vijece Sandzaka], held a news conference during which he spoke  of the difficult position of the Muslim nation in Sandzak and  the need to solve the national problem of the Sandzak Muslims  within the framework of the international conference on the  former Yugoslavia. Senada Cumurovic has a report.    [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] In the beginning of his news  conference, Sulejman Ugljanin noted certain inconsistencies in  the work of the international conference on the former  Yugoslavia which is solving the national problem of Croats and  Serbs globally, while only the Bosnian national problem has been  reduced to solving the status of the Bosnians within the borders  of Bosnia-Herzegovina alone. The aim of his visit is to alert  the Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament and the international  community to this problem.    [Ugljanin] You all know that the policy of the Muslim  National Council of Sandzak is to solve the Yugoslav crisis by  agreement and by peaceful means. The priority of our policy is  a sovereign and unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina and a special status  for Sandzak. A special status for Sandzak is the only way to  prevent the (?cruel) ethnic cleansing of the Sandzak Bosnian  people from that area.    [Cumurovic] The establishment of a special status for  Sandzak  implies the demilitarization of Sandzak, the right to display  Muslim national symbols, education that honors the identity of  the Muslim nation, and forming their own assembly and  government. Explaining the difficult situation in Sandzak,  Ugljanin pointed out the fact that the entire political  leadership of the Muslim nation in Sandzak has been arrested,  precisely at the time when the national problem of the Muslim  nation is being solved.    [Ugljanin] I will briefly tell you that since the beginning  of the Serbian and Croatian aggression against  Bosnia-Herzegovina, eight Muslims were killed in 1992, [words  indistinct] and 181 Muslims have gone missing. Around 60 houses  were destroyed by planted bombs, as well as almost 1,000  business premises, four mosques, and so on. Several thousand  houses belonging to Sandzak Muslims (?have been attacked) by  Serbs and Montenegrins in cooperation with the Serbian and  Montenegrin police.    [Cumurovic] This tragic position of the Muslim people in  Sandzak has led to the following demand by the Muslim National  Council:    [Ugljanin] To urgently send CSCE observers, that is, a  permanent CSCE mission with greater authority than the previous  one had, to send UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], the UN forces  for the prevention of conflicts, and to release the arrested  political leaders of the Muslim people. We have placed this  request with the European Twelve, the Geneva conference, and the  United Nations, and I would like to repeat it during this news  conference.    [Cumurovic] Answering the question of whether an armed  attack  on Sandzak by Serbs and Montenegrins was possible, Ugljanin said:    [Ugljanin] You know that 29,000 members of the  Serb-Montenegrin Army are deployed in Sandzak on top of their  peace time troops, that Muslim houses are searched every day,  mainly at night between midnight and 0600 in the morning.  Family members are harassed, our people are arrested. [Passage  indistinct] Now, when the Bosnian crisis is over, we are  expecting an open Serbian and Montenegrin aggression against  [word indistinct].    [Cumurovic] Sulejman Ugljanin also presented the following  figures: 69,000 residents of Muslim nationality have left  Sandzak in the past three years, and 59 villages bordering with  Bosnia-Herzegovina have been ethnically cleansed. All this  points to the need to solve the status of Sandzak, but not  within the framework of Serbia and Montenegro, but within the  framework of the international conference on the former  Yugoslavia, it was said at the news conference today.

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA TO CURB FUNGICIDE USE ON FRUITS, VEGETABLES;  </P> <P> HEALTH: INDUSTRY GROUPS PREDICT THE EXPECTED BAN WILL RAISE FOOD PRICES AND  REDUCE CROP YIELDS. BUT ENVIRONMENTALISTS CITE EBDC LINK TO CANCER.  </P> <P> After months of debate, the Environmental Protection Agency will move next week  to sharply restrict a controversial class of fungicides used on many fruits and  vegetables and linked in recent years to cancer in laboratory animals.  </P> <P> Informed sources in the food industry and the environmental movement said EPA  officials will seek to prohibit use of ethylene bisdithiocarbamates, or EBDCs,  on tomatoes, potatoes and bananas, three of the crops on which they are most  heavily used.  </P> <P> The action is expected to be announced on Monday by EPA Administrator William  K. Reilly.  </P> <P> EBDCs are used widely in California and throughout the world to protect produce  crops from fungus, particularly in humid areas, and to extend shelf life after  harvest. The compounds currently are used on about a third of all fruits and  vegetables produced in the United States.  </P> <P> The chemical and produce industries contend the proposed restrictions would  increase food prices by reducing crop yields, particularly in the Rio Grande  Valley of Texas, in Florida, and in other Southeastern states where the growing  season is accompanied by high humidity.  </P> <P> Environmentalists, however, said the EPA's proposed action would be inadequate,  ineffective and impossible to enforce thoroughly.  </P> <P> The move to withdraw approval for EBDC use on tomatoes, potatoes and bananas  comes three months after manufacturers of the fungicides voluntarily withdrew  60 of the 73 food crops listed for approved use.  </P> <P> In spite of the sharp reduction, consumer exposure was not drastically lowered  by the voluntary action, the EPA has concluded, because the remaining 13 crops  include such staples as tomatoes and potatoes and account for much of EBDC use.  </P> <P> In an effort to hold off mandatory restrictions, the United Fresh Fruit and  Vegetable Assn. and more than a dozen other trade groups asked the EPA last  week to delay its decision until a $17-million industry study of consumer  exposure to EBDCs is completed.  </P> <P> The organizations had received no answer by Friday, when the agency announced  that Reilly would disclose the decision on Monday.  </P> <P> Because Monday's actions will be subject to comment from industry and  environmental interests, it is expected that a year or more will pass before  the new restrictions would take effect.  </P> <P> Critics predicted the EPA action would not be effective even when implemented.  </P> <P> Since EBDCs would remain on the market and approved for use on at least 11  crops, there is no assurance they would not continue to be used on fruits and  vegetables no longer on the approved list, said Rick Hind of the U.S. Public  Interest Research Group.  </P> <P> Hind and representatives of other environmental groups concerned with pesticide  use insisted that EBDCs should be banned outright.  </P> <P> "If we have learned any lesson over the last decade, it is that we cannot trust  the federal government to assure a safe food supply. . . ," said Al Meyerhoff,  a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The EPA is  seeking to manage the cancer risk here, not prohibit it, and they are  continuing to close their eyes to the special risks that pesticides present to  children."  </P> <P> Meyerhoff said California growers use EBDCs on such crops as tomatoes,  potatoes, grapes, lettuce, sugar beets and asparagus. Under an environmental  initiative now being circulated for the November, 1990, ballot, the compounds  would be banned for use by growers, and foods containing their residues could  not be sold in the state.  </P> <P> "The EPA has set out to establish an 'acceptable risk' for public exposure to  one carcinogen on a food commodity, while failing to calculate the aggregate  risks from other cancer-causing pesticides used in the production of the very  same commodity," said Jay Feldman of the National Coalition Against the Misuse  of Pesticides.  </P> <P> A dozen carcinogenic pesticides are still approved for use on apples, Feldman  said, while 13 are approved for use on potatoes, 10 on tomatoes, and 11 on  citrus fruits.  </P> <P> EBDCs were first used in the 1940s. Sold under the trade names Zineb and Maneb,  they represent about half of all fungicides used on fruits and vegetables in  the world.  </P> <P> Laboratory studies have suggested that EBDC residue levels commonly found on  food crops could produce a cancer risk as high as 20 cases out of every 1  million people -- 20 times the accepted risk level.  </P> <P> Two years ago, a study by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that EBDCs  were among the more dangerous agricultural chemicals currently in use.  </P> <P> Officials of the produce industry maintain there are few alternatives to EBDC  use.  </P> <P> "For some crops, such as green peppers, there is no approved alternative," said  John McClung of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn. "For celery and some  others, there are alternatives which are expensive and ineffective."  </P> <P> Produce industry representatives accused the EPA of taking precipitous action  because it has decided not to wait for results of a national "market basket"  study being conducted to determine the level of consumer exposure to the  compounds. The study is due to be completed next summer.  </P> <P> Environmental groups, in contrast, insist that the EPA has dragged its feet,  even after acquiring new evidence involving the safety of EBDC use.  </P> <P> The decision to be announced Monday, Feldman said, is but "a small piece in a  flawed food safety policy puzzle."  </P> <P> Staff writer Maura Dolan in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

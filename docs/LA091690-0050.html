			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO SIDES OF THE GETO-GEFFEN FLAP  </P> <P> Geffen president Eddie Rosenblatt may find Clay funny. I don't. And who says  Clay's brand ofhumor (if you can call it that) doesn't encourage racism,  homophobia, and misogyny? And how about that Guns 'N Roses song "One in a  Million"(with its racial slurs against blacks)? Pure genius.  </P> <P> This is the same label that released Slayers' "Reign in Blood," which glorifies  violence. I mean really, with songs like "Angel of Death," "Criminally Insane"  and "Altar of Sacrifice."  </P> <P> There is racism involved, because rap fans are mainly black. What's Geffen  worried about anyway? That the Geto Boys are going to give black youth a dose  of much needed reality?  </P> <P> SAM THOMAS III  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

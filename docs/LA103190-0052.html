			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FORECAST IS IFFY, BUT IT LOOKS AS IF HALLOWEEN WILL BE DRY  </P> <P> Two storms may still bring rain late tonight and Thursday, but trick or  treaters will probably stay dry, according to the National Weather Service in  San Diego. But rising tides have put a new wrinkle in the weather picture.  </P> <P> Hurricane Trudy, about 800 miles south of San Diego, has been downgraded to a  tropical storm. Forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said: "The storm will dump most of  its rain over northern Baja and blow clouds our way."  </P> <P> A storm brewing in the Gulf of Alaska will spread nearly half an inch of rain  over Northern California but will weaken by the time it reaches Point  Conception near Santa Barbara, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Tonight will turn cloudy and cool, with temperatures in the 60s and a 20%  chance of rain, he said. Winds are expected to gust up to 25-30 m.p.h. in the  mountains through Friday.  </P> <P> Daytime temperatures will hover in the 70s this week with a weak Santa Ana  condition warming the county this weekend, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> The weather service is keeping an eye on the rising tides, surf and winds.  Tropical storm Trudy has pushed the surf up to 5 feet, and the highest high  tide will take it to 6.3 feet today, 7.5 feet on Sunday.  </P> <P> Waves are not expected to spill over into coastal areas, but forecasters are  watching the situation, he said. "With the winds, the seas may be rough, but  the winds will turn lighter by the weekend," Shigehara said.  </P></p>

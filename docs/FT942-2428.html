			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Insider dealing law approved by Bundestag Insider dealers in Germany face up to five years in jail and heavy fines under the terms of a new law voted through the Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament. The second financial markets promotion act, passed on Friday, will also introduce a new regulatory body for the German securities industry - the German equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US - and will allow banks to introduce money market funds, a form of short-term investment vehicle hitherto outlawed in Germany. The law, which in part implements European Union legislation, is a plank of government policy to strengthen Germany as a financial centre and is due to take effect at the beginning of August. The initiative for the law came from Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, who outlined plans for the legislation in early 1992. The law is designed to bring the regulatory regime for German securities markets up to international standards after controversial cases in Frankfurt highlighted weaknesses. The German authorities are especially worried that the absence of a law against insider dealing has diverted business away from the German stock exchanges to London. Other measures include stringent disclosure requirements for companies listed on the stock market. They will be subject to fines of up to DM3m (Pounds 1.2m) if they delay releasing price- sensitive information to the stock market and will be obliged to release details of stake-building in other companies when the stake reaches 5 per cent compared with the present 20 to 25 per cent disclosure threshold.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING IN A BALLROOM BY THE BEACH: WHERE ELSE BUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA?  </P> <P> A saxophone and piano are being played. Bartenders draw beers and pour wine.  Hot dogs, brownies and cookies wait to be eaten. A crowd gathers behind doors  not yet open.  </P> <P> It is nearly time for Boxing by the Beach at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Long  Beach.  </P> <P> Two women in tight skirts and low necklines enter the foyer and are offended  when mistaken for the curvaceous women who hold up round cards during the  fights.  </P> <P> The women say they represent a beer company. They sit at a table and autograph  beer ad posters of themselves.  </P> <P> Inside the Grand Ballroom, which holds a red-aproned boxing ring, promoter  Steve Brooks writes checks to people who have provided their services for the  evening.  </P> <P> Brooks is a tall young man in jeans and a T-shirt.  </P> <P> "All the fighters made weight, so that's a minor miracle," he said. "One was a  pound over, but they put him on a bike for 40 minutes and he lost it."  </P> <P> Tables are being set up. Little numbers are being affixed to chairs.  </P> <P> "We have 923 seats in the room," a hotel official told Brooks.  </P> <P> "We're getting a lot of calls about tickets," another hotel official told  Brooks.  </P> <P> A fire inspector wants to look at the seating chart. "This row has to go  someplace else," he said.  </P> <P> Sonny Ray, a top fighter in the 1950s and now a car painter, has a drink in his  hand. He says he is a corner man for Ray McElroy of Long Beach, the undefeated  California middleweight champion who will be in the main event.  </P> <P> The doors open, the crowd files in.  </P> <P> Brooks, carrying a tuxedo and cowboy boots, goes to change.  </P> <P> Leah Newman and Darcy Austin wait nervously in a hotel room. They will be two  of the ring girls, the first time for both. Newman is a cocktail waitress at a  popular sports bar, where she did well in a recent bikini contest. Austin works  at a nightclub, where she wrestles customers in hot shaving cream.  </P> <P> Beneath a ceiling of little white lights similar to those that decorate  Christmas trees, the fights begin. Salvador Montes knocks out Anthony  (Hummingbird) Corriel in the first round.  </P> <P> Newman and Austin, in skimpy bathing suits, parade around the ring. Cheers and  "yows" rise from the crowd.  </P> <P> Newman returns to her chair. Her hand shakes.  </P> <P> "Guarding" these women is Kraigo Klier, 23, of Norwalk. A short-sleeved tuxedo  shirt emphasizes his big biceps. Red hair falls halfway down his back. He has a  cast on his wrist.  </P> <P> Klier said he broke it in a fight at a Black Angus restaurant, where he is a  bouncer.  </P> <P> Celebrities are introduced: pop singer Irene Cara and boxer Henry Tillman.  </P> <P> Mike Masucci, the center on the Cal State Long Beach basketball team, gets  Tillman's autograph.  </P> <P> The smacks from red leather gloves echo during the next two bouts.  </P> <P> "Take him out!" booms Gene Layton, an ex-pro football player who is sitting --  by design, he said -- behind the ring girls.  </P> <P> But one person at ringside looks bored.  </P> <P> "I've seen more excitement at a Broadway musical," said Gordon James, president  of the Long Beach Civic Light Opera.  </P> <P> In the fourth fight, light-heavyweight Nate Houser, his eyes puffy, crumbles to  the canvas. A flashlight is shined in his eyes by a doctor. Later, a state  official said Houser just lay down and quit, and Houser said he is going to  retire.  </P> <P> In line at one of the bars during intermission, Layton said: "This is old-time  entertainment. These kids are banging hard."  </P> <P> Time for the main event: Ray McElroy vs. Robert (Showdown) Carson of San Pedro.  Both have tassels on their shoes.  </P> <P> Carson can't stand still for the national anthem.  </P> <P> Enthusiasm for the ring girls ebbs, but rises for the fighters, who slug it  out.  </P> <P> "Knock him out, Ray."  </P> <P> "Knock him out, Showdown."  </P> <P> "Ray can't do it, baby."  </P> <P> There is a flurry of punches in the eighth and final round. Sweat drops fly  into the first row.  </P> <P> "Comb-in-a-tion, comb-in-a-tion," instructs a fan, his hands cupped around his  mouth.  </P> <P> It is over. McElroy wins a unanimous decision. Sonny Ray pulls off McElroy's  gloves.  </P> <P> The fighters leave the ring.  </P> <P> "Champ didn't knock you out, baby," Carson's girlfriend shouts to him.  </P> <P> They both smile.  </P> <P> Already, the ring is being taken down.

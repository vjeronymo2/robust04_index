			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Facilities meeting all the requirements in subpart F of part 483 would be qualified as PRTFs to provide the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit. We would require that facilities protect and promote the rights of each resident, as specified in &sect;483.211, Resident rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would require that these providers meet applicable licensure laws in States that have established licensure requirements for this type of facility. This requirement would be specified in &sect;483.212(a)(1), Licensure and other laws. Because it is important that the children and adolescents in the facility maintain their educational development while they are in the facility, we would require in &sect;483.212(a)(2) that the facility coordinate its educational activities with school curricula in the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would specify at &sect;483.212(a)(3) that providers would be expected to meet the regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services relating to nondiscrimination, protection of human subjects, and fraud and abuse, as specified in 45 CFR parts 46, 80, and 84 and 42 CFR part 455. The disclosure of ownership and control requirements in section 1126 of the Act would be applicable to these providers. The requirements for provider agreements under section 1902(a)(27) of the Act would also be applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would also require that PRTFs have a governing body which would appoint an administrator to be responsible for the general management of the facility. These requirements would be specified in &sect;483.212(b), Administrative structure. There would be a general requirement relating to competence, academic credentials, and administrative experience. We invite comments on whether these requirements should be more specific, and if so, what the requirements should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to require that the facility designate a clinical director who is at least board-eligible in psychiatry and has experience in child and adolescent mental health. The clinical director would be responsible for the implementation of each resident's inpatient treatment plan and for the coordination of all medical/psychiatric care in the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would require that all facilities have written procedures to use for all potential emergencies, such as fire, severe weather, and missing residents (proposed &sect;483.218(b)). New employees would be trained in these procedures and all staff would participate in review drills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

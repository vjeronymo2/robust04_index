			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUROR'S ILLNESS DELAYS MCMARTIN  DELIBERATIONS  </P> <P> A juror fell ill Tuesday while deliberating the last 13 counts in the marathon  McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, as the panel's talks bogged down on  questions about a conspiracy charge. It was uncertain whether the juror would  be well enough to deliberate today.  </P> <P> The jurors, considering 65 molestation and conspiracy charges against Raymond  Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were still trying  Tuesday to resolve the issue of whether they could convict one defendant of  conspiracy and acquit the other.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders told them that they could;  they then asked how to go about it.  </P> <P> Pounders, who discussed the issue at length with attorneys for both sides and  asked for case citations, said he would answer the question when jurors return  to resume deliberations.  </P></p>

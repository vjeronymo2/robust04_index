			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Confusion in fusing 'sides' Sir, You should be complimented on another excellent survey on derivatives (October 20). There is, however, one point over which I must quibble. The article on technology, headed 'Integration top of the agenda', inverts the proper meanings of 'buy-side' and 'sell-side' when it refers to '. . . a small but growing band of the corporations and investment institutions on the sell-side'. Perhaps this is not only an inadvertent oversight, but is also another clear indication of how the distinction between 'buy-side' and 'sell-side' is rapidly becoming an anachronism, as the two 'sides' of the securities and investments industry are fusing into one, and an increasingly competitive one at that. Joseph Rosen, managing director, Enterprise Technology Corporation, 305 Madison Avenue, Suite 2145, New York, NY 10165, US</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Decision and Order of the Department of Energy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> July 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of Special Refund Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Name of Firm: Telum, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date of Filing: October 7, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Case Number: LEF&hyph;0114  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on October 7, 1993. The petition requests that OHA formulate and implement procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant to a consent order entered into by the DOE and Telum, Inc. (Telum).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Telum was a ``reseller-retailer'' of ``covered products'' as those terms were defined in 6 CFR 150.352 and 10 CFR 212.31. Therefore, Telum was required to price middle distillate fuel in accordance with the price rule of the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations set forth at 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart F, and antecedent regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 150, Subpart L. As a result of an audit, the ERA alleged that Telum and entities under Telum's direction violated the price regulations in sales of middle distillate fuel to Salt River Project (Salt River) during a five month period from December 1, 1973, through April 30, 1974 (the audit period).* The auditors determined that during this period Telum made sales of middle distillates to Salt River at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price (MLSP) permitted by the regulations. Consequently, the ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Telum on May 28, 1980, alleging pricing violations in the sale of middle distillate fuel to Salt River. After revising its selection of the ``nearest comparable outlet'' with regard to the ``new market'' determination under 10 CFR 212.111(b), the ERA issued an Amended PRO on September 15, 1986, alleging that Telum had overcharged Salt River in its sales of middle distillate fuel in the amount of $357,587. On April 7, 1988, that Amended PRO was remanded by OHA to the ERA for a new determination regarding Telum's nearest comparable outlet and a recalculation of MLSPs and any overcharges in sales to Salt River. Telum, Inc., 17 DOE &para;83,010 (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> * <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telum was incorporated as Bonus Oil Company on August 13, 1968. Bonus Oil Company's name was changed to Telum, Inc. effective December 3, 1974. For the purposes of this Decision, we will refer to the firm only as Telum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other entities under Telum's direction, as listed in the consent order, are: Industrial Fuels, Inc., an Arizona Corporation, and Giraud Corporation, a Utah corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The ERA did not issue a second Amended PRO. Instead, on May 30, 1990, the DOE entered into a consent order (No. 820H00020Z) with Telum to resolve all administrative and civil claims related to Telum's compliance with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations in its resale transactions of petroleum products during the period December 1, 1973 through April 30, 1974. Specifically, Telum agreed to remit $60,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. Telum has remitted $56,149.35 to the DOE, consisting of $51,626.18 toward payment of the $60,000 principal amount due and $4,523.17 toward payment of interest due on principal. The DOE has authorized a write-off of the remainder of the amount due for reasons of uncollectability. Telum is no longer in business, and Earl K. Cook, the former president of Telum, has indicated that he is unable to pay the remainder of the amount due. As of June 30, 1994, $9,615 in interest had accrued in the DOE escrow account on the amount paid by Telum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 31, 1994, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order in which we determined that it was appropriate to establish a special refund proceeding with respect to the Telum consent order fund. In that Proposed Decision, we tentatively set forth procedures to distribute a refund to the party that was injured by Telum's alleged pricing violations in sales of middle distillates during the consent order period. Specifically, we proposed that Salt River, the party injured by Telum's alleged pricing violations, be eligible for the entire consent order fund plus accrued interest. The Proposed Decision was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 6, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 29289), and comments on the proposed refund mechanism were to be submitted within 30 days of that date. No comments regarding the Proposed Decision and Order were received. Accordingly, we have determined that the proposed procedures should be adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this Decision and Order is to establish procedures to be used for filing and processing Salt River's claim to a refund in this matter. This Decision sets forth the information that Salt River should submit in order to receive the entire Telum consent order fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

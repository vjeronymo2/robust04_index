			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television It sounds as though strong stomachs will be needed by those watching Sadhus  -India's Holy Men. This week's subject is an Aghori, said to be the most extreme of the lot, and the rarest; there may be as few as 10 in all of India. Hardly surprising, given that they live on the 'burning ghats', Hindu cremation sites, and eat their own excrement as well as the flesh of corpses. Ram Nath, the subject of this programme, is seen hunting for a human skull to use as a bowl for eating, begging and ritual purposes (7.40pm BBC2). Dirty Money is the first in a series of three programmes about the criminal use of electronic fund transfers and offshore havens. Today two women who infiltrated the cocaine cartel, Cali, said to be 'the world's most powerful criminal organisation', with an annual income of Dollars 30bn, (who can contradict such assertions?) report on the methods of the drug suppliers (10.20 BBC1). Completing a jolly trio, ITV begins a five part report on 'Date Rape' in Network First. Three daytime programmes starting tomorrow show the dramatisations of the trial. The final programme is next Tuesday (10.40).</p>

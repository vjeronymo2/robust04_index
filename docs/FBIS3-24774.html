			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The fraudulence of eight of the 58 constituencies  has been established. The results of these eight constituencies  have therefore been canceled. In any case, this is the verdict  handed down at Parliament House this afternoon by the  international arbitral college appointed to look into the  electoral dispute. Now more than ever, Congo is taking the path  of reconciliation to attain durable peace. The salutary  conclusions reached by the interregional parliamentary committee  on peace, which met yesterday, is still reverberating in the  minds of every Congolese.    Out of the 58 cases listed for annulment, eight of them were  judged to be guilty of fraud. The results in these  constituencies have been annulled. Partial elections are to be  organized in accordance with existing regulations. The  following is the list of the constituencies concerned:    The second constituency of Bacongo in Brazzaville, the  second  constituency of (Mosaka), the second constituency of (Abala),  the sole constituency of (Toma), the first constituency of  (Lumumba) in Pointe-Noire, the second constituency of (Deoumi),  the sole Constituency of (Masholoba), and the first constituency  of (Ouende) in Brazzaville.    Everything is now clear. The results of eight constituencies  have been annulled. [passage omitted]</p>

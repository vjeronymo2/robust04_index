			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 10 Jun (NA) -- Defense Minister  Oscar Camilion today indicated that "some figures must still be  adjusted" to carry out President Carlos Menem's order to  eliminate compulsory military service. Camilion noted that it  must still be determined whether the new system "can be  implemented overnight, or whether it requires a process of  adjustment."    Camilion agreed with Lieutenant General Martin Balza, Army  chief of staff, that "no deadline" has been established for  carrying out the presidential order.    Justicialist Party and Radical Civic Union Party legislators  this afternoon supported the president's decision to eliminate  compulsory military service, and stressed that this measure "has  been requested extensively by the whole of Argentine society."    A little over two months ago, the public became engaged in  heavy discussions over whether or not it was appropriate to  maintain the system of compulsory military service, after the  killing of conscript Omar Carrasco at a garrison in the town of  Zapala, Neuquen Province.    Congress became a sounding board for this controversial  issue, as a military service bill that has already been approved  by the Chamber of Deputies is currently being reviewed by the  Senate Defense Committee.    The defense minister made it clear that the decision was  made  by the executive branch, "but Congress will have the last word  in determining a way to replace compulsory military service with  a professional system."    Concerning the deadlines considered by the government for  implementing the measure, the minister pointed out that "there  are no deadlines," but estimated that "a few weeks will be  required."    The defense minister indicated that the project "was  discussed by the cabinet today, and the president believed it  was wise and advisable to announce it publicly."    Concerning the budget issue, Camilion said: "In principle it  is being reviewed, to see if the idea is viable." He added:  "The figures must still be adjusted."    The minister also explained that "no deadlines have been  estimated" for the elimination of compulsory military service,  because it is very important to determine first "whether it can  be implemented overnight or whether it requires an adjustment  process."

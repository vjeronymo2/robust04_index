			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Equal pension age decision delayed A GOVERNMENT decision on equalising male and female state pension ages has been delayed until mid-summer at the earliest. The decision is expected to provoke a political row because millions of women face longer working lives. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is considering postponing the legislation until the parliamentary session beginning in autumn 1994. A decision on a common pension age of 65 had been expected soon after Easter with legislation in the next session. But options have not yet been considered by a cabinet committee and, even if legislation is not delayed further, the planned white paper still seems some way off. Ministers may decide to await the outcome of the European Court of Justice's decision in the Coloroll Pension Trustees' equal pension rights case - expected in July. That case will determine whether equality is required only for pension benefits earned by service since May 17 1990, the date of the 'Barber' judgment, or for benefits which were earned by service before that date. The Barber judgment on equal pay led the government to move towards a common pension age. Currently the state retirement age is 60 for women and 65 for men. Although equalising at 65 has emerged as by far the most likely option, ministers have not formally made a decision. Nor have they agreed on how to use some of the expected Pounds 3bn a year savings from raising the female retirement age - for instance by helping low-income pensioners. One Whitehall insider said: 'What is happening at the moment is a whole lot of cold feet about exactly how we ameliorate the announcement. It is getting that package together that is holding things up.' A decision would not take effect for at least a decade and would probably be phased in.</p>

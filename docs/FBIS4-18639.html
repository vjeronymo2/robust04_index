			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn/Munich (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has  again come out in favor of deporting violent Kurds to their  homeland. "I am not willing to bow to the terror of any group  in the streets of Germany," Kohl said in an interview at his  vacation resort in Bad Hofgastein, Austria, which was  prereleased on Thursday [7 April].    He added that if, in this case, it is the Kurds "who came to  us with Turkish passports," they must be aware of the  consequences. However, deportations may be carried out only to  those countries where it is clearly obvious that "the necessary  points have been ensured from the viewpoint of human rights."    Asked about the reservations by FRG Justice Minister Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic Party of Germany)  against the deportation of Kurds to Turkey, Kohl reportedly  reacted with clear annoyance. "She does not represent in any  way the opinion of the Federal Government in this matter, not to  mention my own." Furthermore, it is not clear at all whether  the minister's statements correspond to the opinion of the Free  Democratic Party of Germany.</p>

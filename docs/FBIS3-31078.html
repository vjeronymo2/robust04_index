			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vladislav Jovanovic, federal minister of foreign  affairs, spoke about the latest NATO threats in the "On the  Spot" program of the Belgrade Radio First Channel today. This  is what he said among other things about the aims of the  ultimatum:    [Begin Jovanovic recording] The present (?Muslim) leadership  in Bosnia-Herzegovina has never been independent. Whenever a  problem regarding Bosnia was being solved, this leadership was  always led by interests and directions from abroad. It is  indebted to these [foreign] factors, considering the huge  support it has been receiving. This support is financial,  moral, and political, and probably there are also ideological  and religious elements which are rarely pointed to although they  lie at the foundation of everything.    Therefore, foreign interests, the interests of certain  factors, have always been not to end a Yugoslav crisis during a  time that they needed to penetrate the Balkan Peninsula deeply  and find firmer and more lasting support for their new strategic  [word indistinct] in the Balkans. Therefore, whenever peace was  in the offing, whenever things looked as if they were virtually  solved, foreign factors intervened with actions of an opposite  nature which was immediately interpreted by the Muslim  leadership as a signal, as a support, almost as an order to turn  their backs on negotiations and peace. They have always acted  accordingly; ranging from Cutilheiro's mission when the Bosnian  crisis was expected to be solved by exclusively political means  and the war was not to take place at all, to various stages of  negotiations. Also in this case, it turned out that a virtual  assassination of a political kind was committed at this renewed  peace process that started from the heart of the crisis, from  Sarajevo, followed with many hopes. This is this ultimatum  which was obviously made with a view to calling on the Muslim  side not to cooperate in the peace process, because why should  it cooperate when it can expect to get much more in 10 days by  air raids and war than it would achieve by peace.

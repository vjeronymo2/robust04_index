			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / People: Pillard adds grist to the mill Larry Pillard, a senior executive at Cargill Corn Milling, has jumped ship to a major competitor, Tate &amp; Lyle's US starch and sweetener subsidiary Staley, as the new president and chief executive officer. He replaces Murray McEwen, a Tate &amp; Lyle director who moved down from Toronto on a temporary basis after the previous Staley boss Doug Lapins resigned in April because he found he was 'not enjoying the job', according to Tate &amp; Lyle. In common with its two other big competitors, ADM and Cargill, Staley is suffering from a cyclical downturn in its principal product, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS); excess capacity combined with weakening demand for soft drinks has placed the two main HFCS buyers Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in a particularly strong position to effect a tight squeeze on prices. Pillard, 45, who has been in corn milling all his business life, joined Cargill in his late teens on the night shift in the laboratories. He has worked his way up to senior vice president, technology/engineering operations of Cargill Corn Milling based in Minneapolis. While he joins at a 'challenging time', according to the company, analysts say that Staley's position is a mark of wider troubles in the industry rather than any management-induced problems. ***** Wilson Berry, general manager, manufacturing and marketing of TEXACO's Europe division, based in New York, is appointed md, manufacturing and marketing of Texaco Ltd, based in London. Robert Solberg, md, exploration and production based in London, is appointed vice-president of Texaco Inc and deputy chairman of Texaco Ltd. Donald Bennett, general manager, asset development for Texaco Ltd, is appointed md, exploration and production. Glenn Tilton, a vice-president of Texaco Inc and chairman of Texaco Ltd, has been appointed president of Texaco Europe. Bill Tierney, md, manufacturing and marketing for Texaco Ltd, has been appointed regional director, Texaco Europe, Mediterranean. ***** The Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest provider of housing finance, has been slower than some of its rivals to move into Europe. However, it may be starting to catch up. In May its members approved a change in its rules to enable it to lend money in the European Community and invest in a finance or insurance company. Now it has strengthened its European team by appointing Mike Ellis (left) as general manager, treasury and European operations. He joins Ian Lumsden, the Halifax's assistant general manager for European operations, who has been monitoring developments on the Continent for some time. Ellis, a former local government official, joined the Halifax five years ago as treasurer. In June 1989, he became group treasurer and he has now been promoted to general manager, treasury and European operations. He is the youngest of the Halifax's general managers and will continue to report to Gren Folwell, the Halifax's finance director, on treasury issues. However, he will report directly to Jim Birrell, the group chief executive, on European matters.</p>

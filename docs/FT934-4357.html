			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Dublin summit revives search for peace plan: Major and Reynolds aim for joint declaration on Ulster after 'frank talks' The British and Irish prime ministers last night revived their stalled Northern Ireland peace initiative with a plan for a joint declaration of principles designed to persuade the IRA to halt its campaign of violence. Nevertheless, intense talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds at the Dublin summit still left the two governments without a detailed formula to bridge the gap between the aspirations of Irish nationalists and Britain's guarantee to Ulster Unionists of a veto over a united Ireland. After what both leaders admitted had been a 'frank' exchange over Britain's contacts this year with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, they acknowledged that it might eventually prove impossible to bridge differences over the future of the province. 'We cannot be certain we will resolve those difficulties,' Mr Major said. He and Mr Reynolds discussed different texts in detail, and said they remained committed to further talks. That raised hopes that a joint statement could be agreed when they meet in Brussels next week or during a session in London pencilled in before Christmas. Balancing the two leaders' caution, Mr Reynolds said: 'We got through quite a lot of very serious work, very productive work.' The Irish prime minister insisted during the talks that agreement on the joint declaration was essential to secure an end to violence by the IRA and set the stage for detailed talks with the political parties in Northern Ireland. He said afterwards: 'At the end of the day, peace is paramount.' It is understood that the draft of the declaration includes a renewed offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations in return for an end to terrorism. Mr Major also refused to dismiss the possibility of further bilateral contacts with Republican leaders. But he insisted that the IRA could not dictate the terms of any agreement. 'There is no question of bargaining for an end to violence,' he said. Earlier Mr Major had faced sharp criticism from Mr Reynolds over the London government's covert contacts with Sinn Fein for much of this year. The Irish leader said their sharp exchanges on the issue had 'cleared the air' and paved the way for further negotiations. At the heart of the day-long talks was an attempt, so far unsuccessful, to find language that would recognise both the right of the Irish people to determine their own future and the insistence of the Ulster Unionists that nothing should be done to undercut Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom. Mr Reynolds repeated his pledge that the Republic accepted that the consent of the Unionist majority was essential to any change in the constitutional status of the province. He confirmed that he wanted referendums in both the north and south of Ireland to endorse any agreement reached by the two governments. Mr Major will now seek to reassure Unionist leaders that he has not agreed anything to undermine Ulster's place in the UK. Mr Reynolds appeared determined to maintain the pressure on Mr Major to agree language that would give the IRA an excuse to call a permanent end to violence. The Irish leader believes that such a cessation could transform the atmosphere in both north and south and pave the way for a durable political settlement.

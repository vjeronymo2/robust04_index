Minister of the Presidency Oscar Santamaria told the press  that "this government is committed to concluding all agreements  by the end of its term." He added that "naturally, some of these  agreements will continue to be implemented beyond that time  because these are scheduled for beyond the period of  transition." He noted that there is not an impasse, but a  dynamic that is appropriate to the peace process, in which there  are some time difficulties, but which are normal within the  complexity of the process."    The government and the former Salvadoran guerrillas signed  more than 100 peace agreements on 16 January 1992 in Mexico,  ending a civil war which had lasted more than 12 years and in  which over 75,000 persons were killed, according to humanitarian  organizations. Santamaria added that "we have not reached any  crisis because we are heading in the right direction  fortunately," although he admitted that "sometimes we are not on  schedule, but despite problems, we are advancing."    Last week before UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali,  the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the former  guerrilla organization now turned political party, claimed there  were several delays in implementing some peace agreements, which  are the responsibility of the government, such as rejoining  civilian life and transfer of land to the former fighters. In  addition, the FMLN thinks the complete development of the new  National Civilian Police (PNC) and the definite dismantling of  the current National Police (PN), which has a military  structure, is another delay in the peace agreements.    For his part, Ghali told the FMLN in New York that he sent  President Alfredo Cristiani a letter asking him to accelerate  the implementation of the issues pending from the peace  agreement. Santamaria insisted that "we are doing this with our  best political will, and we are not going to back out in any way  from our commitment." He also accused the FMLN of not  surrendering all of its weapons yet. Santamaria said the Ghali's  letter is "welcome," and he affirmed that "the government does  not see anything negative in it. On the contrary, it reminds us  that we have agreements pending so that we will not lose the  impetus we are giving the entire implementation."    Santamaria said FMLN representatives went to the United  Nations not because of an alleged crisis in the agreements, but  because they wanted to talk with Ghali about the future of the  peace process following the change of government after the 20  March general elections. The official added that the government  has met with the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) to  coordinate the implementation of the peace agreements, mainly  those related to the former guerrillas rejoining civilian life  and the deployment of the PNC.    Santamaria made these statements after presiding at the  graduation ceremony of a new group of PNC officers who will be  sent to enforce security in various parts of the country where  there are delegations of the new police corps created by the  peace agreements.</p>

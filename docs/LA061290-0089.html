			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: MOSCOW;  </P> <P> CRUCIAL WEEK ON TAP  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is expected to push the government's cautious  plan to open the Soviet economy to market forces before lawmakers today,  kicking off a crucial legislative test for the interim program this week.  </P> <P> Critics on one side say the plan doesn't go far enough, while opponents at the  other extreme condemn it as "creeping capitalism."  </P> <P> If the Supreme Soviet, or legislature, rejects the program, it may lead to the  resignation of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, or at least his main economic  advisers. Gorbachev has already said the rescue plan may have been poorly  presented. He said it is intended to provide a transition period during which a  complex package of more than 30 new economic laws and decrees are prepared.  </P></p>

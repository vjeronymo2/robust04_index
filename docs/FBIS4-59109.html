			<p>BFN     Tripoli, 10 May (JANA) -- JANA's international affairs  editor has asserted that the facts have been reaffirming day in  and day out that the United States is the number one terrorist  state in the world and the most serious threat to world security  and peace.    The editor added that America does not want to see peoples  free; it accuses sovereign countries of terrorism just because  these countries are not under any foreign influence.    He affirmed that the countries which America has accused of  terrorism are the only free states in the world. That is why  these states have been facing U.S. terrorism [words indistinct]  for no other reason than the fact that they have rejected  foreign influence and refused foreign political dictation.    The editor went to say that America is an anti-peace and  tyrannical power. It is behind the destruction and the havoc in  the world by creating and fuelling wars and conflicts and the  acquisition of biological weapons of mass destruction which are  a threat to the world as a whole. It is also the source of  morbid diseases facing the world today, like AIDS, through its  CIA-run laboratories.    The editor affirmed that America is exposed before all  peoples as a state which has been practising state terrorism,  supporting terrorism, and giving refuge to terrorists. It is no  longer possible to fool anyone with American preaching about  terrorism and peace. America is the leader of terrorism and the  number one enemy of peace.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc sets Roussel price RHONE-POULENC, France's flagship state-controlled chemicals company, yesterday announced it was selling its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf, the specialist chemicals concern, for FFr563 a share. The deal values the holding at FFr4.39bn (Dollars 770m), writes Alice Rawsthorn. The sale - intended to raise capital to reduce Rhone-Poulenc's debt before the French government's privatisation programme gets under way in the autumn  -has been divided into a public offer of nearly 3.9m shares in France and an international placing of some 3.9m shares. Some 15 per cent of the international allocation can be clawed back for French investors. Roussel's shares were suspended at FFr575 two weeks ago on the day the deal was announced. The price of the transaction is in line with market expectations. Rhone-Poulenc's own share price yesterday fell FFr14 to FFr571 following the announcement. The sale of the Rhone-Poulenc stake has been expected for some time. The French group acquired the holding in Roussel, best known for its controversial RU-486 abortion pill, in 1990, when France's then socialist government reshuffled its chemicals interests. However, Rhone-Poulenc is now pursuing a strategy of shedding peripheral interests - a category into which most of Roussel's activities fall - and also concentrating on companies where it exercises control. Roussel is controlled by Hoechst, the powerful German chemicals group which owns a 54.5 per cent stake. Rhone-Poulenc is also keen to reduce its net debt, valued at FFr34bn (Dollars 5.96bn) at the end of last year.</p>

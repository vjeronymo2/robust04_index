			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA IS SORE, HIS BEARD IS LOOSE, BUT THE MAGIC HOLDS  </P> <P> Santa Leg Lift, don't fail me now.  </P> <P> I was halfway through my first shift as Santa Claus, sitting in a sparkly  winter forest setting at the center court of a Manhattan Beach mall, when this  5-year-old who looked like he weighed 200 pounds walked up and waited to sit on  my knee.  </P> <P> The boy, named Chad, actually was no bigger than any child his age. Business at  the Santa stand at the Manhattan Village Shopping Center had been brisk on the  Friday after Thanksgiving. Having hoisted 60 other children into my lap, my  back and shoulders ached as though a herd of reindeer had marched across them.  </P> <P> It was time to use the Leg Lift.  </P> <P> The lift is a movement perfected by generations of department store Santas in  an attempt to avoid the back strain that comes from lifting children with their  arms. By extending my left leg and dropping my left knee, I would enable Chad  to sit on it by himself. Then, as I drew my left foot toward me, he would  automatically rise to Santa's lap level.  </P> <P> At least that is how they had explained it at Santa school. Chad had other  ideas.  </P> <P> He started talking excitedly about how I had eaten the cookies and milk he left  for me last Christmas. As he talked, he scooted around to my right leg and  lifted his arms to be picked up.  </P> <P> I was not about to break the magic spell. So I reached out with my white-gloved  hands and lifted Chad to my right knee, grimacing under my beard as we chatted  about chocolate chip cookies and toy trucks and the importance of brushing  teeth and going to bed on time.  </P> <P> There were more than 100 such magical moments during my first four hours as  Santa. I found that the children were nicer than I had expected. Their parents  were kinder. My back was sorer. There was none of the skepticism that I feared  would come when the children looked past my phony beard and into my nervous  eyes.  </P> <P> Four-year-old Amy would not recite her Christmas wish list until she threw her  arms around my padded waist. "I love you, Santa!" she blurted out.  </P> <P> Stern-faced Charles, an 11-month-old who at seemed apprehensive, burst out  laughing after he turned to see that I had a plastic-wrapped candy cane for  him.  </P> <P> A 6-month-old named Connor broke out in tears at his first glimpse of me. His  mother stepped out of line to feed him and he returned a few minutes later with  a contented look. "Connor doesn't talk much yet," said Anne Geiran. "But he  told me what he wants for Christmas is peace in Saudi Arabia."  </P> <P> Adults passing through the mall waved at Santa throughout the day. One kindly  man took his reading glasses out of his shirt pocket and positioned them on the  tip of his nose to alert me that my plain-glass Santa spectacles were pushed  back too far on my face.  </P> <P> Marcus, a boy of about 7, studied and quizzed me closely. "Where are your  reindeer?" he asked, looking around the center court toward the 10 food stands  behind me. Marcus was satisfied when I answered that they were visiting the  zoo. Then he asked how I was getting home. I told him that they were coming  back to the mall Friday night to pick me up.  </P> <P> Marcus seemed to step away a believer.  </P> <P> To my surprise, so did the other kids.  </P> <P> No one yanked on my beard to see if it was real, although a few large children  came close to inadvertently pulling it off my face when they slid from my lap.  Several babies almost did the same thing by grabbing onto it or tangling their  tiny hands in it.  </P> <P> No one noticed that the beard seemed for a time to dance up and down on my face  when I talked. That is because I poked a gob of its hair into my mouth the  first time I tried to discreetly pop a breath mint through it.  </P> <P> My boss, John McGill III, coordinator of mall Santas for Western Temporary  Services, used extra double-faced adhesive tape in hopes of making the beard  stick beneath my nose. It was only partially successful: We decided that I will  shave off my real-life mustache before my next mall assignment.  </P> <P> At the end of my shift, I took my aching back home for a long, steaming shower.  </P> <P> My beard went for a soak in a bath of lukewarm water and Woolite.  </P></p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Asian shares maintain pace Asian stock markets kept up their record-setting pace yesterday as Japanese fund managers, on holiday on Monday, returned to compete with their US counterparts in fuelling the advance. Records were set in nine centres. Bangkok, closed on Monday, led with a 4.2 per cent rise as it caught up with the rest of the region in near-record turnover. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose more than 500 points at one stage before profit-taking trimmed the advance, leaving the index 114.60 higher at 12,201.09. Highs were also seen in Singapore, Manila, Australia, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Bombay and Karachi, which scored its largest ever one-day rise. Tokyo, however, made an uncertain start to its trading year, and investors are expected to remain wary until the government passes its political reform bill and announces details of a new fiscal package at the end of this month. The Nikkei average fell 47.50 to 17,369.74. In Europe, Nordic markets surged with Helsinki adding 4.1 per cent to a record high as falling interest rates persuaded investors to switch from bonds to stocks. Norway jumped 2.1 per cent to a new peak, and records were also set on the Stockholm and Copenhagen stock markets. In London the money supply figures, measured by M0, the most narrow definition of the money supply, rose by a seasonally adjusted 5.8 per cent in the year to December. The news did little to help sentiment in the UK government bond market, where long gilt prices fell by 1 1/4 points. Analysts felt the apparent buoyancy of the consumer sector may have damped hopes of an early cut in UK interest rates. The FT-SE 100 share index, down 38 points at one stage, rallied in the afternoon to close 9.9 points lower at 3,408.5. Market reports, Section II</p>

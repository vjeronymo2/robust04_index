			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / China's ethylene city waits for investors and infrastructure: A look at planning and funding shortfalls at Haicang's ambitious development project HALF an hour's drive from China's special economic zone of Xiamen City is one of the largest infrastructure developments on the mainland's eastern seaboard. Haicang, which planners say will cost Rmb5bn (Pounds 578m) to complete, is being hailed as China's 'ethylene city', with plans for deep-water berths to unload oil and for factories to convert it into a host of downstream plastics and chemicals. The first apartment blocks are finished, mainly to house farmers dislodged by site flattening. New roads are nearly ready to be tarmaced, and will relieve the existing dusty track, which groans under the weight of construction vehicles and residents taking produce to market. Despite the activity, Haicang may become famous as a planners' folly. Designed to attract foreign petrochemical companies, none have yet arrived. In 1990, Mr Wang Yung-ching, the chairman of Formosa, Taiwan's largest plastics company, announced he would build a naphtha cracker in Haicang. China, and some foreign observers, assumed much of Taiwan's downstream plastics industry would follow. But Mr Wang was blocked by political pressure from Taiwan's government. There are now rumours he is looking elsewhere in China. Mr Xie Tingmu, a Haicang official, said foreign investors will come, but only when the infrastructure is ready. 'Haicang is an objective necessity. It will continue with or without foreign investors,' he said. Whatever Haicang's fate, it neatly illustrates the difficulties faced by China in co-ordinating rapid economic coastal growth with its infrastructure. While Haicang runs before it can walk, the area's ports, roads and telecommunications limp along behind, unable to keep pace with double digit economic growth. Xiamen's port is operating above capacity. Some foreign companies now send goods by land to Hong Kong, even though it costs about 30 per cent more. Roads inland and up the coast are often poor and so choked that progress is very slow. Due to the influx of foreign businessmen seeking cheap land and labour, flights to Hong Kong are booked months in advance and long distance telephone lines are engaged by mid afternoon. Xiamen's port is being expanded and by the end of next year capacity will increase to 9.5m tonnes from 6m tonnes. Following growth in container trade, which expanded 6 per cent in terms of tonnage and 66 per cent in containers handled last year, capacity is set to quadruple to 400,000 containers a year. A further development plan, which according to Mr Lin Zhongqi of Xiamen's harbour bureau has won 'oral' but not yet official approval from China's State Council, will take capacity to 1m containers a year by the end of the century. A Rmb260m, three-year expansion of the city's airport is under way and will lift passenger capacity to 5m, up from this year's forecast of 2m. Also, the runway is being extended to cater for Boeing 747s. Xiamen's Posts and Telecommunications Bureau has spent Rmb120m increasing the number of local lines five times to 50,000 and long distance lines six times to 2,000. The bureau now aims to at least double local lines by 1994, according to Mr Li Zhenqun, the bureau director. But these improvements barely seem able to keep pace with demand. Once the port is improved, road traffic will again switch back to using containers. Mr Li said as soon as new phone lines are installed they are overloaded. Most of the money for these projects has been provided by the central and local governments, although the port expansion has been partly financed by a Dollars 36m long term, low-interest World Bank loan. Kuwait provided Dollars 18m of low-interest loans towards the airport and Japanese government loans have helped buy telephone equipment. But central government funding is becoming more difficult to obtain, mainly because Beijing's bailing out of lossmaking state industries has led to a budget deficit. Xiamen is also having to compete for funding and low-interest loans with other coastal areas, especially the Pudong development in Shanghai. Xiamen officials said they will increasingly have to seek new sources of funds. Following the example set by Guangdong, where Hong Kong businessmen have built roads and power stations, Fujian is also now courting foreign investors for infrastructure projects. So far the results have been small in comparison with Guangdong, but are encouraging nonetheless. Fujian's drawback is that although Taiwanese investors, who have language and often family ties with the province, are investing in processing industries, they have not targeted infrastructure. Such projects are probably seen as too risky because of Taiwan's continuing rift with China and the lack of investor protection agreements between the two sides. Possibly the most ambitious project being considered is a 'bullet train' from Xiamen to the provincial capital Fuzhou. Japan's Ikawa Trust is conducting a feasibility study on the Dollars 2bn project. If built, it would reduce travel time between the two cities to one hour. At present it takes six and a half gruelling hours by car along unpredictable roads. Hong Kong investors have taken a 30 per cent stake, worth Rmb600m, in a 1.2m KW coal-fired power station being built near Xiamen. Another Hong Kong company has become the first foreigner to invest in Chinese port ownership, rather than management, with a 80 per cent stake in a Rmb200m berth in the city's port. Earlier this year a Chinese Malaysian investor exchanged contracts to build a 40 km highway from Xiamen to the inland city of Zhangzhou, which would greatly improve communications away from the coast. But the investor is now being investigated by Hong Kong securities officials, and the project is in doubt. Western observers say Fujian's slower economic growth means it does not yet share Guangdong's power shortage problems but in other respects it is lagging behind. What Fujian needs, they say, is a large-scale infrastructure investment like that made by Mr Gordon Wu with his 'super highway' north from Shenzhen. As construction continues at Haicang, Xiamen officials are left to wonder if, and when, Mr Wang is their man.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Applause for festive initiative Sir, Bah and humbug Mr Harris] Clay Harris's debunking of Leeds Development Corporation's Christmas card in his entertaining article ('The folly and the lively', December 23) on corporate greetings cards missed the point. 'We'll give you something to toast this Christmas' is, indeed, the promise, followed by 'Great deals on land in Leeds. Prime sites at realistic prices.' In the climate of the Pounds 50bn budget deficit, the Financial Times of all newspapers should surely be applauding a development corporation that is not missing any opportunity to entice money into the public coffers. Anyone wanting to buy land in the capital of the north, do give me a ring on 0836 729700. Stuart Kenny, director of development and marketing, Leeds Development Corporation, South Point, South Accommodation Road, Leeds LS10 1PP</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTS &amp; CULTURE ON THE PACIFIC RIM;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> NEW ZEALAND DIRECTOR'S MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION  </P> <P> Vincent Ward's first film, shot at art school, called for a naked man to run  across a semifrozen lake.  </P> <P> No one in the conservative city of Christchurch would agree to his odd request,  so Ward ended up stripping down and doing the job himself.  </P> <P> It's a story Ward likes to tell, and it illustrates several qualities about  this tenacious New Zealand director.  </P> <P> It shows, he says, how we learned to make films -- "literally by jumping in and  getting my feet wet; by falling down on my face and trying again."  </P> <P> But it also gives an early hint at the extraordinary lengths to which Ward will  go to get what he wants, and the considerable aura that has grown around his  refusal to compromise that vision.  </P> <P> At 32, he is now firmly cast as the "anti-podean Herzog." His films bear the  unmistakable hallmark of a grand quest and, like the indomitable West German  director, he attracts a loyal band of followers.  </P> <P> In New Zealand, his work and his working methods are regarded as obsessive. It  is a term Ward rejects, but one that has followed him to Australia, where he is  now based.  </P> <P> "It's not a particularly complimentary phrase, is it?" he asks, "I might have  fallen into that category once, but now I'd like to think my approach is a bit  more low-key. I just don't see any point in doing something unless you put  everything you have into it."  </P> <P> In the 13 years since Ward's icy plunge into film-making, he has put his all  into just two feature-length productions and two award-winning short films.  </P> <P> Despite this slender output, he has developed an increasingly international  profile, as each film's release reinforces the presence of a startingly fresh  style and vision operating Down Under.  </P> <P> His films have not generated much box office in America, but recognition has  come from the international festival and art-house circuits.  </P> <P> Ward's first film, the 50-minute psychological drama "A Stage of Siege," won  awards at the 1978 Chicago Film Festival (a Golden Hugo) and the Miami Film  Festival (Special Jury Prize).  </P> <P> Then his 2 1/2-year odyssey into the remote Urewera ranges (living with an  82-year-old Maori woman and her 40-year-old paranoid schizophrenic son),  resulted in "In Spring One Plants Alone," a haunting documentary that was Grand  Prix co-winner at the 1982 Cinema du Reel and a Silver Hugo winner at the  Chicago Film Festival.  </P> <P> Both his feature films, "Vigil" and "The Navigator," have been selected in  competition at the Cannes Film Festival, a rare double achievement in the  festival's 41-year history.  </P> <P> But similar success seemed to elude him at home. As his producer John Maynard  states: "In France, Ward is seen as an auteur director, but in Australia he was  seen as self-indulgent, and in New Zealand he wasn't seen at all."  </P> <P> However, Ward's latest film, "The Navigator," is crossing over some of those  previously defined boundaries.  </P> <P> The film scooped six Australian Film Awards last year, including best film,  best director, best cinematography and best editing, and its box-office success  in Australia and New Zealand has opened up a whole new audience for Ward's  work.  </P> <P> Released in New Zealand's five main centers last month, its per-screen average  in the first week was $20,000 New Zealand (about $13,000 U.S.), placing it just  behind Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Red Heat" as the country's top-grossing movie.  Its dream run was then halted by the release here of "The Accidental Tourist."  </P> <P> "The Navigator," subtitled "An Odyssey Through Time," concerns a pilgrimage by  a group of 14th-Century English miners who believe they can save their village  from the advancing Black Death by erecting a cross on top of the "highest  church in Christendom," on the other side of the world.  </P> <P> Led by a 9-year-old visionary boy called Griffin, they tunnel through the  Earth, emerging into glittering 20th-Century New Zealand, and the "celestial  city" of Auckland, 1988.  </P> <P> The bold leap in time is made without any of the convenient time-travel devices  seen in films like "Back to the Future." Ward moves between stark black and  white for Cumbria, 1348, and deep, foreboding color in the 20th Century.  </P> <P> "I prefer to tell a story visually as much as possible," he says, "That is the  art of film making and what makes it interesting.  </P> <P> "If you want dialogue or easy answers, listen to a radio play or watch TV. Film  is visual. I try constantly to whittle away unnecessary dialogue and overt  explanation."  </P> <P> Yet the juxtaposition of the 14th and 20th centuries has a meaning in the film  that is all too clear.  </P> <P> The Black Death has its modern-day counterpart in AIDS, and Ward compares the  Cumbrian village (an isolated pocket untouched by the plague) to New Zealand  with its "courageous or foolhardy" anti-nuclear stance.  </P> <P> "Most of New Zealand is Celtic in origin," says Ward, "I liked the idea of what  our distant ancestors would make of us if they came to visit one dark night.  Normally we film stories about he past which are implicitly judging the past. I  wanted the film to be from their perspective -- they are judging us, and we see  our century through medieval eyes."  </P> <P> Ward is a fourth-generation New Zealander, from a long line of farmers who  worked the land by hand, shaping it through sheer hard work.  </P> <P> "I was a hunter and a possum trapper," he says proudly. "And I trained in  amateur wrestling and boxing (before concussion put an end to all contact  sports)."  </P> <P> At art school, he originally intended being a painter or sculptor. Yet when  film critics talk about his art, Ward cringes, preferring, if pressed, to  describe it as craft.  </P> <P> "For me the important thing is working and making things. If I was a carpenter  or a sculptor, I'd be just as happy. The act of creating is a very physical  process . . . I identify very strongly with the miners in The Navigator."  </P></p>

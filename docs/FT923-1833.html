			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Oui, . . . mais TECHNICALLY, THE French electorate has ratified the Maastricht treaty. In reality, it has saved the European Community. The treaty in the precise form that it was signed last February is almost certainly already past saving. The task now facing European leaders is, first, to decide how much they really want to save and, second, to devise a way of doing it. Ironically enough, that is what many of those advocating rejection of the treaty, in France and elsewhere, have said they want to happen. But had the majority of French voters taken their advice the chances of saving anything would have been much less. Not only would the treaty itself have been junked wholesale: many of the EC's earlier achievements, if not its very existence, might have been jeopardised, in an atmosphere of which last week's recriminations gave an unpleasant foretaste. The treaty as it stands is past saving for several reasons. First, the Danes have already rejected it. They show no sign of changing their mind, and even if they do so it may not be possible for them to vote again on an unaltered text. Second, the forced departure of Britain and Italy from the exchange rate mechanism has shown that the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union are most unlikely to be met by more than at most an inner core of north-central European countries. Third, in the course of the referendum campaign France's leaders have said things, both about Germany and about the purpose of Emu, which have strengthened the rapidly growing misgivings in Germany about the whole project. Public opinion All year, but especially since the Danish vote on June 2, a revolt of public opinion has been apparent throughout Europe. Not one of the 12 governments in the EC could now claim to have gained popularity or authority since signing the treaty; nearly all of them have lost both. Greatest of all, perhaps, has been the loss for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government in Germany, whose promises that no one would be worse off for reunification have been revealed, at least in the short term, as cruelly false. The authority that enabled Mr Kohl, a year ago, to impose a timetable for Emu on a clearly reluctant Bundesbank is simply not there any more. The Yes vote in France accords these 12 discredited leaders a breathing space. But for one of them, Mr John Major, it makes a desperately difficult domestic situation even more difficult. He cannot now put the whole Maastricht episode behind him, as he must privately have hoped to do. Instead he has to continue defending, before a deeply sceptical audience, a platform from which the central plank - Britain's ERM membership - has already been knocked out. And yet it is to him, as current president, that falls the immediate task of convening his fellow heads of government to search for a new way forward. Common interests Mr Major has done the right thing in calling a summit, but its agenda cannot be simply the ratification or implementation of Maastricht. The heads of government should agree to put that on one side for the moment, and proceed as their predecessors did 42 years ago under the guidance of Jean Monnet. Rather than seeking to score national points at each other's expense, they must consider what they believe to be the interests that all of them have in common. It should not be too difficult for them to agree that all want to see the single market become a reality. If that were achieved, many of the monetary tensions felt so painfully this year could be reduced, since economic conditions in one part of the market would work through into other parts more swiftly, and so monetary policies required in one member would be less inappropriate for the rest. They might also agree that it is politically unhealthy for the monetary policies of all member states to be dictated, in practice, by the national authorities of one of them. At least the question could be put in that form to the Germans and, if they did agree, they could be asked to help devise a system which would avoid that, whether or not it was intended to bring about a single currency at the end of the day. And the 12 could surely agree that they all want to see a community or union which interferes as little as possible in the internal affairs of its members, but defends their common interests effectively vis-a-vis the outside world, under democratic supervision. They would, perhaps, end up producing a treaty not unlike Maastricht, but simpler, more coherent, and above all easier for the peoples of Europe to understand and accept. Meanwhile, there is plenty of work for them to get on with, notably in completing the Uruguay round and in offering more effective support to central and eastern Europe, before other countries of that region follow Yugoslavia into the abyss.</p>

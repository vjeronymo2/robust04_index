			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An important event took place in Bishkek today. The  presidents of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan signed a number of  documents defining the prospects for the further development of  bilateral economic relations. Our correspondent says that the  agreement on Kyrgyzstan joining the bilateral agreement between  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on setting up a single economic space  is the main one. Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev had the  following comments:    [Begin Akayev recording] This is what our people, our whole  region, needs. I think that it is a very bold step which may  serve as the start button for getting an economic union to work  on the scale of the whole CIS. I would like to stress once  again that this is not a regional separation today. I think  that this is happening thanks to decisive actions by Presidents  Karimov and Nazarbayev. Today we formed a major economic union.  That is, first of all, a single economic space in trade.  Second, a single economic space envisages (?a unitarian) policy  in the sphere of currency, in the sphere of taxation, in the  sphere of pricing and in the sphere of investments. You can  imagine what this means -- that now, we three states will agree  all these questions. I think that this, to a certain extent, is  the first historic step on the path from talks to concrete  deeds. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> THE SIDE EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA  </P> <P> There is good news and bad news about marijuana. The good news, according to  microbiologist Gerald Lancz of the University of South Florida in Tampa, is  that the primary active component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC,  can interfere with herpes viruses, such as those that cause genital herpes and  some types of birth defects.  </P> <P> THC binds to the external membrane of the herpes viruses and prevents them from  attaching to cells, so that the cells do not become infected. Lancz cautioned  that smoking marijuana would probably not produce a high-enough concentration  of THC in the blood to affect a herpes infection, but he predicted that the  discovery might lead to new types of anti-herpes drugs.  </P> <P> In a separate study, however, microbiologists Steven Specter and Kirk Trisler  of the University of South Florida found that THC suppresses the normal growth  of disease-fighting white blood cells and disrupts their ability to kill tumor  cells. "The findings suggest that people who smoke marijuana have the potential  for altered cellular immunity, and their ability to fight infection and/or  cancer may be suppressed," Trisler said.  </P></p>

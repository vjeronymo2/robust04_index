			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MARIA CASALE GIVES HARP RECITAL AT USC  </P> <P> Sometimes it's easy to take for granted an outstanding performance when  confidence and control are second nature to a musician. Yet when harpist Maria  Casale breezed through her recital Sunday evening in Hancock Auditorium at USC,  few in the audience -- many harpists themselves -- doubted that they were  hearing anything less than musicianship of the highest quality.  </P> <P> Sponsored by the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Harp Society, the event  consisted of a collection of showy pieces of moderate length, most from the  Romantic era. In each, the Juilliard-trained virtuoso demonstrated her  comprehensive technique and commanding, vigorous style.  </P> <P> Although none of the technically challenging works could be considered a major  undertaking, the Sonata in G by C.P.E. Bach proved especially provocative. The  Classical style presented few problems for Casale, who shaped each phrase  expertly, stressing simplicity.  </P> <P> An Impromptu by Albert Roussel in a quirky, early 20th-Century style gave  Casale a different type of challenge, which she met authoritatively. A  multifarious fabric of dissonances and complex textures also made Bernard  Andres' impressionist "Absidioles" pleasing.  </P> <P> Transcriptions of music by Respighi, Albeniz and Falla by Casale's teacher  Susann McDonald and eminent harpist Marcel Grandjany similarly tested her  prevailing virtuosity.GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

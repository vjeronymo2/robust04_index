A particular insidiousness of the severe infection  is that it cannot be diagnosed by the conventional methods.    Cholera is a truly terrifying disease because of the  lightning speed with which it spreads. Fifteen to twenty five  days elapse before the onset of typhoid fever. Cholera does not  allow man to mobilize resources and nip the infection in the  bud. All too often its incubation period lasts only a matter of  hours. A day or a couple of days pass, and an infected person  dies if he does not receive qualified aid. Neither do preventive  inoculations help being next to useless and, so, they are rarely  resorted to by medics.    Cholera continues its triumphal march across the planet and  it takes root even in states it never visited before. Up to  70,000 cases of cholera were registered worldwide in 1988-1990.  In 1992-1993 they topped the million mark with thousands of  fatalities. Russia is no exception in this regard. Last years  six Russians were cured of cholera. This year there were 20 such  ``Russian'' cases and two foreigners, but one patient in Moscow  succumbed to the disease.    ``It is a sheer miracle that the infection has not erupted  anywhere yet,'' says the Rostov Regional Centre of the  Sanitary-and-Epidemiological Inspectorate Deputy Chief Doctor  Gennady Aidinov. Wars, refugees left to their devices, the  ``tentative'' Russian borders with a virtually total absence of  sanitary control, an influx of illegal migrants from the Middle  East and Asian countries, a multitude of lice-ridden homeless  tramps and unemployable provide breeding grounds for almost any  infection! Further, there is street trade, overflowing with  filth and garbage and other waste, and dealing in worthless and  substandard wares. And an appalling quality of drinking water...    It is perhaps the hand of God that an uncommon variety of  cholera erupted precisely in Rostov. For a long time we heard  virtually nothing about infection cases, infectious diseases  were a closely-guarded state secret; even in service  correspondence the plague was disguised as ``form 100'' whereas  cholera was styled as ``form thirty.'' If the authorities were  compelled to admit anything in this respect they did it through  clenched teeth.    Rostov is traditionally a cholera-visited region. How should  one behave in an emergency situation? Even an isolated case of  this disease is an emergency. Moscow should be informed  forthwith of every case and the WHO should be notified within  twenty-four hours. The local epidemiologists know ``their''  disease not from books. There is a State Plague Research  Institute in Rostov, the leading institution of this kind in  the country, it is also concerned with cholera. Should a person  succumb to cholera somewhere in a Russian hinterland, and not  here, the local doctors might even fail to diagnose the case. It  is fearsome to contemplate the consequences.    The uncommon cholera variety was ``delivered'' to Russia by  plane. And in future it will also more likely than not find its  way here by air. Remember how many international airports we had  in Russia only a few years back. We had the airports of  Sheremetyevo-2, Pulkovo and Khabarovsk, perhaps. Now there are  no fewer than fifty and their number is growing. Our traders and  merchants have been shuttling to and from places and locations  where they can buy cheaper merchandise. That those places and  locations are often infection-ridden is a matter of little  significance to them. The sanitary services have been lagging  behind Aeroflot flights catastrophically.    Regular flights to foreign countries from the Rostov airport  were started six years ago, whereas a sanitation control centre  is only being organized today. The chief of the local air fleet  buckled under to the sanitary doctor (Lyudmila Prilutskaya  heading the North Caucasus centre for sanitary-epidemiological  inspection) and allocated the requisite funds. But before long  the planes will start flying to foreign countries from eleven  cities in this country, and then the charm exerted by  Prilutskaya will be powerless.    ``True, sanitary control centres are being set up and  financed in a rather haphazard way,'' they heaved a sigh in the  State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Control. ``But  we intend to set up 410 such outfits in our airports, on the  seas, rivers and on railways, and we request 28 billion roubles  for this.''    That the amount will be received from the scanty state  treasury is not an accepted fact yet. The program is to be  implemented by the year 1997 but how can we explain to cholera  that it should refrain from visiting us until then?    ``We shall not be able to prevent cholera visits by air of  course,'' they nodded their understanding at the State Committee  for Sanitary and Epidemiological Control. The main thing is to  prevent the spread of the infection.''</p>

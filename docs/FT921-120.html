			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Gloomy skies broken by sun over Mexico Sentiment was depressed last week in most of the markets covered in the FT-Actuaries World Indices, with Mexico the sole bright spot. The cheerless mood was again emphasised on Friday as the Nikkei average sank to its lowest close for five years and there was talk on Wall Street that some institutions were switching out of equities and into bonds. The world index fell 1.3 per cent on the week. European bourses failed to shake off the gloom, with Italy particularly under a cloud. Poor banking results, fears of a devaluation of the lira and a decline in fiscal revenues drove the market down. On Thursday the Comit index set a new closing low for the year, and throughout the week turnover remained undemanding. One analyst described the Italian market as 'totally lethargic', with the general election to be held on April 5 adding to the uncertainty. Scandinavia caught the chill, as an absence of foreign interest was clearly felt. Finland and Denmark were the worst hit. Mr Peter Bradshaw, Scandinavian analyst at Robert Fleming, said Finland had been affected by three factors: the raising of stamp duty on share dealings, expected in July; an increase in interest rates; and the downgrading of debt of the country's three main banks by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. He added that the losses of Pohjola, the insurance group, were worse than expected. A slide in shipping rates and weakness in the oil market also weighed on Scandinavian markets. Denmark was further undermined by political instability which emerged last week. Mexico's positive tone continued - in spite of a correction on Friday - as sentiment remained strong ahead of the share offering by Celmex. Analysts report that the sound macro-economic outlook and high demand by foreign institutions for Mexican paper were driving equities higher.</p>

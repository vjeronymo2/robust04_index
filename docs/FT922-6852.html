			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Teacher vacancies well down THE NUMBER of teacher vacancies in England is sharply down on last year according to government figures released yesterday. The overall vacancy rate has fallen by nearly two thirds since last year - from 1.5 per cent of all posts to 0.6 per cent - taking the number of unfilled posts to 1,955. Overall teacher numbers are slightly up at 394,000. The altered trend is particularly marked in London, where the vacancy rate has fallen to 1 per cent, its lowest since 1988 - and the lowest for secondary schools since 1984. Vacancies in science subjects fell by two thirds, but the decline in other shortage subjects was below par. Maths vacancies were down by half, and unfilled posts in modern languages declined by only a third. High levels of graduate unemployment account partly for the renewed attraction of teaching, but substantial real pay increases in the past two years, and promotion and bursary schemes to attract students in shortage subjects, may also have made an impact. Lady Blatch, schools minister, said: 'Any lingering claims that the national curriculum cannot be delivered in full because of teacher shortages should now fade away.'</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strength in P&amp;O Reports that P&amp;O was among a consortium intending to raise container rates on its eastern shipping routes helped the shares rise sharply in useful turnover of 4m. They closed 23 ahead at 565p. According to the reports, the consortium is to push up rates by 20 per cent, which would have a big impact on P&amp;O's balance sheet. Last year, the group made Pounds 36m profits from its container and bulk shipping interests. However, transport analysts tended to be sceptical, pointing out that the consortium had made attempts before to harden rates. 'None of the price rises ever stick,' commented one specialist.</p>

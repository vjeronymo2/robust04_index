			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel Ramos with local </F> and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila --  live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ramos] I have signed  Executive Order [EO] No. 160 today, entitled: Reducing the  Special Duties of Crude Oil and Oil Products Prescribed in  Executive Order No. 115, Series of 1993.    Whereas, EO No. 115, dated 24 July 1993, was issued to raise  much-needed revenues to finance government infrastructure  projects and social services programs; and,    Whereas, the legislative and the executive departments have  identified legislative and executive measures to replace the oil  levy under EO No. 115.    Now, therefore, I, Fidel V. Ramos, president of the Republic  of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the  Constitution, and the authority granted to me under Section 401  of Presidential Decree No. 1464 as amended, do hereby order or  ordain:    Section 1: Reduction of the special duty. The P [Philippine  pesos] 1.90 special duty on imported crude oil falling under HS  [expansion unknown] Heading No. 27.09, and the P2.00 special  duty on imported oil products falling under HS Heading No. 27.10  and 27.11, prescribed under EO No. 115 Series of 1993 and listed  in Annex A thereof, are hereby reduced by P0.95 and P1.00 per  liter, respectively, effective 1 January 1994.    Section 2: Repealing clause. All executive orders, rules,  and regulations inconsistent with this executive order are  hereby modified, amended, or repealed accordingly.    This executive order shall take effect after 30 days  following the completion of its publication in two national  newspapers of general circulation.    Done in the city of Manila, this 23d day of February, in the  year of our Lord, 1994. Signed Fidel V. Ramos, by the  president, Teofisto Guingona, executive secretary.    In effect, this lifts the P1.00 levy. And my statement in  connection with this decision is as follows:    I have decided today to lift the P1.00 oil levy effective 1  January 1994. I make this momentous decision in consideration  of the plight of our people; their welfare has the top priority  in our programs of government. But I also want to tell you that  this decision challenges all of us to exert extraordinary  individual and national effort to overcome our recurring  resources problems for good. Progress and development have a  cost to be paid. When the family budget for business is  reduced, the business suffers before fresh funds come in to  replenish -- and so it is with our national development.    According to our best estimates, the lifting of the P1.00  levy will mean the delay of vital projects that could have  generated 100,000 jobs, the deferment of the construction of  some 5,000 schoolhouses, and the possible cancellation of some  other vital infrastructure projects. But we can make do without  the P1.00 levy as long as recurring alternative sources of  revenue come in.    This decision also challenges us to strengthen our  solidarity, for the real adversaries are poverty and injustice.  And in the long run, what is paramount is that we lift the  lives of our people so that they will have more job  opportunities, better education, and a more healthful condition.    The seeds of increased unity have already been manifested in  the wake of this urgency. We joined hands to address the  problems of the day: The joint government-KRB [Kilusang  Rollback -- Rollback Movement] committee working together in a  genuine spirit of harmony despite differences; the executive and  the legislative dialoguing patiently; the House and the Senate  cooperating to enact needed measures; the businessmen and basic  sectors helping each other; the NGO's [nongovernmental  organizations] and government working hand-in-hand. So, let us  continue this spirit of teamwork as we fight poverty and rebuild  our beloved Philippines.    Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] By lifting, Sir, the P1.00 oil  levy, does that mean that you have already chosen the  recommendations of the joint committee as to what sourcing you  will get the replacement for this oil levy?    [Ramos] Yes, actually, we did not adopt everything in toto  because there were other inputs that were derived from our  patient, almost day-to-day dialogues with the Senate and the  House, as well as other inputs coming from the public at large,  because we also entertained them. And as we work on the  combination of inputs during the last three days, we came out  with the solution.    Insofar as the joint recommendation of the joint committee  --  which was submitted by Secretary Guingona together with Senator  Herrera, who are the joint co-chairpersons -- the following  items were inputted into the so-called alternative sources: The  reduction by 5 percent in government maintenance, operating, and  other expenses without impairing social services; the generation  of revenues by executive action under the so-called alien  legalization effort; the increase in the stock transaction tax;  the increase in the annual registration of luxury vehicles and  recreational vehicles and the like; a tariff on non-essential  items, or so-called zero- tariff items; as well as the  correction in the tax exemption of married couples.    These were among the common recommendations of various  sources -- including the joint government-KRB committee -- and  also arising out of our meetings with the Senate and the House.    [Unidentified correspondent] Will this be enough? The  amount, Sir -- will this be enough to cover the P10.5 billion?    [Ramos] As I mentioned in my statement, we can make do  without the levy and recover some of the delays and setbacks in  terms of still meeting the deadlines by the end of the year if  the recurring alternative means will come in. That is why there  are both executive actions which are one-time as well as  recurrent and there are legislative measures that would ensure  the recurrence of alternative sources of revenue.    I will not mention anymore the other one-time sources,  because these were inputted in the consideration of the 1994  proposed budget, such as privatization.    [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Sir.    [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Now that you announced the lifting of the oil levy, does this  mean that a permanent oil price rollback is certain already?    [Ramos] Yes, that comes automatically. We will go back to  the previous price levels.    [Unidentified correspondent] And that is effective when,  Sir?    [Ramos] Pardon?    [Unidentified correspondent] That is effective today?    [Ramos] Well, in other words, we go back to the levels of  28 January. Yeah, of course -- effective right now.    [Unidentified correspondent] So, now that, uh...    [Ramos, interrupting] That there will be no second wave,  as some were speculating. [Word indistinct] it is the lifting  of the one peso levy.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, can you give us your  reaction to the threats of militant labor groups who are against  the tax measures proposed by the joint committee? They still  feel that this will burden the poor and still threaten to stage  protest actions towards the end of the month and on 1 March.    [Ramos] The proposed tax measures are very progressive.  For instance, the tax on luxury cars and the so-called affluent  consumption. There's also one item I forgot to mention, because  this came out of in a recent initiative, and this is the  broadening of the value-added tax. Again, this is a progressive  measure in that it is not intended to burden the lower classes.    [Unidentified correspondent] Okay. Thank you, Sir.    [Ramos] Now, on the aspect of militant groups wanting to  demonstrate. I have been a demonstrator and rallyist myself  during the EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] revolution of  1986. So we can be comfortable with that, and we will know how  to handle it peacefully. [passage omitted]</p>

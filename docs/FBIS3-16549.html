			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valentin Rudenko: "Russia Has Not Lost Its </F> Markets, `Rosvooruzheniye' General Director Viktor Samoylov  Believes"]    [Text] As we have already reported, the "Rosvooruzheniye"  State Arms and Military Hardware Import-Export Company was set  up last November in accordance with the Russian president's  edict on the basis of the "Oboroneksport" All-Russia  Association, the "Spetsvneshtekhnika" State Company, and the  Main Administration for Cooperation and Production Sharing. The  new company has now held its launch.    What prompted the president and the government to embark on  the centralization of military-technical cooperation and to  concentrate the entire Russian arms trade virtually in one pair  of hands? First and foremost, of course, the desire to establish  -- as is generally accepted in the entire civilized world -- a  strict state monopoly on the export of weapons and military  hardware. It is no secret that a situation had come about of  late whereby state specialist exporters, in an attempt by hook  or by crook to win the right to conclude contracts, were  competing with each other in the foreign market and duplicating  each other -- which, with a single producer, inevitably led to a  dissipation of effort and dumping prices. For instance, five  Russian specialist arms exporters tendered for a 1992 munitions  delivery to India. They were all offering products from the  same plant. As a result, the unit cost of the ammunition was  knocked down from $700 to $450.    Or take the following example: In the space of a single year  the Malaysian and Bangladesh defense ministers were visited by  representatives of 24 Russian firms, who unanimously stated that  they had exclusive rights to sell our weapons.    With the formation of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company,  which is directly subordinate to the Russian president, the  situation will change fundamentally for the better. Now all our  foreign partners will have a clear idea of with whom they are  dealing.    As for the weapons manufacturers, in the opinion of  "Rosvooruzheniye" General Director Viktor Samoylov, their rights  will in no way be infringed upon. As before, all major Russian  defense enterprises will actively participate in foreign  economic activity. Only the producers can determine what each  country needs, what modifications to the weapons need to be made  for each country, how best to organize servicing, and so forth.  The state company intends to act as a representative, providing  state monitoring, helping to process documentation, and so forth.    At a meeting with journalists, Viktor Samoylov stated quite  definitely that Russia has not lost its traditional markets at  present. The process of incorporating "Rosvooruzheniye" into  the market has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and  this has meant that it has been able to ensure complete  continuity and to maintain all the links which the  "Oboroneksport" All-Russia Association, the "Spetsvneshtekhnika"  State Company, and the Main Administration for Cooperation and  Production Sharing previously had.    According to forecasts from "Rosvooruzheniye" specialists,  this year there is every reason to expect an increase rather  than a reduction in the volume of military-technical  cooperation. Not least in markets that are new to Russia. The  company intends to take an important step in this direction at  the FIDAE '94 airshow, which opens in Chile Sunday. In the  opinion of Pavel Trishin, deputy general director of the  "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, our display at the exhibition  will stand out from all the others to our advantage.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Sea Transport Department might soon  submit to the government a proposal on the introduction of  strict quotas on the transportation of Russian oil by Russian  tankers.    A spokesman for the department Dmitriy Kokorin said that at  the end of last month the leadership of the country's only  tanker fleet Novoship (Novorossiisk) asked the department and  the State Oil Company Nafta to give priority to Russian tankers  in transporting export oil.    Novoship and the department account the steady decline in  the  share of export cargoes transported by Russian tankers to the  fact that most oil contracts between Russian exporters and  foreign customers are on FOB (free on board) terms.    Under such contracts exporters deliver oil to the port of  dispatch while the importer is responsible for the rest of the  transportation. At the moment most Western oil importers are  using their own tanker fleets while Novoship tankers are  standing idle.    Novoship has 45 tankers with a combined payload of 2.1  million tons, 16 oil and ore ships with a payload of 1.4 million  tons and 5 oil and ore ships working for the Russian-Norwegian  shipping line Novoklav.</p>

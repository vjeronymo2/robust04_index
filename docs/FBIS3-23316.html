An internal BKA report quotes a strategy paper by "Red  Zora."  It announces "illegal militant organizing" to "destroy  patriarchal power."    In a 38-page underground brochure entitled "Mili's Dance on  the Ice," "Red Zora," which went underground in August 1988, is  now again calling for attacks and punishment actions against  persons and institutions that it holds responsible for the  oppression of women, as the BKA analysis says.    In 1978, "Red Zora" attracted attention for the first time  with attacks on sex shops. In 1984, there followed attacks on  genetic laboratories and the Federal Constitutional Court.    In 1987, "Red Zora," which, according to the chief federal  prosecutor's office, is an underground organization of the "Red  Cells," set fire to the mother company of the Adler clothing  company in Haibach near Aschaffenburg and another seven  subsidiaries of the company.    At that time, the textile corporation was accused by "Red  Zora" of exploiting women in South Korea.</p>

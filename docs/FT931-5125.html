			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Overheated debate of economic niceties produces trade in insults: The argument which has split the Treasury's panel of seven wise men A THICK cloud of recrimination, hurt pride and embarrassment has settled over the UK economics profession after the angry blast by Prof Tim Congdon directed at the other six members of the government's new panel of economic advisers. Prof Congdon says in an open letter to the six, to be published this week, that he has been 'dismayed' by the work of the group - set up only three months ago - on the grounds of what he says is his fellow members' lack of understanding of the basics of economics. The substance of Prof Congdon's accusations - that the other members of the panel, with much of the economics establishment, do not account adequately for the money supply in their economic analysis - does not surprise those who know him. Prof Congdon, a staunch monetarist who is economic adviser at Gerrard &amp; National, the City discount house, feels passionately about his subject. He combines a high regard for his own intellectual capabilities with a fondness for lecturing his fellow economists. These traits have won Prof Congdon respect but have also brought him a fair number of detractors. 'He's an arrogant so-and-so,' was one of the comments from members of the economics community at the weekend. In the professor's favour is that his forecasting record since the mid-1980s has been significantly better than that of many other economists. He correctly foresaw both the inflationary boom of 1986-88 and the seriousness and length of the recession which followed soon afterwards. In terms of forecasting he has performed far better than the teams of economists at the UK's two biggest and best-known academic establishments in the discipline - the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London Business School. They are represented on the Treasury panel by the institute's director, Mr Andrew Britton, and the LBS's head of forecasting, Prof David Currie. Prof Congdon is also a member of the generally respected Liverpool Six group of monetarist economists, which correctly argued from early 1991 that the recessionary forces in Britain would ultimately compel the country to leave the European exchange rate mechanism. What has surprised many about Prof Congdon's latest tirade - which he showed to the FT on Friday - is the force of the invective in his 12-page letter and the fact that he included in his sweeping criticisms his fellow monetarist, Prof Patrick Minford of Liverpool University - who is another member of the Treasury panel. The letter demonstrates not only Prof Congdon's lack of regard for restraint in conducting economic arguments, but the gulf between him and Prof Minford  -another member of the Liverpool Six - when it comes to considering the technical role of money in the economy. In his letter, to be published in Gerrard &amp; National's monthly economic review, Prof Congdon criticises the Liverpool academic on the detailed points of monetarism and concludes that he has no 'means of analysing the effects on the economy of a change in the quantity of money'. Prof Minford retorted at the weekend that Prof Congdon was 'plain wrong' and 'ignorant'. He added: 'The whole thing is embarrassing and a bit pathetic. I am afraid Prof Congdon does not understand modern economics and doesn't listen to other people's views. Prof Gordon Pepper, of the City University Business School, a further member of the Liverpool Six, said Prof Congdon's letter was 'incredibly irritating'. Prof Pepper said: 'For him to attack the neo-Keynsian economics establishment in the UK and its lack of success in economic analysis is fair enough. But going about this in this rude way, and by including Prof Minford in his sweeping comments, undermines his case.' Two of the other members of the panel - Mr Andrew Sentance of the Confederation of British Industry and Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge University - both expressed their displeasure at Prof Congdon's remarks. Mr Britton - who is a particular target of Prof Congdon's cutting comments - said he did not want to comment until he had read the full text of the letter. 'I might not want to comment then either,' he added. Yesterday Prof Congdon found at least one wholehearted ally among the other ranks of monetarist economists. Mr Paul Turnbull, chief UK economist at stockbrokers Smith New Court and a former colleague of Prof Congdon, said: 'In my view the vast majority of UK economists do not place enough emphasis on money and credit, an oversight which has led to dramatic failures in forecasting by mainstream economists in recent years. I sympathise entirely with Prof Congdon's views.'</p>

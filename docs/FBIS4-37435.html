			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, a well-known scholar and  mirwaiz [religious leader] of south Kashmir, Qazi Nissar Ahmad,  has been shot dead by militants. His body was found at Dayalgam  in Anantnag District this morning. Qazi Nissar Ahmad was  kidnapped from his residence last evening. One of the killers  has been identified as Fayaz Ahmad Mir, alias Abu Bakr, who  according to official sources belongs to the militant outfit  Hizbul Mojahedin.    Over 50,000 people took out a procession in Anantnag town in  protest against the killing and demanded immediate arrest of the  killers. The funeral procession raised anti-Hizbul Mojahedin  and anti-Pakistan slogans.    The prime minister has expressed shock and grief at the  tragic death of Qazi Nissar. Condemning the killing, the state  governor, General K.V. Krishna Rao, said it clearly indicates  that the militants have no respect for religion or human rights.  The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and the CPI-M [Communist Party  of India-Marxist] have also condemned the killing. The BJP  general secretary, Mr. K.L. Sharma, asked the government to take  firm measures against the militants, while the CPI-M said it  showed that the struggle in the Kashmir valley is not on  communal lines, but between the patriotic and antinational  forces.    Four left parties and the Janata Dal have called for revival  of the political process in Jammu and Kashmir. In a joint  statement in New Delhi, the CPI-M, CPI [Communist Party of  India], Forward Bloc, RSP [Revolutionary Socialist Party], and  the Janata Dal urged the center to deal firmly with militancy in  the valley and districts like Doda. They alleged that the BJP  has chosen to utilize the current events in the state to deepen  the communal polarization. The union civil aviation minister,  Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, has said the migrants in the Doda District  in Jammu and Kashmir are likely to return home very soon. He  was speaking to newsmen after a two-day tour of the bordering  villages in Himachal Pradesh.</p>

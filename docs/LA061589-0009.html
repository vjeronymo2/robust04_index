			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KAREEM: FOREVER A CHAMPION  </P> <P> "It's over," said Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Playoffs, season and career all ended at  once Tuesday night for the Los Angeles Lakers star who played professional  basketball longer than anyone else ever had. His skyhook was a thing of beauty  and his scoring records may be a joy forever.  </P> <P> Born in Harlem, he made championships his way of life. Starting life as Lew  Alcindor, he played on a Power Memorial High School team in New York City that  won the national championship two years in a row. His freshman team at UCLA was  undefeated. He led the varsity to three straight NCAA championships. He was  rookie of the year with the Milwaukee Bucks. Changing his name in 1971,  Abdul-Jabbar came back to Los Angeles as a Laker in 1975. The team won  championships in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar, now 42, not only played in more games than anyone else, he played  more time, he scored more points, he tried -- and made -- more field goals than  anyone else in the history of the game and he blocked more shots. He also  ranked high in rebounding and free throws. A fierce competitor, he would have  been far happier to go out with his team winning another National Basketball  Assn. championship. It was not to be. Nonetheless, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar goes out  a champion in every sense of the word.  </P></p>

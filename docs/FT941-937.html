			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Government criticises EC social policy The government has criticised the European Commission's green paper on social policy.  It said many of the themes should be left to member states. The government attacked the green paper for suggesting that 'levels of social provision and regulation can only ever increase' and for supporting 'merchanistic approaches to labour market intervention'. The government wants discussion on how far EU social policy impedes UK competitiveness and how far it protects member states with high levels of social protection. The paper could form the basis of a new programme of social legislation.</p>

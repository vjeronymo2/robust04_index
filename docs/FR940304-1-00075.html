			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The life-cycle cost was calculated for the range of efficiencies in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engineering Analysis for each class in the year standards are imposed, using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> real consumer discount rates of 2, 6, and 10 percent. The purchase price is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the factory costs in the Engineering Analysis and includes a factory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markup plus a distributor and retailer markup. Energy price forecasts are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken from the 1991 Annual Energy Outlook of the Energy Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration. (DOE/Energy Information Administration_0383(91)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance usage inputs are taken from the relevant test procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Energy Savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the significant conservation of energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a separate statutory requirement for imposing an energy conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, the Act requires DOE, in determining the economic justification of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, to consider the total projected savings that are expected to result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly from revised standards. The Department used the Lawrence Berkeley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratory Residential Energy Model results, discussed earlier, in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of total projected savings. The savings for the eight products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are provided in Section IV of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This factor cannot be quantified. In establishing classes of products and design options, the Department tried to eliminate any degradation of utility or performance in the eight products under consideration in this rulemaking. That is, to the extent that comments, or the Department's own research, indicated that a product included a utility or performance-related feature that affected energy efficiency, a separate class with a different efficiency standard was created for that product. In this way, the Department attempted to minimize the impact of this factor as a result of the standards that were analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Impact of Lessening of Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is important to note that this factor has two parts; on the one hand, it assumes that there could be some lessening of competition as a result of standards; and on the other hand, it directs the Attorney General to gauge the impact, if any, of that effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to assist the Attorney General in making such a determination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department studied the affected appliance industries to determine their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing concentrations, levels of competitiveness, and financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performances. This information will be sent to the Attorney General. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Support Document, Chapter 7. The Department has also provided the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attorney General with copies of this notice and the Technical Support Document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for her review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Need of The Nation to Conserve Energy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The results of the environmental effects from each standard level for each product will be reported under this factor in the product specific discussion (Section IV) of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Other Factors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision allows the Secretary of Energy, in determining whether a standard is economically justified, to consider any other factors that the Secretary deems to be relevant. The Secretary is seeking comments on two issues which may be considered in this rulemaking. The issues are (1) the incremental impact of appliance conservation standards on energy use, consumers, manufacturers and other factors (See the discussion regarding rebuttable presumption under General Analytical Comments) and, (2) the extent to which any proposed national efficiency standard is likely to disproportionally affect identifiable groups of consumers and whether the analysis should be modified to consider such impacts in the selection of efficiency standard levels (See the discussion regarding other comments under Product-Specific Comments for Direct Heating Equipment).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received 90 written comments in response to the September  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990, advance notice. These comments addressed all aspects of the analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this section, the Department will present discussions of the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical issues raised by the comments, followed by discussions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product-specific issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Immediately afterward, all the units of the internal security  forces were instructed by Major General Rafiq al-Hasan, director  general of the internal security forces, to immediately carry  out investigations and gather information on the criminals  before they are arrested and handed over to the Judiciary.    On the night of 4 February, Staff Brigadier General Salim  Salim, commander of the Judiciary Police Corps, obtained  information that a Palestinian person called Yusuf Mahmud  Sha'ban, whose nom de guerre is Wa'il Mahmud 'Ali, is the  perpetrator or the instigator or implicated and involved in this  incident. Coordination between the Lebanese Security Service  and the Syrian military intelligence branch of the Syrian Arab  Forces in Lebanon led to the arrest of Yusuf Mahmud Sha'ban.    The judiciary was informed of developments. It issued  instructions for the start of investigations, which were carried  out by Staff Colonel Mahmud al-Rida, head of the special  criminal intelligence branch, and Lieutenant Colonel 'Ali  al-Sha'ir, head of the antiterrorism bureau. The investigations  were supervised by the commander of the Judiciary Police Corps.    In light of the coordination, three perpetrators involved in  the incident were detained. All of them are Palestinians. The  investigations have revealed that the killer is Yusuf Mahmud  Sha'ban, alias Wa'il, who was aided by the three detained and  others who are still at large.    The internal security forces, coordinating with the other  Lebanese security services and the Syrian intelligence branch of  the Syrian Forces in Lebanon, continue to make diligent efforts  to find and arrest the other perpetrators and refer them to the  judiciary.</p>

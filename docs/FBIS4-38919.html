			<p>BFN     [Text] An Armenian-Azerbaijani meeting took place on the  border near Yeraskh [an Armenian village bordering Nakhichevan  Autonomous Republic] on 2 June. The Armenian side asked the  Nakhichevani delegation about the misinformation disseminated by  the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry and the press service of the  National Assembly on 31 May, which say that allegedly the  Armenian Army units have invaded the Nakhichevani territory and  occupy a strategically important hill.    The Armenian Defense Ministry press service informed  ARMENPRES that Brigade Commander Colonel Farman Aliyev, who  commands all the army units in Nakhichevan, has declared that he  himself heard that news from Moscow's Vesti television program  for the first time, and added that it does not conform to  reality.</p>

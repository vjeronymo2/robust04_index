			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Gan Zhebin (3927 0772 2430): "Looking </F> Ahead to the Forthcoming `Two Sessions': The Forthcoming `Two  Sessions' Will Continue To Show Concern Over the Hong Kong  Issue"]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The second  session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and the second session  of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], to be held on 8  and 10 March respectively -- though they are but regular  meetings of this term of the NPC and CPPCC -- have attracted  much attention from within and outside China because they are  facing a number of important matters. Of these matters, the  Hong Kong issue is bound to become one of the hot topics for the  NPC deputies and the CPPCC national committee members during the  "two sessions," and the keynote on the Hong Kong issue set by  the "two sessions" will definitely also attract attention from  people in and outside China.    People must still remember that, at the first session of the  Eighth NPC in March last year, the Chinese Government, for the  first time since China and Britain solved the question of Hong  Kong between them, leveled criticisms on the British Government  in the "Government Work Report." One year has passed. The  unfriendliness and lack of cooperation demonstrated by the  British side on the Hong Kong issue have aggravated. So what  comment will this year's "Government Work Report" make on the  same issue? It is believed that this will be the focus of  attention.    Over the past year, because the British side always held on  to the position which violated the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, defied convergence with the Basic Law, and  contravened the agreements and understandings reached between  China and Britain, the Sino-British talks on the arrangements  for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong broke down. On 24  February, Chris Patten's partial constitutional reform bill  characterized by the "three violations" was adopted by the  British Hong Kong Legislative Council, after which the British  side unilaterally disclosed the contents of the talks,  misrepresenting and attacking the posture of the Chinese side.  The Chinese side was compelled to publicize the relevant truths  to ensure a correct understanding of the facts. It is  foreseeable that the series of moves made by the British side --  which intended to confront the Chinese side and sabotage the  smooth transition and transfer of sovereignty in Hong Kong --  will evoke strong criticisms from the NPC deputies and CPPCC  members during the "two sessions."    Last year's first session of the Eighth NPC decided to set  up  a Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee  for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. After it was  founded last July, the PWC quickly began its work and, after  adopting the work programs of all its subgroups at its second  plenary session last December, entered the stage of substantive  work. As a working organ subordinate to the NPC standing  committee, the PWC will be able to hand in an excellent progress  report to the nation at the upcoming NPC session. There is not  much time left before Hong Kong returns to China. A great deal  of convergence-related work in political, economic, legal, and  other fields, has to be done. Therefore, as Premier Li Peng put  it, the burden on the PWC is even heavier, its responsibility  greater, and its role bigger. After the forthcoming "two  sessions," the PWC is bound to step up its work and speed up its  progress.    The NPC and the CPPCC national committee are the embodiment  of the will of the state as well as the people's will. The NPC  deputies and the CPPCC members show of concern on the Hong Kong  issue demonstrates the Chinese people's longing for national  reunification and their wish that the great construct of "one  country, two systems" will be smoothly realized first in Hong  Kong. The smooth implementation of "one country, two systems" in  Hong Kong will play an effective exemplary role in the process  of solving the Taiwan issue and will help the reunification of  the motherland come to pass at an early date.    It is now March, and spring has arrived early in Beijing.  Hong Kong's NPC deputies and CPPCC members will attend the  great events, participate in government and political affairs,  and offer valuable advice. A separate constituency was set up  for Hong Kong members at the first session of the Eighth CPPCC  National Committee last year. Now the CPPCC members from Hong  Kong have served a full year in their office. They, faced with  the wind and rain in Hong Kong of the past year, have given all  their strength. They will definitely offer good ideas and good  suggestions during the upcoming "two sessions" and will do their  utmost to ensure the smooth return of Hong Kong to China.    "A thousand sails pass by the shipwreck; ten thousand  saplings shoot up beyond the withered tree." Hong Kong's  destiny is, after all, in the hands of the Chinese people,  including the Hong Kong compatriots. The uncooperative attitude  of the British side will not in the least hold back the forward  momentum of the wheel of history. During the "two sessions,"  the NPC deputies and the CPPCC members will once again give  voice to the aspirations of the Chinese people on the question  of Hong Kong.</p>

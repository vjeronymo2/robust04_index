			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / News Corp doubles net profits NEWS Corporation, the Australian-based media group, yesterday reported doubled net profits of ADollars 668m (Pounds 310m) for the nine months ended March, following a strong third quarter. Lower interest costs and strong performances from associates were the main reasons for the improvement, while the bulk of the group's core businesses made steady gains. Revenue rose by 3 per cent to ADollars 8bn. Associated companies, mainly BSkyB - the UK-based satellite broadcasting arm in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, Ansett Transport Industries, the Australian airline, and Pacific Magazines, the Australian publisher, turned round their contribution from a ADollars 76.8m loss to a ADollars 112m profit. News Corp said BSkyB's weekly revenues were exceeding Pounds 7m and weekly operating profits more than Pounds 1.7m at the end of March compared with break-even a year earlier. Ansett had moved from loss to profit with better yields on improved passenger numbers. The group said continued debt reduction and falling interest rates cut total interest expense by 22 per cent to ADollars 567.8m. News Corp continued to derive the majority of its earnings in the US where operating income rose from ADollars 654.9m to ADollars 686.6m. The Fox television businesses increased earnings almost 20 per cent, but earnings from the Twentieth Century Fox Film division fell significantly. Magazine and inserts operations lifted earnings by 17 per cent, profit from TV Guide rose 27 per cent, but the HarperCollins book group had an earnings fall in the period in spite of a slightly improved latest quarter. UK activities lifted their operating income from ADollars 275.3m to ADollars 313.6m. BSkyB now has 2.3m homes subscribing to at least one of its services. The company says the numbers of homes receiving Sky channels is increasing at an average rate of more than 20,000 a week through satellite dishes and cable television. In the autumn BSkyB will scramble all its channels and offer a 'basic package' of at least 10 channels for around Pounds 4 a month. Chargeurs results, Page 27 Fox cable TV venture, Page 27</p>

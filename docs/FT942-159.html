			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / People: Bodies politic Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge University is to become the 15th ASTRONOMER ROYAL. The Queen has appointed him to succeed Arnold Wolfendale of Durham University next January to a post created by Charles II in 1675. The Astronomer Royal lost his responsibilities in 1972, when the position was detached from the directorship of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Now it is purely honorary, carrying no stipend and no duties beyond a general obligation to act as an ambassador for astronomy. Rees, 52, is a distinguished cosmologist who already devotes a lot of energy to popularising the subject. 'The Astronomer Royal is now rather like the Poet Laureate,' he says. 'There is no analogous post for the other sciences  -no Chemist Royal or Master of the Queen's Physics - so one should take every opportunity to speak up not only for astronomy but for science as a whole.' Rees will have plenty of opportunity to do that next year, when he will also be President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Wolfendale, 67, has spoken out not only for astronomy but also for scientific Christianity during his three years in the post. He made a notable contribution to BBC Television's Songs of Praise broadcast from Durham Cathedral last November, using the building's great rose window as an analogy for the history of the universe after the Big Bang.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> FULBRIGHT, 84, TELLS PLAN TO WED  </P> <P> Former Sen. J. William Fulbright is getting married.  </P> <P> The 84-year-old Democrat who represented Arkansas in Congress for 32 years will  marry Harriett Mayor on March 10 in Washington.  </P> <P> Mayor, 56, is executive director of the Fulbright Assn..  </P> <P> "We've been really good friends for a long time and it's only been recently  that he asked me to marry him," Mayor said in a telephone interview from  Washington. "We talk about world affairs. That's what got us together, I  guess."  </P> <P> Fulbright, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 15 years,  said he called Mayor early one morning several weeks ago to propose. He said he  figured it would take the better part of the day to persuade her and was  surprised when she said yes right away.  </P> <P> "I was afraid she wouldn't accept because I'm old and she's young, you know,"  Fulbright said in a telephone interview from Captiva, Fla., where he was  visiting one of his two daughters.  </P> <P> "I thought this sort of thing was all over for me. It's been a great surprise,"  he said.  </P> <P> His wife of 32 years, Elizabeth (Betty) Fulbright, died in October, 1985.  </P></p>

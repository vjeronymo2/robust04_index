			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Privatising British Coal The lengthy and painful saga of British Coal enters its closing chapter on Wednesday, when bidders make their tenders to buy the state-owned company. All that remains is for the government to ensure it gets the highest possible value for the taxpayer - and for observers to bewail the might-have-beens. What would have happened if Arthur Scargill had not been the leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, or if coal had been privatised earlier, or if the structure of the electricity privatisation had not encouraged the 'dash for gas'? Truly, this has been a tragedy of errors. For the purposes of the sale, British Coal has been divided into five regions, and bidders can put in for as many as they wish. The government will then choose the winning bids, with a view to completing the privatisation by the end of the year. In assessing those bids the government has set itself two objectives. The first is to maximise the return to the taxpayer. The second is to preserve the largest economically viable coal industry in the long term. The first aim is both sensible and laudable: taxpayers deserve the greatest possible recompense for the billions of pounds they have poured into British Coal over the years. There is also no justification for underpricing privatisations in the way that many have been underpriced in the past. The second aim needs to be examined more closely. If this statement is merely a long-winded way of saying that the coal industry must stand on its own two feet, that is acceptable. But if it means that the government is prepared to accept lower bids in return for commitments by purchasers not to close pits, it should be rejected. Soften the blow Even at this late stage, the government may wish to soften the blow of coal rationalisation. But the terms of the sale should not be bent to give coal that extra chance of survival. That temptation has been yielded to too often in the past. Subsidies, if any, should be explicit, not hidden inside a manipulated bidding process. It is true that the economics of mining seem somewhat special, in that investors have the choice of 'raping' mines or investing in them over the long term. And it may be that a lower bidder would put in a business plan that promises to preserve mines - and jobs - for a longer period. But accepting such a bid would just be a concealed job subsidy. And how could such bidders be held to this commitment if the market turned against them, without distorting the business still further? There have been suggestions that detailed terms could be written into licences, but that would surely be unrealistic. Competitive bidding There is only one criterion to be applied: the highest bid wins. Thus will the greatest value be extracted from the nation's coal. The sole requirement is to ensure that the bidding is sufficiently competitive. The government may also need to set reserve prices, to avoid underbidding. By the same token, the government should have no hesitation in selling all five regions to the same bidder if that were to yield the best return. There would be no serious loss of competition: domestic coal's strongest competitors are natural gas and imported coal. There may even be a case for keeping the coal industry in one piece, to enable it better to confront these competitors. Although the assets being offered for sale are a mere shadow of the business that British Coal once was, they do have the makings of a durable, if small, industry. The cutbacks of the last two years have greatly reduced costs, but there is enough scope for further savings. Meanwhile, the prospects for the UK coal market have become clearer now that the share of coal in power generation has fallen to more sustainable levels. If anything, the major challenge facing coal's new owners will be environmental, rather than economic: how to deliver a product that conforms to the country's much tighter atmospheric pollution targets, and covers the environmental liabilities that mining operations always create. Managing the coal industry's long decline has been one of the most intractable - and costly - challenges confronting British governments for more than a generation. This privatisation must be the end of it. From now on, coal should be just another industry.</p>

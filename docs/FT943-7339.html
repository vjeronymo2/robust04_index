			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Economy set to pick up tempo: But protests are a worry Mexico may be emerging from the economic doldrums in which it has been languishing for two years. If opposition protests against the conduct of Sunday's election fizzle out or at least do not degenerate into violence, many private economists are likely to increase the forecasts for growth which they scaled down amid the political uncertainty of the first half of the year. 'If we can avoid a post-electoral conflict, things will really look up, especially on the investment side,' said Mr Jonathan Heath, head of Macro Asesoria Economica, a Mexico City economic consultancy. Already this year, growth has been unexpectedly high. In the second quarter, growth was 3.8 per cent compared with the same 1993 quarter, leading to a first half economic expansion of 2.2 per cent. In the second half, growth should get a boost from falling interest rates - yesterday's auction showed Mexican 28-day Treasury bill rates falling from 17.7 per cent a month ago. But in the first half, unusually for a Mexican government which has kept a tight rein on the budget, the motor for growth was a 27 per cent rise in government spending. According to Mr Rogelio Ramirez de la O, who runs the Ecanal economic analysis company, the government's new agricultural policy - which aims to replace guaranteed prices with direct income support to small farmers - injected Dollars 3.8bn into the economy between February and June, alone equivalent to more than 1 per cent of GDP. While for seasonal reasons, the public sector budget remained in surplus in the first half of the year, many expect a deficit by the year-end rather than the balance forecast by the government. Some analysts think this means that the ruling party's successful presidential candidate, Mr Ernesto Zedillo - who has promised a 25 per cent rise in public investment next year  -may have to begin by checking government spending. Foreign investment has held up remarkably well in the face of uncertainty, and many economists are expecting it to pick up significantly with a peaceful handover of power in prospect. Foreign direct investment, excluding foreign share purchases, reached Dollars 3.3bn in the first half of the year, compared with Dollars 4.9bn for the whole of last year. 'Direct foreign investment could easily reach Dollars 7bn in 1994,' says Salomon Brothers in New York. But growth of the country's trade and current account deficits remains a troubling feature to many economists - and underlines to some the overvaluation of the Mexican peso. Most economists believe a big devaluation is out of the question. President Carlos Salinas' three predecessors were forced into panic devaluations in their last year of office. With reserves perhaps around Dollars 17bn - and assuming an amenable environment in international markets - the question becomes not whether Mr Salinas can hold the exchange rate but whether it is sensible for him to do so. If a depreciation is considered desirable, the government is expected to push for it gradually, by increasing the daily slide of the peso against the dollar from the current 40 cents a day (or about 5 per cent a year) as part of the so-called pacto in early September. Mr Zedillo and his advisers are sure to have an important influence over content of the new pacto, an annual agreement between business, labour and the government, especially if there is a decision to modify exchange rate policy. A former budget minister and central bank official, Mr Zedillo strongly supports economic policies of the current administration, and there is expected to be co-operation between the outgoing and incoming administrations. The continuity in economic policy is likely to be underlined when Mr Zedillo chooses his economic cabinet. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the trade minister and a friend of Mr Zedillo from when they were both students at Yale University, Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the deputy finance minister, and Mr Pedro Aspe, current finance minister, are in rough order of likelihood the three candidates most frequently mentioned as the next finance minister. With inflation under control, Mr Zedillo and his economic team are likely to focus on improving efficiency of the economy over the next six years. Advisers say the new government will seek to remove unnecessary business regulations, improve functioning of the labour markets and commercial legal system, overhaul the health and social security system and open the giant state monopolies in oil to more competition. But important as such reforms are, they are not expected to be the most crucial aspects of a Zedillo administration. 'For the future I'm less worried about Hacienda (the finance ministry) and more worried about Gobernacion (the interior ministry). Politics will be to this administration what the economy was to the last,' says Mr Heath.</p>

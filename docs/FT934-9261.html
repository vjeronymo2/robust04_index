			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Unigate Unigate continues to make useful progress rationalising its illogical collection of businesses. Though flattered by the release of provisions and a gain from a pension revaluation, Unigate's rise in headline profits represents an encouraging performance in tough conditions. Buying dairies on the cheap and squeezing extra volumes out of reduced capacity is proving an effective strategy to combat margin pressures - in the short term at least. Unigate's shares will continue to be underpinned by their 5.5 per cent yield. But the company's 40 per cent outperformance of Northern Foods this year is beginning to look a trifle excessive. Northern has attractive investment avenues in which to divert the funds milked from its dairy cash cow. Unigate still lacks a suitable recipe for sustainable earnings growth. With the grocery chains soon likely to apply the squeeze to commodity producers, the market appears to be coming full-circle in believing branded goods manufacturers are best placed to resist their fatal embrace. But that will hardly be to Unigate's benefit. The success of Muller in grabbing so big a share of UK yoghurt sales illustrates how vulnerable Unigate remains on that score.</p>

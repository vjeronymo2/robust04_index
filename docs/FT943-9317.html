			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Rail dispute set to worsen as union calls fresh strike: BR chairman warns of 'dangerous' alternatives if stoppages continue Both sides in the increasingly bitter rail signalling dispute blamed each other's intransigence last night for the failure to reach a settlement as the network faced its longest period of disruption since the conflict began nine weeks ago. The latest bout of disruption will affect an estimated 5m travellers around this weekend. Today's stoppage ends at midnight. While the network will run normally over tomorrow and Sunday, this will be followed by 48 hours of strikes ending at midnight on Tuesday. The RMT transport union executive yesterday announced that a further strike by signal workers was planned from noon on Monday, August 22, to noon on Tuesday, August 23. Last night Railtrack, the state-owned infrastructure operator, said it hoped that up to 37 per cent of the network would be open for services over the 72 hours of the present strike. The two sides seem determined to persist with a battle of attrition in what is now one of the longest industrial conflicts since the miners' strike of 1984-1985. Last night Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' at what he described as 'yet another lost opportunity' to settle the dispute. Railtrack's current offer of a 6 per cent supplement plus a Pounds 250 lump sum payment was 'as unacceptable today as it was four weeks ago when it was first made'. 'I hope the public will recognise all the initiatives to try and resolve the dispute have come from the union. This weekend's disruption could have been avoided if Railtrack had shown some realism and flexibility. 'Railtrack's stubbornness is losing them their holy grail of restructuring. Without an agreement on RMT's claim, Railtrack are not going to get agreement on restructuring.' In a letter to Mr Knapp, Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial relations director, accused the RMT of inflexibility and intransigence. He said the union's peace proposals were not acceptable and warned that there were 'only seven weeks' left to complete the restructuring deal for the signal workers if the RMT was not to make them 'disadvantaged in pension terms'. He added: 'I don't need to remind you that September 30 is the last date for new pay deals to be taken into account under the reshaping of the present railway-wide pension scheme.' Mr Armstrong called on the union to have five days of talks to hammer out a final package for the signal workers. Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail which operates services, said yesterday some of his staff could be called in to help operate signal boxes if the dispute was not settled soon. BR would have 'no alternative but to look for a different, much more dangerous solution'. He added: 'We have got to help people to run the boxes. I don't want to see our business disappear.' It is estimated that about 100 BR staff are qualified to operate signal boxes, but so far have not been asked to do so. BR said this was not likely during the latest strikes. It was up to Railtrack to request help. With the conflict deepening, Railtrack's options include the introduction of individual contracts for signalling staff, but this is not being considered immediately. It prefers to open more of the network while keeping pressure on the union's members to persuade it to re-enter talks. The company is concerned the RMT may call strikes over the August bank holiday. But there is no sign of the union contemplating such action, which could destroy public support.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Brussels plan on economy faces test THE European Commission's campaign for a growth package to stimulate investment in the flagging European economy faces a test of credibility in the coming weeks, EC officials said yesterday. The Commission won a political victory on Monday when EC finance ministers agreed to explore proposals for a package which combines generating capital investment with closer co-ordination of economic policy by member states. The proposals are to be considered at next month's EC summit in Edinburgh, but member states led by Germany are certain to challenge some of the Commission's assumptions, particularly the contention that no significant deficit financing by governments will be involved. Officials at the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Luxembourg also questioned whether it could do more to encourage investment in transport, telecommunications and other infrastructure projects along the lines proposed by the Commission. The EIB provides long-term fixed-rate interest loans for projects such as the Channel tunnel. Despite widespread concern about lower growth in the European economy next year, member states are divided on the best approach to a growth initiative, vague on details and reluctant to let the Commission take the political lead. Germany, whose support is vital if an EC-wide growth package is to work, this week dampened expectations. Mr Horst Kohler, Germany's state secretary for finance, said: 'We will constructively join in the discussions, but this is not the time for deficit-financed economic programmes.' The UK position is ambivalent. British ministers do not want to alienate their EC partners already angry about Britain's delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty. However officials at the finance meeting in Brussels on Monday voiced alarm after Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, told reporters that between Ecu50bn (Pounds 40.7bn) and Ecu60bn was needed to 'move' the community's economy. Yesterday Britain acted to quash hopes of substantial funding to stimulate growth in the European Community, stressing instead the need for co-ordinated economic planning. The British presidency is clearly keen to be seen by its continental partners as taking positive action. Addressing the home audience, however, the British government does not wish to be interpreted as abandoning its long-standing insistence on budgetary rigour. In the House of Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, stressed co-ordinated action by individual governments. But he said the EIB could provide more by means of loans and guarantees to support investment spending, 'especially on projects such as trans-European networks' for transport. Officials stressed later, however, that funding for such EIB projects was already in place and would not involve extra money.</p>

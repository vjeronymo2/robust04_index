			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "jac": "Nelson Mandela Accepted Michal Kovac's </F> Invitation to Visit the Slovak Republic"]    [Text] Bratislava--President Michal Kovac and his wife  yesterday returned from a three-day visit to the Republic of  South Africa [RSA], where he attended the inauguration of new  RSA President Nelson Mandela, at the invitation of the National  Inauguration Committee. "We have seen a country with deeply  rooted hatred and a wide gap between whites and blacks undergo  significant democratic changes, especially recently, which a few  days ago culminated in free multiracial elections," the  president said, adding that the Slovak Republic considered it  very important to participate in this event in order to confirm  that we not only continue to be interested in cooperating with  the RSA, but also want to start a new stage in mutual relations.  The improvement of economic relations was also the aim of  Michal Kovac's meeting with the governor of the South African  central bank, who is expected to visit Slovakia in the very near  future. Because Michal Kovac also met with Nelson Mandela,  reporters inquired about the contents of their conversation.  "Even though the conversation with Mr. Mandela was short, it was  two or three times longer than his meetings with other  delegations." Kovac conveyed to the president his thanks for  his lifelong quest for the rights of blacks and for seeking a  peaceful path toward solving this problem. "At the same time, I  made use of the meeting to invite the president to visit the  Slovak Republic. Mandela accepted the invitation; the date of  the visit will be specified later. I personally believe that  the visit might take place next year."</p>

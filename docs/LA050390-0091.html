			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WEST TORRANCE CAN'T SHAKE OFF JINX IN LOSING, 13-1, TO REDONDO  </P> <P> The gods of baseball haven't been smiling on West Torrance High School lately,  but that didn't stop West Coach Dick McGrath from mustering a grin after his  team's latest mismatch with misfortune.  </P> <P> Even after watching everything go wrong in West's 13-1 Ocean League loss to  visiting Redondo on Wednesday, McGrath was looking hard for a silver lining.  </P> <P> "We're snake-bitten right now," McGrath said. "But we're still in the running  for the playoffs. There's no dominant team in this league. I don't know what it  will take for us to get into third place, but if someone loses three in a row  or wins three in a row, it could still happen."  </P> <P> For now, though, Redondo (13-11 overall, 7-4 in league) is in sole possession  of third place. The fifth-place Warriors (8-13, 5-6) are two games out of a  playoff spot, with games remaining against South Torrance, North Torrance and  first-place Culver City.  </P> <P> West's run of bad luck began a week ago, when McGrath's best player --  shortstop Dana Cowing -- shattered his jaw in a collision with a teammate while  chasing a pop fly.  </P> <P> And Cowing hasn't been the only Warrior casualty. West's starting third  baseman, second baseman and catcher have also been injured, and the team's best  pitcher is academically ineligible.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, West right fielder Rich Herrada sprained his ankle  before Wednesday's game and couldn't play. Then Matt Mishler, the Warrior's  starting left fielder, pulled his hamstring in the first inning and had to  leave the game.  </P> <P> "We've had too many injuries," McGrath said. "That's just too much to  overcome."  </P> <P> Still, McGrath had his best remaining pitcher, Jason Vroman, on the mound to  start the Redondo game. Vroman took a 2.10 earned-run average into the game  with him, but he wasn't immune to West's jinx either, and walked four of the  first five batters he faced.  </P> <P> The Warriors made a pair of errors behind Vroman (2-3) in the first inning, and  by the time left-hander Gary Stewart replaced Vroman with two out in the  second, West was down, 7-0.  </P> <P> West didn't help itself on the base paths, either, getting a runner gunned down  at the plate in the second inning and another caught in a rundown between  second and third bases in the third.  </P> <P> "A lack of basic baseball hurt us today," McGrath said.  </P> <P> On the other side of the field, Redondo played near-flawless ball in a game  crucial to its playoff hopes. The Sea Hawks still must play league-leading Mira  Costa and Culver City in their last three games.  </P> <P> "We've got three big games left," Redondo Coach Tim Ammentorp said. "This was  the game that really scared me because we basically had to win it."  </P> <P> Right-hander Artie Scarpino (5-4) threw a six-hitter and struck out seven, but  lost his shutout bid on Randy Block's sacrifice fly in the fifth.  </P> <P> Leadoff man Brett Tyrrell led Redondo with two hits and three runs batted in,  and second baseman Chris Townsend singled twice and scored twice.  </P> <P> Mira Costa 5, North Torrance 3 -- Andy Owens collected two hits in three  at-bats and drove in three runs to help the host Mustangs keep pace with Culver  City for first place in the Ocean League.  </P> <P> Mira Costa (12-11 overall, 9-2 in league) opened a 4-0 lead in the first inning  and withstood a strong offensive performance by North (11-12, 4-6), which  outhit the Mustangs, 12-9. But the Saxons could score only three runs off  junior right-hander Jason Garner, who went the distance for his fourth league  victory in six decisions.  </P> <P> Owens put Mira Costa ahead with a two-run double in the first and added an RBI  single in the fourth. D. J. Allen singled home a run in the first. Jason  Boseant was two for four with two runs scored.  </P> <P> Tony Torino paced North, going two for three with two RBIs and a solo home run.  </P> <P> South Torrance 6, Centennial 4 -- Stu Manthey's three-run homer in the third  inning gave the Spartans a 5-0 lead, and right-hander Chris Castillon held off  Centennial en route to an Ocean League win at South.  </P> <P> Centennial cut its deficit to 5-3 in the fourth on a three-run homer, but South  got a run back in the fifth on Aemon Fowler's pinch-hit RBI single.  </P> <P> South improved to 7-12 overall and 4-7 in league play. Centennial had its  league mark evened at 5-5.  </P> <P> El Segundo 7, Verbum Dei 0 -- The Eagles, who pounded Verbum Dei, 31-1, in  their first meeting March 28, were deadlocked in a scoreless tie before  rallying for five runs in the fifth inning at Victoria Park in Carson.  </P> <P> "I was very nervous," El Segundo Coach John Stevenson said. "Our game was just  off. Everything seemed to go against us."  </P> <P> The Eagles (21-3 overall, 10-1 in the Camino Real League) finally broke through  in the fifth on RBI singles by Mark Lewis and Tate Seefried, an RBI double by  Garret Quaintance, who scored on a passed ball, and a solo home run by Kenny  Talanoa. Quaintance finished with three hits.  </P> <P> Right-hander Rob Croxall (8-1) gave up two hits in five innings and extended  his scoreless-inning streak to 23. Junior left-hander Brian Wise finished up,  allowing one hit.  </P> <P> St. Bernard 7, Pius X 0 -- Senior right-hander Andy Diver, whose only loss this  season was to top-ranked El Segundo, improved to 9-1 with a three-hitter in a  Camino Real League game at Pius X in Downey.  </P> <P> Diver struck out three and walked none as St. Bernard (15-5 overall) kept pace  with El Segundo for first place at 10-1.  </P> <P> Jeff Richardson was three for four with two RBIs, Sean Dunbar had three stolen  bases and varsity newcomer Brian Benbow was two for three with two steals,  including a steal of home in the second inning.  </P> <P> The Vikings collected 10 hits, all singles.  </P></p>

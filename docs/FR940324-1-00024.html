			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Some categories of E-mail messages or documents that would satisfy the definition of record are those: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Containing information developed in preparing position papers, reports, and studies; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Reflecting official actions taken in the course of conducting agency business; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Conveying information on agency programs, policies, decisions, and essential transactions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Conveying statements of policy or the rationale for official decisions or actions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Documenting oral exchanges, such as meetings or telephone conversations, during which policy was discussed or formulated or other agency activities were planned, discussed, or transacted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E-mail messages are not considered nonrecord materials merely because the information they contain may also be available elsewhere on paper or in electronic files. Separate E-mail messages that contain the same information on Government activities may differ in important respects and, thus, are not automatically nonrecord materials. In addition, multiple copies of messages may all be records if they are used for different purposes in the conduct of official business or filed in different files. In other words, if more than one office takes action or otherwise uses copies of a message, copies would be records in each of those offices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist in the process of determining record status, NARA recommends that agencies consider designing into their current or future E-mail systems a feature that helps users to identify records. For example, agencies may want their systems to allow users to tag messages as record or nonrecord or to automatically default to the determination that system-produced documents are records, requiring users to take additional steps to mark a document as nonrecord. Another option would be to develop a system that analyzes the contents of a message according to specified rules in order to prompt the user with a suggested categorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further information on making these distinctions between records and nonrecord materials, see Personal Papers of Executive Branch Officials: A Management Guide, published by NARA in 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Transmission and Receipt Data <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Besides the text of messages, E-mail systems may provide transmission and receipt data. In some systems, transmission data is part of the message. In other systems some transmission data is in a separate message. Generally, receipt data is separate from the messages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E-mail messages require some transmission data to be intelligible and to understand their context. It is essential that necessary transmission data is preserved with all E-mail records. Many E-mail systems automatically capture with an E-mail message the identity of the sender and the addressee(s) and the date the message was sent. Just as with a paper record, this transmission data is necessary for an E-mail record to be complete and understandable. Agencies should determine if any other E-mail transmission data is needed for purposes of adequacy of documentation. Both the message and the related transmission data are Federal records and must be maintained in recordkeeping systems for the same retention period. (See section entitled Maintenance of Federal Records Created by an E-mail System, below.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E-mail systems may provide users with the ability to request acknowledgments or receipts showing that an E-mail message reached the mailbox or inbox of each addressee. E-mail systems may also provide, upon request, information about or acknowledgments of E-mail messages that were received or viewed by the addressee. Agency instructions to E-mail system users should specify when to request such receipts or acknowledgments. Users should request receipt data when it is needed for adequate and proper documentation of agency activities, especially when it is necessary to confirm when an addressee has received or viewed a message. Agencies should maintain such receipts and acknowledgments associated with Federal records for the same period as the electronic message to which they refer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Draft Documents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Agency staff may use the E-mail system to circulate draft documents created on either the E-mail system or a separate word processing or other system. Preliminary drafts must be maintained for purposes of adequate and proper documentation if (1) they contain unique information, such as annotations or comments, that helps explain the formulation or execution of agency policies, decisions, actions, or responsibilities, and (2) they were circulated or made available to employees other than the creator for the purpose of approval, comment, action, recommendation, follow-up, or to keep staff informed about agency business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because drafts in electronic form may be Federal records, the record status of electronically created drafts that are transmitted as part of, or as attachments to, E-mail messages must be evaluated as changes are made. Successive drafts containing substantive revisions may be Federal records; drafts containing only minor changes are less likely to qualify as records. If the draft qualifies as a record, the agency should save a copy before the draft is deleted or altered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Directories and Distribution Lists <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Some electronic communication systems identify users by codes or nicknames. Some identify the recipients of a communication only by the name of a distribution list. Directories or distribution lists linking such shorthand names or codes with the names of users must be retained to ensure identification of the sender and addressee(s) of messages that are records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Calendars <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An E-mail system may provide calendars and task lists for users. Agencies that have such features on their E-mail system should advise users that calendars, indexes of events, and task lists are Federal records if they meet the criteria specified by law. Calendars, whether individual or shared, despite the level of the individual to whom they relate, may be Federal records or they may be personal materials. The NARA publication Personal Papers of Executive Branch Officials: a Management Guide provides guidance on the record status of calendars. That publication notes that the Freedom of Information Act case law regarding ``agency records'' is the most pertinent guidance for deciding whether calendars are Federal records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most calendars and related documents that are Federal records are disposable under General Records Schedule 23, Item 5. Federal record calendars that relate to the activities of high-level officials, however, must be specifically scheduled for disposition to allow NARA to appraise their value for future use. GRS 23 provides guidance on identifying high-level officials. Users may delete calendars that are nonrecord materials at their discretion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

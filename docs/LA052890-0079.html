			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SWAP SETS STAGE FOR RIVER EDGE PROJECT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: A DEAL BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND A CONSTRUCTION FIRM ENDS A DECADE OF  NEGOTIATIONS OVER 265 ACRES OF PROPERTY.  </P> <P> Ventura County has agreed to swap an aging 14-acre maintenance yard in north  Oxnard for a new facility nearby, paving the way for construction of the  largest commercial development in the county, officials said.  </P> <P> The deal with River Edge Development Co. will end a decade of sometimes-bitter  negotiations between the county and a succession of builders with grand plans  for a prime, 265-acre site northeast of the Ventura Freeway at the Santa Clara  River.  </P> <P> Acquisition of the county yard has been critical to River Edge because it  stands in the path of a new freeway interchange that must be completed before  three-fourths of the company's project can be built.  </P> <P> As approved by the Oxnard City Council in 1985, the $500-million project could  have 4.4-million square feet of space and include office towers up to 24  stories high, a low-rise business park, a large shopping mall, a hotel and a  cultural center.  </P> <P> Only the steel frame of a six-floor office building, a row of young palm trees  and the county maintenance yard now mark the site.  </P> <P> Legal documents are being drafted to seal the maintenance-yard deal, which the  Board of Supervisors approved in concept a year ago, said spokesmen for both  the county and the developer.  </P> <P> A final agreement has been delayed by disputes about how much River Edge will  spend to improve the 20-acre parcel off Vineyard Avenue, where the county's new  buildings will be located, the spokesmen said.  </P> <P> The improvements finally agreed upon, including septic tanks and perimeter  walls, will cost between $4.5 million and $7.5 million, county Chief  Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said.  </P> <P> In addition, the developer will pay up to $6.5 million to construct a  69,000-square-foot set of buildings for the county, Wittenberg said.  </P> <P> The new facility, like the old one, will include the county's automotive repair  shop, a fire station, a radio communications center, and offices for public  works, flood control and weights and measures, officials said.  </P> <P> "It's a very good deal," Wittenberg said. "Instead of having a 1950s  barracks-type facility that is literally falling down, this will give us a  brand-new facility. But we're giving up a very, very valuable piece of  property."  </P> <P> County Supervisor John K. Flynn, in whose district the project is located,  said, "We wanted to make sure the deal added up to the market value of the land  out there, and it does."  </P> <P> Paul Denis, a River Edge vice president, said that the deal is nearly complete.  </P> <P> "The papers are drawn," he said. "The issues we're still talking about are not  substantial. It's an agreement to do all things necessary to build a new yard."  </P> <P> However, during negotiations with the county, "we've had a lot of small points  that became big ones," Denis added. "We've moved from one issue to another and  then back again. Everybody is a little impatient about this."  </P> <P> If negotiators are impatient today, they once were angry.  </P> <P> Documents on file with the county show that county representatives have walked  out of at least one meeting since 1981 to put pressure on builders to increase  their offers for the maintenance yard.  </P> <P> In fact, developers first argued that the county should donate the 14 acres as  surplus, since taxes from the project would flow both to the county and the  city of Oxnard.  </P> <P> By 1985, when Oxnard approved the project, developer Robert P. Warmington Co.  had set a value of $2 million on the county land. The same year, the company  estimated that $5.3 million in sales, hotel and property taxes would go to  Oxnard annually after the project is complete in the year 2000.  </P> <P> The county also would eventually receive about $1.6 million each year in  property taxes, and about 11,000 jobs would be created, the company estimated.  </P> <P> In 1988, Warmington increased its appraisal of the county yard to $4.35  million, and Flynn, in a pointed letter, accused the developer of trying to get  Caltrans to condemn the county property so the project could move forward.  </P> <P> Throughout the negotiations, Oxnard officials lobbied the county to sell the  yard, county officials said. "Yes, they have wanted to have the interchange  built," said Richard Maggio, Oxnard's community development director.  </P> <P> River Edge, which took over the project about two years ago, plans to begin  construction on another five low-rise office buildings, a restaurant and a  100-room hotel during the next 18 months, Denis said.  </P> <P> Immediately after that, construction of the first half of a million-square-foot  shopping mall is planned, he said. By comparison, the Oaks Mall in Thousand  Oaks has about 1.2 million square feet.  </P> <P> The high-rise core of the project, about 1.5 million square feet in 12- to  24-story buildings, will be built to meet regional demand within the next 10 to  15 years, he said.  </P> <P> The vacancy rate in county office buildings is about 18%, which is lower than  some depressed parts of Los Angeles County but high when compared nationally,  industry analysts said.  </P></p>

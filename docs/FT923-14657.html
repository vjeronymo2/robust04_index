			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: East Midlands Electricity chairman receives 102% pay rise MR JOHN HARRIS, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, the regional electricity company privatised two years ago, was awarded a 102 per cent pay increase last year. The rise, disclosed in the annual report published yesterday, lifted Mr Harris's remuneration from Pounds 114,476 to Pounds 230,969 for the year to March 1992. The increase is likely to reawaken the row over salaries in the privatised electricity industry. Prof Basil Weedeon, chairman of the East Midlands Electricity Consumers Committee, said: 'I am sure that the general public will be greatly concerned by such a massive pay increase at a time of recession.' The chairmen and chief executives of the 12 regional electricity companies were castigated by Labour politicians at this time last year, when they increased their salaries by as much as 200 per cent. Most were earning between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 70,000 before privatisation and between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000 a year later. Mr Harris, himself, received an 84 per cent increase in the year ending March 1991. The latest round of salary increases have been less sharp and the controversy less acute, although there has been public criticism of some salary levels. Mr Duncan Ross, chairman of Southern Electric, and said to be the best paid regional company chairman, is one example. His current Pounds 220,000 pay-packet is now 253 per cent higher than before privatisation. Most electricity company chairmen are now earning over Pounds 200,000, and can earn anywhere between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 200,000 more from share bonus schemes. However some companies, like Norweb, froze top salaries this year.</p>

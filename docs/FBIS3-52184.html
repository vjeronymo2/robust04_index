			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An Information Ministry spokesman has stated the  following: The news by AFP about negotiations between Syrian  and Israeli officials in European capitals is unfounded and  fabricated. The sources from which it has derived this  information are liars and harm the credibility of the agency  itself. If AFP were not one of the world's most far-reaching  agencies, we would not have replied to these allegations,  especially because Syria, as is known, adheres to the framework  of the Madrid peace conference and to the Washington talks that  stemmed from that framework.</p>

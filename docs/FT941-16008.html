			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Ukraine's peril On Monday night in Brussels President Bill Clinton announced an agreement between the US, Russia and Ukraine on removal of all former Soviet nuclear missiles from Ukrainian territory. Celebration would be premature. The past two years have seen a series of agreements in principle to the same effect, and Ukrainian officials have already warned that this latest one is not yet in final form. Last year the Rada, Ukraine's parliament, ratified the Lisbon protocol (associating Ukraine with the US-Soviet 'Start I') treaty only in an incomplete form, and even then hedged it about with improbable conditions. President Leonid Kravchuk has said he will wait for a new Rada to be elected in March before putting the new agreement to the vote. Until now western leaders have shown little patience with Ukraine's democratic procedures. Mr Clinton on Tuesday at least broke with that tradition, expressing his confidence in Mr Kravchuk and remarking that 'executives often have to sell to their legislative branches what they know is in the national interest of their country'. The west seems also to have realised that Ukraine's demands for financial compensation and security guarantees, even if over-optimistic, are not wholly unreasonable. Yet Ukrainians would be foolish indeed if they imagined that the independence and integrity of their new state can be effectively secured either by nuclear weapons or by carefully worded western guarantees, or indeed by western financial aid. Such things can only be complements to any nation's security. The first prerequisite is a united people, confident of its national identity and generating the resources to defend it. Two years ago, when Ukraine became independent by the free choice of more than 90 per cent of its voters, cutting across ethnic and regional divisions, that kind of security seemed within reach. Most of the 11m ethnic Russians in the country were happy to become Ukrainian citizens, believing this the route to prosperity. Mr Kravchuk has sought to maintain this somewhat adventitious national unity by avoiding painful economic decisions. But this policy has had precisely the opposite effect. There is hyperinflation, together with steeply falling production and acute energy shortages. Ukraine's economic predicament is now such that many of its inhabitants see Russia as an oasis of golden riches - not least in Crimea where candidates in this week's presidential election are vying with each other in pro-Russian rhetoric. Ukraine's desperate need, apparently not perceived by its rulers, is for genuine economic reform. Without this, it may soon have to choose between a return to Russian hegemony, the secession of Crimea and possibly other Russified regions, or a downward spiral of ethnic conflict such as has already made a mockery of independence in several other ex-Soviet republics.</p>

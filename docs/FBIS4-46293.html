			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 May -- An attempt was made on the life of  Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev on 27 May. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent learned this from Chechnya's press and information  ministry today.    The attempt occurred at 1900 hours along the road to Groznyy  when the motorcade in which the president was travelling passed  a Lada car parked on the side of the road. The blast from the  powerful car bomb killed Interior Minister Magomet Eldiyev, his  deputy Saidali Batayev, and the driver of their car, who were  accompanying the president. The car in which the Chechen  president was riding was thrown 10 meters by the explosion, but  the president was not hurt.    ITAR-TASS learned from Shirlai Pashayev, Chechnya's deputy  minister for information and the press, that components of a  remote control triggering device were found at the scene of the  attempt. According to Pashayev, similar devices have not been  used before on the territory of the Chechen Republic. An  investigation is under way.    A decision was adopted at an emergency sitting of the  Chechen  cabinet of ministers today to declare Sunday, 29 May, a day of  mourning.</p>

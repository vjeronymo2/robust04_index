			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / The strange case of Dr Mitty: Dominic Lawson asks what it takes to give a person an air of authority DOCTOR Muhammed Saeed, 64, stands in the dock of Leeds Crown Court accused of working illegally as a general practitioner for the past 30 years. The prosecution alleges that the man had assumed the identity and qualifications of a 73-year-old Doctor Muhammed Saeed, who qualified with a Batchelor of Medicine and Surgery degree from the University of Punjab, Lahore, in 1949. The younger Muhammed Saeed is alleged to have used a duplicate of this certificate to register with the British General Medical Council in 1961. Since then, young Saeed has run a surgery in Bradford, West Yorkshire, with 3,000 patients. The prosecution alleges that the man was 'bogus' and 'was running a sub-standard surgery with sub-standard facilities with a low regard for cleanliness . . . this man is ignorant of medicine and ignorant of the breadth of medicine available and is capable of many prescribing errors.' Only time, and the jury at Leeds Crown Court, will tell whether young Saeed is guilty or innocent of the charge of deception. It brings to my mind an earlier and quite different case in which a man far younger even than young Saeed successfully masqueraded as a surgeon in a National Health Service hospital. He performed a number of minor operations successfully before he was detected as a fantasist who had always dreamt of being a surgeon, a dream nourished by a collection of Emergency Ward 10 videos. The poor man was defrocked of his white coat, to end up at an institution in the care of other men in white coats. Were they real doctors? - The coat is essential to the trick. On a more mundane level, I recall the antics of a parsimonious friend with a large appetite who, living near a large hospital, would at lunchtime don a white coat and walk into the hospital canteen. Naturally, the more often he went, the less likely it was that he would be challenged. But Mr Doctor Saeed has been practising 'real' medicine for over 30 years, without raising suspicion. If, as the prosecution allege, he was not genuine, then it is the greatest example of a successful placebo test in the history of medicine, showing that it is not just fake pills that can cure or treat a patient, but even a fake doctor and a fake surgery. Nor would this be very surprising. All we require from a GP is a sense of authority and the hope that he or she will send us to hospital if we are ill and he has no idea why or with what. The sense of authority comes simply from the fact that we believe the man actually is a doctor, and if young Saeed happened to send rather more of his patients to hospital than is normal, that would be no bad thing. The worst doctors are those who are not aware of the limits to their own knowledge. The prosecution would claim that young Saeed was only too well aware. Paradoxically, the greater the position of authority, the more likely people are to be fooled or convinced. I recall a conversation with a political observer of some note in the early days of the recent General Election campaign - when it was fashionable, indeed obligatory, to rubbish the Prime Minister. Major, said this disenchanted observer to me, was a Walter Mitty figure who had, by some bizarre twist of fate, been propelled from obscurity into the job of Prime Minister. The pundit explained it was actually very easy to persuade people that one really was the Prime Minister, prime ministerial even. One lives at the right address, and was driven around in the right sort of car, with the right sort of bodyguards. And one had all the resources of the Civil Service at one's disposal, to give one a plausible prepared answer to any tricky questions that might be put. Then the pundit tapped his nose. 'But now Mr Major must do without his civil servants' - the equivalent of Dr Saeed's nurse, perhaps 'and once he is all alone on the hustings, the electorate will suddenly realise that he is not really the Prime Minister after all, but just Walter Mitty.' Well, they didn't. Which, I suppose the Labour-voting pundit would argue, shows that you can fool 41 per cent of the people all the time. Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator.</p>

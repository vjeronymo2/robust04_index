			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Shakhnoza Ganiyeva; from the "Novosti" </F> newscast]    [Text] [Announcer] The news from Tashkent is connected with  bank notes:    [Ganiyeva] A new decision by the cabinet has been published  in Uzbekistan. The decision stipulates that bank notes issued  by the Central Bank of Russia will no longer be accepted for any  form of payment anywhere in the Republic from 15 April onward.  However, commercial organizations and enterprises, as well as  private individuals, will be allowed to sell goods and services  for freely convertible currency. Exchange rates between the sum  coupon, the national currency, and foreign currencies will be  fixed in regular auctions at the Uzbek currency exchange,  bearing in mind the need to maintain parity between prices on  the domestic and foreign markets.    In order to establish a gold and hard currency reserve in  the  country, all enterprises, irrespective of their form of  ownership, will now be obliged to sell the Central Bank 30  percent of their hard currency earnings. From 1 May, all  Uzbekistan's settlements with CIS countries will be transacted  solely through clearing or in freely convertible currency.</p>

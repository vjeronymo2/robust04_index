			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After visiting several cities in the former  Yugoslavia, including Sarajevo, Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of  the UN secretary general, and head of the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] in the former Yugoslavia, held talks today in  Belgrade with Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska  republic. They discussed all the issues that are currently  complicating the situation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina [as  heard], particularly certain demands by the international  community issued to the leadership of the Srpska republic.    [Begin recording] [Akashi, in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] There should be no difficulties  concerning the rotation of the UNPROFOR troops in Srebrenica,  and I hope that this rotation, based on this agreement, will be  completed by the end of February.    As for the opening of Tuzla airport, I believe that Dr.  Karadzic is keeping an open mind. He wants to explore our  suggestions. He has to consult his assembly, but we are ready  to take into account his concerns regarding the security and  other aspects of this.    We have a clear mandate from the UN secretary general to  open  the airport by peaceful means, by negotiations, but if that is  not successful, then there is the possibility of the use of a  minimum of force for self-defense. However, I am sure that we  agree that we will do everything possible to avoid that kind of  an escalation.    [Unidentified correspondent] How do you understand the  latest  mandate that you have been given by Mr. Butrus-Ghali? The  foreign press carries different interpretations of that mandate.    [Akashi] I have explained many times to the distinguished  members of the press that the secretary general has given me a  mandate to call for NATO air support for self-defense for our  troops. This is different from air strikes for offensive  purposes. Neither the secretary general nor I have the right to  initiate such attacks. Even NATO would have to go back to  consult the NATO Council to solve that issue, the issue of air  strikes.    We are talking about something specific here, about the air  support for the self-defense of our troops.    [Karadzic] We have completely clarified the issue of  Srebrenica with Mr. Akashi, General Rose, and their associates,  and we do not believe that this will be a problem. The Dutch  troops are already in Srebrenica, and we believe that the  Canadian UNPROFOR will be completely replaced by the Dutch  forces by the end of February.    As for the opening of the airport in Tuzla, we understand  the  efforts of the international community to increase the inflow of  humanitarian aid into the Tuzla region. Last time we offered  Mrs. Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, to double,  even treble, the number of humanitarian land convoys, and we are  ready to increase the inflow of convoys for Tuzla, and that has  already happened. Larger amounts of food are already reaching  Tuzla.    I am afraid that the issue of opening Tuzla airport could  become more of a psychological than a realistic one,  psychological in the sense that the international community  could, that is, some belligerent members of the international  community could use this as a form of exerting further pressure.  We do not reject in principle the notion of it, but it is too  major a decision for any one Serbian official to make by  himself. That has to be decided by our assembly. [end recording]</p>

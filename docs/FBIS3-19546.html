			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hilde Harbo: "New Spanish Quota Demands Will Be </F> Rejected"]    [Text] Brussels -- Norway does not have many fish to give.  That is the clear position of the Norwegian Government before  the negotiations with the EU today.    If Spain, in today's anticipated last and decisive round of  talks, comes up with new quota demands over and above the total  of 3,000 tonnes of cod to which Norway has agreed, then,  according to the main Norwegian negotiators, the answer will be  an unequivocal "no."    Norway will only start its negotiations late in the  afternoon, after the Council of Ministers has discussed its  institutional problems at the beginning of the meeting at 1300  [1200 GMT] today. "We have no more resources to give," Foreign  Minister Bjorn Tore Godal told journalists at a news conference  yesterday. He rejected any talk of the "EEA [European Economic  Area] quota" being stretched any further. Fisheries Minister  Jan Henry T. Olsen also answered with a straight "no" when asked  whether Norway will give up any more fish if the total permitted  fishing quota increases further in the next few years. When  asked how such an assurance by the Norwegians could be relied  upon when the claim that Norway had "not one fish to give" had  already become 3,000 tonnes, Godal replied: "We can discuss  until we are blue in the face whether stretching the EEA  agreement actually constitutes giving any fish. I call it  adjusting or stretching the implementation of the EEA  agreement," he said, referring to the fact that Spain will  receive these quotas in 1995 rather than 1997.  <H5>  Meeting With Solana </H5>   Yesterday afternoon, Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen  had a meeting with EU Fisheries Commissioner Yannis  Paleokrassas. A meeting with the Portuguese fisheries minister  was also planned for late yesterday evening. Meanwhile, the  appointment which aroused the greatest excitement was the  planned meeting between Foreign Minister Godal and his Spanish  colleague Javier Solana. Godal and Solana met late yesterday  evening in the Spanish ambassador's private residence in  Brussels. Attempts were made to conceal the venue of the  meeting from the press. When Godal emerged from the meeting  after 75 minutes, he reported that Spain was not advancing  fisheries demands in the usual manner but that the Spaniards  felt they were being pressured within the EU. Godal emphasized  that the meeting had taken place in a comfortable atmosphere.  He presented his colleague with a cigar, but not a single fish.  <H5>  Problem Areas </H5>   In addition to the technical fisheries issue, which it is  hoped will be solved at senior official government level this  morning, there still remain four additional so-called "problem  areas," namely the issues of resources, administration north of  the 62nd parallel, market access, and licensing regulations  associated with access to territorial waters. Olsen stated that  yesterday's meetings did not result in any rapprochement between  the parties concerned, other than on the question of market  access.    "At the outset, Norway had accepted EU demands for a system  to monitor imports of Norwegian herring, mackerel, shrimp,  salmon, lobster, and scallops," Olsen said yesterday evening.  It is still unclear, however, how long such a monitoring system  will remain in place.    "The important thing is that the Norwegian fishing industry  can continue like today, without being subjected to worse  conditions," he added. The fisheries minister was extremely  sober in describing the chances of resolving the remaining  fisheries problems: "My feeling is that we have an arduous road  ahead of us," he said. Olsen believed that the day's  negotiations will decide whether Norway will arrive at a  solution: "The EU wants to have us as a Member State, but it  remains to be seen to what extent it will accept that Norway has  some distinguishing characteristics which must be taken into  account." He did not want to go into details regarding the  solutions that Norway can accept on the matter of administering  fish north of the 62nd parallel. "However, the decisive thing  for me is that we get a regime under which we can feel safe in  the knowledge that our system can continue as it is," he said.    In addition to fish matters, a formal statement on the  whaling issue still has to be made, and the question surrounding  a protocol establishing that Norway can continue its policy of  openness in administration has yet to be addressed.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (7): Concern over market mechanisms - Japan's relations with the EC JAPAN'S relations with the EC are meant to be governed by the high flown commitments of their joint Hague declaration, adopted in July last year which talks of a deepening partnership based upon the common ideals of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Making the ideals of the Hague declaration a reality will be a long hard slog. Nothing could better symbolise the difficulties which the EC faces in establishing its legitimacy and leverage with the Japanese authorities than the arrival of Mr Jean-Pierre Leng, the EC's current ambassador to Japan. National ambassadors usually present their credentials to the Emperor. But previous EC ambassadors had been shuffled to one side and asked to present their credentials only to the foreign minister and latterly to the prime minister. With Mr Leng's arrival the EC made it clear, politely but firmly, that it expected its ambassador to be treated on a par with ambassadors from its member-states. Mr Leng did indeed visit the Imperial Palace to present his credentials to the Emperor. But only after a significant delay to his arrival in Japan. The EC's relations with Japan are clouded and complicated by several factors. Japan has a much more developed and intense relationship with the US, which has played a vital role in Japan's economic and political development since World War II. Moreover the strategic and economic aspects of Japan's relations with the US are deeply intwined. The nitty gritty of trade discussions have been conducted within Japan's reliance upon the overarching framework of US foreign policy. The strategic relationship between the US and Japan has always been an important counterweight to growing friction over trade. Not only is Europe's relationship with Japan less intense, it also largely lacks the balance of this strategic political dimension. The Hague declaration was an attempt to lay the foundations for such a relationship. But it has not got very far according to an EC review of its relations with Japan written in May this year. It said: 'Progress on political dialogue has so far fallen short of expectations. There has been difficulty for reasons of timing in keeping to the schedule of meetings and when they have taken place they have shown that the dialogue between the Community and Japan falls behind that between the Community and the US, whereas the two should be more nearly on the same level.' Senior officials at the Japanese foreign ministry regard an integrated Europe as central to the architecture of a stable international order in the wake of the end of the cold war. However, that recognition of the historic significance of European integration will not be immediately reflected in Japanese policy. The EC and Japan have sharply differing approaches towards aid to Russia. Japan insists it will not give bilateral aid until its dispute with Russia over the Northern Territory islands off Japan's northern tip, is settled. The intricacies of EC politics are not easy to follow from Tokyo. This reflects cultural and practical difficulties. Mr Seamus Gillespie, economic and financial counsellor at the EC embassy in Tokyo remarked :'Japan is quite culturally and ethnically homogenous. It has a quite centralised political system. It is difficult for the Japanese to recognise the diversity and fertility of political forms within a multinational Europe.' Japan's approach is further complicated by the varying strength of its bilateral relations with different EC member-states, in which the UK, the main destination for recent Japanese manufacturing investment is often presented as Japan's main friend in Europe. Some EC officials say Japan still plays off member-states against one another, for instance over inward investment into Europe when it needs to. However, EC officials in Tokyo say the differences between member-states are narrowing, policy-making is becoming more cohesive and, with it, the EC's credibility in Japan is improving. Mr Mark Bedingham, chairman of the European Business Council says: 'It can often be laborious and time-consuming to gather a common EC view on trade issues, first among industry and then getting it on to the Brussels agenda. But the EC is now accepted as the central body for trade negotiations and progress has been made in some important sectoral issues such as wines and spirits, and pharmaceutical testing.' The costs of a lack of well-developed strategic relationship and a machinery to match it, could be cruelly exposed in the next few years because trade tensions between the EC and Japan could worsen. Over the next decade, the single European market could become as important to Japanese industry as the North American market. However, Europe lacks both the political relationship and the institutional machinery with Japan to deal effectively with growing trade tensions. Japan's trade surplus this year will grow to a record high and its surplus with the EC is growing at a faster rate than with the US. The May review of EC relations with Japan said the heart of the trade problem was 'the structural obstacles which are currently the main barriers to doing business in Japan, whether by exporting or by investing there. Although some progress has been made through increase in infrastructure expenditure, more vigorous enforcement of anti-trust legislation and some liberalisation of distribution, the pace of structural reform remains frustratingly slow despite declarations of intention by successive governments.' The review identified the main problem as a failure of market mechanisms due to 'ineffective competition policy, exclusive business practices, close and often obscure relations between the public authorities and the private sector and the over regulation of certain sectors.' Concern over these issues has led the EC to adopt a much tougher formal approach to monitoring its trade relations with the Japan, by comparing market share for EC industries in Japan with their shares in comparable third country markets. EC officials insist that as yet there is no justification or reason for a European version of the structural impediments initiative approach to trade launched by the US in 1989. However, the EC is concerned that increasing bilateral trade negotiations between the US and Japan may discriminate against European producers. If the Japanese trade surplus grows next year while the European economic growth slows the EC may come under pressure to adopt a more assertive approach to trade. The long hard slog may be about to become longer and harder than first thought.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By diplomatic </F> correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] As INTERFAX learned from Russia's Foreign Ministry,  the chairman of Tajikistan's parliament, Emomali Rakhmonov,  arrives in Moscow at about 1530 on Thursday for a one-day  working visit.    "Rakhmonov expressed his wish to come to Moscow to confer  with President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin long ago," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told  INTERFAX.    According to him, the Tajik leader intends to discuss with  the Russian premier a package of economic issues. "These will  include primarily the prospects for Tajikistan's joining the  ruble area. Judging by the information available to us, Dushanbe  will accept any conditions advanced by Russia," the diplomat  said.    At his meeting with Yeltsin Rakhmonov will discuss political  problems, he noted. "As far as we know, Rakhmonov would like to  discuss with the Russian leader the situation in Tajikistan and  on the border with Afghanistan," the official said.    The draft of a new constitution was published in Tajikistan  recently, INTERFAX's interviewee said. "The Tajik leadership is  working on different ways to accomplish reforms, and it would  like to secure Russia's support in this respect," he said.    On Friday Rakhmonov is to confer with the head of Russian  diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, the diplomat said. The two men will  focus on problems connected with the inter-Tajik dialogue, the  first round of which was held in Moscow recently. "Russia is not  only interested in furthering the talks between the Dushanbe  government and the Tajik opposition; it intends to nudge the two  sides toward a political solution to their conflict," he said.    INTERFAX's interviewee found it hard to say when and where  the next round of inter-Tajik talks will take place. "This will  depend largely on the special envoy of the U.N. secretary  general for Tajikistan, Piris Ballon, who intends to make a tour  of the region shortly," he said. "He is likely to choose either  Tehran or Islamabad."</p>

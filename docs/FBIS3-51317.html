			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ligia Moreno from "The News" newscast; monitored </F> in progress]    [Text] ...he indicated that Banco Latino had been excluded  from the clearinghouse system by the Central Bank of Venezuela  on 13 January after Banco Latino was unable to pay off the debt  balance of more than 4 billion bolivares by the clearinghouse's  close of business on Wednesday, 12 January, due to insufficient  funds in the deposit account at the bank of issue. That is why  this institution resorted to the Simon Bolivar Center, whose  representative is Engineer Cesar Rodriguez, governor of Caracas.    [Begin Rodriguez recording] Banco Latino and its board of  directors know of the efforts made by the Simon Bolivar Center  to pay off nearly 14 billion bolivares, including interest, a  debt that is over 15 years old. I received the authorization  from the Council of Ministers to make the payment at 1030 on  Thursday, 13 January. I left Simon Bolivar Center at 1500, and  it is possible that I may have arrived there a few minutes after  1600 to sign the document and turn in the bonds, which the  Central Bank knew had been delivered by the Finance Ministry a  few hours before, meaning late in the afternoon on Wednesday, 12  January. The situation is not, as some reports indicate, an  operation in which the Simon Bolivar Center and I had the bonds  for a long time. The Finance Ministry issued the bonds and  sent them to the Central Bank only 20 hours earlier. The  finance minister, a member of the assembly at the Simon Bolivar  Center, wanted this operation to be approved by the president in  a Council of Ministers meeting. As you can see, the operation  was carried out after the bonds were received. It was an  operation that lasted less than 24 hours. All efforts that  could be made were made. I was really surprised to see that an  institution as strong as this, one of the largest banks in the  country -- the second largest in the country in deposits -- was  about to collapse just because the president of the Simon  Bolivar Center got there a minute early or a minute late. [end  recording]    The Superintendency of Banks, however, took over bank duties  with all the powers of administration, management, control, and  surveillance, including all powers granted by the law in these  cases, after the government's announcement to shut the doors of  Banco Latino was made.    [Begin recording] [Presidency Secretary Ramon Espinoza] We  want to find the means to protect the public's savings accounts  and finally guarantee that savings account holders can have  access to their money as soon as possible.    [Superintendent of Banks Roger Urbina] The  government-apppointed administrator will have a 90-day term to  conduct the audits that will allow them to determine the precise  financial status of Banco Latino. Based on this report, all the  neccessary measures will be taken to sell the bank to private  national or foreign investors in an effort to keep the  institution working. According to the financial mechanisms  established in the bank laws, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund --  Fondo de Garantia de Depositos] will contribute resources to  Banco Latino so its clients can begin withdrawing from their  savings accounts as soon as possible according to the procedures  determined by the government-appointed administrator, which will  be announced at the proper time. In this program, priority will  be given to small savings account holders. At any rate, it is  important to note that Fogade guarantees deposits up to 1  million bolivares according to Article 127 of the Bank Law. The  Superintendency of Banks is also studying preventive measures  for the remainder of the financial institutions that make up the  Latino Group. [end recording]    Despite the announcement, Banco Latino issued a communique  to  the public because its president, Giacomo Leon, refused to speak  to the media. In the communique, Banco Latino assures the  nation of its willingness to respect the government's decision  and to cooperate as much as possible in protecting the interests  of those who have trusted in them for the last 43 years.    The institution thanks its personnel for their cooperation  and hopes to overcome the problems faced by the banking  institution caused by a criminal campaign of rumors that led to  an excessive withdrawal of funds, which led to the subsequent  closure of Banco Latino.</p>

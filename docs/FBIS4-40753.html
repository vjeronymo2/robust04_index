			<p>BFN     [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin felt Industrial recession could  be over in Russia as early as next month. An analysis of  economic developments gave hope for that, Chernomyrdin told a  reporter for Interfax before boarding a flight for Milan, on  Sunday. The key economic indices showed no recession in June,  he said, so that next month Russia could establish itself on a  bridgehead for economic stabilization.    Chernomyrdin saw financial stabilization as one of his main  achievements. He felt that in conformity with government plans  monthly inflation rate would not top 7 to 9 percent at the end  of 1994. Action could, but would not, be taken to reduce  inflation rate to zero, he said.    The Chernomyrdin Cabinet assigned priority to work on the  second stage of its privatization scheme, the endorsement of a  final draft of the country's budget for 1994, the solution of  the problem of delayed payments and an analysis of the economic  developments of the first six months of 1994.    It was also essential, he said, that the government move to  lure more investment, including domestic, in the economy.  Foreign investment was equally important, he said.    On June 27 he would call a sitting of the investment  policies  council. The world's leading business executives had been  invited to attend, he said.</p>

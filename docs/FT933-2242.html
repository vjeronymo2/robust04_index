			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: The irony of Morocco playing host Sir, King Hassan of Morocco enjoyed something of a publicity coup as a result of the recent Middle East peace settlement. First, Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, arrived in Washington on a Moroccan aircraft; then Israeli prime minister Yitzak Rabin's first port of call his way back home was Rabat. Nothing wrong, it should be said, with an Arab leader getting in on the wider rapprochement between Israel and the Arab states. But is there not some irony in Hassan playing host while his country remains in illegal occupation of another country, the Western Sahara? The Moroccan army moved into the Western Sahara eight years after Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza. Despite UN involvement, there seems little sign that Hassan intends to allow the inhabitants of the Western Sahara a free vote on their future. Perhaps Arafat or Rabin, or even better US secretary of state Warren Christopher, should point out to Hassan that if he wants to play a part in the new Middle East, he should put his own house in order. Like the Palestinians, the Saharawi people have been waiting too long for the opportunity to exercise their right to self-determination.

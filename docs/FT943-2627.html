			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Private View: The general who picked up a briefcase Like so many successful career soldiers, Fidel Ramos is a small man. He was sitting behind an enormous desk in the Hotel de Crillon in Paris this week gently mashing an unlit cigar. 'Can I offer you a cigar?' he said. Thank you - I've given them up. 'I have too. But I have to promote our best export product, you see, and this is one way of eliciting interest.' He smiled benignly. When the head of a turbulent country like the Philippines feels secure enough to take an extended business tour of Europe, things have surely changed. Ramos is a large part of the reason for that change. A former enforcer for Ferdinand Marcos, his second cousin, he led the 'people's power' revolution against the Marcos dictatorship in 1986 and quashed seven attempted coups to protect successor Cory Aquino before running for the presidency himself. For the last nine days Ramos has been travelling with a large retinue between Rome, Madrid, Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt to confirm his democratic credentials and trumpet his country's newly-acquired stability and economic growth. Long famous for its poverty, civil turmoil, crony capitalism, foreign indebtedness, tax evasion and bureaucratic corruption, the Philippines is now being hailed as the latest addition to Asia's economic tigers. Ramos himself is credited with pacifying or neutralising the Communist, Moslem and far-right military rebels. He even claims to have pacified the Catholic Church to which 85 per cent of the 66m Filipinos belong. Church leaders - including the outspoken Cardinal Jaime Sin - attacked his government's birth control programme as an invitation to vice and sexual perversion. A Methodist who keeps a statue of the Madonna in his office, Ramos on this tour enjoyed a private audience with the Pope. They met as the Vatican was fighting its corner at the UN conference on population control in Cairo, so I asked Ramos if they had discussed family planning and artificial contraception. 'To tell you frankly, the Holy Father and I have been exchanging letters since early May. I pointed out in my letters that in the Philippines the family is considered as the basic social unit, the very key to the survival of the nation.' There was no disagreement on principles, he added. 'The freedom of conscience, we say in government, is the basic freedom which we protect. It's up to married couples to determine what kind of life they would like to have for themselves and for their children.' Is the church too powerful? 'It's a matter of opinion, I guess. But if you look at the recent elections, the Catholic Church, as far as I can see, did not try and impose its collective authority in favour of any candidate or set of candidates.' What are your relations with Cardinal Sin like? 'Very good. I kid him all the time because for the last seven or eight years I have been attending his birthday parties, on his invitation. We both belong to the class of 1928 - we were born the same year.' Ramos's former jobs as head of the feared paramilitary police and national police under Marcos seem to have been forgiven him as he pursues economic success under democratic rule, a rare combination for Asia. You grew up in an authoritarian regime, I said. How can you satisfy people that you will not one day want to seek more power to drive your programme through? 'I think you must understand that being in the military as a career does not make you a dictator, per se,' he said. 'We couldn't stand the dictatorship. That's why we got together with the people and Mrs Aquino and many other military professionals to throw out the dictator. The record is there and can speak for itself. 'So what are we guaranteeing to the western investor? A government that is very stable, democratic, predictable, transparent, continuous.' They call you 'Steady Eddie', I said. Some would say you are going too slowly, too cautiously. 'You have to judge the performance by the result. What is important for me is to start properly. There are some critics who think I should be charging all over the place on a white horse, which is the usual dramatics of Philippine politics. But I am different. 'We have seen how Philippine politics in the traditional pattern have failed. They have not provided for the livelihood of the people. It was basically an oligarchy and there was a mistaken idea that there must be drama, charisma, fire and a lot of special effects taking place, forgetting that you must first put in the fundamentals. And this is what I have done.' He cited the end of power cuts as an example. Ramos has never been accused of flamboyance. But on his birthday he used to enjoy parachuting into the party - one year he descended with a crate of beer, another with a live goat for the barbecue. If you are calm and steady, I said, is that due to your military training, your Methodist upbringing? 'No, it's because of me. All of those things impacted on the making of me. But I would give credit to discipline, specially self-discipline. You don't have to go to military school to learn that. But going through an institution like West Point helps.' (He won a place at the tough US military academy against 400 of his countrymen.) 'I have also seen the best and the worst in Philippine society, precisely because this was the nature of my military career. As a military man, very early on, I saw that poverty, injustice in the Philippines was not to be solved by military means but by the removal of the root causes.' Ramos, born in Pangasinan in the north of the country, describes his background as middle-class but not wealthy. His father was a reporter who became a congressman, ambassador and foreign secretary. His mother was a public school teacher 'very charming, a very effective campaigner who was loved by ordinary people because she knew how to relate to them'. A younger sister, Letty, went into politics before him and is the country's second-ranking senator. The president and his wife Amelita 'Ming' Martinez have five daughters, one of whom, on holiday from Hong Kong, was sitting among the officials in the room as he spoke. I forebore, therefore, to ask Ramos about the allegation in a Manila newspaper last year - not apparently so far denied - that behind him is a powerful mistress. When I asked a senior aide about it afterwards he smiled ambiguously and said: 'Maybe it was a long time ago.' The soldier-president, sometimes likened to General Eisenhower, says he has all his life been affected by the devastation of war - first as a boy during the second world war, then as a combat soldier in the Korean War, later as a fighter of his own country's insurgents. In Vietnam, he headed a non-combatant unit sent in to repair roads and bridges and distribute medical relief. Civic action, a military form of community help, had been an important theme of his life, he said, and his overall responsibility as a former deputy chief of staff. Later, under Cory Aquino, he was put in charge of relief operations for the huge earthquake of 1990. When did you start having presidential ambitions? 'After seeing that the economic empowerment of the people had not yet been put in place towards the end of President Aquino's term, I decided to go for it. 'By that time I had helped Mrs Aquino overcome seven coup attempts against her government and I felt the economic setbacks resulting from these upheavals, and then the terrible natural disasters (the earthquake, followed by the eruption of Mt Pinatubo and a succession of typhoons) convinced me that someone who knew how to do it must take over. 'Another factor you might say that convinced me to go for it was the clamour of people that were with me during the people power revolution who did not see much improvement over the years that followed. They said I must finish the unfinished revolution.' In getting to the top were you lucky or clever? 'It's not because of religion, or schooling,' he repeated. 'I am saying it's because of me. That's the way I was made.' When I asked him what he read he mentioned Alvin Toffler, Paul Kennedy, and John Naisbitt of 'Megatrends' fame. 'I do read a lot and I write a lot, in the sense of writing my own stuff - speeches for instance. I'm happy to give you some samples later on.' He held up some notes. My time was up, but President Ramos allowed one more question. So I mentioned the thousands of Filipino women who do menial work in Europe and the Middle East, often to support children they have left behind, and often exploited in the process. Are their remittances a welcome feature of the economy, I asked, or is their presence an embarrassment to you? 'No, we are just practical about this. The jobs are here but we are generating jobs now in the Philippines so that we can keep many of our nationals at home. But this will take time.' Ramos pointed to the doubling, to more than 5 per cent, of GNP growth in the first half of this year. 'We are optimistic that the creation of jobs will happen.' I got up to leave and the president, who had been busily writing in a book, handed the volume to me across the wide desk. 'You might find this interesting, too,' he said. It was a colour magazine with a picture of a man scuba diving among wrecks. When I got outside among the throng of protocol and security men, the smiling attache pointed to the caption. The scuba diver was unflamboyant Steady Eddie himself.</p>

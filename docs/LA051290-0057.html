			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : SILVERMAN TAKES HIGH-TECH ROAD BACK TO STAGE IN 'ILLUSION' AT  LATC  </P> <P> Jonathan Silverman is in a play that's very hard to describe.  </P> <P> "I usually tell people it's about a father searching for his son, who goes to a  sorcerer, who conjures up the son's image . . . yeah, really boring" he  concedes. Fact is, Pierre Corneille's "The Illusion" (at Los Angeles Theatre  Center through June 3) is anything but: a lushly landscaped high-tech voyage  through 17th- and 20th-Century passion, greed, betrayal and revenge.  </P> <P> "The key word is love -- dangerous love," says Silverman, 23, whose  swashbuckling lady-killer gets to woo femmes and do sword/gun battle in both  period costume (including ponytail and no shirt) and contemporary garb. "In  those days, people would do anything for love. Nowadays, people still do things  for love -- but we've found ways to get around it. We're a little more sneaky  now, a little more careful."  </P> <P> Not that he's suffering from an inactive love life. Silverman (who co-starred  in last year's "A Weekend at Bernie's") credits his dog, a "fabulous cocker  spaniel named Hank" as his biggest asset in the girl-getting department: "I  walk down the beach with him -- he's wearing his blue bandanna -- and all the  girls say, 'Aw, who's that?' "  </P> <P> The actor, who came to fame playing teen-age Eugene Jerome in the stage  versions of Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs" and "Broadway Bound" (which  he'll also reprise on film) will forsake the beach girls in June, when he's off  to New York to film "Life in the Food Chain" (a tentative title), followed by  "In Deep" in Texas. In-the-can films "Class Action" and "Sketches" are due out  this summer.  </P> <P> If there is any lingering identification as Neil Simon's alter-ego, the Beverly  Hills native takes it in stride. "It could be worse," he kids. "I could be  doing 'She's the Sheriff.' Instead, I'm having fun playing a studly romantic  lead -- who gets the girl." JANICE ARKATOV  </P></p>

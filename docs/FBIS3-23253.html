Dr. 'Ali Day, chairman of the City Council and an  ophthalmologist, has been arrested after investigations revealed  that he had recruited young men from Ramadan sports courses in  order to give them training in acts of violence at unpopulated  areas in Ra's al-Barr and (al-Dibah) this winter. [see previous  Terrorism Report]    A security source told AL-MUSAWWAR that the chairman of the  City Council, an ophthalmologist who had returned from Peshawar  and who was refused a job in the health department in Damietta,  took advantage of disputes among the National Democratic Party  members in recent elections and got elected. He was chosen from  among the Labor Party members to be chairman of the Damietta  City Council.    The source said that by observing these courses, it was  evident that the ages of the young men who underwent these  courses ranged from 16 to 20. He added: By following up on  this matter last week we found 12 minibuses carrying over 140  young men roaming Ra's al- Barr at 0730 in search of a place for  an obstacle course.    The source assured that the youths were not practicing  soccer  but conducting training on karate, violent games, and target  practice.</p>

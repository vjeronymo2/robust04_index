			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by John Rettie: "Oppressed of India' Turn on Gandhi"] </F>   [Text] Delhi -- For the first time since Mahatma Gandhi's  assassination 46 years ago, his role as the revered and saintly  "father of the nation" is being challenged by leaders of the  people he called Harijans or Children of God -- the Untouchables.    Now calling themselves Dalits -- the Oppressed -- the  leaders  of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which was swept to power in  the northern state of Uttar Pradesh last year, have denounced  Gandhi as "the biggest enemy of Dalits".    The upper castes who dominate the media, the bureaucracy and  the armed forces have reacted with outrage. But conscious of  the new-found voting power of the Dalits, India's Brahmin prime  minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, went to Bombay yesterday to  unveil a statue of their hero, the late Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar.    "Ambedkar carried out the daunting task of demanding rights  for the lowest people, but the still more daunting task of  implementing his ideals remains," Mr Rao said. "Only when caste  discrimination stops and political parties stop getting mileage  out of these divisions can we say his dream has come true."    Mr Rao was not the only one to cash in on the 103rd  anniversary of the birth of Ambedkar, the Untouchable who beat  the system by going to the United States and Britain, becoming a  brilliant lawyer and drafting India's constitution.    The leaders of many states and political parties attended  public meetings, to be seen garlanding his statues or unveiling  new ones.    The day emphasised what last November's elections had shown  -- that Dalits are at last demanding their rights.    Gandhi, whose trader caste is a sub-group of Vaishnya, third  on the overall scale, grew up as an orthodox Hindu, although he  opposed the denigration of Untouchables. For much of his life  he believed in caste as an orderly system of doing one's duty  and "following one's father's calling" which would protect India  from the greed and venality of the West. But as a result of his  long dispute with Ambedkar, he gradually accepted that the rigid  caste system was unjust, and he even advocated inter-caste  marriage.    To modern Dalit leaders this change was too little and too  late.    "Our society is still dominated by upper castes who are  chelas (disciples) of Gandhi" said Ms Mayawati, deputy leader of  the BSP.    "These people treat Gandhi as their god. I don't."    She accused him of "gestures smacking of tokenism" when he  helped Untouchables to clean latrines and shared meals with them  -- practices which caste Hindus regard as intolerably polluting.    "There is a new awakening among the Dalit masses who realise  that they were misled all these years," she declared. "This  awakening is bound to result in them becoming more assertive in  demanding their rights. If they don't get them, they'll fight."    The veteran socialist historian, sociologist and one-time MP  Madhu Limaye said the BSP was making a serious blunder. The  Dalits' situation was still bad, although, with reserved  positions for them in parliament, the bureaucracy and the  forces, "it is much better than in my youth".    "Mayawati and others are causing great harm to the Dalits  because they'll lose the sympathy of millions of Dalits who  respect Gandhi," he said.    While Gandhi has certainly been idolised in the past, even  by  many Dalits, the independent country he forged has done little  for the overwhelming majority of Dalits.    The BSP is the engine of their impatience, but whether it  can  be the vehicle that will solve their problems, is another  matter. Mr Limaye thinks not. He accused the BSP leader,  Kanshi Ram, of dismissing questions about his economic policies  by saying: "Just give us power, the rest will follow."    "A party with no policy for production and creating jobs has  no future," Mr Limaye declared. "It may not last for more than  three years."</p>

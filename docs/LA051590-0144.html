			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM REALIGNS MANAGEMENT;  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATION: THE LAGUNA ART MUSEUM CREATES AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR'S JOB. THE  DIRECTOR WILL DO MORE CURATING.  </P> <P> Bonnie Brittain Hall, outgoing development director at South Coast Repertory,  has been named associate director of administration at the Laguna Art Museum in  a restructuring that will free museum director Charles Desmarais to assume more  curatorial responsibilities.  </P> <P> Desmarais said that Hall, who announced her resignation from SCR last month,  will assume about a third of his administrative duties when she begins the  newly created job in Laguna on July 15. Hall and an assistant development  officer still to be hired will work on fund raising and other short- and  long-term development activities such as establishing an endowment, Desmarais  said.  </P> <P> The changes in management structure prompted the museum's current development  director, Lynn Kirst, to resign, Desmarais added. Kirst was unavailable for  comment. She has been at the museum about a year, and Desmarais said she will  leave May 22. Asked whether the museum had been dissatisfied with Kirst,  Desmarais replied: "I'd say (instead that) there are a lot of (fund-raising)  opportunities we want to pursue. That's why we're beefing up the development  side."  </P> <P> The restructuring also springs from the museum's failure to find a chief  curator to replace Michael McManus, who resigned in March, 1989. Although about  70 applications were received and several candidates interviewed, none seemed  just right, Desmarais said.  </P> <P> "So," he continued, "the next approach became: Perhaps the best thing would be  to beef up the administrative side and work on the curatorial myself." The  search for a chief curator has been abandoned, he said.  </P> <P> Desmarais said the changes will not affect his annual salary of $60,000.  Neither he nor Hall would disclose her salary. Desmarais said it will be more  than the $26,000 paid to McManus, and he would not say how much Kirst has been  making.  </P> <P> Desmarais said the decision to restructure was his and that the response from  the museum board executive committee has been "extremely enthusiastic. I  haven't talked to anyone that doesn't think (hiring Hall) is a real coup for  the museum," he said. Board President Claudette Y. Shaw was unavailable for  comment.  </P> <P> During Hall's seven years at SCR, the theater company raised $9 million in  capital and endowment funds and more than $7 million in operating funds. She  has not worked in the visual arts before, but she noted that her new  responsibilities "are primarily administrative."  </P> <P> Hall, who had said she was leaving SCR because there was no room for  advancement there, said Monday that she is undaunted by the Laguna museum's  deficit of about $72,000. Desmarais said he thinks that the 71-year-old museum,  which has an annual operating budget of $1.2 million, can end the present  fiscal year in the black through substantial grants, donations and a "tight  control" on expenses. Hall, however, said, "I think we can eradicate the  deficit within a year to 18 months."  </P> <P> Since being named museum director in September, 1988, Desmarais, 41, has helped  curate and organize exhibitions at the museum's main quarters in Laguna Beach  (now exhibiting a major career survey of Ilene Segalove that Desmarais curated  by himself) and at its South Coast Plaza satellite.  </P> <P> Desmarais said Monday that he will continue to curate exhibits at both sites,  emphasizing art produced since World War II. He stressed that the curatorial  change won't curtail associate curator Susan M. Anderson's exhibits of  pre-World War II art or the shows of curator of collections Bolton Colburn from  the museum's permanent collection of California art. Desmarais has a master's  degree in fine arts from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he  concentrated in museum studies and criticism.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An inaugural meeting of the government Committee for  Defense Matters has been in progress for an hour. The committee  is discussing a report on the state of Poland's defense prepared  by the Ministry of National Defense. Defense Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk said before the meeting that it would be a bad  thing if the NATO states give Russia a privileged position in  the Partnership for Peace program.    [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Such a solution would  contradict the idea of the Partnership. It is true that Russia  still remains a superpower and has the right to negotiate  various treaties with the United States and with NATO as a  whole, but not within the framework of the Partnership for Peace  initiative, which would then become doubtful. [end recording]    According to Minister Kolodziejczyk, the reduction of  Russian  troops from 200,000 to 25,000 in the Kaliningrad district may be  carried out soon.</p>

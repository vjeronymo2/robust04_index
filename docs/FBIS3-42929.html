			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Pushkov: "Kozyrev Has Begun Play on </F> Another's Home Field"]    [Text] Andrey Kozyrev's attempts to play Zhirinovskiy  on his field can only seriously damage Russian diplomacy.    Andrey Kozyrev's statement last week at a meeting with  ambassadors of Russia in states of the CIS and the Baltic evoked  a stormy reaction abroad and remains at the center of attention  as the "latest word" in the changing Russian foreign policy.  This, literally, is what Kozyrev said: "The CIS countries and  the Baltic are the area in which Russia's main vital interests  are concentrated. The main threats to these interests come from  there.... In my view, the framing of the question of the total  departure and removal of any military presence of Russia in the  states of the near abroad is just as extreme, if not extremist,  an approach as the idea of the dispatch of tanks to all the  republics and the establishment of some imperial order there...."    Despite the subsequent explanations of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and the refutations of Kozyrev himself, these  words were seen everywhere as Russia's intention to maintain the  Russian military presence in the Baltic republics and as a  consequence of the increased national-patriotic trends in  Moscow's policy.    It would have been hard to choose a less suitable time for  such words. They were heard several days after the departure  from Moscow of U.S. President Bill Clinton and a week after the  NATO Council session in Brussels, which had adopted the decision  to take account of Russian concern at the prospect of an  expansion of NATO and to postpone until some time in the future  the question of the admittance to the bloc of Poland, Hungary,  and the Czech Republic. These countries, like Russia also, were  offered partnership with NATO in the military-political sphere.    If Kozyrev has seen this turn of events and the decisive  support which Clinton expressed for Yeltsin in Moscow as  carte-blanche for toughening Russian policy in respect to the  near abroad, the Baltic countries primarily, this is a flagrant  miscalculation. There is no unity on the attitude toward Russia  either in NATO or even within the Clinton administration itself.  The delicate balance in favor of Russia which has been created  in the Western countries could be disturbed at any moment.  Particularly now, when the signals emanating from Moscow are  being scrutinized in the latter literally with a magnifying  glass in an attempt to discern in them possible influence on  Russian foreign policy on the part of conservatives and  nationalists.    Assertions are being heard increasingly loudly in the West  that a refusal to admit to NATO Poland, the Czech Republic, and  Hungary under pressure from Moscow is tantamount to appeasement  of a potential aggressor, that is, Russia, and that this bodes  ill. Had the supporters of such an approach, Warsaw  particularly, required new arguments in support of the argument  concerning a revival of the threat on the part of Russia,  Kozyrev has given them such.    Kozyrev has said repeatedly that he is pursuing the  president's foreign policy: the president formulates it, the  Foreign Ministry merely implements it.    It may be assumed, therefore, that Kozyrev was complying  with  a directive of Yeltsin himself, whose tone in respect to the  near abroad, Ukraine particularly, has become noticeably tougher  as of late. Nor can it be ruled out that the president was  extremely incensed by the recent arrest in Latvia of the head of  the group of Russian forces stationed there. Such anger is  entirely justified. But should we be paying Riga back in the  same coin, playing into the hands of the Lettish nationalists?  Especially since Riga apologized profusely to Moscow in this  connection. But instead of turning the situation--a potentially  winning one for us--to good account, the leader of the Foreign  Ministry decided to hew away with an ax, and ax work in  politics, as in other spheres also, for that matter, does not  produce good results.    A different scenario is, for that matter, more likely.  Availing himself of his sufficient freedom in determination of  our foreign policy positions, Kozyrev deemed it necessary to  take account of the new winds that have as of late been blowing  over Russia and blowing out of the government some of its  members. He decided, it would seem, to forestall events in order  to kill three birds with one stone: to create for himself the  image of a tougher politician, to shore up thereby his position  in the Chernomyrdin cabinet, and to display personal zeal to the  president.    Kozyrev "developed," as it were, Yeltsin's New Year's  statement of Russia's intent to defend more decisively the  rights of its compatriots in the near abroad (it elicited in the  West a heightened and somewhat unhealthy interest,  incidentally), but was extremely unsuccessful in so doing. If  the president, wishing to rectify a manifest failing in his  policy, decided to say "A," this does not mean that the minister  has immediately to blurt out all the other letters of the  alphabet.    Kozyrev has for some time now given the impression that he  wants to neutralize, as it were, the charges of constant  concessions to the West and of insufficiently active defense of  Russia's national interests by greater toughness in respect to  the countries of the near abroad. This calculation is, however,  very dangerous. First, because a desire to touch up his  hard-to-correct "image" of Westerner and "dove" could prompt the  minister to a severity in positions and statements which  harms--is already harming--Russia's interests. Kozyrev's own  efforts, for example, to secure for Russia a mandate of the  United Nations and the CSCE for peacekeeping operations in the  CIS. Second, because Kozyrev has already created an entirely  different image of Russian diplomacy in the West, and so abrupt  a change therein could evoke only wariness. People are already  puzzled there: Yesterday Kozyrev was saying one thing, today,  another, is Russia really, consequently, returning to an  imperial policy?    Finally, all this is creating the impression of attempts to  wrest the initiative from Zhirinovskiy. But only defeat could  await Kozyrev in such a contest. The sole solution here is to  counterpose to Zhirinovskiy's aggressive propaganda rhetoric a  profoundly considered policy of defense of our interests which  produces real results. In a word, Russia's policy in respect to  the near abroad undoubtedly does need adjusting, but Kozyrev is  hardly the most suitable figure for this.    And, finally, the hint heard in his recent television  appearances at Zhirinovskiy's "legal" origins--what has he got  to do with the Russian people and the defense of their  rights?--can evoke nothing but consternation. Vladimir Volfovich  will hardly be outdone in the use of such methods. But one's own  reputation could be damaged conclusively.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG FETUS 'VIABILITY' UNCHANGED, COURT TOLD;  </P> <P> SCIENTISTS CONTEND THAT MEDICAL GAINS HAVE NOT INCREASED CHANCES OF SURVIVAL  OUTSIDE WOMB  </P> <P> A group of distinguished scientists and physicians, including 11 Nobel Prize  winners, told the Supreme Court Friday that -- despite medical advances -- a  fetus cannot survive outside its mother's womb before it is 24 weeks old.  </P> <P> The so-called "point of viability" of a fetus has not changed significantly  since the high court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling making abortion legal, the  scientists said in a friend-of-the-court brief. Critics of the abortion  decision have maintained that it has been rendered obsolete by advances in  medical technology that have moved back the point of viability.  </P> <P> The brief was submitted in conjunction with a pending case from Missouri  (Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, 88-605). Many legal experts believe  that the high court will use this abortion appeal to revise the legal abortion  standards it set in the landmark Roe ruling. The justices will hear arguments  on the case April 26.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State's Interests Cited  </P> <P> In the 1973 opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote that abortion was entirely  a matter for a woman and her doctor during the first trimester of a 36-week  pregnancy. But the state's "important and legitimate interests" in protecting  the fetus become significant "at viability," which he said occurred sometime  during the second trimester.  </P> <P> The issue of "viability" has not proved to be crucial in the court's later  abortion rulings because the court's majority has struck down virtually all  state attempts to limit abortion. Nevertheless, critics of the Roe decision,  including Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, repeatedly have asserted that Blackmun's  three-trimester framework must be reconsidered because of medical advances  allowing ever smaller and younger fetuses to survive outside the womb.  </P> <P> The Justice Department, in a brief filed a month ago, also said that the  "viability standard (in the Roe decision) is particularly unworkable as a  constitutional reference point because . . . the point when a fetus may survive  outside the womb with artificial aid changes with advancements in medical  skill."  </P> <P> But the Nobel laureates' brief, which was signed by 156 other scientists and  medical experts, said that there have not been great advances substantially  improving the survival chances of very young fetuses.  </P> <P> "Although advances in technology have improved the chances of survival for  premature births within the range of 24 to 28 weeks, the outer limit of  viability at 24 weeks has not significantly changed," the brief says.  "Moreover, there is no reason to believe that a change in this outer limit is  either imminent or inevitable.  </P> <P> "This court's decision in Roe vs. Wade is as well-grounded in biological  justifications today as in 1973, and the basic chronology of human development  recognized in the court's opinion remains accurate," the brief continued.  </P> <P> Doctors have not been able to save fetuses younger than 24 weeks because  critical organs, particularly the lungs and kidneys, are not developed enough.  "Air sac development sufficient for gas exchange (in the lungs) does not occur  until at least 23 weeks after gestation and often later," the brief said.  </P> <P> The scientists admitted that they cannot answer the fundamental question of  when a human life begins. "There is no scientific consensus" on that point and  the answer "will depend on each individual's social, religious, philosophical,  ethical and moral beliefs," they said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Funding at Core of Case  </P> <P> The scientists' brief was only one of many filed by interested parties in the  Missouri case, which centers on that state's attempt to prevent public funding  of abortions.  </P> <P> By Friday, the case had drawn more than 60 briefs. The previous high mark was  58, filed in conjunction with the landmark Bakke case in 1978 on affirmative  action.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Justice Department said Friday that it has recruited Charles  Fried, solicitor general in the Ronald Reagan Administration, to present its  arguments in the April 26 hearing.  </P> <P> Fried left office Jan. 20 to return to teaching law at Harvard University and  the Bush Administration announced its intention to appoint appeals court Judge  Kenneth Starr as his replacement. But Starr had not been confirmed by the  Senate, leaving the Administration without an advocate before the court.  </P> <P> Staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow contributed to this story.  </P></p>

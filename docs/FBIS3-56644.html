			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] As you know, a session of the Georgian  Parliament was held today. The first report in our program  tells you about the work of this session.    [Correspondent] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the  Georgian  Parliament and head of state, delivered a report on the  extension of the operation of the state of emergency on the  territory of the Republic of Georgia.    Our main task is to restore order in the country. Therefore,  the address by the chairman of parliament started with a call  for an improvement of the work of the supreme legislative body.  He said that it is necessary to introduce a principle of  coordination in the work of the parliament and to exclude  spontaneity. Among other central problems Mr. Eduard  Shevardnadze listed an improvement of the rules of procedure and  the necessity to step up work in commissions and to listen to  their reports.    Our public, said the head of state, has a great desire that  fruitless confrontation in the work of the parliament be  overcome.    The main result of the introduction of the state of  emergency  is that Georgia has averted a major civil war which was about to  engulf western Georgia. But for the emergency rules, the  country might have been in a more serious condition. Unless  order is established in the country, nothing will save either  the economy or culture and science, and the country will not be  able to emerge from the crisis, the head of state stressed. He  also said that unless order is restored, all achievements and  agreements reached during talks with other countries will remain  on paper. We should be guided by this principle in our work.    As for an extension of the emergency rules, it was said that  they should be extended for a month -- of course, provided that  the parliament agrees. [passage omitted]    Mr. Jaba Ioseliani presented to the parliamentarians a  comprehensive report on the results of the Geneva talks. He  began by criticizing the press, or, rather, the official press.  Mr. Jaba Ioseliani said that the talks in Geneva finished five  days ago and almost all international newspapers comprehensively  covered and assessed this important event. Meanwhile, the  Georgian population has not been offered even a single report.    We will not repeat today the assessment of the talks by the  head of the Georgian delegation, since Georgian television has  broadcast several times a long interview covering these issues.  We will point out that there was a difference of opinion  regarding the assessment of the results, which is customary for  some deputies.    The significance of the results of the talks will become  clear to all of us only after their implementation, which is  expected to start in the immediate future.    And that was the end of the Parliament's work today.    [Announcer] We would like to add that the republic's  parliament decided today to extend for another month the state  of emergency on the entire territory of the republic.</p>

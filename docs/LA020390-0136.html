			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREATENED STEEL STRIKE ADDS TO GORBACHEV'S TROUBLES;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: FEARING WAGE LOSSES, UKRAINIAN STEELWORKERS START SETTING UP  STRIKE COMMITTEES. ANY STOPPAGE COULD SPREAD TO OTHER REGIONS AND INDUSTRIES.  </P> <P> Already under fire for the failure of his perestroika reform program to deliver  economic dividends, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev now faces the threat  of a potentially crippling steel strike as early as next week, the nation's  media reported Friday.  </P> <P> The immediate threat is in the Ukraine, heart of the country's steel-making  industry, but any strike could quickly spread to other regions and additional  industries, according to the reports. The potential damage, both economically  and politically, thus rivals that of last summer's coal strikes, which sent  tremors through the power structure that still reverberate today.  </P> <P> At issue are large cutbacks in wages and fringe benefits faced by the workers  because of sharp increases in the cost to their employers of electricity,  diesel fuel and transportation tariffs. The wholesale price increases were  imposed earlier this year as part of the government's program to rationalize  wholesale prices, and the mills are forbidden by decree from passing the boosts  on to their customers.  </P> <P> As a result, say the workers, unless the decree is repealed immediately the  mills stand to lose millions of rubles. Under prevailing pay practices, that  means either direct pay cuts or a sharp reduction in the so-called "social  development funds" that pay for employee vacations, housing programs and other  benefits.  </P> <P> One mill, the Dnieprospetsstal conglomerate in Zaporozhie, calculates that the  average salary of its workers will drop in March from the current 277 rubles a  month to 212 rubles, or by about 20%, the government newspaper, Izvestia,  reported Friday.  </P> <P> "A wave of discontent has swept smelting plants in the Ukraine," added  Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow. "The workers are calling for setting  up strike committees."  </P> <P> Interfax reported Friday that the Ukrainian Trade Union Council has requested  the republic's government to either suspend the validity of the wholesale price  decree or reduce the share of plant profits earmarked for the national budget  in order to compensate for the losses. (The vast majority of Soviet enterprises  are state-owned.)  </P> <P> A shop-floor organizer quoted by Izvestia noted that "we have declared a  moratorium on strikes for the next five years, and we are still managing to  stave off a stoppage. But what about tomorrow?"  </P> <P> The moratorium was meant to give the government a breathing space in which  economic reforms would have more opportunity to show results.  </P> <P> But now, said Izvestia, workers have set Monday as the deadline for the  government to come up with some acceptable alternative. The newspaper added  that representatives from chemical, lumber, agricultural machine-building and  other industries also have voiced protests, although they are apparently not as  hard hit as the energy-intensive steel industry.  </P> <P> Last summer's coal strikes so panicked government leaders that they quickly  promised to meet virtually all the miners' demands. Later, they tried to renege  on some of those promises, causing another outbreak of strikes in the far  north.  </P> <P> The mines are working now, but there are still tensions, and the strikes  apparently have earned for the miners an extraordinary voice in national  economic affairs.  </P> <P> A large group of miners representing the country's major coal-producing regions  met with Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on Friday, Soviet  television and the official Tass news agency reported.  </P> <P> "Their frank conversation touched upon drastic problems facing perestroika  policies, society and the Communist Party," according to the Tass account of  the meeting. "Miners' representatives shared their ideas and came up with  critical suggestions and proposals," it added.  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: German farmers feel 'green' currency pinch - How the virtual collapse of the ERM has hit incomes GERMAN FARMERS are calling for emergency action by the European Commission because of the threat to their prices caused by the virtual collapse of the European Community's Exchange Rate Mechanism earlier this month. 'Any further price changes are going to hit us very hard because we've already seen lower prices to farmers from reform of the CAP while we're paying more for our raw materials since our inflation rate is the highest in the EC,' Mr Max Zurek, chief economist at the German farmers' union, said yesterday. The farmers are also protesting against the automatic changes in the 'green' currency rates - in line with real exchange rate fluctuations - that have applied to some currencies since the beginning of the year, but which now apply to all of them. 'It makes it very difficult for farmers to plan ahead,' Mr Zurek said. 'They have to keep revising contract prices.' Mr Jochen Borchert, Germany's agriculture minister, is pushing for a special meeting of EC farm ministers in the first week of September to discuss the green currency system through which EC price support is channeled to farmers. Mr Borchert has already visited his Dutch and French opposite numbers this week to gauge support. EC farmers have been protected from any real drop in farm prices resulting from currency changes since the complex 'switchover' mechanism was introduced 9 years ago at the insistence of the Germans. EC support prices to farmers are set in European currency units, which represent a basket of currencies. The Ecu prices must be converted into countries' own currencies at an exchange rate - either fixed or floating. The switchover mechanism is a complex process for converting Ecus into 'green' Ecus, which effectively makes the Deutschemark the strongest currency in the basket. German farmers have been protected by this system from any cut in farm prices that would follow a revaluation of the Deutschemark in the ERM. The switchover system was set up to insulate German farmers from any cut in prices - it has kept their support prices steady in D-Marks. But it has also benefited farmers across the EC who have seen prices 20 per cent higher than they would otherwise have been. The mechanism proved costly to run - it cost the EC an additional Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.14bn) last year. By keeping German prices stable and pushing all other prices upwards, the switchover mechanism had an in-built inflationary bias. The commission tried to get rid of the switchover at the beginning of the year because of the introduction of the single market, but the German farm lobby ensured that it remained in place. Since the switchover was triggered by a revaluation within the narrow band of the ERM - a political decision in the semi-fixed exchange rate system - it is now defunct as currencies are allowed to fluctuate widely. The Germans want it applied again to floating currencies, but the commission is not keen. 'The commission has now achieved through the action of the finance ministers what it could find no consensus for among agriculture ministers last year,' said Mr Zurek. However, although the switchover is now inoperative, German farmers have not yet seen any cut in prices. What they have seen is the drop in the value of the Franc and the Danish Krone resulting in more French and Danish farm products on the German market, which in turn is pushing German prices down. UK farmers have seen their farm exports become more attractive and their own support prices rise by about 15 per cent since the UK left the ERM last September. The small devaluation for France and Denmark has pushed up support prices marginally to French and Danish farmers. But German, Dutch and possibly Belgian farmers fear their prices will fall if the D-Mark continues strong enough to force a revaluation. That is why farmers claim there must be swift emergency action to remove the threat of price cuts. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is expected to address the issue in talks with Mr Eduard Balladur, prime minister of France, this week. But calls for far-reaching reforms of the EC 'green' money system are unlikely to be supported by many other countries. The UK would strongly resist the return to a switchover mechanism. 'German farmers may not like it, but for the first time, they are in the same position as all other farmers in the EC,' one UK farming official said.</p>

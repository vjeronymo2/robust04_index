This represented an  increase of 0.8 million tonnes over the previous year. However,  the amount was just [word indistinct] the 6.5 million tonnes  projected for the whole year. Last year, 10 more wells were  brought into operation, which -- together with the effort of the  company in applying new technology -- helped raise daily output  from 16,000 to 20,000 tonnes.

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Going rate' preferred to performance pay Sir, Martin Wolf's 'Productivity and pay' (Economic Eye, August 15) did an excellent job of debunking the damaging conventional wisdom that increases in a company's productivity should lead to increases in the wages that it pays. After 15 years of Conservative politicians telling us that the 'going rate for the job' was in fact outmoded, it was about time that someone pointed out that a 'going rate' is precisely what the theoretical ideal  - a perfectly competitive labour market - would generate. The evidence on pay differentials cited also suggests that deregulation and decentralisation of pay bargaining have in fact been counter-productive, reducing the degree to which observed labour market outcomes correspond to this theoretical ideal. This is unsurprising. Decentralisation of pay bargaining increases the scope and need for firms to pay efficiency wages to retain high levels of effort and to retain the trust and sense of legitimacy in the workplace that are required to maintain high productivity levels. If companies cannot point to industry wage norms to establish a legitimate 'going rate', then they are obliged to link pay more closely to the company's performance, with deleterious effects on the wider economy. Rather than trying to improve labour market performance by dogmatic deregulation, we ought perhaps to be trying to develop an institutional framework that generates efficient outcomes, which 'mimics' the ideal market, without requiring us to assume that the market for labour operates in practice in the same way as the market for fish.

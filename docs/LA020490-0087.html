			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> How exciting it was to see hockey on network TV for the first time in 10 years.  But what a disappointment it was to have Marv Albert call the play-by-play for  NBC on Jan. 21. With all the good hockey announcers available, couldn't the  network find a more competent announcer?  </P> <P> Anthony Alpert, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation One of this year's intriguing themes will be whether supposedly cyclical consumer stocks prove to be as cyclical as the market presumes. The high savings ratio seemingly highlights the scale of latent demand. Confidence appears to be returning, too. Rank's shares have benefited from such optimism in the leisure sector, outperforming the market by 12 per cent over the past year. Its annual figures contain some substance to underpin this sentiment. The current 8 per cent gain in bookings for domestic holidays is encouraging. Small volume gains are also being made elsewhere - even if price rises are hard to achieve, as First Leisure noted this week. But recovery may prove precarious with the chancellor poised to hit consumers with more taxes. Other factors, too, may swing against Rank this year. Rank Xerox will have to swallow its share of Xerox Corporation's Dollars 700m restructuring charge. Jurassic Park can no longer be relied upon to pull viewers through cinema doors. Rank's Pounds 995m debt burden will continue to restrain any grander corporate ambitions. And the renewed rumours that it will dispose of its stake in Rank Xerox could prove as ill-founded as the more ambitious recovery hopes. The tax implications of disposing of Rank Xerox would prove especially heavy now that Mecca's acquired tax losses have been exhausted. Rank may prefer to hang on to the asset rather than sell it to pay down its debts. But Xerox's poor prospects in mainland Europe are another reason to expect modest progress at Rank this year.</p>

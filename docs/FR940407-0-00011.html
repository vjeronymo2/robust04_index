			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of its proposal to simplify the size standards, SBA attempted to contact all 8(a) Program Participants in the program at the time of the proposed rule and requested them to specifically address the potential impact of the proposed size standards on smaller-sized 8(a) firms. Sixteen commenters addressed this issue. Eleven of the sixteen commenters maintained that the proposed increase in the size standards would be beneficial to smaller-sized firms. Five of the sixteen commenters believed that such increases would be adverse to smaller-sized firms in that the number of 8(a) firms would increase, thus taxing available Federal procurement opportunities and the level of SBA assistance. Overall, the prevailing view of all commenting 8(a) firms is that the increases in the size standards are necessary and beneficial and should be adopted. The SBA believes that any possible adverse impact on the smaller-sized 8(a) firms is out weighed by the desirability of recognizing the effects of inflation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters suggested that the SBA adopt employee-based standards in lieu of receipts-based standards for all industries. However, only two commenters provided a rationale for the adoption of employee-based standards for all industries. One of these commenters indicated that utilizing employee-based standards would eliminate the need for periodic inflationary adjustments. The other commenter stated that equipment and material purchases required by Federal agencies on certain contracts distorted the actual size of a concern by raising a concern's receipts without an accompanying increase in actual business activity. The decision to use receipts or employees as the size standard measure is based on which measure is viewed as the best measure of size for firms involved in that particular industry. The SBA's policy is to evaluate the size standard measure of an industry on a case-by-case basis as part of the SBA's continuing efforts to review industry size standards. However, the issue of whether all industries should be measured by number of employees will be further explored along with other issues on simplifying size standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to several comments, this rule publishes the entire set of size standards by SIC code designation and their accompanying footnotes. The complete size standards table provides the public with one convenient set of size standards and eliminates the need to have two tables of size standards, one for those size standards revised in this final rule and one for those unaffected by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance with Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA considers that this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. section 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). In addition, SBA believes that this final rule constitutes a significant rule for the purpose of Executive Order 12866. Immediately below, the SBA has set forth a summary regulatory impact analysis and a final regulatory flexibility analysis of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Description of Entities to Which the Rule Applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA estimates that approximately 20,000 additional firms will be considered small as a result of this rule. These firms will be eligible to seek available SBA assistance, provided they meet other program requirements. Many of these concerns probably had small business status in 1984, when the last comprehensive revision of size standards was issued by SBA, but have since lost eligibility because of general price increases. The current changes, in fact, operate roughly as adjustments for price changes (i.e., inflation) since that data. Approximately 11,000 of the firms gaining eligibility operate in retail trade while approximately 9,000 operate in the services industries (Divisions G and I, respectively, of the SIC systems of classifying industries). Other firms affected by this rule include service firms within the agricultural or mining sectors, or firms in those transportation industries with receipt-based size standards. Firms becoming eligible for SBA assistance as a result of this rule, cumulatively generate $95 billion in annual sales. This figure is less than 5 percent of the total sales in those industries with higher size standards. The new size standards would not impose a regulatory burden because they do not regulator or control business behavior.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

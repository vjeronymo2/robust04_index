			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Baczko quits as Blockbuster chief BLOCKBUSTER, the US video rental chain which owns the Cityvision group in the UK, yesterday said that Mr Joseph Baczko had resigned as president and chief operating officer. Mr Baczko will be replaced as president by Mr Steven Berrard, the company's vice-chairman. The resignation of Mr Baczko - who had been with the company since January 1991 - was described as part of a reorganisation of Blockbuster that follows a series of acquisitions. Separate divisions have been created, including domestic home video, international home video, domestic music retailing, international music retailing and new technology ventures. Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman, said the company's recent acquisition of music store chains and its new joint-venture in music retailing with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group would lead to new opportunities. He said Blockbuster and Mr Baczko agreed on the president's resignation plan and added that Blockbuster would become an investor in a new retailing venture planned by Mr Baczko. Blockbuster's results for the third quarter of 1992 showed a 50.9 per cent rise in after-tax earnings, to Dollars 41.3m. Sales rose 24 per cent to Dollars 283.7m.</p>

It is expected to take some action on this front in the Budget, as it has done in 11 of the last 12 Budgets. The government has also welcomed the intervention of the European Commission which has issued a non-binding recommendation aimed at promoting employee participation in profits and equity. The recommendation, part of the social action programme, seeks to promote best practice in the field. It also proposes setting up a working party to examine the possibility of an EC-wide scheme. The Department of Employment, which is inviting responses from business on the recommendation, would not welcome statutory measures, but says it 'welcomes the European Commission's recognition of the importance of financial participation'.

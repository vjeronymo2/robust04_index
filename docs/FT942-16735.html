			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wolseley Pounds 57m Austrian buy Wolseley, the expanding heating and plumbing distributor, has set its sights on Germany and the old Austro-Hungarian empire. Yesterday, the group announced the acquisition for Pounds 56.9m of the OAG Group, the biggest distributor of plumbing supplies in Austria. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman of Wolseley, said OAG was the company's first German speaking acquisition, which he hoped would lead in time to further growth in Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic. OAG, founded in 1871, has 40 branches in Austria. It extended its operations to eastern Europe in 1990 and 1991. It has five branches in Germany, five in Hungary and four in the Czech Republic. Operating profits last year were Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 187m. Net assets were Pounds 18.2m. The seller is Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie of Vienna, a leading Austrian quoted company. The deal should be completed in about eight weeks, depending on regulatory approvals. It could be terminated if the approvals are not given before the end of the year. Wolseley is financing the deal with the Pounds 55m it raised last August through a placing of 8.7m shares, and is making up the balance through its own resources. The company has been looking for an opportunity to expand distribution on mainland Europe since acquiring Brossette of France in February 1992.</p>

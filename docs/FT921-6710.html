			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Capitalist tool in need of sharpening: As former communist countries look to the IMF to aid their transition to the market, Michael Prowse examines the role of the fund The International Monetary Fund has rarely been in greater demand. It is on the verge of completing membership negotiations with Russia and other former Soviet republics. Already heavily committed in eastern Europe, it has emerged as the west's principal instrument for assisting the transition to capitalism in formerly centrally planned economies. Most policymakers seem to take the IMF's central role in guiding economic reform in the former communist countries - as well as in scores of developing countries - largely for granted. Yet it marks a startling transition for an institution that was established for a quite different purpose. The IMF was created at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 to run an international monetary system based on fixed exchange rates and limited capital mobility. The Bretton Woods system disintegrated in the early 1970s creating an identity crisis for the IMF. At the time, many experts feared that its influence as a global financial institution would gradually wane. Instead, the IMF cast about for new roles. It helped recycle oil surpluses in the 1970s and involved itself increasingly with economic reform in developing countries. In the early 1980s, it was back on centre stage, managing the Third World debt crisis. During the 1980s, the IMF was often criticised for excessively austere policies, especially in heavily indebted Latin American countries. Much of the criticism has melted away. Indeed, most observers today appear to have an exaggerated faith in its ability to work economic miracles. The changing perception of the IMF reflects a shift in world opinion: the policies of economic liberalism and fiscal responsibility that it has always championed are now uncontroversial. Indeed, some recent clients have wanted to 'out-IMF the IMF'. In Czechoslovakia, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the finance minister, is a more committed disciple of market forces than many IMF officials. In Latin America, even as recalcitrant a pupil as Argentina is now proposing a programme of economic reforms that makes the Bush administration look dirigiste. But observers argue that the IMF has also shifted ground to meet criticisms. It talks more about growth and less about balance of payments 'stabilisation'. It seems more aware of the impact of its policies on poverty, income distribution and the environment. Mr Moeen Qureshi, until recently head of operations at the World Bank, says Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director since 1987, deserves much of the credit for the changes. Mr Camdessus has 'anticipated challenges and shown a greater capacity for leadership' than any of his recent predecessors, he says. Under Mr Camdessus's leadership, the IMF has: Lengthened the duration of economic adjustment programmes and begun to put more weight on structural reforms; Recognised the need for special concessional treatment - in effect aid  - for the poorest countries, especially in Africa; Taken a more lenient view of countries in arrears, in some cases allowing the effective rescheduling of fund loans; Spoken up on sensitive political issues such as excessive military spending in developing countries. Mr Qureshi stresses that Mr Camdessus received little support from western finance ministers when fighting for such changes and often had to overcome opposition from a conservative old guard within the IMF. He is a 'one-man band to such an extent that the rest of the staff are often not on the same wavelength'. Mr Camdessus's reforms, which built on changes already under way in the early 1980s, have helped create a more positive image for the IMF. But do its economic remedies actually work? Mr Jacques Polak, a former senior IMF official who retains close links with the institution, recently reviewed academic assessments of IMF performance. He found the evidence was 'not as conclusive as one would like'. IMF programmes have tended to improve the balance of payments - which is hardly surprising given that this is their central aim. But the impact on inflation and living standards is, at best, uncertain. His review provides little evidence of a strong positive correlation between IMF programmes and growth. Glancing at the IMF's latest annual report points to a similar conclusion. At the back you will see long lists of developing countries that have had numerous IMF programmes (the champion is Haiti with 21), yet which still remain deeply troubled economically. For every Mexico, you can find a dozen poor performers. The early results in eastern Europe are equally disappointing. 'The underlying reality,' says a World Bank official, 'is extremely gloomy.' Output is down sharply everywhere and there are few signs yet that private enterprise can fill the gap left by collapsed state enterprises. Poland is already backing away from the austere policies initially agreed with the IMF. Czechoslovakia is growing restive. Mr Richard Erb, the IMF's deputy managing director, concedes that declines in output have been 'a lot bigger than we expected' but argues that nobody has put forward convincing alternative policies. The disappointing results do not imply that IMF policies are necessarily misguided. Mr Polak suggests that it reflects the failure of countries to pursue the policies consistently. But the fact that the IMF finds itself in a long-term relationship of dubious value with many clients indicates something is wrong. After decades of effort, suggests one former IMF official, 'a certain cynicism has set in'. He says many officials are not 'success-oriented': they negotiate tough programmes that fail to heed political realities and then 'wait for them to break down'. Part of the problem lies in the mismatch between the IMF's responsibilities and its original charter. It was meant to provide short-term bridging finance for countries experiencing temporary balance of payments problems. This led naturally to a focus on policies  - such as devaluation and fiscal and monetary retrenchment - that would quickly bring demand into line with an economy's short-run capacity to produce. The more difficult development challenge of creating the conditions for sustainable growth formed no part of its remit. The IMF seems likely to get bogged down in eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics for many years: the evidence from Latin America and Africa is that it is rarely possible quickly to stabilise an under-developed economy and then withdraw. Mr Camdessus seems to relish the prospect of turning the IMF into a long-term development agency. But some question whether this is the right goal for an institution whose primary expertise lies in short-run macroeconomic management. The irony is that, while the IMF's case load has soared, putting enormous pressure on its hard-working staff, the rationale for some of its functions  -and those of the World Bank - may be diminishing. A few blocks east of the IMF's grand building on 19th Street in Washington, a small group called Sachs and Associates has opened its doors. The non-profit consultancy, which is headed by Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, provides economic advice to Russia and eastern European governments. In April, another innovative group, the Emerging Markets Corporation (EMC), will open in Washington. The founders include Mr Qureshi and Mr Donald Roth, formerly the World Bank's senior financial officer. EMC regards itself as an entrepreneurial version of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's arm for promoting private sector development. EMC hopes to add value by locating profitable opportunities for direct and portfolio investment in developing countries and the formerly centrally planned economies. Public sector agencies will always have a crucial role in crises such as mediating between creditors and bankrupt borrowers and in helping the poorest countries. But flexible groups such as Sachs and Associates and EMC, rather than the Bretton Woods dinosaurs, could represent the future in development advice and finance. What do developing countries need? The answer, first, is a genuine commitment to reform: signing up for an IMF or Bank programme is not necessarily evidence of good faith. The other requirements are sound advice and money. There is little reason to suppose that Mr John Odling-Smee, the head of the IMF's department for former Soviet republics, can offer better economic advice than the equally knowledgeable Prof Sachs. Going one step further, on the IMF's own market principles, it seems improbable that its 1,200 economists, corralled into bureaucratic departments, are realising their full potential. Might it make more sense to split them into autonomous competing groups like the 15-strong Sachs and Associates? If such groups charged fees, they could be sure their advice was really welcome. Advisers whose policies worked would gradually gain business at the expense of the less successful. As for finance, the US Congress is baulking at providing an extra Dollars 12bn for the IMF's long-promised quota increase. In the medium term, most resources for investment in former planned economies and the Third World will be supplied by private capital markets that are larger and more liquid than envisaged by the IMF's founders. The bulk will probably be direct and portfolio investment flows. Companies such as EMC could thus become key conduits for development finance. At present, the IMF plays a catalytic role. Mr Odling-Smee and Prof Sachs may endorse identical programmes of reforms but Mr Odling-Smee's signature is far more valuable, because many lenders and investors lack the confidence to commit resources without the IMF imprimatur. This suggests a need for a rating agency of some kind: if Sachs and Associates could win a AAA rating for a proposed reform programme from an impartial agency, it, too, might be able to unlock a flood of private sector capital. The advantage of lots of small independent advisers in place of the hierarchical IMF would be greater innovation in the design of reform programmes. For now, the IMF must take a lead role in Russia and elsewhere. But if independent advisers were to flourish it could focus more closely on the task Keynes and others originally conceived for it: the running of a world monetary system. 'My big criticism of the IMF,' says Mr John Williamson, an economist at the Institute for International Finance, a Washington think-tank, 'is its lack of work on economic policy co-ordination.' The proper surveillance of macroeconomic policies in the industrialised world ought to be next big item on Mr Camdessus's agenda, says Mr Qureshi. He argues that Japan's big current account surplus and its alleged import barriers form a classic example of the kind of problem the IMF ought to tackle. Referring to President George Bush's ill-received recent visit to Tokyo, he argues that the disinterested Mr Camdessus, rather than a political leader, should have raised questions about unfair trade practices. 'This would represent a genuine extension of a new world economic order.' The IMF can play the role for which it was designed only if the leading industrial countries cede it more power to monitor and co-ordinate exchange rate and other macroeconomic policies. At present, they are denying it this crucial responsibility while pushing it ever further into development tasks for which it is still not fully prepared, despite Mr Camdessus's innovations.</p>

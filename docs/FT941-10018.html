			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Technology: Let the lifeblood flow freely - Ericsson's approach to research and development has lessons for the rest of Europe Lars Ramqvist, the chief executive of Ericsson, has some incisive words to say about the power of innovation. He also has plenty of hard-won experience to back them up. In a nutshell, they are: invest to the utmost in developing new products or services, forget about short-term profits and be willing to take risks. Compelling though these points are, companies often ignore them, especially in Europe. Yet innovation is the lifeblood of industry, creating growth and jobs. If the Swedish telecommunications group had not accelerated its spending on new products in 1991 at the expense of earnings and dividend growth, Ramqvist says, 'we would not be sitting here'. Not surprisingly, it was a move the group's US shareholders, who hold 40 per cent of the equity, found it hard to accept. Ramqvist, a 54-year-old physicist and chemist, has been chosen to deliver next Tuesday's 1994 Innovation Lecture in London, partly sponsored by the UK's Department of Trade and Industry and the Confederation of British Industry. Last week in Stockholm, he explained why he thought Ericsson's recent history held some important lessons for his audience. Some of his views are not likely to be palatable to UK executives, although the lecture will be couched in diplomatic rather than provocative language. Ramqvist admires the US approach to innovation, with its creativity, flexibility and willingness to take chances, but does not think enough people in Britain have yet got the message. 'In the UK, I have the impression, I'm sorry to say, that you have been extremely good at the first part of innovation - a lot of innovations were made in Britain - but you never managed fully to make them an industrial success,' he says. The UK has been weaker in the final stages of innovation by failing to commercialise many ideas. 'You have been too prudent, too logical, you've done everything step-by-step. But in the end, the world has moved faster.' Clearly, that charge does not apply to all companies. But it is no secret - and patent and R&amp;D statistics back this up - that Britain lags behind much of the industrialised world and that Europe as a whole is behind the US and Japan. Ericsson's single-minded approach to innovation, which meant spending 15 times more on R&amp;D than on dividends, was risky in the tough, fast-moving telecoms market. 'We only had one bullet in the gun, one shot - in mobile communications,' Ramqvist says. 'Because of the enormous spending, if we had missed on any aspect - microelectronics, the market niches or the timing - we would have been a dead duck.' As it turned out, Ericsson hit the target. It developed new products - a third of its orders are for products less than two years old - and yesterday announced pre-tax profits for 1993 of SKr3.1bn (Pounds 265m), more than double those of 1992. But the struggle to compete by bringing new products to the market more cheaply and more rapidly is by no means over. It never will be, Ramqvist says: 'Innovation has no end.' This is part of the message he will bring to his London audience. Innovation, he will stress, is both continuous and involves a number of activities at once - in research, development, production and marketing. Ramqvist uses the vogue term 'concurrent engineering' to describe what this means and the challenges it involves. It takes around 15 months to develop a new microelectronics system and 12 months to order and install specially designed manufacturing equipment. So production engineers must be closely involved from the start. 'If they were waiting for the silicon (chip) guys, it would take 2 1/2 years.' The software developers, of which Ericsson has 10,000, also need to be brought into the process early. 'They want to see a chip in only a few weeks. They can't sit and wait.' By following this method, Ericsson has saved time and money and brought its products out much more quickly than before. Four years ago, the time from order to delivery for one of its AXE switching systems was six months; now, it is 10 days. Today, Ericsson has a 40 per cent share of the world market for mobile phone systems and one of over 50 per cent in digital cellular equipment. It is up against competitors such as Alcatel of France, Siemens of Germany, Motorola and AT&amp;T of the US and Canada's Northern Telecom. Thus Ericsson will not be able to let up on the pace of its R&amp;D spending, totalling Kr13bn last year, 20 per cent of sales (double the rate of its competitors) and more than double the level of five years ago. Of course, Ericsson is favoured by the fact that voting control is in the hands of long-term shareholders, the Wallenberg family and Svenska Handelsbanken. Thus when Ramqvist stresses the importance of risk capital, he is speaking from a basis of loyal shareholder support, something not all companies enjoy to the same degree. Ericsson does not do everything right, as Ramqvist admits. Its move into office equipment in the 1980s was a costly failure. And it was late in cutting costs, notes Tim Hirst, telecommunications analyst with Kleinwort Benson. But Hirst admires the company's investment drive, initiated at a time of dwindling profits. 'They stuck to their guns and spent money on their product, although they were going through a difficult time.' Ramqvist sees no let-up yet in the pace of development spending. Ericsson is working hard on new systems for the next generation of multimedia communications combining sound and vision, where the computer and telecommunications industries converge: 'We need new technology in the network, we need better and faster switches, we need powerful transmission networks.'</p>

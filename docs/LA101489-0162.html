			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Fidelity National Financial Inc., which has acquired a 23.6% stake in the  Hammond Co., has extended until Oct. 31 its agreement to cease buying the  Newport Beach mortgage banking firm's common stock. Fidelity, an Irvine-based  title insurance company, had agreed to a two-week buying halt on Sept. 28.  </P> <P> Hammond officials have expressed alarm over what they see as an attempt by  Fidelity to acquire controlling interest in the company. Hammond said Thursday  that while Fidelity has agreed to extend the moratorium on stock purchases  until the end of the month, "the prospects of a mutually acceptable longer-term  standstill agreement, or other proposals, are uncertain at this time."  </P></p>

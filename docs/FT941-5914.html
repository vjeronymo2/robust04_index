			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Algeria in IMF talks Algerian economy minister Mourad Benachenhou is expected to visit Washington next week to hammer out the details of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, according to officials in Paris, Reuter reports from Paris. If agreed, the accord is expected to have two components - a regular 'standby' loan to support its balance of payments and a further sum under the IMF's compensatory financing facility. Algeria said last week the IMF might give it a Dollars 500m (Pounds 342.4m) standby loan and Dollars 300m more to offset lower oil revenues, which make up over 90 per cent of hard currency earnings.</p>

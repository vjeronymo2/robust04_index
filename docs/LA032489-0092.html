Harbor Sportfishing,  six anglers were catching calico bass with squid and anchovies when the action  got frenzied.  </P> <P> A flurry of white sea bass came up slashing the bait and busting tackle.  </P> <P> Ron Smoten of West Los Angeles landed the first, which weighed 14 pounds.  </P> <P> Richard Chase of San Pedro had to bring his out of the kelp and landed a  12-pounder.  </P> <P> Ed Ingle of Long Beach went from the stern to the bow in a 20-minute fight to  keep his fish off the anchor line. It weighed 16 pounds.  </P> <P> Jeff Carpenter of San Pedro caught two. He bounced a 12 1/4-pounder to the  deck, rebaited in a hurry and brought to gaff a 17-pounder.  </P> <P> The catch of the sea bass trip was a whopping 22-pounder by Gardena angler  Darty Cronin using a Mo Jo jig.  </P> <P> The 14th annual Marina del Rey Halibut Derby was a huge success. With 1,200  anglers bringing in 195 halibut, the largest was caught at Big Rock by Don  Crisp of Lancaster. He won a trip for two to Australia with his 42 1/2-pounder.  Ray Hansen of San Pedro won second place with a 25 1/4-pound halibut.  </P> <P> The barge Isle of Redondo is now operating daily and has been relocated on the  sunken Sacramento Barge in Redondo Canyon.  </P> <P> Dan Armstrong of Redondo Sportfishing reports that salmon have been around the  barge and a possible salmon run could be coming.  </P> <P> If you're a grunion grabber and missed the first runs, a second four-night run  ends Sunday. This is the last run until June.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: John Van Stone of Santa Monica, fishing aboard his boat the  Bold Affair off Sunset Beach, caught the whopper of the week when he lowered  his net to bring aboard a 38-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Ron Lang of Long Beach, aboard the Southern Cal at Catalina Island, won the  jackpot with a 29-pound lingcod.  </P> <P> Juba Wallace of Inglewood, aboard the Redondo Special at Twin Roads, won the  jackpot with a 20-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Dennis Larson of Long Beach, fishing at the 150 Spot aboard the Hitless Miss,  won the jackpot with his 18 3/4-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> Ed Martin of Hermosa Beach, fishing aboard the Redondo Special at Torrance  Beach, caught an 18 1/2-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Tosh Okamoto of Long Beach, on the Southern Cal at Catalina, won the jackpot  with his 18-pound lingcod.  </P> <P> Fish Reports  </P> <P> The water has warmed from a chilly 52 degrees to 58 and the calico and sand  bass fishing has improved.

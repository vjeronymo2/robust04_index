The party formulated its position  during another Political Bureau meeting today to examine  developments in the Cyprus issue in light of the upcoming  proximity talks.    AKEL Secretary General Dhimitrios Khristofias told the  Cyprus  Broadcasting Corporation that AKEL is disappointed with the de  facto situation, as he expressed it, which the president has  created. He said: We refuse to cover up this situation.  Khristofias mentioned that if Kliridhis made the decision to  attend the proximity talks, he will have to figure out how to  return to the substance of the Cyprus issue. Khristofias added  that the party will not withdraw from the National Council.    Within the framework of the dialogue with other parties that  began at EDEK's [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] initiative,  DISI [Democratic Rally] and socialist party EDEK delegations met  today at the DISI offices to discuss the CBM's. DISI Chairman  Ioannis Matsis and EDEK Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis headed the  delegations.    After the meeting, Matsis and Lissaridhis made statements.  Matsis said that every party has its own position on the CBM's  and considers its approach correct. He added, however, that  they have a common goal: To break the deadlock and end the  occupation. Lissaridhis reiterated that his party wants to  disengage from the CBM's and turn toward the substance of the  Cyprus issue.</p>

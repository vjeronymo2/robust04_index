			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich during news </F> conference with unidentified reporters from the Belarusian  Television and Radio Company and BELINFORM on 12 January; place  not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is clear that if Belarus  were a nuclear state, if we had not refused to keep the nuclear  weapons, we would not be participating in this meeting [with  President Clinton]. I am speaking sincerely. However, we see  that the Clinton administration is paying tribute to Belarus,  and this is being done, first and foremost, by U. S. President  Bill Clinton. This is brought about by the fact that we do not  lay claims to nuclear weapons and we do not make nuclear weapons  the subject of political bargaining. This is the most important  thing. I hope that during our short meeting -- Clinton will  stay with us no more than five hours -- we will discuss issues  related solely to economic relations between Belarusian and U.S.  business circles.</p>

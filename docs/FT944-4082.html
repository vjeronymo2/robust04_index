			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Late plunge leaves Dow sharply lower Wall Street US share prices nosedived in the late afternoon yesterday amid uncertainty about the repercussions of the financial troubles in Orange County, California, and renewed fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in the near term, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 49.79 down at 3,685.73. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 weakened 5.78 to 445.45, the American SE composite slipped 6.38 to 422.81 and the Nasdaq composite fell 15.15 to 719.12. Trading volume was extremely heavy on the New York SE at 362.8m shares. The skid started late in the afternoon, with the Dow spiraling down more than 57 points before bouncing up slightly. The market retained Wednesday's skittish tone brought about by testimony in which Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a Congressional panel that he remained concerned about inflationary pressures in the economy. Mr Greenspan said he believed higher prices in raw materials and intermediate goods would ultimately spill over to consumer prices, which had held relatively steady this year. With little other economic news yesterday, investors focused on the comments, which many interpreted as a sign that the Fed would raise rates again by early next year. The Fed has boosted rates six times this year, and investors fear another increase would choke off corporate earnings by slowing consumer demand and making borrowing more expensive. Financial problems in Orange County continued to trouble the market. Analysts remained uncertain how the bankruptcy would affect banks that had been lenders to the county, and there was concern that other municipalities might face similar crises. Morgan Stanley initially bucked a downward trend among US investment banks after reporting that it was in merger discussions with SG Warburg, but fell with the market later in the day. The investment bank ended down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 55 1/4 . Lehman Brothers lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 13 7/8 , Salomon Brothers fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 1/4 and Merrill Lynch declined Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 . Airline shares took a beating after two large carriers announced that they anticipated weaker than expected results for the fourth quarter. Southwest Air dropped Dollars 3 to Dollars 16 7/8 and Continental Air plummeted Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 8 7/8 after both announced that fourth-quarter results would probably come in below analysts' forecasts. Apache gained Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 25 1/2 after an analyst from Bear Stearns made a buy recommendation, saying its decline to Dollars 25 made it an attractive value. The oil and gas firm's high for the year is Dollars 29 1/4 . Caesars World rose initially and then receded to end Dollars  1/4 off at Dollars 41 5/8 , after news that Bally Entertainment had the green light from federal regulators to acquire a major stake in the casino company. Bally was unchanged at Dollars 5 5/8 . Canada Concern over interest rates continued to depress the Toronto market, which finished sharply weaker after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index dropped 33.21 to 4,046.57 and declines outnumbered rises by 473 to 291 after trading volume of 53.8m shares valued at CDollars 656m. Only paper and forestry stocks made gains on the day. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo rose 3.7 per cent, with the biggest gains occurring in blue chips, as investors bet on prospects for future growth. The Bovespa index ended 1,715 up at 47,686. A broker noted that buyers were building their portfolios for February through the futures market. 'It is a financial operation,' he said, 'with investors betting that share prices would be higher in February than at present levels.' The broker added that investors are confident that the economy will fare strongly under the leadership of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who takes over as president on January 1. Also, there are hopes for a great deal of privatisation next year, he noted, and for this reason the market is expected to rise strongly. Investors were also encouraged by data from the Geography and Statistics Institute that the country's GDP had risen by 6 per cent in the third quarter of 1994 after the introduction of the new real currency on July 1.</p>

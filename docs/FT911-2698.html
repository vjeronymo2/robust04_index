			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (2): Trends point to increased concentration of capacity - Growth of overall business has slowed FOREIGN exchange traders are supposed to thrive on volatility and crisis. But the gyrations of the dollar, D-Mark and pound so far this year have done little to dim the impression that the foreign exchange market is undergoing considerable structural change. According to Swiss Bank Corporation, last year was probably the most difficult year for foreign exchange market operators in 10 years. Over the past two years or so, there has been a steady trickle of smaller banks and foreign branches of banks leaving the market. Traders and analysts report that the growth of overall business has slowed. When the industrial world's leading central banks next carry out a survey of foreign exchange activity it is unlikely to confirm the trend reported by the Bank for International Settlements in February last year. The BIS survey, which is still the most up-to-date overview of global foreign exchange activity, indicated that global turnover in the market more than doubled to a staggering Dollars 650bn a day in the three years to April 1989. It is likely that the market is still growing. But at the same time, the big participants such as Citibank of the US, Barclays Bank of Britain, France's Credit Lyonnais and the large German and Swiss banks are increasing their business at a faster rate than the market, lifting their market share. This gradual shift of power to the big battalions is largely a reflection of two interwoven trends. Since 1987, there has been a decline in overall exchange rate volatility, which has limited business volume and trading opportunities. More recently, banks have become far more cautious and loss averse. In marked contrast with the 1970s and early 1980s, the major industrialised countries now care about their exchange rates. Although domestic economic policies differ, all countries share a determination to defeat inflation. Moreover, the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and an increasing number of smaller developed nations are prepared to intervene in the market to influence exchange rates. Although intervention is not always successful in the face of fundamental currency movements, it is a factor that markets cannot afford to ignore. The rapid switch of official attitudes towards the dollar earlier this year highlights this constraint on foreign exchange market activity. In mid-February, the G7 was intervening to support the dollar as it fell to new all time lows against the D-Mark. Four weeks later, the Bundesbank, the US Federal Reserve and a host of smaller central banks were acting to restrain the dollar's rise. Such factors have taken much of the fizz out of a market that once seemed to exemplify speculative excess. According to Mr Nick Douch, senior manager for corporate services at Barclays Bank's global treasury department in London, 'the aim for most participants these days is to maximise the number of days in which they can make a profit' rather than aim for outright speculative gains. Alongside external constraints are pressures for caution inside banks that largely reflect the spread of the 'Basle mentality' in international banking. Since July 1988, when the central bankers of the world's leading industrial countries agreed on minimum capital adequacy ratios for international banks, awareness of credit and counterparty risk has grown. Recession in the English-speaking world, with its trail of bad debts and the downgrading of banks by rating agencies, has greatly increased the premium placed on prudence in international banking. The effect on the foreign exchange market has been a reduction in the number of banks that are attractive business partners, making liquidity tighter. These conditions have already deterred some banks from acting as market makers and made life harder for the big banks still quoting rates in a wide variety of currencies. A market maker must be prepared deal both with an increasing number of counterparties seeking prices and cope with large blocks of currency that are suddenly put up for sale. One result of the declining liquidity in the market has been a sharp increase in day-to-day exchange rate volatility, which poses a far more difficult management task than medium term volatility. Bankers cite how Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, has reportedly switched as much as Dollars 2bn at a time from one currency to another in the course of aggressive management of its foreign currency reserves. A handful of US fund managers and Japanese corporations are also major movers of the market. In these circumstances, the shrinkage in the number of market making banks has created problems for some when they need to get out of positions. However, there is a positive side to the concentration of market making capacity in fewer hands. The big operators have superior information. 'Unless you are a big bank, you have no idea what is happening to currencies,' one trader observed recently. Mr Chris Deuters, Citibank's head of foreign exchange and derivatives in Europe agrees: 'If you don't have access to the end user, your view of the market will be severely limited', he says. The vital importance of information in a market where trading decisions are taken in a split second cannot be over-emphasised. It helps explain why today's large foreign exchange players are more than just interbank trading operations, which thrived in the volatile trading conditions of the 1970s and early 1980s. Those banks with an extensive customer franchise were in a far better position to handle the dollar's sharp rise in the six weeks following the Gulf war because they had an early insight into activity of the international institutions that moved long-term portfolio capital into the US at the time. According to Barclay's Mr Nick Douch, looking after the customer is now a 'number one priority' for foreign exchange departments. There has been an 'enormous shift of emphasis' towards customer based business in the last 2 to 2 1/2 years, he says. At Citibank's London offices, Mr Julian Simmonds, the head of foreign exchange sales and trading agrees. 'Any bank can have a marvellously successful year, but very few have growing but stable profits. For that you need the customer franchise', he says.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET, NET AVERAGE DAILY TURNOVER (BN DOLLARS)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 1986        April 1989 UK      90.0        187.0 US      58.5        128.9 Japan   48.0        115.0 Canada   9.5         15.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bank for International Settlements 1990  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     ANNUAL RANGES FOR THE US DOLLARS AGAINST THE D-MARK, IN PFENNIGS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1985      100 1986       55 1987       35 1988       34 1989       34 1990       25 1991*      27  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  *first quarter Source: Swiss Bank Corp, London  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Menachem Begin critically ill Mr Menachem Begin, former Israeli prime minister who negotiated the Camp David peace agreement with Egypt, was critically ill last night after a heart attack at his Tel Aviv home, writes Hugh Carnegy. The condition of Mr Begin, aged 78 and a near recluse since he resigned as premier in 1983, was said to have improved during the day. But he remained unconscious and was on a respirator. Mr Begin won the Nobel peace prize jointly with the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt for the 1979 accords.</p>

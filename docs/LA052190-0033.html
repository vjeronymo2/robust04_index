			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Nielsen Study: Responding to criticisms from the television networks over the  recent case of "disappearing viewers," the A. C. Nielsen Co. has agreed to  study the possibility of combining its current "people-meter" ratings system  with some other kinds of audience measurement. The networks have contended that  flaws in the "people-meter" system are responsible for the recent drop in TV  viewing shown in the Nielsen ratings. See "By the Numbers" below for a look at  the Nielsen families. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Dutch PM sets out priorities The Dutch prime minister, Mr Wim Kok, yesterday promised 'work, work and more work' from his new coalition government to tackle rising crime, build prosperity and launch a review of foreign policy. Presenting his government programme to the Dutch parliament, Mr Kok responded to criticism that his new coalition, which excludes the Christian Democrats and joins the Labour, conservative Liberal, and reformist D66 parties, would prove fragile. The coalition has been dubbed 'purple' because of the mix of the three parties' political colours. The government took 111 days to form after an inconclusive general election in May. Mr Kok, former finance minister, inherits a sound economy emerging from a mild recession. As part of a modestly austere financial package, he has pledged funds to stimulate new jobs, financed by spending cuts. Mr Kok warned that the cuts, aimed at health care, state pensions, higher education and child benefit, would mean 'some painful measures'. Foreign policy will be reviewed within two years, with a new emphasis on linking it to development co-operation.</p>

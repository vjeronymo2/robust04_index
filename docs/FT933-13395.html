			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UN ends deadlock on Iraqi weapon sites MR ROLF EKEUS, the United Nations envoy, yesterday succeeded in defusing a confrontation with Iraq over the monitoring of two missile testing sites and said Iraq had agreed to consider long-term UN monitoring of its weapons programmes - a key condition for the lifting of economic sanctions. Mr Ekeus, head of the UN special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said he had reached a 'satisfactory' interim solution to monitoring the missile sites - lifting the threat of a UN-backed military strike against the two complexes. 'I don't see any crisis after these talks,' he said after a two-hour meeting with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister. Mr Ekeus said his discussions with Iraqi officials over the past five days had broken the 'vicious circle' of UN inspections and Iraqi obstruction which has provoked a string of tense confrontations since the Gulf war. He also said that the resulting improvement in relations between the UN and Iraq could ease agreement in separate negotiations on a limited exemption to the embargo on Iraqi oil sales. The talks were suspended last week in New York as Iraqi officials returned to Baghdad with a draft agreement for the prospective Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) oil sale, with diplomats in New York saying an accord appeared close. Mr Ekeus gave no details of the compromise reached on the monitoring of the two missile test sites, but said he was confident it would be approved by the UN Security Council, to which he will report on his return to New York. His mission to Baghdad was prompted by Iraq's refusal to allow UN inspectors to install video cameras at the sites or to seal monitoring equipment there  -part of long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons programmes mandated under UN resolution 715. Washington had warned of possible military action if Iraq refused to comply with UN inspectors. But potentially more significant is Iraq's apparent concession over long-term monitoring of conventional, chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programmes banned by Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. 'Iraq has stated that they are ready to comply with plans for future monitoring and verification adopted under resolution 715,' Mr Ekeus said. Iraq has fiercely resisted UN resolution 715 and said it would allow long-term monitoring only after the UN had lifted its economic embargo. But Mr Ekeus said Iraq 'no longer insists' on a prior lifting of the embargo. He said that Iraq had presented a position paper on long-term monitoring which contained 'positive elements' which would be discussed in 'high-level technical talks' likely to convene in New York in August or September. However, he added that there remained 'a large number of outstanding issues'. UN diplomats in New York expressed caution over Iraq's apparent acceptance of resolution 715, but said that if Iraq was serious it could be a 'curtain-raiser' to the easing of sanctions. 'Agreement in itself won't trigger a lifting of the embargo, they will have to implement that agreement,' said one. Moreover, compliance with 715 is only one of a series of conditions Iraq would have to meet to fulfil all the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. The British, US and French UN ambassadors yesterday presented a list of outstanding areas of non-compliance to the Security Council. These included Iraq's failure to accept the new boundary with Kuwait, failure to disclose an exhaustive list of its weapons suppliers, a lack of information about Kuwaiti detainees and continued human rights abuses.</p>

'Imran said he also hopes that the resolution will mark the  beginning of a greater UN role in providing for the security  needs of the occupied Arab territories prior to the transfer of  these lands to their rightful owners.    'Imran, who was speaking on the sidelines of the opening  session of the second Conference on Solidarity and Cooperation  in the Mediterranean in the 1990's, remarked: We regret that a  member of the Security Council abstained on a paragraph that  affirms respect for the Geneva Conventions, particularly the  Fourth Convention, which explicitly deals with the world  community's responsibility for protecting people living under  occupation from being killed, oppressed, or terrorized.    'Imran pointed out that not only are the Israeli settlers  responsible for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, but the Israeli  authorities also are because of the prevailing settler mentality  and the instructions given to the Israeli Army not to intervene  to stop any Israeli murderer. He said the Security Council  resolution on the incident should have been adopted in a more  timely and urgent manner.    The Arab League assistant secretary general asserted that  Jerusalem is occupied territory according to Security Council  resolutions. He said this issue must be given priority in the  peace negotiations.    He emphasized that Jerusalem's Arab identity is "beyond  doubt" and said that all the Arab countries are committed to a  full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories,  including Jerusalem.    'Imran added: More important than resuming the negotiations  is Israel's abandonment of its procrastination and evasiveness.  The negotiations will be fruitless unless Israel foregoes its  rejectionist mentality and complies with international legality.    Explaining that the peace issue is a permanent item on the  Arab League's agenda, he noted that the next Arab foreign  ministers conference will discuss the Middle East peace process.</p>

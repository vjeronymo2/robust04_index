			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (5): Middle towns in good shape - In a difficult climate the second-tier cities are holding their own AT a cursory first glance, Macon's boarded-up shopfronts and downtown dilapidation, to say nothing of the decrepit warehouse at the end of the town's main street, suggest little in the way of economic prosperity. But peer more closely at Macon, about 85 miles south-west of Atlanta, and the picture changes. While the town has not matched the growth rates seen recently in Atlanta, it has a well-diversified industrial and commercial base, better-than-average unemployment rates, and - over the past couple of decades - has established a good record for attracting new investment. All this is typical of Georgia's 'second-tier' cities. Although each has individual characteristics, towns such as Augusta, Macon, Savannah, Columbus and Albany can look back on the 1980s with some satisfaction. According to Mr Dean Albert Niemi, writing in the monthly Georgia Trend magazine, total personal income in the five cities over the past decade grew by 101.8 per cent, 92.2 per cent, 82.3 per cent, 78.8 per cent and 70.8 per cent respectively. That failed to meet the growth rates seen in Atlanta, with the result that the state's largest city generated 52 per cent of Georgia's personal income at the end of the decade, compared with 47.9 per cent at the beginning. Nevertheless, against Atlanta's rapid expansion, the second-tier cities have made an admirable effort to hold their own. These towns also appear to be weathering the tougher climate of the 1990s in reasonably good shape. Macon demonstrates how the general diversity of 'middle' Georgia's economy helps. On the minus side, the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center has a strong influence on the area, and jobs - in line with the overall reduction in US defence spending - have been declining here recently. In 1991, when Warner Robins was reckoned to have a total economic impact on middle Georgia of around Dollars 2.1bn (through salaries and the purchase of goods and services), the base employed around 18,620 people. That compared with 19,988 in the previous year and 20,631 in 1985. The decline was concentrated in civilian employment; the military base employed around 2,000 people less in 1991, than it did four years earlier. But other big employers in the area have offered stable, even expanding, prospects. The largest in Macon itself is Brown &amp; Williamson, the tobacco manufacturer which is owned by Britain's BAT Industries and employs around 29,500 people. Other leading corporations range from a division of Weyerhaeuser, the West Coast-based pulp and paper company, which makes stuffing for nappies, to Geico, the large insurer which moved back office operations to Macon over a decade ago, and Charter Medical, the hospital management company, which is headquartered in the town. Aerospace companies, such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, are another feature of the area - a spin-off from the Robins base. Given the defence spending cuts and retrenchment in the commercial airline market, this might appear to be a bearish influence on the local economy. But even here the picture is not one of unmitigated gloom. Locals point out that corporate restructurings have sometimes benefited relatively low-cost plants in Georgia, at the expense of facilities elsewhere in the nation. For example, following internal bidding, some of the work being carried out at McDonnell Douglas's Columbus, Ohio, plant - which the defence group recently announced would close - is scheduled to be relocated to the Macon region. One local businessman predicts that 1,000 jobs could be added over the next year. Clearly, however, new industry has been wooed and it has not always come cheap. Officials at the Greater Macon Chamber of Commerce recount the tale of one New Jersey manufacturer, who was promising a mere 250 jobs but produced a heady Dollars 7.5m incentive list as his price for relocating. In spite of these formidable demands, officials say they still believe he will move to the middle Georgia area - implying that at least some of the terms have been met. Of all the second-tier towns, Macon is perhaps most closely affected by the expansion of Atlanta itself. Locals are ambivalent about the impact. Some suggest that having the larger city's facilities within a 90-minute drive attracts executives who want to operate in a cosier environment than Atlanta can offer. Others argue that some businesses have found the Atlanta hubbub more convenient and cold-shouldered Macon as a result. Savannah, further south and on the coast, has a slightly different tale. It shares, Macon's industrial diversity. Locals estimate that the town supplies around 100,000 jobs and supports some 80,000 families. Yet the largest manufacturing employer is Gulfstream Aerospace, the upmarket corporate jet manufacturer, which provides around 3,275 jobs, followed by Union Camp Corporation, the paper products company, with 3,200. Fort Howard Paper Company is third with just 1,000. Tourism, however, is a much bigger factor - partly because of the city's geographical location and partly because of its historical roots. It is reckoned that Savannah gets over 5m 'visitors' a year, of whom perhaps half are tourists (as opposed to visiting relatives, for example). These tend to fall into two categories: either older tourists attracted by the town's history, or families driving south to Florida and Disneyland, in need of a 'stop-over' city. Either way, the arrivals pump almost Dollars 600m into the local economy and provide around 16,500 jobs. Here, recession has taken a toll: the downturn in the economy has dented the industry nationwide and Savannah has endured small declines in the number of visitors and the money they spend. But at least the upmarket nature of these tourists has provided some insulation and there are hopes that the 1994 Olympics will also publicise the town's name and reputation. Savannah is to host the yachting events. Perhaps the town's most important success story, however, has been the growth of the Port of Savannah, which is under the control of the Georgia Ports Authority. Garden City Terminal, about 7 miles west of the centre of Savannah, now houses a six-berth container port, where business has been growing recently. In the year to end-June, for example, the facilities saw a 13 per cent increase in containerised cargo to 3.85m tons. Some projections suggest that this figure could total around 6.4m tons by 2000. Already, growth has been encouraged by the construction of a Dollars 70m bridge over the Savannah River offering an enlarged 185ft of vertical clearance. A further improvement should come from the dredging of a 42-ft channel up the river this year.</p>

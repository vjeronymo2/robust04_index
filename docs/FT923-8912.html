			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Flagstone deeper in red with Pounds 2.5m Flagstone Holdings, the marine and leisure, property and light industrial services group, fell deeper into the red in the year to January 1 with pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.5m against Pounds 934,000. The directors said that because of uncertainty over future working capital and the possible uncertainty over the realisable value of the assets, the auditors were expected to qualify their report. In the meantime, the directors were not drawing salaries. Although turnover rose to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 956,000) cost of sales were Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 1.06m). In addition, this time there was a Pounds 625,000 investment property write-down and a Pounds 400,000 exceptional debit. Losses per share deepened to 1.58p (0.68p). A wholly-owned subsidiary, Universal Shipyards (Solent), is disposing of the demonstration yacht, Universal Hartbeat, for Pounds 40,000 in cash to Fawdry and Evans (Management), in which Mr John Harding, managing director of Flagstone, is interested.</p>

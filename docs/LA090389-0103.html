			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SOUTH;  </P> <P> SOUTH CAROLINA GIVES NEW COACH 27-21 VICTORY  </P> <P> Harold Green ran for 160 yards and two touchdowns to lead South Carolina past  Duke, 27-21, Saturday night at Columbia, S.C., and give Coach Sparky Woods his  first Division I-A victory.  </P> <P> Green, a 6-foot-2, 218-pound senior, scored on runs of 42 yards and one yard,  most of which were through the middle of the Blue Devil defense, an area Coach  Steve Spurrier hoped to shore up this season.  </P> <P> Duke got most of its pointsd from star flanker Clarkston Hines, who scored his  22nd and 23rd career touchdowns on receptions of four yards and one yard.  </P> <P> The game was dedicated by the South Carolina players to the late Joe Morrison,  Woods' predecessor who died of a heart attack in February.  </P> <P> South Carolina, 8-4 last season, scored two plays into its first possession on  Green's tackle-breaking, 42-yard run through the middle of Duke's defense.  </P> <P> Duke, 7-3-1 in 1988, scored on its next possession -- a 75-yard drive that  ended with Hines' first touchdown. The extra-point kick went wide to the right.  </P> <P> Gamecock kicker Collin Mackie then got the first of two first-half field goals,  breaking by one Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers' 202-point career scoring  record at South Carolina.  </P> <P> North Carolina 10, Maryland 6 -- Anthony Barbour scored on a seven-yard run  late in the third quarter, and the Wolfpack defense held off a fourth-quarter  charge by the Terrapins for an Atlantic Coast Conference victory at Raleigh,  N.C.  </P> <P> Maryland quarterback Neil O'Donnell, who pulled off a last-second victory over  North Carolina State last season, almost did it again, completing five of his  first seven passes in the Terrapins' final drive. But after Maryland reached  the N.C. State 17, the drive ended with two incompletions.  </P> <P> Clemson 30, Furman 0 -- The Paladins, defending Division I-AA champions, were  no match for the 12th-ranked Tigers and were routed at Clemson, S.C.  </P> <P> Furman had five turnovers, including three first-quarter fumbles. In the fourth  quarter, a blocked punt went into the end zone, where Tony Mauney recovered for  Clemson's final touchdown.  </P> <P> The Tigers gained more yards passing than running -- 166 yards to 155 yards --  for the first time in nearly two years as they handed the Paladins their first  shutout in 76 games.  </P> <P> Last season, the Tigers averaged 270 yards rushing and 114 yards passing a  game.  </P> <P> Villanova 20, Richmond 17 -- Quarterback Kirk Schulz completed 27 of 43 passes  for 317 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner with 8:26 left, as  the Wildcats rallied to beat the Spiders in a Yankee Conference opener at  Richmond, Va.  </P> <P> The winning throw went 22 yards to Robert Brady.  </P> <P> Virginia Tech 29, Akron 3 -- Quarterback Will Furrer passed for 211 yards and  three touchdowns for Virginia Tech at Blacksburg, Va.  </P></p>

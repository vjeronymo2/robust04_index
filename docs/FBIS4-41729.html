			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Riga, Jun 27, BNS -- Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis plans to declare at 1400 on Tuesday at a press briefing  if he will announce or not the citizenship law, and say about  his stand in changing of customs tariffs, President's Office  told BNS.    During his meeting with Aluksne inhabitants on Saturday,  Ulmanis admitted that the citizenship law could be sent for  repeated parliament consideration.    "I will ask the parliament to consider the citizenship law  one more time so that the interests of the Latvian people as  well as international norms were observed in it," said Ulmanis.    As reported, the Cabinet called the president not to  announce  the citizenship law, adopted on June 21, but send it for  repeated parliament consideration. The law's article No. 14  provides for the quota principle that allows to naturalize each  year a number of citizens equal to 0.1 percent of the body of  citizens, starting with the year 2000.    The naturalization quota principle endangers Latvia's  enrollment in the Council of Europe [CE] and the very  negotiations on the granting the CE associate member status to  the Baltic country, and that poses a threat to Latvia's further  integration into the European Union, according to the government  statement. The quota principle also complicates Latvia's  entrance into European collective security structures, the  statement read. [passage omitted]</p>

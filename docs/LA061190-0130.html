			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEWARD BOUND;  </P> <P> OPERATION EXODUS LENDS SUPPORT TO SOVIET JEWS IN THEIR RETURN TO ISRAEL  </P> <P> Israeli businessman Mendel Kaplan reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a  sheaf of papers written in Hebrew and English. In mundane words and numbers,  the documents detail housing construction for Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel  in a modern exodus that sometimes sets the world on edge.  </P> <P> Casting aside geopolitics for a moment, Kaplan -- also head of the private  agency responsible for transporting and resettling the emigrants -- flips  through the pages and delivers a litany on the perils of putting up apartments  in his country.  </P> <P> Stabbing a finger at one project, he says: "I'm going to take photographs of  (the contractor's) progress." Then he adds, "I've been in business in Israel  for 20 years, and I'm happier when I'm checking up on the exact progress of  every aspect of my activities. I'm putting it gently."  </P> <P> Kaplan, a steel and wire manufacturer who doubles as chairman of the Jewish  Agency Board of Governors, is in Los Angeles on a private trip. But he concedes  it is almost impossible to extract himself completely from the complex  operation behind "another great moment in Jewish history, the ingathering of  the last reservoir of Jews left in the world."  </P> <P> In his Jewish Agency role, the bluff, no-nonsense Kaplan is at the focal point  of a worldwide campaign to raise $600 million over the next three years to pay  for the unprecedented and controversial flood of Jews leaving the Soviet Union  for Israel. Jewish communities in the United States are expected to raise more  than two-thirds of this amount, some $420 million. In Los Angeles, the goal is  $36 million.  </P> <P> Since the Soviet Union liberalized emigration policies in the spring of 1989,  some 51,700 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel. Estimates of how many of the  Soviet Union's 1.5 to 2 million Jews ultimately will leave have varied widely,  ranging up to 1 million. Kaplan scoffs at these higher estimates and asserts  that playing with potential immigration numbers is dangerous.  </P> <P> "The more numbers (of Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel) you put in the  newspaper, the more pressure the Arabs put on the Russians," he maintains,  touching on one aspect of the political volatility of this issue, which mixes  Soviet internal affairs and Big Power relations with the already fiery stew of  Middle Eastern conflict.  </P> <P> For example, during his recent summit meeting with President Bush, Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said his government would reconsider its  emigration policy unless Israel guaranteed Soviet Jews would not be resettled  on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Days later, the Soviets backed away  from this position, telling U.S. officials they are "committed" to liberalized  emigration.  </P> <P> Based on the number of Soviet Jewish families who have requested resettlement  in Israel, Kaplan estimates that 600,000 to 700,000 currently are eligible to  come to Israel. In Los Angeles, officials orchestrating the local fund-raising  drive acknowledge the influx of Soviet Jews involves explosive issues, such as  where they settle in Israel and the long-running uprising of Palestinians in  the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East  War.  </P> <P> But they say such issues are secondary to their main concern: helping as many  Jews as possible to leave the Soviet Union as soon as possible. Citing worries  about the Soviet Union's internal stability and a rise in anti-Semitism, they  say fund-raising efforts for Operation Exodus have so far encountered little  resistance.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that there is "definitely some concern" about settlement of  Soviet Jews on the West Bank, the Los Angeles Jewish community -- ranging from  the "very orthodox" to the politically liberal -- has given broad support to  the drive, said Richard Gunther, co-chairman of the local effort. Since its  start-up last month, the campaign has raised $12 million in cash and pledges,  he says.  </P> <P> How many emigrants have settled in the occupied territories is a matter of  dispute that hinges partly on what the Israelis and their Arab opponents  consider occupied territory. Before the new conservative coalition was formed  on Friday, the caretaker government said that that 318 Soviet emigrants had  moved to the West Bank. However, based on its own survey, the Associated Press  reported that nearly 4,000 Jews also had moved to five suburbs of Arab east  Jerusalem. Israel maintains that although it took that part of the city from  Jordan during the 1967 war, it annexed the area and does not consider it  occupied territory.  </P> <P> Moreover, Kaplan asserts that "every single housing unit that has been approved  by the cabinet or ministry of housing for Jerusalem is inside the area  controlled by Israel before 1967."  </P> <P> Despite the contentious potential, the Los Angeles fund drive began quickly.  The need for cash was so pressing, officials say, that the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles borrowed $4.6 million to assist immigrants  already in Israel. The federation is the umbrella group directing the fund  drive.  </P> <P> "(Operation Exodus is) above and beyond our campaign for regular purposes,  which will raise $52 million this year, and we had to open this drive  immediately," says Wayne L. Feinstein, federation executive vice president. He  notes that 70% of American Jews are of Russian and East European origin, and  that they feel an affinity for their contemporaries in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "If my grandfather hadn't bought a steamship ticket out of Hamburg in the  teens, I could very well be waiting for exit permission," he explains.  </P> <P> Loren Basch, director of the Operation Exodus campaign, said the drive will  attempt to tap donors who do not typically contribute to other Jewish  campaigns, reaching a total of perhaps 70,000 to 80,000 contributors.  </P> <P> Kaplan admits there has been a hurry-up nature to the resettlement program  because the influx from the Soviet Union has been much greater than expected.  In February, the Jewish Agency estimated that 70,000 Jews would come to Israel  this year, and that number had been bumped up from 33,000 last fall. Now the  agency is planning for 150,000 Jews to arrive in 1990.  </P> <P> The agency pays all transportation costs -- about $1,000 per person -- plus all  the new immigrants' expenses for their first six months in Israel, Kaplan says.  Currently, there are 20,000 empty housing units in Israel where Soviet  immigrants might settle. A building program for 55,000 units will begin to  provide additional housing in about a year, he says.  </P> <P> He disputes reports that there has been "no progress" in providing housing,  saying, "there is real progress on the ground. . . ." Contractors receive  bonuses if they finish work on time or ahead of schedule.  </P> <P> Kaplan is a native of South Africa and maintains ties with that country's  Jewish community. Although he supports an end to apartheid, Kaplan says he  draws no direct parallels with Soviet Jewish emigration and the freedom drives  of black South Africans.  </P> <P> Black South Africans are already in their homeland, he says, whereas Soviet  Jewish emigration to Israel is another act in the age-old Jewish search for a  homeland.  </P></p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / University staffing trails student rise Academic staffing levels have failed to keep up with rising numbers of full-time students in UK universities during the past four years of expansion, government statistics published today show. While student numbers at 'old' universities - excluding former colleges and polytechnics upgraded to university status from 1992 onwards - have risen by 34 per cent over the past four years, the number of full-time academic staff has risen by only 13 per cent. The rise in staff numbers was concentrated on research while the number of teaching staff increased by only 7.6 per cent, said Mr David Triesman, general secretary of the Association of University Teachers. Mr Triesman said this meant the average ratio of full-time students to teaching staff had risen from 10.6:1 to 14:1. He said: 'Treating professional staff as if they were machines that could be set to run faster and faster places a low value on quality in higher education, which is suffering from go-stop planning and gross underfunding.' There has been a cut of 30 per cent in public funding per student since 1980, says a report produced for the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, which represents universities, by London university's Institute of Education. The report predicts 'continued financial stringency', and said 'no change of government would alter the broad outlook to any significant extent'. It suggested that universities' strategic plans should incorporate the possibility of a period of consolidation, for reasons including 'the capacity of the labour market to absorb very rapid increases in graduate numbers' and 'the maintenance of acceptable quality'. The proportion of students winning first-class honours degrees has risen by 50 per cent in 11 years to 9 per cent, from 6 per cent in 1983. The statistics also reveal that numbers of mature students have risen substantially, with 18 per cent of new full-time undergraduates being aged 21 or over - compared with 10 per cent 10 years ago. Part-time students also showed an increase - of 11 per cent - on the previous year. Subjects enjoying the largest increases among undergraduate entrants last year were law, computer studies and psychology, while teacher training and nursing saw a decline in new recruits. Expansion has raised the number of women in higher education - they account for 23 per cent of academic staff (up from 15 per cent 10 years before), and for 47 per cent of full-time undergraduates (from 42 per cent a decade earlier). However, men still outnumber women by six to one on engineering and technology courses and three to one in mathematical sciences. University Statistics 1993-94 - Students and Staff.

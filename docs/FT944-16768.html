			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Jury told of Pounds 1.36m passport 'racket' A barrister and a solicitor ran a multi-million-dollar passport racket preying on the fears of wealthy Hong Kong residents desperate to leave before China's 1997 takeover, a court heard yesterday. Numerous documents were forged and the Home Office 'fooled' repeatedly, Southwark Crown Court was told. For nearly three years Mr James Walker, a solicitor, and barrister Mr Paul Samrai got away with the 'scam' which enabled dozens of people to get the right to live in Britain, said Mr Brendon Finucane, prosecuting. He alleged that altogether the men's company, charging about Pounds 40,000 for each application, made a total of Pounds 1.36m, most of which was obtained illegally. Mr Finucane told the jury that Mr Samrai and Mr Walker - the only one before the court - and others, set up a Hong Kong-based operation. Mr Samrai saw customers in the colony and then forwarded often false documentation to Mr Walker in Britain. Once they reached the solicitor's office at a London law firm Mr Walker signed them knowing many were bogus, claimed Mr Finucane. Trading on the 'trust and integrity' his profession attracted, he then submitted them to an 'overworked' Home Office immigration department as part of applications for 'right of abode' in Britain or 'indefinite leave to remain'. Counsel claimed 'certificates of entitlement' were subsequently issued. Mr Finucane told the court that Mr Samrai and Mr Walker set up the business initially without any dishonest intentions. The case continues</p>

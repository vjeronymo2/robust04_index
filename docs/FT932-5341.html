			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Bristol strikes deal to develop 27-acre site BRISTOL Development Corporation has struck its most significant deal yet with agreement to develop 27 acres of land as a retail and leisure complex, which the corporation says will eventually create about 1,500 jobs. Contracts have been exchanged with Wilson Connolly, the commercial property arm of Wilson (Connolly) Holdings, as lead developer of the site, close to the city centre. Financial terms of the deal, announced yesterday, have not been disclosed but the corporation puts a Pounds 50m value on the completed scheme, which will include nearly 200,000 sq ft of retail space. Agreement has also been reached with National Amusements of the US for a 14-screen cinema with 3,600 seats. The development will be on two parcels of derelict land straddling the river Avon in south-east Bristol and alongside a new spine road, which is under construction and due for completion next summer. The road links the M32 and the A4 Bath road. Mr Miles Collinge, chief executive of the corporation, said yesterday: 'Our policy of putting infrastructure first has now paid off and has led directly to the securing of this significant regeneration project, the largest leisure and retail complex in the south of England.' Wilson Connolly has submitted a detailed planning application to the corporation and is expected to complete the scheme before the end of 1994. Mr Alan Rudge, managing director of Wilson Connolly, said the sites were 'outstanding locations for leisure and retail facilities, which Bristol and the surrounding area are currently lacking'. Imperial Chemical Industries will today submit a planning application to improve road access to 2,000 acres of land owned by the company near the River Severn including a fertiliser plant and a pharmaceutical works. ICI wants an interchange on the new M49, which crosses the company's land and links the M5 with the second Severn bridge, now under construction. There are expansion plans for the Avlon Works and ICI has long-standing outline planning consent to develop 1,500 acres for commercial and leisure use.</p>

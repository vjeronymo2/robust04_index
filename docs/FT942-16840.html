			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Rwanda PM and UN team die in rampage A spate of murder and pillaging in Rwanda yesterday claimed the lives of Ms Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, as well as three Belgians acting as military observers for the United Nations. The murders follow the assassination on Wednesday night of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana, president of the impoverished east African country. A UN official in the capital Kigali said the premier was killed near the presidential palace. UN headquarters in New York said a number of other observers in the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda (Unamir) were missing. Gen Habyarimana and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighbouring Burundi were both killed when their aircraft was shot down as it was preparing to land in Kigali. The presidents were flying back from regional peace talks in Tanzania. Two other Burundi ministers, five senior Rwandan officials including the army chief of staff and the French crew of the presidential jet were also believed to have died on the aircraft. The killings have derailed Rwanda's UN-sponsored peace process, already under severe strain. A three-year civil war waged by the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) ended with a peace agreement last year. But the president, who took power in a 1973 coup, had angered much of the population by delaying the formation of a national government which included a power-sharing agreement with the RPF. Even before Gen Habyarimana's assassination, Rwanda was tense. Two government ministers had been hacked to death. The bankrupt government was weighed down by a drought and 400,000 refugees from tribal killings in neighbouring Burundi. Gen Habyarimana's death has left a power vacuum in Rwanda. Army troops, presidential guards and gendarmes were yesterday reported to have gone on the rampage in Kigali. Residents said they could hear sporadic gunfire and mortar bombs exploding. The UN headquarters in Kigali was reported to have come under mortar fire. The world body has 2,500 UN peacekeepers stationed in Rwanda. The turmoil in Rwanda has spelled another blow to the beleaguered UN peacekeeping missions in Africa. In Nairobi Mr Habi Mana, the Rwandan ambassador, blamed the killings on the rebel RPF. 'The plane was blown up by a Soviet-made Sam-7 missile, which have been used by the RPF in the past. The Rwandese army has no Soviet military equipment,' he said. The RPF denied it was involved in the attack. 'The plane was shot down from the airport base, which is controlled by the gendarmerie. The area is heavily guarded and totally out of bounds to the RPF,' Mr Paul Dusaidi of RPF said in New York. Diplomats believe Gen Habyarimana was the victim of a power struggle between rival military forces. Burundi was reported quiet yesterday, despite the loss of its second president from the Hutu tribe in less than six months. President Ntaryamira had been appointed in January to replace Mr Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi's first democratically elected president, who was murdered after less than 100 days in office. Mr Ndadaye's assassination by Tutsi paratroops triggered a bloodbath in Burundi. In Rwanda, the killing of a Hutu president was used as an excuse to delay the country's slow march to democracy. President Habyarimana, also a Hutu, feared sharing power with the Tutsi-led RPF.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Gomorra' in Vienna - Opera Vienna as Gomorrah, in HK Gruber's new 'musical show' at the Volksoper. Not that the local elbow-digs in Richard Bletschacher's libretto matter much; for this Gomorra ('h'-less in German) might be any tidy, prosperous, enlightened Western capital, and the fire and flood which destroy it are no divine punishment, Old Testament style, but natural civic developments - set by Gruber to infernally buoyant music. The fable is too transparent to need commentary. Gomorra, a liberal city-state with all modern comforts, is being visited by a representative of Higher Authority. As his tour of inspection begins, a Presenter proudly catalogues the innumerable fine things that Gomorrans own and cherish, and above all their great volunteer Fire Brigade, entrusted with preserving order and calm. (Distant cries from dissident Pyromaniacs are heard but ignored.) The climax of the visit is to be a grand ball, for which the local paper, 'Public Opinion', wants an appealing Princess to choose the lottery-winner. A freelance reporter and a photographer, Augustin and Flitzer, are sent to find one in the overloaded asylum for Endangered Existences (the homeless, the work-shy, dreamers, artists and musicians), a luxurious health-farm. They find Gwendolyn, a Gastarbeiterin from the North. She and Augustin fall into an irrelevant mutual rapture. In due course, transformed into a fashion victim by the newspaper, Gwendolyn takes the stand at the ball; but first Valentina, Augustin's recent paramour and daughter of the Chief Editor, makes a bitter, rebellious scene - and then the Pyromaniacs strike with fire at every corner of the city. In Act 2, the warring popular forces take the foreground while the individual characters recede. The Pyromaniacs, who profess no creed but a vague sentiment for getting back to the land (wildly unrealistic, in the circumstances), exult in the city-wide holocaust; the Fire Brigade retreats underground to open the sluice-gates of the sewers, thus extinguishing the blaze but unfortunately drowning almost everybody in the flood. The Higher Authority man makes a suave departure by spaceship, without uttering a word of judgment, and Augustin and Gwendolyn - raptly impervious to everything - float away in a rubber dinghy to nowhere in particular. Gruber's music underlines no moral, though his huge, swinging 'underwater can-can' finale for the waterlogged citizens betrays a grimly apocalyptic gloat. Gomorra, his longest work so far, pursues his disarmingly original, post-modernist vein less than an equally impassioned one: 'dispassionate music of merciless elegance', aimed deliberately at young, pop-oriented ears. The love duets - and Augustin's subversive paean to cigarette smoking, punctuated by satisfied smoke-rings - rejoice in lazy, sexy syncopations. The bass-lines rock overbearingly (Gruber made a notable career as a double-bass); odd taped sounds are enlisted, and live swanee-whistles, and at the end massed harmonicas in serene chords. Before that there are music-boxes in chorus, and a long unison-strings plea, expressly 'reminiscent of Mahler or Berg' (as it certainly is, but also of Schoenberg's Moses in his last despairing cry: 'O word that I lack]') broken by hostile bangs on empty petrol cans. Upon its neo-Broadway, neo-Weill grounds, Gruber's score developed astringently and gorgeously. Among the Volksoper principals, Ildiko Raimondi's Gwendolyn and Hans Helm's Fire Chief deliver their roles with nicely expert wryness. Josef Luftensteiner's Augustin, properly droopy-eyed, sounds like an operetta-artiste where a plaintive pop-voice would suit better. The enthusiastic Valentina, Flitzer and pyromaniac Hilarius of Karin Goltz, Josef Fortner and Adolf Dallapozza are too much out of raw stock. Clasped (even rehearsed) within an overall frame, they do their nut but fail to wring our withers. Some blame must be attached to the British producer Mike Fields. Up to a point, his vaudeville moppings-and-mowings for the multiple chorus were silly/funny enough; but Act 2, where the music expands to full-throated communal scale, looked far too bitty - it did not begin to match the elegance nor the exuberant menace of the score. Nor did the Volksoper chorus rise to the scathing precision of their music; they were indifferently co-ordinated and scatterbrained. Perhaps their focus was blunted by politeness. The Volksoper's Sunday matinees are evidently populated by aged regulars, many of whom soon hobbled out in dudgeon, or at least stuck fingers in offended ears, as the (admittedly very loud) native ritual proceeded. The 'Greisenlied' chorus of twitching wrinklies - 'We know all that, including so-called 'love']' ' got a dampened reception. All the same, Gomorra invites and deserves a production that will give full, various values to its crowd-content, which is popular as could be.

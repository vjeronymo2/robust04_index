			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Lords call for task force to fight EU fraud Top business executives with experience of multinational companies should be appointed to a special task force to tackle large-scale fraud in the European Union, a House of Lords committee recommends today. Lord Hunt of Tamworth, chairman of the Lords committee on the European communities, highlights the latest evidence of 'continuing fraud and irregularity on a massive scale'. Commenting on the report by the Court of Auditors on the 1992 community budget - which showed Ecu162m had been misapplied or not received - he says a similar condemnation of international industrial or trading groups in the UK would result in shareholders sacking the directors and appointing a new board. The committee calls for the task force to be established as part of urgent remedial action co-ordinated by the council of ministers, the European Commission and member states. It suggests that the task force comprise four to six people with wide experience in the administration of large concerns and with up-to-date knowledge of modern accounting and auditing techniques. The committee believes some of the members should be drawn from international groups such as Shell, BP, Unilever and Phillips. Their remit should include a 'radical look' at the whole system of administering EU funds, with a view to recommending specific changes. Changes in the administrative arrangements made by the individual member states for carrying out EU policy are advocated by the committee, which notes that 'many of them do it badly'. It urges action to ensure that the focal point in each member state to which community funds are channelled is accountable for their proper use. This should apply whether the funds are disbursed directly or through intermediary organisations. In evidence to the committee, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, looked for more effective action from recent changes in the European Commission, involving the commissioner, Mr Peter Schmidhuber, being given specific responsibility for the anti-fraud unit. The chancellor expected proposals to be produced by the end of March for strengthening the ability of the commission and the member states to take action. He also referred to proposals by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, which would require member states to ensure that serious fraud against the EU's financial interests ranked as a serious and extraditable offence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.S. Dzhindoyan and A.Ye. Naydeenov, Scientific </F> Research Institute of Microbiology, Ministry of Defense, Kirov;  UDC 613.636:616-078]    [Abstract] A common approach to safety  in the handling of pathogenic microorganisms in microbiological  laboratories is based on the probability of biological effects  resulting from exposure to a microorganism or its metabolites.  This approach also entails definition of socially acceptable  risk vis-a-vis a defined endpoint, e.g., death. The suggestion  is made that safety be calculated in terms of probability that  protective barriers might be overcome by the pathogen per hour  of work and be released into the working area. For microbiology  laboratories concerned with pathogens the recommendation is made  that the acceptable probability for such an event be set at  10[.sup]-8[/] h[.sup]-1[/].

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Effective wins for Germany and Spain The natural order of western European soccer re-asserted itself when Germany and Spain disposed of Belgium and Switzerland on Saturday with no more than a modicum of fuss. Germany beat Belgium 3-2 and Spain beat Switzerland 3-0. The German result in an unseasonably cool Chicago was also closer than the balance of play warranted. Albert's 90th-minute goal set up a frantic finish, with Preud'homme, the admirable Belgian 'keeper, up in the German penalty area and almost geting his head to an injury-time cross. Belgian appeals for a second-half penalty after Weber had been brought down were waved away. Klinsmann, maintaining his goal-a-game pace, and Voller were too quick and co-ordinated for the Belgian defence.</p>

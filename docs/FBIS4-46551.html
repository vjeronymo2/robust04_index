			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liana Minasyan, under rubric "Justice": </F> "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Military Tribunal Sentences Yuriy  Belichenko to Death: Radical Party Attempts To Save the  Mercenary"]    [Text] Yuriy Belichenko, a military pilot who was sentenced  four days ago by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Military Tribunal  in accordance with the articles pertaining to "premeditated  murder under aggravating circumstances" and for the "inflicting  of material damage of an especially large scale" (213 million  rubles in August 1992 prices), has been sentenced to death. He  participated in bombings by the Azerbaijani air forces of  villages in Mardakertskiy Rayon, which led to losses of human  life and large amounts of destruction. Belichenko, who formally  is considered to be a citizen of Ukraine (where he was called up  into the Soviet Army of that period), and served in Azerbaijan.  After the collapse of the USSR and the withdrawal of Russian  troops, he continued to serve there. His aircraft was shot down  after a combat sortie and, according to the data in the  investigation, the pilot admitted that he had been recruited for  $10,000 monthly, plus a bonus for successful bombing.    Incidentally, there is another pilot -- true, a Russian one,  Chistyakov -- who is in a similar situation. The only difference  is that the court that is trying him in Stepanakert is still in  session and the sentence has not yet been pronounced.  Belichenko, however, is left with the possibility of requesting  the presidium of the NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] Supreme  Council to pardon him, but, according to data provided by the  miliary procurator, such a request has not yet been made.    According to certain information, the Ukrainian authorities  have not shown any interest in Belichenko's fate, despite his  formal Ukrainian citizenship. The reason that they give is that  his actions were the consequence of a personal choice and that  he himself bears the responsibility for them. As a mercenary,  this pilot cannot be recognized as a prisoner of war, and the  laws governing the protection of prisoners of war do not extend  to him.    Nevertheless Belichenko's wife, who now lives with their  children in Krasnodar Kray, has sent telegrams to Russian  minister of foreign affairs Kozyrev and to the Karabakh  authorities, requesting them to take part in her husband's fate.  Something that can serve as a formal precedent for such  participation is the situation involving six Russian mercenaries  who were sentenced to death in Baku for having participated in  combat actions on the side of the Karabakh Armenians. At that  time they were handed over to the Russian authorities in  exchange for several Azerbaijanis who had been taken prisoner.  Karabakh official consultations that have already been conducted  by the Russian MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], are linked  with the possibility of exchanging Belichenko for five Armenians  who also have been sentenced to death -- they are incriminated  in the murder of Azerbaijani journalist Salatyn Askerova  (originally, seven persons had been accused, but two of them  have already died in prison, and the fate of the remaining  persons still remains unknown). As for pilot Chistyakov, it is  not precluded that, after the sentence has been pronounced, he  will be handed over to Russia and will serve his punishment on  its territory.    Meanwhile the Radical Party has decided to choose the  example  of Belichenko to carry out a demonstration to abolish the death  penalty and to establish a permanent international tribunal on  military crimes. Party members who picketed yesterday in front  of the Armenian Embassy in Moscow feel that crimes similar to  those that Belichenko is accused of committing should be under  the jurisdiction of an international criminal court with  supranational powers, and they have stated that "the incident  with him is viewed as a model one, and we are speaking not about  a humanitarian, but a political problem." Having shared their  views with Armenian ambassador Mamikonyan, who received them and  who stated that "the context spoils the idea: pity concerning  the sentencing of a person whose actions led to the death of  peaceful citizens, was expressed with a complete lack of an  attempt to analyze other similar incidents from the opposite  side," the participants in the demonstration expressed their  readiness to picket the Azerbaijani Embassy also.</p>

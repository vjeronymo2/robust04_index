			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE GOP VOTE DEALS BLOW TO GINGRICH  </P> <P> In a sharp setback for combative Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and  hard-line conservatives, House Republicans Monday rejected his candidate for  the No. 3 leadership post and reelected a moderate Californian, Rep. Jerry  Lewis (R-Highland), after a bitter contest that left deep divisions in GOP  ranks.  </P> <P> The usually affable and soft-spoken Lewis, who defeated Rep. Carl D. Pursell  (R-Mich.) by a surprisingly large margin of 98 to 64, declared the outcome a  "disaster" for Gingrich and two of his close allies who tried to oust Lewis as  chairman of the House Republican Conference.  </P> <P> "Their purpose was not to help Carl Pursell but to dump Jerry Lewis," snapped  Lewis, who said that Reps. Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado) and Vin Weber  (R-Minn.) were "designated deputies" by Gingrich in the campaign against him.  </P> <P> In another implied rebuff for Gingrich, who earlier this year led the revolt  against the first budget package endorsed by President Bush, Minority Leader  Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) expressed deep concern that the 167-member House GOP  group not become a "battleground" where Republicans snipe at each other or  attack Bush and his Cabinet members.  </P> <P> Lewis' victory indicates that the President will have smoother working  relations with Congress than he would have otherwise, because Pursell made  clear that he would carry on a fight against both new taxes and new spending if  he was victorious.  </P> <P> It also gave Lewis a strong vote of confidence if, as many Republicans expect,  he opposes Gingrich for the Republican leader's job when Michel, 67, eventually  steps down from the post he has held for nearly a decade.  </P> <P> But another candidate backed by Gingrich in a hard-fought race -- Rep. Guy  Vander Jagt (R-Mich.) -- decisively won his campaign for reelection as chairman  of the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee over Rep. Don  Sundquist (R-Tenn.) by a vote of 98 to 66.  </P> <P> The House GOP campaign fund-raising organization under Vander Jagt's direction  was accused by Sundquist of making improper financial arrangements with  consultants and polling organizations and getting unsatisfactory results.  Vander Jagt promised to review the complaints and make changes, if warranted.  </P> <P> Gingrich, who was reelected without opposition to his No. 2 position in the GOP  hierarchy, insisted that the Lewis-Pursell contest was not a referendum on him  or his followers. "I am for Jerry Lewis in some elections and against him in  others," Gingrich said. "The conference voted for the established leadership."  </P> <P> Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.), a Gingrich deputy whip, acknowledged that the  anti-Lewis campaign did not suit the mood of most Republicans. "More than  anything, they want to unify our party, and you never unify with purges,"  Gunderson told reporters.  </P> <P> In contrast with the sharp infighting among Republicans, House Democrats  reelected Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and their other leaders by  acclamation as they organized for the 102nd Congress that will convene in  January.  </P> <P> Democrats netted a gain of nine seats in the November elections while the  Republicans suffered a net loss of 10. One independent, Bernard Sanders,  defeated a GOP representative in Vermont.  </P> <P> In one major change, Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) was tapped to be the new  chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in advance of the  1992 elections.  </P> <P> On the GOP side, Republican leader Michel tried to smooth over the differences  between the forces backing Gingrich and those who lined up with Lewis in the  divisive battle.  </P> <P> Noting that his party has 101 fewer members than the opposition, Michel urged  the Republicans to work with President Bush because he can give them more  leverage by using his veto power to influence the shape of legislation in the  Democratic-controlled Congress.  </P> <P> "I must confess to having deep concerns when we spend our time sniping at each  other, at the President or at members of our Administration," Michel said. "It  can be a total disaster if we don't recognize that, outnumbered as we are, we  have to work together to achieve a unity of purpose."  </P></p>

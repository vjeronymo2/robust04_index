			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Triple blow to Texaco refinery caused blast Lightning strikes and the fracturing of a corroded pipe were part of a sequence of events which caused the explosion at Texaco's Milford Haven refinery on July 24. The Sunday lunchtime explosion caused extensive damage to the south Wales plant and started a fire, although there were no serious injuries. Production has yet to resume. The cost of lost output has not been divulged, but the damage alone runs into millions of pounds. Texaco has completed its preliminary investigation. Its final report will not be made until the result of a separate inquiry by the Health and Safety Executive. The HSE, which is expected to publish its preliminary report soon, still has inspectors on site. Mr Phil Walters, Texaco personnel superintendent, said yesterday: 'There were three separate occurrences. It is unusual to have them together, but that's what we did and that's what caused the explosion.' The first was a thunderstorm. Lightning caused a fire at a crude oil unit and caused power interruptions. Texaco's inquiry team reported: 'Pumps and cooling fans tripped out and there were many alarms on the panel and some of the information on levels and flows was misleading.' As a result there was a build-up of liquid hydrocarbon which tripped a compressor, and a mixture of vapour and liquid reached the flare system without being registered by monitors. The flare system was not designed for liquid. The third event was the compressor tripping again and the mixture being discharged from the flare drum into an overflow pipe. The pipe, not intended for liquid, vibrated and fell to the ground. The pipe had been thinned by corrosion on the inside and was nearing the end of its service life. Leaking liquid and vapour became an explosive mixture which was ignited by a heater. The inquiry team said of the causes: 'Each of these on its own could have caused a less severe incident, but in combination resulted in this more serious situation.' One of the team's recommendations is to have more conservative criteria for replacement of the refinery's piping systems. Texaco expects limited production to resume next month but the plant will not be back in full production until the end of October. None of the 630 staff has been laid off and the usual contract labour force of 400 has been increased to 1,500 to deal with the repairs.</p>

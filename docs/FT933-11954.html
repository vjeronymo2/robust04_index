			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Boeing shares rise despite warning on lower sales trend BOEING, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, yesterday reported a slight drop in second quarter net income and warned that a trend towards lower sales would continue into 1994, because of a global economic slowdown. However, Boeing shares rose sharply on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at Dollars 38 5/8 , up Dollars  7/8 , because the results were ahead of analysts' expectations. The company reported net earnings of Dollars 426m (Pounds 283m), or Dollars 1.25 a share, on sales of Dollars 7.98bn for the second quarter, compared with Dollars 432m, or Dollars 1.27 a share, on sales of Dollars 7.8bn in the same period last year. Analysts had expected earnings per share of around Dollars 1.05. Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said second-quarter sales were higher than the first quarter's Dollars 6.6bn because of the timing of commercial jet deliveries. In the first six months Boeing earned Dollars 751m, or Dollars 2.21 a share, down from the Dollars 852m, or Dollars 2.50 a share exclusive of accounting adjustments, in the same period of 1992. Sales fell from Dollars 15.79bn to Dollars 14.63bn. The drop in first-half earnings resulted largely from lower sales in its commercial aircraft and defence and space businesses. Boeing delivered 202 commercial aircraft in the period, down from 243 in the first half of 1992. Defence and space sales were around 14 per cent lower. Mr Shrontz said Boeing continued to expect full-year sales of around Dollars 26bn, down from Dollars 30.2bn in 1992. Second-half sales would be about 20 per cent lower than the first half, and this was consistent with cuts in production already announced by the company. 'Based on current programmes and schedules, the trend of lower sales levels will continue through 1994,' said Mr Shrontz. 'New orders for commercial transports continue to be below current delivery rates, and some customer requests to reschedule existing orders continue to be negotiated.' However, the company said operating profit margins on commercial jets were expected to be 'substantially maintained' as Boeing moved into this period of lower production. Margins also continued to improve in the defence and space business.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE HOLIDAYS;  </P> <P> BEFORE THE GLITZ;  </P> <P> CHILDREN CAN PEEK AT THE PAST AT AN ANTIQUE TOY EXHIBIT. A FESTIVAL WITH A  HAYRIDE IS ALSO PLANNED.  </P> <P> If you're looking for a calmer, gentler Christmas season for your children,  there are a few excursions that will soften some of the holiday glitz and  provide some meaningful fun.  </P> <P> Two displays of antique toys are going up for the holidays. If children think  toys and batteries have always gone together, they will find out how  yesterday's children managed to do without whiz-bang gadgetry.  </P> <P> Another option is a ranch-style Christmas festival, complete with a hayride.  </P> <P> The toy exhibit at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art opens Dec. 3.  One of the most intriguing items is a pair of roller skates dating back to the  1890s. The skates were carved from wood with leather straps around the toes and  heels. Each skate has four little wooden wheels inset in the bottom.  </P> <P> "There were no sidewalks back then, so we don't know where they were used,"  said Jeanne Brown, a museum docent who is setting up the exhibit. "Maybe they  used them in the house."  </P> <P> Most of the toys have been donated to the museum over the years by area  residents. Brown is setting them up around a seasonal theme, with Christmas  stockings hanging from a fireplace mantle. Life-size boy and girl mannequins  will be wearing Victorian-era holiday clothes.  </P> <P> Some of the toys are elegant. An ornate picture book about Cinderella comes  with a set of puzzle blocks that can be put together six ways, corresponding to  the pictures in the book. In their day, probably in the 1870s, they sold for 25  cents.  </P> <P> A Victorian doll sits majestically in an upholstered wicker doll carriage  decorated with elaborate scrollwork. Another doll, made in Germany at the turn  of the century, has a leather body with knees constructed to bend and real hair  on her head.  </P> <P> Some toys reflect everyday home life. A miniature cast iron stove sold in the  early 1900s is displayed with cast iron kettles, pots and a skillet on its six  burners. A miniature working sewing machine also will be shown. The six-inch  metal machine was made in California about 1920.  </P> <P> There's much more -- cowboy and Indian figures, an old Uncle Wiggly board game,  marbles, a game of Old Maid with cards showing the old maid at home alone  sipping tea and Henry Holler getting a licking with a switch.  </P> <P> At the Albinger Archeological Museum, children will see more of a hands-on  exhibit. Opening Dec. 2, the display includes old phonographs -- one from 1906  and an 1878 replica. They will see working antique music boxes dating back to  1880 and 1895, and a replica of an 1860 zoetrope, an early motion picture  machine.  </P> <P> A collection of Victorian dolls, including some from France, will be on  display. Children also will see handmade folk toys.  </P> <P> Some of the toys are from private collections in the area, and some are on loan  from local merchants.  </P> <P> For some outdoor fun, businessman Mel Cummings is again hosting his Cummings  Ranch Christmas Festival to benefit the community outreach program at St.  John's Regional Medical Center.  </P> <P> The festival will be Dec. 1 and 2, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the ranch, three  miles up Wheeler Canyon Road, which is off Foothill Road near Santa Paula. Last  year about 750 people attended the fund raiser for the program.  </P> <P> Children can take a hayride around the ranch and see cows, horses, pigs, sheep  and fields of oats. Christmas ornaments and handmade crafts will be on sale,  along with homemade pies, jelly and other snacks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> * The toy exhibit at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art, 100 E.

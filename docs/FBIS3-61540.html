Using these and other results of joint work,  we intend in the immediate future to broaden the themes and to  increase the effectiveness of the installments of ``Our  Exchange.''    In recent years the steady tendency for associates to leave  scientific research organizations (NTOs) has emerged. Young  people, maintenance personnel, scientific workers of high  skills, and middle-level specialists are leaving. Official  statistics do not make it possible to establish promptly the  scale, directions, and structure of this phenomenon. The work  performed by the Istina Center to the order of the department of  social problems of science of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Science and Technical Policy will make it possible to clarify  the situation. During it 42 scientific and technical  organizations of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Moscow Oblast with  a total of about 16,000 workers were examined. Academic,  sectorial, and plant science, which both is and is not (four  organizations) state property, is represented at them. The  number of personnel at the NTO ranged from 60 to 3,600.    The survey was conducted in two stages. At the first stage  the overall change of the number of personnel during January-May  1993, the sex, age, position, and skills of the scientists and  specialists, who quit during this period, were determined  through the personnel departments of the NTOs. At the second  stage of the survey in a telephone survey of these workers the  directions of the departure of personnel from science  (emigration, a change of the type of activity, transfer to the  private sector of the economy, and so forth) were ascertained.  The data of this survey, which were obtained from more than 400  people, made it possible to gain original statistical material  that is making it possible to analyze thoroughly the problem of  the migration of scientific personnel on the basis of real  factual data, and not various kinds of hypotheses.    It turned out that during the first five months of this year  the number of personnel at the surveyed NTOs decreased by 7.2  percent. What does this mean? According to the data of the  Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics, the annual  decrease of the number of employees at NTOs came in 1990 to 12  percent and in 1991 to 16 percent. So far there are no official  data for 1992, but the forecasting figure was specified at the  level of 20-30 percent. Our survey confirmed the fact that the  trend toward the decrease of the number of employees in science  also remains during the current year, 1993, although its pace  has become somewhat less.    The results of the analysis of the reasons, for which  associates quit NTOs, are interesting. Of those surveyed 86  percent did this at their own request or in connection with  being transferred to another job (that is, again at their own  request). For Moscow this indicator came to nearly 91 percent.  Thus, the departure of personnel from NTOs for the present is  not connected with organized reductions. Incidentally, last  year, in 1992, when at Russian scientific research institutes  and design bureaus two or three reductions of personnel were  carried out, they were responsible for only 25 percent of the  departure of personnel from science.    The analysis of the problem of who is leaving NTOs provides  even more food for thought. For this purpose the personal data  of 675 scientists and specialists who had quit were studied. The  results were somewhat unexpected. Approximately an identical  number of men and women quit. However, if you consider that the  share of women in science comes to more than 55 percent, it is  possible to conclude that men "are being flushed" from NTOs more  intensively. Nearly half of those who quit held earlier the  positions of engineers, designers, and so forth, about 30  percent held junior scientific positions from trainee to  scientific associate. The number of people who quit after the  age of 40 exceeds slightly the number of people who quit not  having reached this age. Here, however, it is necessary to take  into account that the share of the younger age groups at NTOs at  present is small, therefore, a high intensity of the "flushing"  of young people from science still lies behind the smaller  absolute figure.    Of the 675 people who quit during the first five months of  this year 18 went abroad (to live or to work under contract for  a period of more than one year). All of them are workers of  well-known academic scientific research institutes. Thus, not  external, but internal migration, that is, the transfer of  scientists to other sectors and spheres of the national economy,  is playing a far greater role in the dynamics of scientific  personnel.    From the telephone survey of those who had quit it became  clear that 85-90 percent of them already had an understanding on  a new job. In those cases, when a person left "for nowhere," it  was quite difficult for him to find a job (the chance of getting  a job came to one in five). Only 40 percent of the respondents  again went to work in state structures, 52 percent left for  private organizations, cooperatives, and joint-stock companies,  6 percent left for joint ventures, about 0.5 percent left for  foreign firms, and a little more than 1 percent engaged in  individual labor activity. Among the people who left for state  enterprises the share of women, people 40 to 60 years old, and  those people, who earlier held the positions of senior  scientific associates and higher, is large. Primarily men,  people up to the age of 40, as well as people who held junior  scientific positions and positions of specialists, are getting  jobs at organizations of the alternative sector of the economy.  Seventy five percent of the doctors of sciences and 56 percent  of the candidates of sciences, who quit scientific research  institutes, also transferred to a job at nonstate organizations.  Representatives of the physical mathematical and technical  sciences, as well as the people, who engaged earlier in  scientific and technical development and services and in  introduction, prefer them.    Responding to the question of the type of basic activity of  the organization, to which they transferred, 23 percent of the  telephone respondents named research and development, 22 percent  named scientific and technical services and introduction, 25  percent named the making of a product, 19 percent named  intermediary activity, 8 percent named commercial and purchasing  activity, and 15 percent named services and consulting. The  total of the above-cited percentages does not equal 100,  inasmuch as the same respondent could indicate several  directions of activity of the organization.    The survey also showed that for the most part women and  people over the age of 40 are remaining in science or ``near  it.'' Young people up to the age of 30 are leaving mainly for  the sphere of intermediary activity. Comparatively many  candidates and doctors of sciences, as well as people, who held  earlier scientific positions from senior scientific associate  and higher, are transferring to organizations of the scientific  and technical type.    In order to supplement and at the same time to verify the  responses to the preceding question, the respondents were asked  to assign their new place of work to one of the sectors of the  national economy. Twenty six percent of the respondents named  the sector ``Science and Scientific Service,'' 30 percent named  ``Industry,'' 18 percent named ``Trade, Public Dining,  Procurement, and Marketing,'' 6 percent named ``Finance, Credit,  and Insurance,'' and 0.6 percent named ``Education.''Among young  people 19 percent went to work again at NTOs, 21 percent left  for industry, 28 percent left for trade, and 9 percent left for  the sphere of finance. Among those who had quit 37 percent of  the candidates and doctors of sciences, 33 percent of those  people who had held scientific positions, and only 11 percent of  the engineers, economists, and other representatives of  nonscientific specialties, who worked at NTOs, remained in  science.    For physicists and mathematicians science, education, and  finance proved to be most appealing. Representatives of the  technical sciences and chemists transferred mainly to industry.  About 25 percent of the economics scholars remained in science,  22 percent of the latter left for trade and 19 percent left for  financial organizations. Of the surveyed representatives of the  humanities 41 percent began to work again at NTOs, 18 percent  left for a teaching job, and 18 percent left for administrative  bodies. As a whole the obtained data testified that 55 percent  of those who left NTOs had changed drastically the sphere of  their activity. This is especially typical of young people.    In what did those who quit NTOs engage at their new place of  work? Twenty six percent of the respondents replied that they  engaged in research and development, 28 percent--in scientific  research services and introduction, 18 percent--in  entrepreneurial activity, 22 percent--in administration, and 11  percent--in physical labor. It would be interesting to learn  precisely who of the former workers of science began to engage  in enterprise? For the most part these are men (there are  threefold more of them than women), people up to the age of 30  (33 percent) and from 30 to 40 years old (29 percent). In this  group there are practically no scientists and specialists over  the age of 40. It also turned out that among the new  entrepreneurs there are many people, who had held at NTOs  positions that were not connected with research activity, and,  however strange this is, scientists who had worked on basic  problems. And another somewhat paradoxical result that was  obtained during our survey is that mainly those people who are  over 50 had begun to engage in physical labor.    It is no secret that one of the basic reasons for the  departure of personnel from science is the low level of the  remuneration of labor in this sector. About 92 percent of the  scientific workers and specialists of NTOs consider their income  at their main place of work to be lower than average. At the new  place they, it seems, are finding what they sought. Nearly 33  percent of the associates, who left NTOs this year, are  satisfied with the present remuneration, 34 percent--``more yes  than no,'' 18 percent--``more no than yes,'' 8 percent are not  satisfied, and 7 percent found it hard to answer this question.  Thus, 67 percent of the respondents rated favorably their new  wage.    The degree of satisfaction with the content of the new job  is  also high--for nearly 71 percent of the respondents. The highest  level of dissatisfaction is observed among the people who  engaged earlier in basic research.    And, finally, the last question that was addressed to the  respondents during our survey: ``To what degree is your new job  connected with the previous one?'' The responses are broken down  as follows. Ten percent of the respondents replied "It is a  direct continuation," 28 percent believe ``It is connected,''  for the remaining 62 percent of the scientists and specialists  the previous and present jobs are not connected in any way.  Among young people this indicator is even higher--nearly 74  percent. Those people, who engaged earlier in basic research and  the humanities, proved to be most devoted to their old jobs.    What tentative conclusions is it possible to draw from the  results of the conducted survey? First, the tendency for the  number of employees in science to decrease remains. Second, the  overwhelming majority of associates of NTOs are quitting because  they are finding a more appealing (based mainly on material  criteria) place of work, and not due to reductions of personnel,  which have been organized ``from above.''    Another important conclusion is that only 40 percent of the  scientists and specialists of NTOs, who quit, go to work at  state structures. About 45 percent of the respondents are now  working again at NTOs or at organizations that are connected  with science and technology. It is very important that the  satisfaction with the wage and the nature of the work at the new  place is nearly ninefold higher than on the average among  workers of the sector ``Science and Scientific Service.''    Scientists and specialists up to the age of 40, that is, the  most promising and able-bodied group, are transferring most  actively to other sectors of the national economy and are  beginning to engage in new types of labor activity. And this  latter fact is, perhaps, the most unpleasant and alarming  conclusion among those that were obtained during the conducted  survey.</p>

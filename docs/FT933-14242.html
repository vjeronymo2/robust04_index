			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Arts: Onegin proves a musical masterpiece - Opera The Royal Opera's new Tchaikovsky production affords, in purely musical terms, one of the most distinguished performances to be mounted in the house in many a season. When given by ragbag assortments of singers from here, there and everywhere, parrotting the so-called original language while surtitles flash away above their heads, International Opera can be a dismal, unworthy business. When given as here - by a carefully chosen cast of principals uttering a language either native to them or communicatively 'lived', and a conductor intuitively alert to every strand of musical drama  -it can seem the noblest of artistic pursuits, worth battling for even in the hardest of hard times. This is an Onegin musically structured to make fully-weighted sense of the work in a theatre that is, strictly speaking, several sizes too large. (Tchaikovsky had the work first performed by students at the Moscow Conservatory.) The bigger the house, the greater the danger of coarsening and blunting the delicate detail of this most intimately affecting of operatic tragedies. (Tchaikovsky purposely underlined its divergences from the forms and manners of Grand Opera by subtitling the work 'Lyric Scenes'.) The conductor of the new production is Valery Gergiev, fiery young chief of the Kirov Opera. He is making his Covent Garden debut, and perhaps has still to find his ease there: on Tuesday the early scenes betrayed passing imbalances in the choral ensemble. In essence, however, Gergiev's Onegin is already one of the most impassioned, vivid and spontaneously emotional we have heard: it is properly scaled for Covent Garden yet not overbearing, grand with no loss of orchestral and vocal immediacy. The sound is always beautiful, animated (as it were) from within, shaped along the dramatic lines with a keenness of perception that marries instinct and iron command. Gergiev takes chances. The domestic, countryfied atmosphere of the opening scene, with daughters duetting in the distance and mistress and maid reminiscing in the foreground, is risked by the slow tempo; likewise M. Triquet's birthday song, and the moment of relief it provides amid the gathering tensions of the Larin ball. Accentuation of dance-rhythms is not at all metrically mechanical; indeed, the conductor's rubato elasticities may surprise the unwary. But even while I wondered at or where I questioned the interpretative ideas, I felt the opera's dramatic vitality surging out into the theatre. This is opera-conducting of rare quality. Sergey Leiferkus (Onegin), Galina Gorchakova (Tatyana) and the Armenian Gegam Grigorian (Lensky) are members or associates of Gergiev's Kirov ensemble. The sense of singers supported from the pit, not merely accompanied, is another of the performance's special virtues. The baritone, a house favourite, is at his peak of eloquent, fine-grained artistry. Every inflection tells. A non-Russian speaker gains the illusion of understanding every word as it leaves his lips. He never loses the air of breeding that is Onegin's distinguishing mark; even in disintegration he avoids melodramatic overstatement. The soprano, who burst upon London audiences with tidal-wave force in The Fiery Angel, at the Proms and at Covent Garden, is possibly the most opulent, lustrously full-toned Tatyana in living memory: again, truly Covent Garden-sized without being oversized. She does not always shape the lines or make them perfectly smooth; though physically plausible, she is a sympathetic rather than an original, inventive actress. What she offers is a restrained, ravishing account of the role, and in context wonderfully appropriate. Grigorian, a small, rotund Lensky with a vibrant, technically free tenor and a heart-breaking openness of emotional expression, is all feeling - the over-abundance of happiness in the Act 1 aria, beautifully caught in the timbre and phrasing (and sustained in the conducting), sends out subtle, alarming warning signals. It is satisfying to see and hear Louise Winter (a delightfully spirited Olga), Sarah Walker (Filipyevna) and Gillian Knight (Mme Larin) keeping pace with such idiomatic artistry; and as Gremin it is peculiarly moving to see and hear again Nicolai Ghiaurov, no longer a basso cantante in full flood but a 63-year-old veteran wise, colourful and full of tender vocal touches. A triumphant Royal Opera Onegin all round? No: the production - by John Cox in Timothy O'Brien's designs - is plain to the eye, cautiously tactful, blandly second-rate. No big mistakes are made (which, when one considers how easy it is to go wrong in this opera - cf. Howard Davies's recent, mistake-riddled Onegin staging for Welsh National - is a merciful relief). Nothing gets in the way of the music. For many ROH patrons this may be sufficient. With this conductor and cast, it deserves to be. But the replacement of the old Julia Trevelyan Oman sets and costumes seems unjustified. Royal Opera House: in repertory until July 24; production sponsored by The Drogheda Circle.</p>

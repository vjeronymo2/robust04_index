			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: A painful account to be heeded Sir, Taking another look at Lady Doris Stenton's account of English Society in the Early Middle Ages I was intrigued to find that Henry I, under the impression that people were becoming 'careless' about coinage, had summoned his moneyers to Winchester around Christmas in 1125. There, they were each deprived of their right hand and emasculated. The historian notes this 'dour business'  - recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  - was completed by Twelfth Night. Financial officers and public servants, elected or otherwise, breathe much easier these days; but, as we approach the same season, contemplation of that cautionary punishment may well create a frisson in some notable nooks and corners of the City or Westminster  - more obviously in the light of recent past events.

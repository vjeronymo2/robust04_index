			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Arts: A Pounds 1.5m boost for West End theatre The West End theatre will receive a shot in the arm where it matters most today, in the balance sheet. It will announce a deal with a group of companies who are collectively investing Pounds 1.5m in the London theatre over the next three years. The agreement has been put together by the Society of London Theatre, which represents the leading producers and theatre owners. Seagram, Radisson Edwardian Hotels, and Grolsch are the contributors to date, and other companies are expected to add to the kitty soon. It could rise to Pounds 3m. The money wll be spent on promoting West End theatre, and bursaries for young actors and would-be producers. Some of the extra cash will go to the Theatre Investment Fund, which supports plays put on by new producers. But the main impact of the sponsorship will be the West End Proms when, for a month, perhaps next September, 150,000 tickets will be offered at substantial discounts. The aim is to attract under-25s to the theatre. For Seagram and Grolsch there will be promotional spin offs but also the practical gain of having their brands on exclusive sale in around 70 per cent of West End theatres. Radisson Edwardian becomes the society's official hotel partner. This is the first big sponsorship deal gained by the society and comes at a time when the West End is holding its own fairly well. Ticket sales this year are on a par with 1993, which set a record.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Pre-tax profits ease at Daiwa DAIWA HOUSE Industry, a leading builder of steel-framed homes, said sales for the year to March rose 5 per cent to Y926m (Dollars 8.3m), in tandem with a rise in housing starts, in spite of waning land prices, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. But the Osaka-based company said pre-tax profits eased 3.8 per cent for the first time in 13 years. Declining interest rates led to a fall of more than Y9bn in financial revenue.</p>

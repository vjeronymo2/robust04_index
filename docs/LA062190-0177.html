			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> CAFE VALLARTA;  </P> <P> MEXICAN TWIST;  </P> <P> A NEW MENU AND A BOUILLABAISSE COUP RAISE THE SANTA BARBARA EATERY ABOVE THE  CROWD.  </P> <P> Early on a summer evening, Cafe Vallarta is a vision. The sun's waning rays  light up the place, slanting through the small front dining room before  reaching the high, four-seat tapas bar where (if you're lucky) they glisten off  your dish of ceviche and the bottle of cold Bohemia beer standing next to it.  </P> <P> Of course, if the weather's cloudy or the sun's already down, you'll have to  close your eyes and concentrate on the food alone. But that's not a bad option.  Handsome as the place is, food is what it's really about, as Santa Barbara has  been discovering.  </P> <P> A year ago, Justo Garcia's restaurant was just one of the crowd of Mexican  eateries on Haley Street. Then Garcia and his newly acquired partner, Liliana  Parr, worked out a new "classical Mexican and Yucatan cuisine" menu, quite  different from Haley Street's usual taco/enchilada repertoire. But that wasn't  all that happened.  </P> <P> About the same time, Garcia created a small stir in Santa Barbara food circles.  It seems that he showed up at the Santa Barbara Bouillabaisse Festival in the  Santa Ynez Valley and, without a recipe, pretty much flying by the seat of his  pants, beat out several of the area's most prominent chefs for first prize. The  bouillabaisse publicity, together with the menu changes, lifted Cafe Vallarta  well above the rest of Haley Street.  </P> <P> The new menu includes such things as a calamari-stuffed chile relleno, which  uses a pasilla chile in place of the more ordinary Anaheim variety. It's been  roasted gently and then, without ever being breaded, stuffed with a rich  mixture of calamari, red pepper and onions in a cream sauce made with jack  cheese.  </P> <P> Then there's Garcia's pollo almendrado, a Mexican dish for those not in a mood  for spicy food. The chunks of chicken in their sauce of almonds, lime juice,  tomatoes, garlic and mushrooms have character enough without chiles.  </P> <P> Garcia's usual side dishes, the poblano rice and black beans, are distinctive  for the firmness of the beans and the seasoning in the rice, which turns out to  be mostly cilantro and a touch of Anaheim chile. Accompanying everything are  fresh corn tortillas, handmade on the premises.  </P> <P> The ceviche sitting next to the beer on the tapas bar is marinating in quite a  spicy chile sauce and, in this case, is made with octopus. As we know, ceviche  is raw fish "cooked" in lemon or lime juice; here, the octopus has actually  been cooked in the conventional way as well, and it's tender, rather than  rubbery -- a dish to convert octopus-haters.  </P> <P> The tapas bar snacks -- many of which can be ordered as main dishes -- are  nearly all worth trying. Personally, I can never resist a dish that bills  itself as "cooked in banana leaves," such as the cochinita pibil. It apparently  loses its banana leaves by the time it gets to you, but the pork is delicious  in its colorful Yucatecan achiote sauce.  </P> <P> I found the cochinita pibil worth ordering the next time as a main dish. On the  other hand, the Culiacan-style prawns, stuffed with herbs and cheese and  wrapped in bacon, are best in the small tapas quantity. In the main dish size,  I'm afraid, they're overwhelmed by the bacon.  </P> <P> At least they're good in small quantities. I'd avoid altogether what our blond,  cornrowed waiter described as an absolutely marvelous persimmon cheesecake. It  turned out to be absolutely frozen. Garcia claims that that's the way much of  his clientele likes it, but I'd rather buy my frozen desserts at 7-Eleven.  </P> <P> Oh, you may be wondering about the famed bouillabaisse. On the menu, it's  listed as caldo de mariscos, and it turns out to be a rich seafood stew with  shrimp, fish, octopus, mussels and vegetables. The sauce is made with a  fish-bone stock, with seasonings, including saffron and cilantro, spices that  seem to be more or less a Cajun mixture . . . and lots of garlic. I wasn't at  the bouillabaisse contest, but I wouldn't be surprised if the garlic made it  the winner. It's powerful.  </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN: Cafe Vallarta, 626 E.

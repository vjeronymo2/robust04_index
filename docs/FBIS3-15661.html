			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk from the "World Last Week" program] </F>   [Excerpts] The Zionists committed a crime in Hebron in the  occupied territories early last Friday. The criminal action  recalled the Dayr Yasin and Kafr Qasim incidents. They  massacred dozens of Palestinians who prayed in a mosque. The  incident caused clashes between the Palestinians and the  Zionists throughout the occupied territories. The massacre of  Palestinians praying in a mosque in Hebron last week caused a  wave of mourning in the Islamic world and infuriated the  international community. Some 70 Palestinians were killed and  dozens of others were wounded. In an effort to prove that  Israel's military forces were not linked with the incident, the  Zionist regime described the assailant as mad. But the  indications are that the Israeli military forces had a part in  realizing the tragic incident. The Hebron incident has exposed  the true nature of the Zionist regime and the international  community has witnessed that the innocent Palestinian people  have again become the victim of a criminal Zionist action.  [passage omitted]    The multisided U.S. support for the occupying Zionist regime  is an important factor contributing to the inhuman Zionist  activities. The U.S. move to obstruct and veto the UN Security  Council resolutions against Israel is an indication of the  support that that country gives to Israel. Consequently, the  two-faced policy maintained by the UN Security Council has  created important opportunities for the Zionist regime and  allowed it to commit crimes against the Palestinian people. An  example is the stance the United States adopted after Hebron.  The U.S. approach prevented the UN Security Council from  adopting a resolution on the incident. Considering that, the  international community must express its indignation over the  issue.    The Hebron incident has shown that the sacred Palestinian  uprising must be strengthened. It has also revealed that the  Palestinians can safeguard their right to live on their own  homeland only through an armed struggle.</p>

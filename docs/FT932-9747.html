			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Apple moves towards 'open' software APPLE Computer is developing technology to enable applications programs designed for its Macintosh personal computers to run, without modification, on Unix workstations from Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines. The move represents a reversal of Apple's long-standing strategy of protecting its competitive advantage by ensuring Macintosh software would run only on its own computers. Its switch to an 'open' software strategy heralds a mounting challenge to the market dominance of Microsoft and Intel, the leading suppliers of software and microprocessors for personal computers. Apple also revealed that it had a project under way, called Amber, that will make it easier to create application programs, such as word processors and spreadsheets, that run both on Apple's Macintosh and on PCs using Windows, the Microsoft operating system. Apple said that it would form a non-profit association to share Amber technology with other computermakers. Last week, Sun Microsystems, the leading workstation manufacturer, also said it was developing technology that would enable Windows programs to run on Unix workstations. Both Sun and Apple are trying to loosen Microsoft's grip on the software market. The battle over standards is expected to lead to intense price competition as manufacturers seek new ways to differentiate their products. For computer users, the industry battle is expected to accelerate the trend toward 'open systems' that enable different types and brands of computers to share software and data more easily. Increasingly, computer buyers want to be able to run the same software on different types of computers to minimise training and management. 'The customer is in the driving seat today,' said Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive. Apple's 'extraordinary move' is 'precisely what customers want,' said Mr Roel Pieper, president of Unix Systems Laboratories, the former AT&amp;T unit responsible for Unix development and licensing.</p>

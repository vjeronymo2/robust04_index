			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Anglo American to shed 12,500 jobs ANGLO American, South Africa's largest mining house and the world's largest gold producer, yesterday announced that 12,500 jobs would be lost at its mines as a result of the depressed state of the industry. Freegold, the world's largest mine, is to cut its 100,000 labour complement by 8,000 and Vaal Reefs will cut 4,500 jobs from a current total of 49,600. Last year Freegold announced 7,800 job losses. The rationalisation at both mines stems from the need to curtail uneconomic activities. Neither mines expect gold production levels to be affected as they will be focusing on higher grades in the balance of their operations. Announcing the March quarterly gold mining results, Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division, said: 'We had to take some very tough decisions . . . We hope that by so doing we will enable the division to weather whatever further hard times face us.' Mr Lionel Hewitt, executive director, described Freegold's performance, which saw after-tax profit rise from R102.9m to R134.6m (Dollars 49.5m), as 'extremely pleasing'. Explaining the rationalisation, however, he noted that the mine had posted a 52 per cent decrease, from R346m to R167.4m, in available profit in the year to March. He also pointed out that the north section of the mine had made a R10m loss in the quarter, after capital expenditure. Vaal Reefs suffered the effects of a slow recovery from the Christmas period to record lower gold production. Combined with higher costs, this saw profits from gold fall by 29.5 per cent to R124.4m. Mr Hewitt said unexpectedly good grades in the south of the Western Deep Levels mine saw gold production rise 2.6 per cent in the quarter. A R9.5m jump in tax, however, left after-tax profits lower at R83.1m, against R89.4m. Revitalising the gold industry, Page 34</p>

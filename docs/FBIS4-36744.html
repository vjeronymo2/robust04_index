			<p>BFN     [Text] Irfan Ljubijankic, Minister of Foreign Affairs of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, arrived in Tehran this morning at the head  of a delegation and was welcomed by Foreign Affairs Minister  Velayati.    During the Bosnian-Herzegovinan foreign minister's visit to  Tehran, apart from talks on bilateral relations and the latest  developments in that country, the agreements reached between the  two countries during the visit to Tehran by the prime minister  of Bosnia-Herzegovina will also be discussed.    On arrival in Tehran, the Bosnian-Herzegovinan foreign  minister said: We are seeking appropriate grounds to establish  peace, but as the main causes of the war in Bosnia are still  there, the achievement of peace seems difficult.    On the Bosnian Government's views on the UN Security  Council's disagreement with the dispatch of peace-keeping forces  from Islamic countries to Bosnia he said: The Government of  Bosnia continues its efforts to win the agreement of that  organization [UN] for the dispatch of forces from Islamic  countries, particularly from the Islamic Republic of Iran.    The Bosnian foreign minister said that among the reasons for  the Western countries' contradictory handling of the Bosnian  problem are their national interests and strategic  considerations.</p>

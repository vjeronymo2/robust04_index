			<p>BFN     [Text] Former U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin says the  U.S. Administration understands that an Israeli-Syrian peace  settlement would require extensive resources, which it is  willing to commit. He was speaking during a lecture at the  Davies Institute of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.    Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who also spoke at the  gathering, cited an article from the London-based paper  AL-HAYAH, which is considered a reliable source on Syria. The  newspaper's editor wrote that peace talks between Israel and  Syria are not frozen. He recalled that former U.S. Secretary of  State Henry Kissinger shuttled between Jerusalem and Damascus 41  times to help arrange the separation of forces agreement after  the Yom Kippur War. Israel and Syria have shared outlooks,  Beilin said: a desire for a peace agreement; recognition of the  need for withdrawal and U.S. involvement in the process.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Checks urged on diesel engines CARS and trucks are the main source of smoke pollution, the National Society for Clean Air says in a report published today. It expects the position to worsen. The society says smoking diesel engines and lack of official control are mainly to blame. Its report says police and environmental health officers should be empowered to make regular checks on smoking vehicles. In spite of tougher environmental standards for new cars, there is no effective system for curbing smoking lorries and cars once they are on the road, the society says.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: When cleanliness is next to godliness - Nick Garnett meets the Reverend David Jones, a man stuck on the bathroom business ON A typical day last month, the Reverend David Jones celebrated communion at St Mary's Church, in the north London district of Primrose Hill. He then climbed out of his eucharistic vestments and climbed into his Vauxhall Senator (up to six months ago it was a BMW coupe). Destination? One of the three shops Jones owns in and around the capital that offer basins and lavatories as well as complete bathrooms designs with hand-painted wood. 'I trained in a monastery for five years and was ordained in 1970 as an Anglican priest,' Jones says. 'I subsequently resigned from that but was relicensed as an Anglican priest in the middle of last year.' In between, Jones worked in the bathroom supply business, eventually setting up his own company in 1983, selling it to Smallbone, an upmarket supplier, and buying into and then getting out of bathroomware makers Sanitan. He set up Colourwash with two partners in 1990 and the company now has bathroom shops: in Fulham, north London and Sunningdale. 'What a disastrous time to do anything like this,' Jones says. Colourwash shows you can start up a retail business without much capital and extract a salary even in difficult times. The three partners - Jones, Jane Gilchriest, a former commercial cook, and Teeny Hickman, a sculptor - last year earned a total of Pounds 80,000 from the business. You also need nerve. Until August last year, Colourwash made losses; it has racked up a net deficit of Pounds 35,000 since starting up. The company is now in profit, but at only a margin of 5 per cent on turnover - Pounds 700,000 last year. The business was set up with one shop, the partners each contributing Pounds 20,000, the two women raising that against their houses. The Trustee Savings Bank came up with a secured loan of Pounds 40,000. Jones injected another Pounds 40,000 on his own to open the Sunningdale shop, and the north London shop and warehouse absorbed another Pounds 15,000, with Pounds 25,000 needed for working capital. All the premises are rented. Colourwash is the kind of company which offers only white bathroomware (there is no avocado in sight) and would not touch a bath made of plastic if it was the last material on earth. 'En suite' would be regarded as a dirty phrase. A lot of folk in Sunningdale like a limed oak finish on the bathroom wood in their South Fork spreads, but Jones blanches at this. The company sells itself partly on its ability to colour-match complete bathrooms. It supplies wallpaper, tiles and the wooden furniture. A lot of the wood finishes are of the fashionable, washed-out, 'kicked around and rolled downstairs' look, as Jones likes to call it. Colourwash mainly uses a traditional furniture maker in Somerset. A lot of the sanitaryware Colourwash sells comes from continental Europe: Pozziginori and Sbordoni of Italy, or Duravit and Villeroy &amp; Boch, rather than the UK's Armitage Shanks, Twyford or Shires. 'At the beginning of the 1980s, when traditional designs started coming in, all UK makers pooh-poohed it. Now they are all on the bandwagon, but years after the event,' says 47-year-old Jones. 'They have vacated the high value ground to foreign imports. This has allowed the Germans to come in with their taps, shower doors and valves with good engineered quality and reliability. You've got companies like Roca of Spain just waiting to come in, and Jacob Delafon making a surge into the market.' Colourwash has high regard for, and sells bathroomware from, some UK makers such as Ideal Standard, Sanitan and Tutbury, the latter recently bought by Spring Ram, the equipment maker, as a separate upmarket arm. Jones says the pricing policies of most British makers work against small retailers. 'People like myself running specialist bathroom shops have been badly served by UK manufacturers. We have to find products with margins not eroded by large building merchants which sell a lot of British-made items. We have to look abroad. You can't live with margins of less than 30 per cent.' The point was underlined, Jones argues, when Spring Ram cut retailers' margins on Tutbury bathroomware once it had bought that business, but he has a lot of confidence in Spring Ram. Colourwash, which sells baths for as low as Pounds 100 but will do complete bathrooms (one house is installing Pounds 28,000 of equipment supplied by the company) can enjoy positive cash flow even in a desperate market. 'We can get positive cash flow if we can turn over equipment within eight weeks.' Jones argues that the company has negotiated its way through the back end of a recession by being 'mean'. There are no company cars, and management accounts are done month on month every 10 days - these accounts include 33 entries split shop by shop. 'On every sale we make we analyse margins.' Some of this approach has rubbed off from the practices of the mini-conglomerate, Williams, which bought Smallbone and, indirectly, employed Jones. 'The ethos is: 'on time, on budget, and no surprises.'' Recession has squeezed margins on many bathroom products by 10 to 15 percentage points. To help offset this, Jones tries to take advantage of de-stocking offers by equipment suppliers and is importing some bathroomware direct. In this way he can absorb the distributors' margins - usually 25 per cent - as well as the retailer's. 'The problem is scale. We don't have much clout in the market.' Colourwash did Pounds 250,000 of business in the first three months of this year. 'I think the prognosis is extremely good. We are more than holding our own now. Companies selling ordinary stuff with no exclusivity must still be bleeding to death.' Small businesses like Colourwash need to raise sales to about Pounds 2m, Jones believes. 'At that level, with one to three shops tightly managed and a reasonable market, you are going to be very profitable.' Colourwash, 1 Broomhall Buildings, London Road, Sunningdale, Berkshire SL5 0DH.

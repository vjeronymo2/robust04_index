			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: EC warned not to cut tariff on chips THE EUROPEAN semiconductor industry would be unlikely to survive if it dismantled its 14 per cent tariff on chip imports, a report by the industry market research group Dataquest says. The EC is being pressed by the US and Japan to dismantle the tariff. It is the only main industrial region that has kept tariffs on semiconductors. The US, Canada and Japan suspended theirs in 1985. The EC Commission has offered to cut the 14 per cent tariff on imports of integrated circuits by a third, to 9 per cent, in exchange for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers. Such a cut could sharply reduce competitiveness of the European industry and is unlikely to lead to lower prices. The declining trend in European manufacturers' own share of their market and low market prices of many chips in Europe have created a situation where dismantling the tariff overnight 'is likely to spell the death of the European semiconductor industry,' Mr Byron Harding, industry analyst at Dataquest, asserts. The EC, the US and Japan are discussing the issue in Gatt's Uruguay Round. Calls have come from within the US to reinstate the suspended 14 per cent tariff on chip imports if Europe fails to cut its tariff. EC chip users have been urging a cut in the tariff, which, they say, damages their competitiveness. The study indicates that despite the EC tariff on imports, prices of certain chips in Europe have been as low as, or at times lower, than prices in other main markets. This is because foreign makers are ready to sacrifice profit to revenue, to boost European market penetration, Mr Harding believes. * EC Semiconductor Tariffs and Related Issues.

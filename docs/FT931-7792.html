			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Hong Kong inflation tops 10 per cent The annual rate of consumer price inflation edged above 10 per cent in Hong Kong last month, the first time in almost a year, Simon Holberton writes. But the Hong Kong government sought to play down January's rise, at an annual rate of 10.1 per cent, in the CPI(A), the broadest measure of the colony's price movements. It attributed the rise to seasonal factors, notably the timing of this year's Lunar New Year holiday, at the end of the month. Hong Kong has suffered a chronic inflation problem for the past few years which is mainly attributable, economists and government officials say, to the structural changes taking place in the colony's economy. In yesterday's inflation data, the Census and Statistics Department said prices for housing were rising at an annual rate of 15.5 per cent in January and services prices were up 12.4 per cent. Alcoholic drinks and tobacco prices rose 14.2 per cent in January compared with a year ago. Rising prices for services are underpinning wage demands. Per capita earnings rose last year by over 15 per cent.</p>

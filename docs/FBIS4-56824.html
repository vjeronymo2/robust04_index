			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ricardo Alvarado N.] </F>   [Text] No one doubts that industrialization may be the only  option for achieving economic development; we cannot pin all our  hopes on the primary sector (agriculture, livestock, etc.).  There is no question that if we want to achieve a higher  standard of living, we must build a sufficiently vigorous and  original industrial network to take advantage of the country's  natural advantages, and consequently, to contribute effectively  to the growth of the gross domestic product [GDP].    Thus, it is antitechnical and even counterproductive to  expect that exporting a few nontraditional agricultural products  or enthusiastically supporting the assembly line industry  [maquiladora], especially if there is no accompanying transfer  of technology, is the way to assume responsibility for integral  development, a responsibility that we as a nation must assume  for the benefit of present and future generations. The assembly  line industry and feeble primary-sector exports are mere  bandaids that temporarily and partially alleviate the crippling  problems of hunger and unemployment.    A multitude of diagnoses show that the industrial sector in  Nicaragua is going through a crisis, moving ever closer to  extinction. Its share of the GDP has fallen from 31.8 percent in  1978 to 17 percent in 1993, and its annual per-capita GDP income  is now three times smaller than it was. And regardless of the  many different controversies that may arise concerning the  positive or negative aspects of the historic Common Market and  the catalytic cotton parameter [as published], the fact is that  in those years Nicaragua's industrialization process was  experiencing tremendous growth; and in spite of the "import  substitution," which has such a bad reputation among certain  economists today, the existing industrial system provided a  solid foundation of support for the country's economic  development.    To be sure, adjustment policies have a direct and indirect  impact on whether an industrialization process moves forward or  backward. Yet it is clear to everyone that poor countries such  as Nicaragua are meeting with mathematical precision all kinds  of requirements with respect to eliminating subsidies and  throwing the doors wide open to outsiders, knowing that no rich,  developed country would destroy itself with the same  restrictions. Quite the contrary, in those countries  protectionism, tariffs, and technical regulations zealously  guard the safety of the productive apparatus.    There are examples galore, and the adjustment program was  not  born yesterday, even in Nicaragua. Overcoming the adjustment  successfully depends on the capacity, leadership, and creativity  that the government must display to be a reformer without being  an exterminator. It is not a question, therefore, of repeating  the well-worn excuse that the government, in keeping with its  neoliberal facade, should not intervene. Of course it has to  intervene, and it should intervene, but as a genuine  facilitator, promoter, and leader, not as a caudillo.  The policies of the World Bank and the IMF may be inflexible,  some might say brutal, but the government should not blame its  "limitations" on external conditions. Rather, it should be  sufficiently capable and intelligent to respond efficiently to  its role as an active guiding force rather than a passive  observer. Examples abound: In Chile, the "Chicago Boys" promoted  the free market, but substitute "production" for the Chilean  state's service capacity. And in Mexico, as Dr. Salinas himself  has pointed out, "the decisions are made by the people, not the  bureaucrats." In that country, local councils, invoking the  participation of civil society, decide how the resources derived  from privatization will be used.    In those countries, even though the governments are pursuing  neoliberal policies, adjustment policies, or whatever, they are  sensitive and astute enough to get the most out of the reforms  to benefit their people.    In Nicaragua, a greater effort should be made to take on a  creative role under the authority of a healthy leadership that  exudes confidence. In the specific case of industry, the  government must subsidize and protect, with finesse and cunning,  but without severely disrupting the adjustment process. There  are so many forms of subsidies that can allow our industry,  especially small-scale industry, to recover gradually. It is  unfair to expect the productive sector to pull itself up by its  bootstraps. The government must compromise and accept that it  "did not determine what, how, or how much to produce," it is  philosophy, and only philosophy.    At first, the government must reach a consensus with  industry  leaders and agree on all pertinent measures to revive the sector  and enable it to compete on an equal footing. Chile, Japan,  Italy, and other countries did not necessarily build their  industries by leaving them to their own devices.    Thus, the inflexibility of the World Bank or the IMF and the  adjustment are not the sole, evil cause of our industrial  depression, and the overall slump in production. The secret  lies, simply, in knowing how to function as a real government, a  creative and steadfast promoter and facilitator. A leader, not a  caudillo. And apparently, there is still time to mend  its ways.</p>

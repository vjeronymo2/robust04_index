			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Nissan case jury 'misled' The jury in the Nissan UK corporation tax fraud trial was misled over the guilty plea entered by Mr Frank Shannon, the company's former finance director, the Court of Appeal was told yesterday. The claim was made by Mr Alun Jones QC, appearing for Mr Michael Hunt, the managing director of the former car importer, who was jailed for eight years last July after being convicted of a Pounds 55m tax fraud against the Inland Revenue. Mr Hunt is appealing against both his conviction and the length of his sentence. Mr Jones said the offence Mr Shannon admitted to - one of cheating the Revenue - should be declared null and void because the particulars of what he admitted did not amount to cheating the Revenue. Mr Shannon made the confession only as the result of a bargain with the Revenue in which he agreed to settle his outstanding tax liabilities and plead guilty to the one offence, he said. The jury hearing the case against Mr Hunt was told, however, that Mr Shannon had pleaded guilty to a similar charge to one of those brought against Mr Hunt. Mr Jones said: 'The jury have simply been misled about what the plea of guilty is.' Mr Hunt's conviction should therefore be overturned. The hearing is expected to last five days.</p>

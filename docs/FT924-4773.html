			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Lloyd's losses in US 'could reach Pounds 4.9bn' LLOYD'S losses from pollution and industrial diseases in the US could amount to Pounds 4.9bn, according to estimates by Chatset, the company that analyses the insurance market's results. Names, the individuals whose capital supports Lloyd's, could face heavy annual levies, depressing the profitability of current business. Mr Charles Sturge, co-editor of Chatset, yesterday declared such an effect 'inevitable'. The estimates form part of a new assessment of open years among Lloyd's syndicates which leave their accounts open when they are unable to assess the size of future claims arising on business already underwritten. There are now 162 open years at Lloyd's, with several syndicates having more than one open year. Chatset estimates that it will cost a further Pounds 5.3bn to close the open years, with Pounds 400m needed to close years left open as a result of recent catastrophe losses such as Hurricane Hugo and the European storms of 1990. Liability claims arising from court awards to victims of asbestos-related diseases and government-ordered clean-ups of polluted sites and asbestos-contaminated buildings account for the remainder. The group estimates that it could take between 20 years and 25 years to settle all outstanding claims and that, taking into account investment income, a fund of Pounds 2bn set aside now would be sufficient to meet all future liabilities. Chatset made the calculations after comparing the actual pattern of claims payments over the past four years with actuarial projections about future payments. These projections vary widely. Mr Sturge said Chatset had favoured the more cautious and pessimistic projections. Chatset Guide to Syndicate Run-Offs 1992, PO Box 661, London SW1 8HY. Pounds 45.</p>

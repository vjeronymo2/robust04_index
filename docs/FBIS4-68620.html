Babenko, TORGOVAYA GAZETA correspondent, </F> under the rubric "Ukraine": "Prices Are Not Stinging Any More,  They Are Murderous"]    [Text] Dima the hairdresser, whose client I have been for  many years, finished his fancy manipulations on my head and,  with many apologies, asked me to pay 50,000 karbovantsi for a  regular haircut.    "What can you do?" complained the hairdresser with a touch  of  melancholy. "Such wild expenses for rent, water and sewage,  electricity..."    Generally speaking, the March prices in Kiev defy all  description. I made a tour of the neighboring food stores and,  within some 30 minutes, dropped 100,000 karbovantsi. Here it is:  300 grams of bologna-type sausage for 25,000; the same amount of  butter for 30,000; 10 eggs for 24,000; five kilos of potatoes  for 15,000; a liter of milk for 10,000; and two loaves of bread  for 6,000.    The average salary, meanwhile, equals now 763,000  karbovantsi  a month in the federal sector, or from 587,000 to 362,000 in the  fields of trade, municipal services, education, and health care.  The prices in Kiev are simply murderous. But even then groceries  may not cost all that much if we recalculate the prices in  Russian rubles at the rate of 1 to 23. But in Ukrainian terms  this is just a nightmare.    It is true that prices are terrorizing everybody. At the  Kiev  railroad terminal you had better stay away from porters if you  have less than 100,000 karbovantsi. A ride in a taxi cab used to  cost five Soviet rubles four years ago, but now it costs 300,000  karbovantsi already.    One can easily guess that the reasons for all this lie on  the  surface. According to the official data of the Ukrainian Cabinet  of Ministers administration for the economy, the amount of  consumer goods manufactured in January and February of this year  was 36 percent lower than in the same period of last year, the  volume of manufactured goods dropped by 41 percent, etc.    When she heard about my haircut problems, a friend of mine  who is a doctor with a candidate's degree in medicine offered to  perform this service free of charge. Her hair-cutting skill was  duly appreciated by my relatives and neighbors. A doctor of  technical sciences whom I had known since our student years told  me, not without a certain degree of smugness, that he has been  repairing shoes for a year, and he promised to teach me this  very profitable trade.    Generally, like the people of the besieged Oriental city in  the legend, the residents of Kiev are not crying any more. They  are laughing. But very, very bitterly.</p>

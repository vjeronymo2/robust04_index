			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Inspector is right I HAD EXCESS capital gains in 1992/93 and, in completing my tax return, I sought to use losses carried forward from 1977. These amounted to Pounds 1,185 and I suggested to the inspector that the sum should be increased by the indexation allowance from March 1982 of 1.753, giving a March 1993 loss figure of Pounds 2,078. He says the 1977 loss cannot be increased by the indexation allowance and that only the figure of Pounds 1,185 is available to offset gains. Is he right Yes. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

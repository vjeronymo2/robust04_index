			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / 'Golden Quadrangle' united by a desire to make money: Economic frenzy in a zone of 300m people In all, a dog, two chickens and two pigs have been killed and grains of rice and freshly-cut leaves are piled neatly next to the dog's corpse under the hot afternoon sun. It is a routine sacrifice. Some villagers in the Akha hilltribe community of Paka Sukjai in Thailand's far north are sick, and they have paid the spirit-man Bt52 (Pounds 1.40) to perform a ceremony to cure them. Such are the ancient animist traditions that survive among these Akha villagers. But the region they inhabit is being changed and modernised at a bewildering speed. They migrated from Burma 16 years ago to what was then an isolated Thai hilltop in the Golden Triangle - the zone encompassing the borders of China, Laos, Thailand and Burma that is notorious for its fields of opium poppies and guerrilla warlords. Today most of the dense forest that once blanketed the hills of northern Thailand has been destroyed. The Thai armed forces have pacified the area and discouraged opium growing, and have abandoned their military outposts and roadblocks. A paved road built a year ago reaches almost to Paka Sukjai, bringing ice cream vendors and the occasional tourist on a motorcycle. Schoolchildren learn Thai. The village is connected to the electricity grid and each house has its own meter. Villagers from the surrounding hills, with insufficient land for farming, sell their services as labourers, domestic servants or prostitutes in the nearby provincial capital of Chiang Rai or as far afield as Japan and Taiwan. The economy of northern Thailand - like the economies of each of the other three countries in the neighbourhood - is growing rapidly. Businessmen and governments have started calling the area the Golden Quadrangle, a name designed to reflect the fact that there are four nations while recalling the supposed romance of the Golden Triangle. Any political differences between Thai capitalists, the communist authorities of China and Laos and the Burmese military junta have been submerged by the mutual desire to make money. The four governments have opened their borders to tourism and trade. Last year, the Burmese junta began allowing foreign visitors to cross into Burma from Mae Sai in Thailand; this year Laos and Thailand let them cross the Mekong river at Chiang Kong. A Thai businessman is building a fleet of fast river boats to ferry tourists between Laos, Thailand and southern China along the river, and there are plans to blow up the rock-strewn rapids which prevent the passage of large cargo vessels. Chiang Rai's big new airport has called itself 'international' although there are no scheduled international flights; it is taken for granted that airlines will soon be flying from Chiang Rai to China and Laos. The State Railway of Thailand is examining the possibility of extending its network northwards as far as Chiang Rai. Governments and foreign aid agencies are building and upgrading roads throughout the 'quadrangle'. Chiang Rai already has five new hotels, three stockbrokers' offices and the first signs of traffic congestion, but local businessmen believe there is potential for much more growth. They see future profits in a combination of Thai investment capital and cheap labour, hydro-electricity and raw materials (including coal) from China, Laos and Burma. They want an industrial estate in Chiang Rai as well as a university and a railway station. 'These four countries would have great potential once there's a big push in this area,' says Mr Tanomsak Serivichyaswat, president of the Chiang Rai chamber of commerce. 'There's a very big market in this area  - 300m people  -and there's lots of labour.' Not everyone is so enthusiastic about what is happening. Environmentalists are trying to curb soil erosion, pollution and the deforestation of watersheds, and health workers are worried about the spread of the disease Aids. Such concerns, however, cut little ice with the crowds of tourists and traders in the busy frontier towns. In the Burmese town of Tachileik, across the border from Mae Sai, they are selling Chinese clothes, dried mushrooms, plastic toys and medicines to improve sexual potency made from deer antlers, along with Burmese rubies, cheroots and peacock feather fans. Thailand's contribution includes cigarettes and a cheap perfume called VIP Boms which comes in a container shaped liked a grenade. With China's Yunnan province struggling to find new, southward routes for its exports to bypass the congestion afflicting Chinese ports and railways, the activity at such frontier markets is probably only the beginning of a surge in cross-border trade and tourism. New buildings are springing up on both sides of the Thai-Burmese frontier, and one of the hotels in Mae Sai has been aptly named the Boom Hotel.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Thorn EMI Wants To Have the First </F> Text-Reading System Ready in a Few Months"]    [Text] Frankfurt. In the near future, display panels will  be able to be operated with much less energy expenditure than  has previously been the case thanks to the introduction of new  ferroelectric liquid crystals. These liquid crystals can  maintain their state even without a constant current. Characters  and graphics displayed once can be erased by a short electrical  current surge. Transportable computers like laptops, notebooks,  and the like, equipped with such displays, can operate for a  considerably longer period on one battery charge.    Ferroelectric liquid crystals are capable of changing their  orientation under the influence of a current pulse, in the  course of which they adjust the direction of polarization of the  incident light. Sandwiched between two extensive polarization  filters with correspondingly crossed polarization directions,  the liquid crystals of the display panel turn bright or dark,  depending on their orientation.    Viewed electrochemically, the ferroelectric liquid crystals  are bistable. Electronics engineers at Thorn EMI in Hayes,  Middlesex, Great Britain, also refer to the crystals as  "electronic paper" because the text or graphics need only be  created electronically and then remain.    So far, Thorn EMI has had a liquid crystal display with a  13-cm picture diagonal. The company hopes to bring the first  practical text-reading system to production readiness in about 6  to 10 months. In the past, ferroelectric liquid crystals have  been used to create color picture and minutely staged gray  values on liquid crystal screens. Now by combining the switching  properties of the liquid crystals with color-producing factors,  it is possible to achieve the color manifestations by means of  very rapid back and forth switching.    The "standing" color pictures with ferroelectric liquid  crystals also require a background illumination to make the  pixels visible. However, Thorn EMI (Department of Security and  Electronics, Hayes, Middlesex UB3 8AT, United Kingdom) reports,  the amount of energy expended is much less than conventionally  used liquid crystal screens, which require a constant current.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / House prices forecast to rise 8.5% before 1995 HOUSE PRICES will rise a further 8.5 per cent by the end of 1994, according to National Westminster Bank's chief economist. The bank's economic forecasts, to be published next month, expect East Anglia, east Midlands and Wales to see prices rise faster than the rest of the UK, and Greater London to lag behind. The same picture emerges from Business Strategies, an economic forecaster, in its regional forecasts published today. A preview of the bank's national and regional forecasts shows most of the rise in house prices - 7.5 per cent - will come next year. Mr David Kern, chief economist, said that the second half of this year would see only a 'modest' increase of about 0.9 per cent, after a 3 per cent rise in the first six months. The bank's report says house prices in East Anglia, east Midlands and Wales will rise by 10 per cent by the end of next year, and in Greater London by only 6.9 per cent. The rest of the south-east, with an expected increase of 8.3 per cent, will be only slightly behind the average. The forecasts are based on expected growth in GDP of 1.5 per cent this year, increasing to 2.2 per cent next year, and on the level of employment reaching 'a cyclical low point around September 1993' and then growing 'by some 240,000 or 1 per cent' by the end of next year. Business Strategies' regional planning service report expects a higher rate of GDP growth of 2.8 per cent both next year and in 1995. 'The strongest impetus for recovery is coming from the manufacturing sector, as a result of last September's depreciation of sterling and major new inward investments, such as the Japanese car plants,' it says. The south-east, like the south-west, is affected by the 'hangover of the late 1980s boom' - personal and corporate debt, the squeeze on the financial sector and the impact of defence cuts. In the longer run, Business Strategies says, the south-east's growth will catch up with the rest of the UK as house price rises 'help to buttress (consumer) spending and support the construction sector'. It adds, however, that 'unemployment in London will be very hard to bring down', partly because of productivity growth in services. As a result the region is unlikely to regain 'its lost share of the UK economy' and 'the chances of a 1980s style of north - south divide are remote'.</p>

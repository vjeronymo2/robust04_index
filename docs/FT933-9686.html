			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) Finance and the Family: Annuity rates fall Correction (published 14th August 1993) appended to this article. ALL THE main annuity providers cut their rates in July, says Billy Burrows, of the London-based Annuity Direct. He adds: 'Annuity rates are linked to gilt yields, and recent events in the exchange rate mechanism increase the likelihood of a further fall in interest rates. 'This will, in turn, reduce gilt yields. In the short term, prospects for annuities look good.' Not all annuities pay out a fixed level of income. This week's table focuses on two different types which increase in line with inflation, and at 5 per cent. The drawback is they start from a lower base. Peter Quinton, managing director of the Annuity Bureau, says: 'In the accompanying table, Standard Life is costing its RPI annuity rates at approximately 4 1/2 per cent fixed escalation, whereas National Provident Institution is costing its annuity at approximately 6 per cent. 'This indicates how different life offices are viewing future increases in inflation.' The figures are provided by the Annuity Bureau, Enterprise House, 59-65 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PQ, telephone 071-620 4090.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNUITY RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annuity escalating with RPI: Single Life  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 60             Annuity     Female age 50         Annuity                          Pounds                            Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Equitable Life       7,187.04     Equitable Life       4,860.96 2 Standard Life        7,052.40     Sun Life             4,842.24 3 Sun Alliance         6,920.04     Standard Life        4,832.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annuity escalating in line with RPI: Joint life/100% spouse's benefit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 60/Female 55       Annuity     Male 65/Female 60     Annuity                          Pounds                            Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Equitable Life       5,028.00     Equitable Life       5,609.04 2 Sun Life             5,008.80     Standard Life        5,540.40 3 Standard Life        4,976.40     Sun Life             5,477.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annuity escalating by 5% per annum: Single Life  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 60             Annuity     Female age 50         Annuity                          Pounds                            Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 RNPFN                7,413.00     RNPFN                5,047.68 2 Canada Life          6,997.44     Prudential           4,701.36 3 Equitable Life       6,941.04     Equitable Life       4,629.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annuity escalating by 5% per annum: Joint life/100% spouse's benefit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 60/Female 55       Annuity     Male 65/Female 60     Annuity                          Pounds                            Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 RNPFN                5,188.08     RNPFN                5,866.80 2 Prudential           4,849.80     Canada Life          5,404.20 3 Equitable Life       4,806.00     Prudential           5,395.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All payments are monthly in advance and have a purchase price of Pounds 100,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CORRECTION In the text associated with last week's Annuities table, the word 'not' was accidentally omitted from a sentence.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema: "Business Before Agni for </F> India"]    [Text] On 21st April, 1994 a newspaper report said that  India has decided to cap its indigenously developed intermediate  range missile programme, Agni, temporarily due to severe  financial crunch. Another report published in a different  newspaper talked about the firm resolve of the Indian PM [Prime  Minister] Narasimha Rao not to abandon India's nuclear  programme. Explaining in detail introduction of various types  of missiles into the Indian defence system, Rao took pains to  clarify that the Americans were not pressurising Indians to give  up trials of `Agni'. While the 1960s witnessed intense  discussion revolving about the operationalisation of  intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) with nuclear  warheads, the 80s and 90s have seen the arrival of precision  guided missile system capable of carrying both nuclear and  conventional warheads.    India embarked upon an ambitious programme of missile  development and their eventual deployment some 20 years back.  In addition to many strategic considerations, slow development  of combat aircraft for deep-strike and interdiction contributed  enormously to the accelerated pace of missile development  programme. The Indian programme is a fairly comprehensive one  which includes missiles like Agni (intermediate range ballistic  missile), Prithivi (medium range surface to surface missile),  Nag (anti-tank missile), Akash and Trishul (surface to air  missile).    Some reports suggest that both the Indian army and Indian  airforce are going to deploy 75 and 25 Prithivi missiles by the  middle or this year. Having successfully completed the third  launch of Agni, indicating that India has now acquired a  capability of delivering one toner [as published] warheads (both  nuclear as well as conventional) to a distance over 2000 km, the  Indians are now engaged in a fierce debate whether or not to  deploy Agni quickly.    With the improvised precision guidance system of Indian  missiles, one expects that they would soon be employed.  Besides, many in India vociferously stress that the fruits of  hard work in this area are beginning to pay dividends now, and  that Agni should not be abandoned at this point. Why then the  capping of the Agni programme?    Four factors need to be analysed for an answer. The official  reason is of course the problem of finances. This is hard to  believe. A country which has been spending over five crores a  day to violently suppress the freedom struggle in Kashmir is  unlikely to abandon a programme which has placed it in the  exclusive club of those in possession of ICBMs. In any case  India will deploy Prithivi missile which costs little over three  crores each. Why has this plan not been postponed for the same  reason?    The second factor can be technical problems. But for the  successful third launch, one could have accepted this as, at  that time, the problem of nose-cone and some complexities of  precision guidance system frequently cropped up. Many  criticised huge spending on the Agni programme at the time. But  now that the Indians have overcome all the technical problems,  and to quote the Indian Chief of Army Staff General Joshi, Agni  has put India in a `totally different league', the reasoning  sounds absurd.    The third reason could be that it is meant as a sop to the  Americans. It is common knowledge that the US desperately wants  to promote nuclear non-proliferation in the region. Both India  and Pakistan, Pakistan much more than India, have been feeling  the pinch of American pressure. But PM Rao has been denying  there was any pressure on India from the US and that even if  there was, Delhi would resist it. It is a matter of fact that  the Americans have been dealing with Delhi with kid gloves. But  they have their concerns. According to an American analyst  working for Carnegie Endowment: `If India decides to make Agni  operational, it would escalate US fears about an open ended  nuclear missiles race in the region'. He further states that  the success of Agni has not only rendered the MTCR [Missile  Technology Control Regime] ineffective but seriously jeopardised  one of the US key mechanism to control missile proliferation in  South Asia. It seems that the government of India withstood all  the pressures until Indian scientists had completed the  requisite spadework and conveyed the success of Agni to the  Indian PM. Cognizant of the American interests in the area, a  short term delay in actual deployment can not only effectively  ward off the pressure but may also be styled as a friendly  gesture to the US to be encashed at a proper time.    The final factor is that it is a tactical withdrawal. The  Agni missile can be operationalised within two years even if it  is frozen at the present level of preparedness. Besides, Agni  has already demonstrated India's technological superiority,  putting it on hold for the time being will not be a big step  backward.    Also the US and many other western nations are viewing the  Indian economic market favourably. They want to and are  investing heavily there. The postponement of the Agni programme  is a symbolic gesture to these potential investors and trade  partners that India means business.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / The proliferation of power: Europe Nuclear proliferation is now one of the leading preoccupations of western governments. This anxiety, that nuclear weapons may get into the hands of states which are unstable, uncivilised or plain malevolent, is the direct consequence of the end of the Cold War. But there is another consequence which is more profound and far-reaching, and that is political proliferation. The two are directly connected; and those nuclear-weapons states which are most anxious to prevent nuclear proliferation, are also most anxious to prevent political proliferation. Their efforts are doomed to fail, since neither form of proliferation can be prevented; delayed for a while, perhaps, but not prevented. But the problem of nuclear proliferation will be easier to handle if governments face up to the inevitability - and desirability - of political proliferation. The fear of nuclear proliferation is the corollary of the nuclear age. Throughout the Cold War, when terror of nuclear war was greatest, the nuclear-weapons club was for many years officially limited to five nations. Some bandit states acquired various degrees of illicit capability, but the stress of the east-west confrontation helped to contain the risks of overt break-out. The polarising discipline of the Cold War has now evaporated. The rogue behaviour of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is the most eloquent witness of the collapse of Soviet influence; but other renegade states may seek to tread the same path. On the supply side, the disintegration of the Soviet Union is causing concern over the future of its nuclear arsenal. The Russians say the weapons are under secure control from Moscow; but control cannot be secure until there is a stable political system of reasonably satisfied states, and that is many years off. Moreover, economic collapse and nuclear disarmament could create optimal incentives for unauthorised exports of nuclear materials or mercenary emigration of nuclear experts. The corollary of nuclear discipline was political discipline. The east-west confrontation of the Cold War compelled lesser powers to accept the domination of the US and the Soviet Union. The western alliance was, of course, democratic and therefore much less monolithic than the eastern. But on both sides the line-up was clear-cut and consistent, and the opposing champions were the so-called 'superpowers'. The end of the Cold War has let loose a vigorous jostling for position between leaders and followers. Russia under Mr Boris Yeltsin is asserting its claims as the successor state to the Soviet superpower; the US under Mr George Bush is being just as hyperactive in asserting its role as the successor state to the American superpower. Now it may suit the ex-superpowers to prop each other up: Bush and Yeltsin, like Reagan and Gorbachev before them, are trading disarmament gestures abroad, because they cannot deliver economic well-being at home. But in neither case do their international claims carry conviction. The latest exchange of nuclear disarmament bids by the superpowers looks like the reiteration of an old trick out of season. The elimination of multiple warheads on strategic missiles may seem spectacular, but there is one problem: what are these missiles for, anyhow, and why do you need 4,500? The world is now less impressed by bilateral number-cutting of the superpower arsenals, because it is starting to look irrelevant. The most urgent nuclear priorities today are the control and stability of the weapons systems inside the ex-Soviet Union, and the containment of proliferation; but neither of these tasks can be handled privately by the two superpowers. On the contrary, they need far-reaching international co-operation. It is not clear that the US welcomes this aspect of the new world order. When President Francois Mitterrand of France suggested last September that the four nuclear powers with weapons in Europe (US, UK, France and the Soviet Union) should jointly discuss the security of Soviet nuclear weapons, the idea was icily ignored by the US. The three western foreign ministers have now made separate trips to the ex-Soviet republics to study the question, and have returned with different conclusions. Unfortunately, America's European allies have been equally slow to accept the egalitarian nature of the new world order. Mr Mitterrand's four-power suggestion annoyed the Germans as well as the Americans, because Bonn could see no reason why it should not be equally involved in the problem of Soviet nuclear security. It is not surprising, therefore, that Germany has now proposed, in Nato, that the unilateral US and Soviet offers to eliminate all their tactical nuclear weapons should be subject to a collective process of verification. The proposal has been kept fairly discreet; but it is a significant warning shot to the so-called superpowers. Last Friday's summit meeting of the UN Security Council is another case in point. France (which first suggested it) and Britain (which organised it) may have intended to shift the bilateralism of the Cold War to the multilateralism of the UN. In practice, this declaratory meeting will have achieved little apart from TV exposure; it annoyed the Germans, because it underlined the fact that they are not members of the Security Council. Unlike the Japanese, the Germans will probably refrain from demanding a permanent seat on the Security Council. But the incident can only reinforce their determination that their views will in future play a role in the UN postures of France and Britain. Political power is leaking uncontrollably away from Moscow and Washington. Lesser powers are no longer prepared for the role of docile followers, although some still hanker irritatingly after anachronistic privileges. But the old hierarchies have to go, because the world is changing.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN RECEIVES AWARD FROM AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan was honored Saturday night in Beverly Hills by  the American Jewish Committee at its annual Executive Council meeting for his  defense of Jewish concerns in international affairs.  </P> <P> The Committee presented Reagan with its American Liberties Medallion for moving  the United States "to new heights of warmth and friendship" with Israel and  enhancing "free trade and strategic partnership" between the two nations in his  eight-year White House tenure. The award, at a Beverly Hilton dinner attended  by nearly 1,000 people, came as the Jewish-rights organization debated at its  five-day meeting whether a serious rift is growing between Israeli and American  Jews over political and religious differences.  </P> <P> In accepting the medallion, Reagan said: "Throughout my Administration a  special friendship between Israel and the United States was a cornerstone of  our foreign policy because of our shared moral values." In the quest for peace  in the Middle East, he said, "courage and trust will be required" from both  nations.  </P> <P> Past recipients of the award have included President Lyndon B. Johnson, the  Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Henry Kissinger, Nobel Peace prize laureate Elie  Wiesel and, most recently, West German President Richard von Weizsaecker.  </P> <P> Although the American Jewish Committee had often criticized the Reagan  Administration's cuts in domestic social programs, the New York-based  organization complimented the ex-president Saturday for "his exemplary  leadership in support of the State of Israel and lifetime commitment to the  freedom of Soviet Jewry."  </P> <P> Reagan, who recently returned from a much-criticized, nine-day series of  appearances in Japan that paid him $2 million, was not paid for his dinner  appearance, Committee officials said.  </P> <P> Producer-director Steven Spielberg, whose motion pictures include "E.T., the  Extra-terrestrial" and "The Color Purple," was given the Committee's Mass Media  Award at the dinner "for bringing film-making to new heights while faithfully  maintaining artistic integrity and deep concern for human values."  </P> <P> The 83rd annual Executive Council meeting, which ends today, was attended by  nearly 300 people to discuss issues such as the impact of new immigrant  communities on American life and the role of media in combating prejudices. On  Friday, the council announced the formation of a Pacific Rim Institute in Los  Angeles to combat signs of anti-Semitism in some Far East countries and to  establish Jewish relations with growing Asian-American communities in the  United States.  </P> <P> One concern here was what a Saturday morning panelist called a "drifting apart"  of Israeli and American Jews.  </P> <P> Jewish leaders generally agree on the primary friction points: the Israeli  handling of the Palestinian uprisings and the unresolved "who is a Jew"  question affecting non-Orthodox converts who emigrate to Israel and who are not  totally accepted. The rabbis in Israel do not accept the validity of  conversions by Reform and Conservative rabbis in other countries, a position  that has drawn criticism from Reform and Conservative U.S. Jews.  </P> <P> It is generally seen that differences have arisen because the Israeli  government has moved to the right while the U.S. Jewish community remains  mainly left of center in political and religious outlook.  </P> <P> Arye Z. Carmon, president of the Israel-Diaspora Institute at Tel Aviv  University, attributed part of the problem to "ultra-Orthodox bigotry and  fundamentalism."  </P> <P> U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles) likened the strains between Israeli and  American Jews to a long marriage. "It can never be good all the time," Levine  said. He added, however, "we can't allow a divorce."  </P> <P> Levine said he is not adverse to expressing misgivings over Israeli policies  with candor -- "but privately, not publicly."  </P> <P> However, the third panelist, Norman Podhoretz, the noted conservative editor of  Commentary magazine, contended that "anxiety over a split is overdrawn." He  said that American and Israeli Jewish relations are better than they were in  the mid-1950s.  </P> <P> Many U.S. Jews in 1948 held anti-Zionist views or at least were indifferent to  the creation of the Jewish state at that time, Podhoretz said.  </P></p>

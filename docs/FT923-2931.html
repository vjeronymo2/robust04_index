			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Buoyant start for Italian futures market ITALY's government bond futures market, the Mercato Italiano dei Futures (Mif), inaugurated last Friday, could not have got off to a more dramatic start following Sunday's devaluation of the lira. After a successful first day's trading, when volume reached almost 10,000 contracts, yesterday proved to be just as buoyant. Turnover reached 10,900 against a background of wild gyrations in the cash market as dealers digested the implications of the EMS realignment. As expected, cash market yields dropped. The gross yield on the most actively traded 10-year bond fell to 13.7 per cent from 14.34 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, rates for securities repurchase agreements be-tween the Bank of Italy and commercial banks fell to 16.06 per cent from the level of 20.81 per cent reached last Tuesday. Mif's opening day was widely viewed as a success. With systems working well, the market traded more than half as many 10-year Italian bond futures contracts as on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). Moreover, the average size so far of the Milan contract, at L250m, compares with L200m on Liffe. Competition between the two markets is likely to be tough. Liffe has created a family of lira products, including options on bond futures and futures on 90-day Eurolira deposits. While Liffe, with its wide variety of products, will continue to appeal to international banks and fund managers wanting to play sophisticated hedging and arbitrage strategies, the Mif looks set to develop a strong following among domestic banks. Only two of the 138 participants in the new market are not Italian. Morgan Stanley is acting as a local, while JP Morgan in Milan has broker status. While the new market has acquitted itself well so far, dealers warn that it is early days yet. 'We hope that some of the pressure on the lira and the Italian market have now been decoupled from the French referendum,' says Mr Riccardo Barbieri, chief economist at JP Morgan in Milan. 'The lira should now to some extent be shielded from these pressures.' However, with the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty taking place on Sunday, this week could still offer a bumpy ride for the infant Mif.</p>

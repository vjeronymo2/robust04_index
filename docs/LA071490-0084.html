			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHANGHAI MAYOR TOURS U.S., SEEKS TO REVIVE GOODWILL;  </P> <P> CHINA: ZHU IS A RISING STAR WHO COULD BE A FUTURE GORBACHEV. BUT HE APPARENTLY  SEES NO NEED NOW FOR SOVIET-STYLE RESTRUCTURING.  </P> <P> China's most urbane and polished leader, the man some Westerners hope may  become a future Chinese version of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is barnstorming the  United States, seeking to revive American goodwill and business interest in his  beleaguered country.  </P> <P> Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji, the top politician in China's largest city and one  of the rising stars of the Chinese Communist Party, is the highest-ranking  official to visit the United States since his government called in troops to  crush pro-democracy demonstrations last year.  </P> <P> Zhu stopped in New York City and Washington this week and will visit Los  Angeles and San Francisco later this month. He is part of a delegation of six  Chinese mayors invited to the United States by the National Committee on  U.S.-China Relations.  </P> <P> At each stop, Zhu pleads for American forbearance and understanding of the  turmoil in China last year and of the differences between the two countries'  political systems.  </P> <P> "You have your system of democracy, and we have our system of democracy," he  said at a press conference in Washington. "But that does not mean we have  nothing in common."  </P> <P> (The Chinese Communist Party refers to China's political system as a "socialist  democracy," which it readily admits is different than what it calls  Western-style democracy. China's constitution requires obedience to the  leadership of the Communist Party and "the dictatorship of the proletariat.")  </P> <P> In Washington, Zhu and the other five mayors got a warm welcome from the Bush  Administration this week. They were greeted at the White House by National  Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and at the State Department by Deputy  Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger.  </P> <P> A White House spokesman said the sessions did not violate the Administration  policy against high-level exchanges between U.S. and Chinese leaders, because  "mayors are not high-level officials." Scowcroft and Eagleburger traveled twice  to Beijing last year to meet with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and other top  officials.  </P> <P> U.S. officials clearly view Zhu as a possible future leader of China. One  Administration analyst said that he believes Zhu will be moved to Beijing in a  top leadership post this fall.  </P> <P> Zhu, 61, probably has had more extensive exposure to the thinking of Western  economists and business leaders than any other senior Chinese leader, with the  possible exception of former Party Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who is now under  house arrest. Before becoming mayor of Shanghai in 1988, Zhu was in charge of  Chinese efforts to attract Western investment.  </P> <P> Although thousands of democracy demonstrators blocked the streets of Shanghai  for several days in June, 1989, Zhu managed to defuse the crisis without  imposing martial law on the city and without the bloody violence suffered in  Beijing.  </P> <P> Zhu's name crops up when Western analysts of China try to imagine which future  Chinese Communist Party leader might succeed in taking power and instigating  fundamental political changes, in the fashion of Gorbachev.  </P> <P> There is no sign at the moment, however, that Zhu sees the need for  Soviet-style perestroika, or political restructuring, in China.  </P> <P> Asked whether he believes that there should be any restrictions on the  authority of the Communist Party, he told reporters that the party's efforts  are aimed at improving government policies and the legal system.  </P> <P> "I see no reason to put restrictions on that," he said.  </P> <P> As for congressional concerns about human rights violations in China, Zhu  declared, "It is we ourselves who are most concerned about our own human  rights." The mayor said that the 1989 demonstrations in Shanghai prevented  residents from getting food, forced women to walk long distances to work and  blocked the transportation of bodies to funeral parlors.  </P> <P> At his Washington press conference, Zhu said that fewer than 10 people remain  in detention in Shanghai as a result of those demonstrations. A few hours  earlier, however, the State Department had told Congress that about 80 of the  1989 protesters are being detained in Shanghai.  </P> <P> Zhu acknowledges that he is concerned about flagging American business interest  in China, once viewed as a potentially lucrative future market. Previously, the  mayor said, the United States accounted for about a third of all foreign  investment in Shanghai. This year, it has dropped to only a quarter of the  total.  </P> <P> "We hope that this year, the American investment will increase again," he said.  </P> <P> Zhu made one gibe at the new Western fascination with Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "We've had 10 years of experience in dealing with foreign investors," Zhu said.  ". . . As to Eastern Europe, I think it may be necessary for them to collect  some experience."  </P> <P> While in Southern California on July 22 and 23, the mayors will visit the Port  of Los Angeles, Disneyland, the RAND Corp., McDonnell-Douglas Corp., and the  Los Angeles-Guangzhou Sister City Assn. They also will stop by City Hall to  talk with Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P></p>

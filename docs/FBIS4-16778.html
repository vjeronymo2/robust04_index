			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Kukanov report: "Bankers Gathered in St. Petersburg"] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg -- Approximately 5,000 bankers,  businessmen, jurists, and finance ministers from 57 countries  have traveled to St. Petersburg for the third annual session of  the Board of Directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development [EBRD], which is being held in St. Petersburg's  Taurida Palace. The Russian side is represented at the  international banking congress by Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Vice Premiers Anatoliy Chubays and Aleksandr  Shokhin, and Russian Federation Central Bank Chairman Viktor  Gerashchenko. EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere declared that  the European Bank intends to fundamentally modify the ideology  of cooperation with Russia and the CIS countries, going over to  direct ties with regions, commercial structures, and  enterprises. There will be presentations of 50 Russian  investment projects within the framework of the International  Banking Forum. An agreement on the use of the Proton carrier  rocket to put European space satellites into orbit is expected  to be concluded with the Russian premier's participation.  Representatives of the "Mayak" Design Bureau and the European  Bank intend to sign the relevant documents. At the initial  stage the project is valued at U.S.$10 million. In the opinion  of experts, this contract could signify the reorientation of  European space structures toward the Russian market.    Precisely 24 investment programs submitted by St. Petersburg  were submitted for the European bankers' verdict. They include  a project for the construction of a ring road which will solve  the problems of transit communication between north European and  Baltic countries and the northwest region of Russia, the  construction of a high-speed main railroad between Moscow and  St. Petersburg, and the reconstruction of the historic city on  the Neva.</p>

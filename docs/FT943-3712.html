			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Farmers attack proposals on nitrate levels Livestock farmers could be forced out of business and overall production dented by 'ill-conceived' government plans for compulsory restrictions to cut nitrates in drinking water, the National Farmers' Union said yesterday. The restrictions hit dairy farmers because the nitrates in the slurry and manure from their animals leach out from fields into the water supply. Mr Tony Pexton, NFU vice-president, said proposals for 72 'nitrate-vulnerable zones' covering 650,000 hectares in England and Wales were based on arbitrary figures for maximum nitrate levels. The government has proposed that the zones take effect by the end of 1999 to comply with the European Commission's 1991 nitrate directive. This says that nitrates in drinking water sources should not exceed 50mg per litre on any single occasion. Mr Pexton said this was over-rigorous because the World Health Organisation and the government's Department of Health suggested a limit of 50mg per litre as an average over a year, as opposed to a 50mg limit on any one occasion. He said the UK's limit of 100mg per litre had 'no perceivable effect on health'. The commission is reviewing the 50mg limit. The NFU urged the government not to begin implementing the policy until the review was complete. Mr Pexton accused the National Rivers Authority of a series of errors in drawing up the zones, which are mainly in East Anglia, the Midlands and the north-east. Up to half the land in some zones had been incorrectly defined, water samples had not been taken often enough and they had produced widely different results, he said. Livestock farmers in the zones would be restricted in the timing and amount of their applications of organic man-ure, with no compensation. Mr Pexton said the NFU had received letters from livestock farmers who said they could be forced out of business by the restrictions. Among the estimated 10,000 farmers affected, the worst hit could be small dairy producers who would be forced to run down their herds to uneconomic levels. Land values could be affected. He also cited a report by the US Department of Agriculture which said 'proper implementation of the directive will result in very significant falls in output for some livestock products'. In the case of pigs and poultry, this could turn the European Union from a net exporter to a net importer.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Wider TUC ballot urged THE NORTHERN region of TUC is to lobby for the next general secretary to be elected by a vote of all members of TUC-affiliated unions. Mr Bob Howard, regional secretary, said the TUC had for too long been seen as a London-based office, selecting its general secretary and senior officials on the basis of 'Buggins' turn'. Stressing that he was not seeking the position, Mr Howard said he was not against Mr John Monks, deputy general secretary who is expected to succeed Mr Norman Willis when he takes early retirement.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Foods aided by UCD purchase WATERFORD FOODS, the largest dairy processor in the Irish Republic, announced a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 8.69m, or Pounds 8.34m, after amortisation of goodwill, for the six months to June 30. Turnover advanced by 15 per cent to IPounds 250m. The company said that 'very good performances were recorded by all our businesses except the UK fruit juice operations where results were below expectations. The first half also benefited from the acquisition of United Co-operative Dairies (UCD) in December 1991.' The company's 2-for-9 rights issue last February raised IPounds 24.3m. It completed the purchase of Express Foods, Ireland in July, at the same time as taking 100 per cent control of Premier Dairies, the principal supplier to the Dublin liquid milk market. The latest two acquisitions cost IPounds 89.6m, bringing the total spent on acquisitions over the past four years to some IPounds 200m. The company said that 'major progress' was being made in restructuring the two neighbouring dairy companies it acquired in the UK, Healds in 1989 and UCD in 1991, and that significant benefits would come through over the next 18 months. Healds and UCD have a combined milk pool of 60m gallons, and a combined market share for liquid milk of about 25 per cent in the north- west region around Manchester. Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, said a broadening of the company's product portfolio and cost competitiveness were group priorities and that the recent acquisitions gave the directors confidence for Waterford's future as 'a large, international, consumer-orientated food business.' Goodwill amortisation of IPounds 621,000 held back earnings per share to 4.29p (4.21p). An interim dividend of 1.15p (1.1p) is declared.</p>

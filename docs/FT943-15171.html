			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Observer: Help wanted Bob Phillis, the BBC's increasingly powerful deputy director general, has bowed to the inevitable. He is looking for a candidate to relieve him of his job as managing director of the BBC World Service which he has held since he arrived at the BBC. In addition to being John Birt's deputy, and natural heir apparent, Phillis has just taken on the chairmanship of the newly created BBC Worldwide so he has more than enough on his plate. However, he is not letting go completely. The new World Service boss will report directly to him, rather than John Birt. Sam Younger, the World Service's new director of broadcasting, is the obvious internal successor. But his promotion might seem a bit too cosy, if Phillis is really intent on exploiting the full potential of one of the Beeb's most valuable hidden assets.</p>

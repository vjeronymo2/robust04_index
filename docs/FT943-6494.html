			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Russians plan gold securities market The Russian government is backing plans to create a domestic securities market for gold bullion, aiming to establish an internal price for the precious metal and to raise capital to develop one of the country's most important but troubled industries. Following a gold industry conference in Moscow last week, government departments, banks and mining companies plan to establish a non-commercial Gold Club to co-ordinate the industry's activities and create a secondary market for gold. Industry officials say such a market could raise Dollars 1bn (Pounds 649m) for much-needed investment. Preliminary proposals envisage the creation of a class of securities, similar to western gold warrants, denominated in grammes of gold and freely traded by legitimate investors. The market would set the official price of gold within Russia and would be used by the Central Bank and tax authorities. The Gold Club has not yet worked out how this exchange could work in practice nor how soon. A founding meeting of the club will be held next month. Mr Valery Skripchenko, head of administration at the Russian Committee for Precious Metals and Stones, said there were still 'contradictions between a state which did not wish to relinquish its control of an important strategic sector of the economy and alternative investors who would not commit resources to a sector under a permanent threat of nationalisation'. Industry figures suggest that a gold securities market might reconcile the differing priorities of the state and outside investors.</p>

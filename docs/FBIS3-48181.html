A government official revealed on 18 January: "If North  Korea allows the IAEA inspection team to visit North Korea to  receive practical [silchilchokin] inspection of the seven  reported facilities and agrees to the exchange of special envoys  of the South and North, this will be recognized as a  breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue, thus making it  possible to allow businessmen to visit North Korea."    This greatly eases the government's policy that was decided  upon at the August reunification-related ministers meeting in  which it decided that `businessmen will be allowed to visit  North Korea only when North Korea completely returns to the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and agrees to the inspection of  unreported facilities in Yongbyon.'    If a breakthrough is made on the nuclear issue, the  government plans to allow technicians to visit North Korea to  activate the consignment processing trade [imgagong kyoyok].    A government official said: "The volume of South-North trade  was reduced by six percent last year because of the nuclear  issue. However, processing trade for reexport [witak kagong]  increased by seven to eight times, thus showing the possibility  of South-North trade. Necessary measures will be taken at the  government level this year to actively assist such processing."    If North Korea accepts the IAEA's inspection and also the  South-North mutual inspection, the government will actively work  on opening direct South-North sea route which is being pointed  out as the greatest obstacle in South-North trade. The  government will also establish a South-North exchange  cooperative subcommittee to provide measures for guaranteeing  investment, preventing double taxation, and providing procedures  for disputes.    It was learned that the sea routes between Inchon Port-Nampo  Port, Pusan Port-Wonsan Port, and Pohang Port-Chongjin Port will  be the most likely sea routes already agreed upon between South  and North Korea in case a direct sea route is established.    The government plans to make a final decision over this  matter at the 25 January reunification-related ministers meeting.</p>

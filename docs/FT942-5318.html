			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / OFT to investigate market-making Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has launched a new inquiry into the practice of market-making on the London Stock Exchange, under which stockbroking firms buy and sell shares in publicly-quoted companies. The Office of Fair Trading has written to market makers, brokers and institutional investors to ask for comments on the effects of market-making, a system which is not used by other large international exchanges. The last inquiry into market-making, which relies on large brokers providing liquidity by guaranteeing to sell or buy shares at set prices, was made in 1988 and cleared the system of anti-competitive effects. Supporters of market-making argue that it has helped London to establish a pre-eminent position in Europe because it guarantees investors the ability to sell and buy large blocks of shares. The OFT said yesterday the inquiry was a standard re-examination of an area that had been investigated before, and had not been prompted by a particular concern that market-making had become less competitive. The inquiry is likely to focus on the use of capital by firms that trade shares, and on wheth-er the system allows market-makers to make excessive profits by fixing large margins between their bid and offer prices. Other exchanges tend to use systems of an order-driven type, where offers to buy and sell blocks of shares at particular prices are posted on computer systems and matched centrally. Pressure from the former director-general of fair trading, Sir Gordon Borrie, over the separation of brokers and jobbers, and minimum commissions, eventually led to the Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986. A subsequent inquiry into the privileges and obligations of market makers in 1988 found that the rules of market-making on the London Stock Exchange were 'not significantly anti-competitive'. Sir Gordon said after that inquiry the OFT might make a further assessment of market-making if there were representations to suggest that competitive circumstances had changed. The stock exchange said it had been informed of the inquiry by its listed companies advisory committee, which had been contacted by the OFT. The OFT is asking for preliminary responses by the end of this month. The OFT may hold detailed talks with firms involved in market-making after that. It could refer the stock exchange to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if dissatisfied at the outcome.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 0251) and </F> XINHUA reporter Hu Qinghai (5170 3237 3189)]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Central Discipline  Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Supervision called a  telephone conference of discipline inspection and supervision  departments nationwide in Beijing today, calling for deepening  the anticorruption drive and concentrating efforts to  investigate and handle major and serious cases.    Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau and the  Secretariat and secretary of the Discipline Inspection  Commission of the CPC Central Committee, addressed the  conference. He said: Party committees and governments, as well  as discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels  should continue to earnestly carry out the three tasks of the  anticorruption drive in line with the party Central Committee's  plans. Currently it is necessary to pay particular attention to  intensifying investigation of major and serious economic  offenses involving leading officials at and above the county and  section levels. Meanwhile, it is necessary to halt all kinds of  malpractice and corruption adversely affecting the progress of  reforms, economic growth, and stability; and to strive to deepen  the anticorruption drive and make it a still greater success.    According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year,  discipline inspection and supervision organs nationwide received  a total of 366,000 tips from the masses, completed the  investigation of 14,718 cases, placed an additional 22,981 cases  on file for investigation, and disciplined 15,216 party and  government officials. These officials included 450 county or  section-level, 35 prefectural or department-level, and 3  provincial or ministerial-level cadres. Of the 15,216  officials, 1,416 were handed over to judicial departments for  prosecution on criminal charges. Through investigating and  handling discipline violation cases, a total of 642 million yuan  in economic losses were recovered for the state.    Wei Jianxing said: Despite some successes in the  anticorruption drive, there remain a number of problems which  must not be overlooked, and which must be resolved by taking  effective measures.    He emphasized: We must further strengthen the leadership  over handling of cases and must conclude the investigation of a  number of major cases within the next few months. He said: All  localities and departments should work out plans and take  action, concentrating attention on major cases involving  economic offenses, such as embezzlement, bribery, financial  frauds, smuggling, and serious violations of financial and  economic discipline. Leading departments of the party and  government, judicial departments, administrative law-enforcement  departments, and economic administrative departments should  remain the main targets; while investigation should be focused  on major and serious economic offenses by leading cadres at and  above the county and section levels.    He said: While investigating major and serious cases, it is  also necessary to pay keen attention to the work related to  leading cadres' honesty and self-discipline, and correction of  style. As far as the work related to honesty and  self-discipline is concerned, efforts should be concentrated on  self-examination and correction by leading cadres. Where a  department or locality has failed to convene a democratic  meeting to examine leading cadres' honesty and self-discipline,  it is necessary to promptly do so. Where such a meeting has  been convened, it is necessary to report the meeting results as  they really are to cadres and people at large, and to accept  their evaluation and supervision. Problems which have been  revealed during the self-examination or investigation should be  promptly corrected and handled according to regulations. He  said: The main targets of correction this year should be focused  on screening of wanton collection of fees, investigating use of  government funds to go on sight-seeing tours outside the country  (territory), and checking power abuse by party and government  organs and their functionaries in using enterprise money and  materials free of charge, and halting salient malpractice in  various departments, trades, and professions.    Meanwhile, he emphasized: We should coordinate various  forces to review progress of the anticorruption drive and  earnestly supervise and inspect the implementation of the three  tasks, especially the progress in investigating major and  serious cases, thereby deepening the anticorruption drive.    State Councillor Li Guixian spoke on the need by various  departments and governments at all levels to step up efforts to  correct unhealthy practices in various trades and professions  and promote the construction of clean government.    Responsible persons from the relevant departments attended  the conference.</p>

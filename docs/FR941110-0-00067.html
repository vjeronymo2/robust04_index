			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1919(h)(2)(A)(i) of the Act expressly gives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States the authority to impose payment denials with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to new Medicaid admissions. While the Act also provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States with the opportunity to design other remedies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to Federal approval, that are as effective as those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enumerated in the Medicaid law, we believe that it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate for us to evaluate a remedy that would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aimed at the admissions of persons over whom the Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law provides no jurisdiction. We believe it would be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to leave to State law remedies that extend as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> far as the commenters suggest. In any event, while a denial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of payment for new Medicaid admissions does not reach all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential admissions, it will provide an incentive to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility to correct deficiencies rapidly, which would serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to benefit not only Medicaid residents but all those persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who are receiving care at the facility regardless of payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source. Also, States may provide public notice of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposition of the denial of payment for new admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy which would alert potential residents to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation in the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not accepting the suggestion that directed plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of correction be a required remedy. As discussed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Factors to be considered in selecting remedies'' later in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this preamble, we have provided a revised enforcement scheme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this final rule that correlates the seriousness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance with the selection of remedies from within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified enforcement remedy categories. While we do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intend to mandate the specific selection of the directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan of correction remedy from among the available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement actions for any specific level of actionable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance, in other words, when the facility is not in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance, we note that it is always an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement option and it may be the only remedy used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower level deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters requested that we require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to submit any alternative or additional remedies to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full State rulemaking process with an opportunity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment. Other commenters believed that States should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to implement additional or alternative remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless HCFA can demonstrate that the State remedies are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as effective as the HCFA remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The States must follow any internal State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures which govern the development and submittal of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid State plan amendment. The Act does not require nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do we believe our regulations should require specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that would limit State prerogatives for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating enforcement policies. Similarly, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act states that the State must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that any alternative remedies are as effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the remedies specified in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters suggested that the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies established by the States be made applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dually participating facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are accepting this comment with some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification. Since States may establish their own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctions through their respective State plan amendment, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since HCFA will be the entity imposing sanctions for dually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating facilities, it is highly likely that a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may choose to impose one of its own remedies on a Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NF which HCFA would have no authority to impose against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare provider agreement. It would not be rational for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> us to proceed with an enforcement scheme whereby a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility, by virtue of participating in both Medicare and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid, would be subject to a dual enforcement track.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, and more importantly, since HCFA will be taking the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead on enforcement actions against dually participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities under part 498, we have concluded that HCFA needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have the authority to impose these alternative or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional remedies against Medicare facilities in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States that have established these remedies. While we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledge that this would not permit consistency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally relative to remedies available for dually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating facilities, we conclude that it is a realistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and necessary response to statutory intent that enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions made regarding the Medicaid agreement, which could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include imposition of these ``other'' State remedies, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied by the Secretary to the Medicare agreement as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under the Secretary's general rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority, this final rule provides that, if the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy is unique to the State plan and has been approved by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA, then that remedy, as imposed by the State under its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid authority, can be imposed by HCFA against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare provider agreement of a dually participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create penalties for States that fail to implement the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act provides no specific penalty for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State failure to implement the enforcement provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, nor do we wish to add one. However, there are existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid rules regarding the submission of and adherence to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State plan amendments. If a State does not comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid rules, the failure could lead to Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative sanctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.305&blank;Standard Surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

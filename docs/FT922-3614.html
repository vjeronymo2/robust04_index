			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / MPs pledge to keep up pressure MPs FROM BOTH sides of the Commons last night stepped up the pressure on banks and other financial institutions that benefited from dealings with Robert Maxwell to contribute voluntarily to the pension funds he plundered. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, defended the government's decision to limit to Pounds 2.5m the emergency aid for the pensioners. Campaigners had welcomed Mr Lilley's statement on Monday. Many of them believe that with its initial move the government is in effect committed to making up whatever the shortfall turns out to be when all the recoverable assets have been returned. Mr Lilley said the special unit set up within the social security department to secure voluntary contributions had already begun its work 'in embryo'. Pressure on him to get the unit working at full strength is likely to increase. Part of the unit's task is to remind the banks of their moral obligations, as it emerged that Treasury ministers had no plans to become involved in the exercise, in spite of the department's close links with the City. Rejecting demands by Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, that the government should restore the losses, he said if it did so it would probably mean that the banks and other institutions would not contribute a penny. Mr Frank Field (Lab Birkenhead), who chaired the Commons social security committee in the last parliament, agreed that if the government said it would foot the bill, there would be few contributions from other sources. There were cheers from the government benches when Mr Field stressed the strong feeling on both sides of the House that the government should press on in securing contributions from the banks and other financial institutions. Mr Field said: 'We will not be satisfied if, at the end of the day, those contributions are inadequate'. Mr Lilley re-affirmed his belief that the Pounds 2.5m would be adequate to meet the short-term needs of pensioners until a court ruling determined how Pounds 100m assets should be distributed among the various schemes. Scoffing at Mr Meacher's suggestion that if the government repaid the money in full it would be able to secure restitution from the banks, Mr Lilley accused him of referring to an 'army of powers which probably do not exist'. Mr Meacher said: 'There is no question that the government is responsible both in honour and in the particular circumstances of the Maxwell scandal'. Mr Antony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, acknowledged the difficulty in gaining access to Maxwell assets in Liechenstein, but emphasised the 'real prospect' that new international banking regulations would improve the position. A Labour motion calling on the government to provide a more realistic sum than the Pounds 2.5m was defeated by a majority of 53 (315-262).</p>

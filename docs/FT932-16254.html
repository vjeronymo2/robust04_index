			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / E German workers search for voice: Easterners are caught in a union fight with employers A POIGNANT reminder of the tensions underlying the unification of the two Germanies occured yesterday when Mr Erwin Hein, Saxony's regional head of Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, resigned. Mr Hein, an easterner, spent last Sunday afternoon holding talks with Mr Hasso Duval, a westerner and head of the Saxony branch of IG Metall, the engineering union, and Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the premier of Saxony. After several hours of talks in the premier's office in Dresden, they claimed they had reached a compromise aimed at averting an all-out strike over a pay dispute among eastern Germany's metal, electrical and steel industry. But the compromise did not substantially differ from what was agreed between west German employers, east German managers, and IG Metall in March 1991. That contract stipulated that east German wages in the metal, electrical and steel industry would reach west German levels by April 1994. That meant a pay increase of 26 per cent this year for metal and electrical workers, and 21 per cent rise for the steel sector. On Sunday, Mr Hein said the employers agreed to pay the 26 per cent rise, which would bring wages levels to about 82 per cent of western German levels. In return IG Metall agreed to postpone full wage parity by nine months. But Gesamtmetall's headquarters in Cologne said it would stick to its 9 per cent offer, and added that Mr Biedenkopf had already offered a similar deal a fortnight ago, which the employers rejected. The failed attempt to break the deadlock between both sides suggests that IG Metall remains determined to go ahead with strikes in all three sectors by the end of the month. However, this failure to seek a compromise underlines the different aims of the west German employers and unions in east Germany. Gesamtmetall and Arbeitgebverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, whose recent decision to exercise their legal right in pulling out of the 1991 contract is one of the reasons for the planned strikes, say they cannot afford high wages in the east because of the recession. Their main argument, however, is that western companies will not invest in the east if labour costs do not reflect productivity levels. Eastern German wages are about 70 per cent of west German levels, but productivity is 70 per cent below. This means that unit labour costs are about 75 per cent above west German levels. Estimates show that east Germany's wage bill this year will exceed the region's gross domestic product of DM201bn (Pounds 85.1bn) by DM47bn. To counter this argument, IG Metall says migration from east to west Germany will continue unless skilled workers are paid to remain in the east. Economists at the Kiel Institute for World Economy, and the Berlin Institute for Economic Forecasting (DIW), have consistently argued that without pay restraint in the east, economic recovery will not occur. Despite repeated warnings about the cost of high wage claims, both sides in the east German pay dispute now think each has a hidden agenda. IG Metall believes the employers in the west want to use the east as a means of breaking collective wage bargaining, first in the east and later in the west. The employers believe IG Metall is using the east as an attempt to maintain high wage levels, not only in the five new states, but in west Germany as well. Sandwiched between the two sides are 300,000 metal and electrical workers, and 20,000 steel workers, who so far, have not produced political and economic elites or leaders capable of articulating the interests of east Germans. IG Metall officials yesterday nearly admitted as much. 'The easterners interests are clear. They do not want to strike. They want job security first and higher incomes later,' a west German official said. Yet he added, rather cynically, that if they lose their jobs after getting their 26 per cent rise, they will at least get higher unemployment benefit. It is, as one economist said, time for the east Germans to defend their interests.</p>

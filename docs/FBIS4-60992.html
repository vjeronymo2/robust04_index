			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Message "To the Ministry of Defense of the Russian </F> Federation, P. Grachev, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  the Russian Federation, A. Kozyrev, and V. Kazimirov" published  under the rubric "Artsakh": "The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Is  Prepared To Provide for Complete Cease-Fire"]    [Text] The leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, having  accepted the proposal of the Russian Federation and confirming  their readiness for peaceful regulation of the armed conflict  between the Armenian Republic and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic,  agree to provide for a complete cease-fire and to end combat  activities as of 0001 hours on 29 April 1994 in keeping with the  Protocol of 18 February 1994.    Taking into account the absence of observers and the mutual  mistrust of the opposing sides and striving to preclude possible  attempts to take advantage of the temporary respite to prepare  for another large-scale attack and thus, contribute to the  irreversibility of the peace process, the leadership of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic considers it necessary to set in  motion the entire mechanism of the aforementioned Protocol  signed by the parties to the conflict with the participation of  the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.    Only the realization of this complex of envisioned  military-technical measures can guarantee stable termination of  combat activities and create favorable conditions for solving  the political programs.    The leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are prepared to  issue the corresponding orders after the intermediary confirms  the receipt of the identical document from the opposing side.    [Signed] Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic A. Gukasyan    [Signed] Commander of the Army for Defense of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic S. Babayan    Stepanakert, 28 April 1994</p>

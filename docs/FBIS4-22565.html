			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Baranowski: "We'll Just Map Out the Right </F> Course and Everything Will Go Fine.... Some Results of the  Economy's Performance for Two Months"]    [Text] According to the State Committee for Statistics, the  republic's economic situation has worsened. In January and  February, compared with the same period last year, the national  income dropped by 33 percent. The volume of industrial output  stood at 63.5 percent. Mutual indebtedness rose sharply, and  large stocks of unsold goods accumulated. In many enterprises,  indebtedness for shipped goods and stocks exceed monthly and  even two-month volumes of production. As of 1 January, the  volume of finished goods stood at 30.7 percent of all goods  produced in December; as of 1 March, that figure was 47.2  percent of the total in February. As of 1 March, enterprises  were overstocked in the amount of 2.114 billion rubles.    The assembly line producing goods "for the warehouse" is  busier than ever. At the Belshyna Combine, remainders of  finished goods at the beginning of this month amounted to 76.3  percent of the total February volume (almost everything they  produced went to the warehouse); in the Minskbudmateryyaly  Association such goods exceeded that volume by 22.3 percent; in  Palimir the figure was 1.9 percent.    A total of 1,642 enterprises and organizations--21.3 percent  of the total number--started 1994 with losses. In January, total  losses stood at 268.9 billion rubles. Industry's profitability  was 12 percent in January (versus 22 percent in January of last  year). In February, 21 enterprises did not operate at all, and  many only worked part time.    In the two months, the production of consumer goods stood at  70.3 percent, with food accounting for 69.4 percent. Hence,  their availability to the trade declined. Supplies of meat and  meat products in January and February stood at only 49 percent  of last year's level (supplies to inter-state stocks increased  to 131 percent).    Retail trade turnover declined by 52 percent in January and  February. The State Committee for Statistics explains that the  drop in sales of goods in the domestic market is due to  declining production of them, to rising prices, and to the  further decline in people's real income.    The level of real income (income minus obligatory payments  and contributions, taking account of consumer price index  adjustments) in February was 73 percent of last December's  level, which in turn was much lower than the previous year.    According to data of the State Committee for Statistics, the  consumer price index for February was 118.7 percent of  January's; compared to December, prices on goods and services  rose by 1.7 times.    The State Committee for Statistics believes that the main  reason for the higher rates of inflation in recent months is the  rising cost of energy and the increased exchange rate of the  Russian ruble in the Inter-Bank Currency Exchange. At the same  time, the State Committee for Statistics draws the following  categorical conclusion: "The disarray in the financial and  credit system is also due to the unjustified setting of the  exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble compared to the Russian,  which is many times greater than the actual purchasing power of  the Belarusian and Russian rubles" (?!). The Committee says that  it and Russia's State Committee for Statistics ran the  calculation "using a methodology that is most like the one used  in the international comparisons of the UN." What was the  outcome? "On the basis of a comparison of the cost of a standard  array of 97 basic food and nonfood items in the prices of each  of the two countries, a parity of purchasing power was  determined; in September it stood at 1.16 Belarusian rubles  (whereas the currency exchange rate in September was 1.5); in  October it was 1.4 (from 1.5 to 3.0); in November it was 1.72  (6.10 to 4.15); in December, 2.22 (4.15-4.51); in January--2.63  (4.51-4.00); and in February--2.85 (3.95-6.19)."    In other words, the exchange rate is to blame.... All we  have  to do is set the "correct" course and everything will go fine....    It's too bad the market exchange rate, which promptly reacts  to daily realities--and market laws in general as well--is not  susceptible to the methods of the State Committee for Statistics  (by the way, wasn't it the introduction of these methods that  launched the attempt to close the currency exchange?). It's too  bad that the exchange rate is set not by calculations but by the  urgent, momentary, pressing need for Russian rubles  (incidentally, this momentariness has become constant), that it  is influenced by enormous unsecured credit emissions which also  encourage production "for the warehouse," the extremely negative  balance of payments (the indebtedness of the republic's  enterprises to enterprises in other countries as of 1 February  exceeded 487.9 billion rubles. The greatest share of the total  indebtedness--88.9 percent--was owed to Russian enterprises).  Isn't it the reverse? Isn't the current exchange rate a product  of our economic reality? Although actually, it isn't even a  matter of whether the exchange rate is low or high--it's a  matter of its stability, and of course it would be a good idea  to influence that as actively as possible.</p>

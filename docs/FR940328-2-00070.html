			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Liquid effluent sample data for 1982 through September 1993 was reviewed and indicates that the results are a small fraction of the values set forth in 10 CFR part 20, Appendix B, Table II, Column 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CE conducts an environmental sampling program to determine if site operations are impacting the environment. Air, soil, vegetation, surface water, and ground water samples are collected from various locations on or near the plant site. Review of the data for 1982 through September 1993 indicates there is no significant impact to the environment from manufacturing operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A dose assessment was performed to evaluate the impact from site operations to the maximally exposed individual who would be the nearest resident. The maximally exposed individual is located 950 feet (290 m), west-northwest of the plant site. The effective whole body dose for the maximally exposed individual is 3.31E&hyph;02 mrem/year. The critical organ for this exposure would be the lungs, with a dose of 1.90E&hyph;01 mrem/year. The annual dose received by the nearest resident is below the federal dose limits set forth in 10 CFR part 20 and 40 CFR part 190, 500 mrem/year and 25 mrem/year, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Liquid and airborne effluents released to the environment are well below all regulatory limits. Results of the environmental monitoring program have shown that environmental radiation levels are not increasing as a result of site operations. The total whole body dose received by the maximally exposed individual from site operations is well below federal limits. Therefore, the staff concludes that the impact to the environment and to human health and safety from manufacturing nuclear fuel at this site has been minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The alternative to the proposed action would be to deny the license renewal. Not renewing the operating license would cause CE to cease operations and begin decontamination and decommissioning activities at the site. While terminating licensed activities at CE may create a minimal positive effect on the immediate environment, the socioeconomic impact of denying the license would adversely affect the area because CE is one of the largest employers in the area. This alternative would be considered if there were public health and safety issues that could not be resolved to the satisfaction of the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Staff utilized the application dated November 22, 1989, and additional information dated October 11, and December 16, 1991, and December 10, 1993. Staff toured the CE facility on August 18 and 19, 1990. The region III inspector and CE staff were consulted in preparing this document. The staff also contacted personnel from the State of Missouri, Department of Natural Resources, Air Pollution Control Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the renewal of Special Nuclear Material License SNM&hyph;33. On the basis of the assessment, the Commission has concluded that environmental impacts that would be created by the proposed licensing action would not be significant and do not warrant the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. Accordingly, it has been determined that a Finding of No Significant Impact is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Environmental Assessment and the above documents related to this proposed action are available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room at the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, and the Local Public Document Room located at the Jefferson College Library, 1000 Viking Drive, Hillsboro, MO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Opportunity for a Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person whose interest may be affected by the issuance of this renewal may file a request for a hearing.

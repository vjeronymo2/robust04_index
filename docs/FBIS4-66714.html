			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Gandhinagar, March 4. The ruling Congress suffered  a severe setback today as it could win only two Rajya Sabha  seats against the expected three. The voting pattern not only  revealed disunity between the erstwhile JD(G) [Janata  Dal-Gujarat] and the `original' Congress but massive  cross-voting in favour of the Opposition BJP [Bharatiya Janata  Party].    The BJP won the other two seats though it had a strength of  only 67 in the House of 178, enough to get only one. The party  managed 24 `extra' votes and its little known nominee, Mr.  Kanaksinh Mangrola topped the four winners with 49 votes. The  party favourite, Ms. Anandiben Patel got 42 votes and stood  second. Two votes were declared invalid.    The Congress stalwart, Mr. Madhavsinh Solanki retained his  seat with 33 votes and his runner-up, Mr. Raju Parmar maintained  his seat with 28 votes. The third candidate, Mr. J.V. Shah could  get only 25 and lost the battle. With the support of nine  independents and a lone member of the Lok Swaraj Manch, the  Congress strength of 98 had officially got augmented to 108.  <H5>  Jolt to Urmila </H5>   The defeat of Mr. Shah, a hot favourite of the former JD(G)  controlling 66 votes in the CLP [Congress-I Legislature Party],  is considered to be a severe jolt to the claim of Ms. Urmila  Patel, to succeed her late husband, Chimanbhai Patel.    If the talk in the lobby of the Assembly is any indication  in  the light of the poll outcome, then the Congress is in deep  trouble. The JD(G) faction has already served an ultimatum to  the party high command that under no circumstances would they  accept a leader who did not belong to their ranks. On this  point, the two feuding claimants of the faction, the second  being the interim Chief Minister, Mr. Chhabildas Mehta, are  united.    The ruling party has now two options. It should either  dissolve the House and impose President's rule to enable the  party prepare for the general elections, due next winter or just  instal a compromise candidate, winning over a substantial number  of JD(G) legislators promising them tickets.    The BJP is overjoyed. The party had worked overtime to  entice  the disgruntled elements and to particularly win the three votes  of the Janata Dal (VP Singh).    "The Congress with its just 32 votes has bagged two seats  and  the JD(G) with its 66 votes has got nothing," said the party's  poll manager and deputy leader, Mr. Suresh Mehta while stressing  that the Government is now a minority one.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER JAZZ SWINGS FREE IN THE OUTDOORS  </P> <P> On a sweltering summer evening, where else would you want to be than your  friendly neighborhood park?  </P> <P> Imagine it.  </P> <P> Perched on a lawn chair you watch the kids fling linguine at each other while  you work your way through a picnic dinner -- soothed by the sounds of live  jazz.  </P> <P> There are countless opportunities all over San Diego County to hear live jazz  outdoors this summer, for free, generally in public parks, the largest of which  is the TGIF Jazz series, now being presented by the city of Carlsbad arts  office on nine consecutive Friday nights.  </P> <P> Tomorrow night in Coronado, Fattburger kicks off six Saturday evenings of jazz  in the park by the ferry landing. At 6 this evening in Carlsbad's Stagecoach  Park, it's San Diego flutist Holly Hofmann. Sunday at Fashion Valley shopping  center, Yutaka plays his Brazilian-Asian-jazz blend. Sunday afternoon from 2 to  4 p.m., the Chicago Six serves up traditional jazz at the oceanfront Scripps  Park in La Jolla. And the list goes on (please see box).  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the sizable city of  </P> <P> San Diego has a relatively small public jazz program. The county's small towns  outstrip the inner city in summer outdoor jazz.  </P> <P> Not that the city didn't have good intentions. A promising series in the  amphitheater behind the downtown convention center was canceled in June after  only a month of concerts. At their peak, these shows lured up to 1,000 people  to hear top local bands, according to convention center Entertainment  Coordinator Rob Huff.  </P> <P> "With the new fiscal year starting in July, we had budget constraints," Huff  said. "We had to rethink the money we were spending. We've received numerous  letters protesting the cancellation. We'll do it again next year. We're looking  for a sponsor; $40,000 would buy three months of jazz."  </P> <P> Baritone saxophonist Ira B. Liss's Big Band Jazz Machine, who played a  convention center date before the series was scrapped, was hired to produce  Carlsbad's nine concerts on a budget of $6,000, and has assembled a lineup  including flutist Hofmann, guitarist Peter Sprague, Latin/Afro-Cuban jazz band  Afro Rumba and other local talent.  </P> <P> For Liss and other musicians, the summer concerts are something special.  </P> <P> "I think the outdoor concerts are beneficial because they give local musicians  the chance to perform, and they give the public a chance to discover who's out  there without having to go to a night club and pay a cover charge.  </P> <P> "They also offer a valuable cultural experience to a cross section of people,  from children to seniors, and every ethnic and demographic division thereof."  </P> <P> Liss has intentionally slanted the Carlsbad summer series toward groups who  play unique and original jazz rather than what's popular with the masses.  </P> <P> "Not to take away from light jazz groups, because they all play music that is  enjoyable to listen to, but I think it's important to show the general public  that jazz isn't just one type of music that you hear on the radio. Jazz is the  only original American music. It is wide and it has a variety of styles and  takes in many different forms."  </P> <P> Hence, Liss booked groups like Kokopelli, composed of such innovative local  musicians as pianist Joe Garrison, trumpeter Bill Cabellero, saxman Dave  Millard and saxophonist/flutist Turiya. All prefer plenty of room to improvise,  and this can be risky in front of an audience which represents a cross section  of a typical suburban neighborhood.  </P> <P> At last Friday night's concert by Kokopelli at Calavera Hills Park, an audience  of several hundred ranged from those who undoubtedly heard Benny Goodman in his  heyday to others who probably think Madonna is an old lady. Despite the range  of people, the audience appeared to like the Latin beat, applauding after the  solos.  </P> <P> Not only do the free outdoor shows give the masses a chance to experience live  jazz, but the musicians say they enjoy playing outside the dark, smoky night  clubs.  </P> <P> "I'm really sort of a fan of nature, and I like being out there with it," said  North County guitarist Peter Sprague, who will work several outdoor dates this  summer. "The real clincher is if the sound system is good. If so, then it feels  good on-stage and the people love it. And the parks are kind of a holistic  setting -- kids, dogs, people, the elements that come together. Sometimes in  clubs, you have to be dressed up or a certain age to be there."  </P> <P> "My band is especially suited to outdoor gigs," said percussionist Gene (Negro)  Perry, leader of Afro Rumba. "That Latin beat outdoors, the drums -- it's like  a call to the people.  </P> <P> "There's always been three or four outdoor shows here, but as time goes on,  there seem to be more and more. They bring people together. It's a time to  share the love of the music. That's why I especially like the outdoor shows."  </P> <P> </P> <P> What's Ahead for Jazz Fans  </P> <P> If you too are ready for live jazz alfresco, here's a list of some of the  concerts ahead this summer:  </P> <P> Carlsbad TGIF Jazz:  </P> <P> Friday evenings, 6 to 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Stage Coach Park (3420 Camino de los Coches)  </P> <P> * July 20 Holly Hofmann Quartet  </P> <P> * July 27: Tami Thomas &amp; Jazz-Ma-Tazz  </P> <P> * Aug. 3: Peter Sprague Trio  </P> <P> Magee Park (Carlsbad Blvd. and Beech St.)  </P> <P> * Aug. 10: Afro Rumba  </P> <P> * Aug. 17: Coast Highway  </P> <P> * Aug. 24: Big Band Jazz Machine.  </P> <P> Fashion Valley with KIFM:  </P> <P> Sunday afternoons, 1 to 3 p.m.  </P> <P> * July 22: Yutaka  </P> <P> * Aug. 12: Grant Geissman  </P> <P> * Aug. 26: Ottmar Liebert  </P> <P> San Diego Museum of Art Jazz After Work:  </P> <P> On the front steps of the museum in Balboa Park Thursday afternoons, 4:30 to  6:30 p.m.  </P> <P> * Aug. 2: Peter Sprague and Brazil jazz  </P> <P> * Aug. 9: Bob Hamilton Quartet  </P> <P> * Aug. 16: Jimmy Corsaro Quartet with vocalist Sharon Andrews  </P> <P> * Aug. 23: Holly Hofmann Quartet  </P> <P> * Aug. 30: Mundell Lowe Quartet with vocalist Betty Bennett  </P> <P> * September: Thursday night Jazz Under the Stars, series to be announced.  </P> <P> La Jolla Concerts by the Sea:  </P> <P> Scripps Park, next to La Jolla Cove Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m.  </P> <P> * July 22: Chicago Six  </P> <P> * Aug. 5: Danny Hale's All-Star Big Band  </P> <P> * Sept. 2 Mellotones  </P> <P> Balboa Park Twilight Concert Series:  </P> <P> Organ Pavilion Wednesday nights, 6:30 to 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> * Aug. 14: Finest City Jazz Band  </P> <P> * Aug. 23: San Diego Historical Dixieland Banjo Society  </P> <P> * Aug. 29: Jeff Jeffries Night Band  </P> <P> Del Mar Twilight Concert Series:  </P> <P> Powerhouse Park (On Ocean Boulevard at the beach, across from the Amtrak  station)  </P> <P> * July 23: Peter Sprague  </P> <P> * Aug. 6: Burt Turetsky and friends  </P> <P> * Aug. 20: Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham  </P> <P> Lites Out Jazz at the Coronado Ferry Landing:  </P> <P> At the foot of B Avenue in Coronado  </P> <P> * July 21: Fattburger  </P> <P> * July 28: Brian Bromberg  </P> <P> * Aug. 4: Hank Easton's East and West Band  </P> <P> * Aug. 11: Steve Bach  </P> <P> * Aug. 18: Ric Flauding  </P> <P> * Aug. 25: Tony Guerrero  </P> <P> Jazz Is Forever:  </P> <P> Aug. 25, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Outdoor music, culture and art celebration, presented by Project Fix It,  sponsored by the California Lottery  </P> <P> Dennis V.

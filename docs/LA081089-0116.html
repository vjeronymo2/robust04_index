			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The leaders of three Cuban human rights organizations -- arrested earlier this  week -- have been indicted on charges of spreading false news, the official  newspaper Granma reported in Havana. It said they "carried out a campaign of  slander through statements to U.S. television and the anti-Cuban radio . . .  with the aim of discrediting the action of Cuban courts during the trial  against the Ochoa-La Guardia drug traffickers." Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez and  Col. Antonio de la Guardia were convicted and executed last month. The three  rights leaders are: Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission for Human  Rights and National Reconciliation; Hiram Abi Cobas, acting head of the Human  Rights Party of Cuba, and Hubert Jerez, president of the Jose Marti Commission  on Human Rights.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang and Chan Po-chung] </F>   [Text] China's robust economy and sweeping reforms are set  to suffer a setback after a decision to reimpose price limits  and suspend some reform measures that could lead to price rises.  The decision was made recently by the State Council, China's  cabinet, in a bid to ensure a stable environment for the overall  reforms this year. It also underlined the leadership's concern  that mounting inflation that might lead to unrest.    An eight-point package demands that local authorities and  regional price departments step up control and administration of  prices while strictly implementing the central authorities'  policy of setting price ceilings, Chinese sources told The  Hongkong Standard yesterday.    The package, decided by a national emergency meeting on  price  controls following price rises for grain and staple foods late  last month, stipulates that:    Price increases for railway transport and electricity by  localities should not be higher than those previously set by the  State Council. Scheduled reform measures that may send prices  up should be suspended. Subsidies on certain products set by  the central government should not be reduced.    A price limit should be reimposed by regional governments  and  local departments on some daily necessities, staple foods and  major products if prices soar to levels that consumers cannot  stand.    Protection prices for grain purchasing set by the local  government should not be lower than those set by central  government.    Administration of fees for education, medical services and  other government services should be strengthened.    A price information network and a price recording system  should be set up, and regular price reviews should be conducted  by local price departments and results be reported to the State  Council.    Efforts must be made by regional governments and relevant  departments to ensure a stable market during the Lunar New Year  and create a favourable environment for deepening reforms.    The moves appear to roll back many of the sweeping reforms  worked out last year following the Communist Party's decision to  embrace a capitalistic market economy. Local analysts expressed  concern about Beijing's decision but said the impact on Hong  Kong would be limited.    K.L. Wong, an economist at Sun Hung Kai Research, said the  move would affect regions in different ways. "The decision is  quite important to the people in northern China because they  have suffered most from inflation."    Benjamin Chan, senior economist at the Bank of East China,  did not think the moves were major setbacks, saying they were  necessary to stabilise prices. The economists agreed that the  impact of the move on Hong Kong business would be limited.    State-run media and senior Chinese officials have recently  joined a growing chorus in expressing fears that the current  economic reforms may lead to spiralling inflation and social  unrest. Premier Li Peng warned that rapid strides in price  reform would cause instability and the fast pace of freeing  controls in 1994 would continue only as long as consumers could  bear the inevitable inflation. The government reimposed  controls on the price of grain and other staple foods in late  December, after watching them soar 30 to 40 per cent in a month.    Top Chinese economic officials promised yesterday to push  inflation below 10 per cent this year, despite mounting  inflationary pressure. But they warned regional authorities of  the possibility of social instability as a side-effect of  China's economic reforms.    Meanwhile, President Jiang Zemin has called for reasonable  pricing in the consumer market because it affects people's  living standards and social stability, the China Daily reports  in today's issue.</p>

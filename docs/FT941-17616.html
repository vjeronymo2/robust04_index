			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Too cautious by half - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson admits that he missed big profits by not trying anything new in his dealings last year / Diary of a Private Investor The young fox picked up the morsel of meat and took slow, deliberate bites, with an expression rather like that of a small boy forced to eat over-boiled Brussels sprouts. Then, it dropped the chewed meat and looked around for something else. Watching from my study window the other day made me reflect suddenly that, in 1993, my investment decisions had been rather like the fox's behaviour. It lives in a den in the wooded part of my garden, and the meat for which it had shown its distaste had been used in a curry. Despite huge profits which I could have made from investing in emerging markets such as Indonesia, Pakistan and Malaysia, I ignored them completely in 1993 in favour of rather more predictable fare. I had tried nothing really new. At one time, foxes had a reputation for being clever and shrewd. They were fast movers which had to seek out and catch much of their food. They also ran the risk of being hunted and were said to be active mainly at night. Now, many have moved out of the wild and into people's gardens. Housewives look after them by leaving kitchen scraps. Foxes no longer have to get up at dusk to forage for food. In my garden, they can be seen having fun from morning to night. They have a comfortable lifestyle knowing there is plenty to eat. With a plentiful supply of profitable investments, I had no need to be clever or shrewd in 1993. Although I hunted out a number of exciting investment opportunities, I generally avoided putting any money into them - preferring, instead, to sit back and let my existing investments provide regular profits while backing other, well-known companies like Associated British Ports (up from 373p at the start of the year to over 530p in December). My most 'daring' move probably was buying more shares in Lonrho at Pounds 1 each in May, although I believed the price was well-supported by assets. I am not surprised it has now risen to around 130p. Ashanti Goldfields, in which Lonrho has a large shareholding, is expected to be floated soon on the stock market and this should highlight the value in Lonrho - assuming there are no last-minute hiccups or unexpected announcements. In 1993, there were many suppliers of financial information. The FT's free annual report service, detailed on the paper's share price pages, operates 24 hours a day so my 'hunting' hours no longer were confined to the business day. One of the most attractive dishes was set before me at the end of 1992 when stockbroker Neilson Cobbold offered shares in a placing of OIS International at 50p apiece. I sniffed around the placing document for this technical inspection and testing services company and liked what I saw - but then risked only a very modest amount for my personal pension scheme. OIS shares are now around 77p each. I missed one especially tasty dish in January. Early that month, an FT reader overseas noticed I had written about my holding in a small company called Treatt. He wrote to ask if I would be interested in buying a rather large number of its shares from one of his relatives for around Pounds 1 apiece. Unfortunately (for me), by the time the letter arrived - it took nearly three weeks - the share price had risen to 130p. It is now 145p. Although this gives Treatt a market capitalisation of only Pounds 13.8m, I still like the company, which has carved a profitable niche in the flavourings and fragrance industry. But I have not added to my holding. In 1993, I was far too cautious. I did not take the risks that I used to take - such as wild gambles on the Vancouver exchange or large positions in very small UK companies. While I was comfortable, I played safe. None of my investments was shot-at in 1993. I avoided investing in Queens Moat Houses; and although I used to have a holding in property company Mowat (now in receivership), I sold that at a profit in 1989. The worst thing for me was the sharp drop in the share price of Toye &amp; Co. In January, the shares were 165p each but, after dreadful 1992 results, they hit a low of 100p. Fortunately, I had only a very small holding and I sold most of that for 128p in May. Its effect on my portfolio was less than a flea bite. Like a fox, I was very protective of my young children. That is why, as 1993 progressed and interest rates fell, I took most of their money out of low-yielding bank and building society accounts (some of which now pay 1.5 per cent or less) and placed it in more profitable havens. This included opening Young Sovereign accounts with the Skipton building society which will, eventually, reward them with up to 8.5 per cent gross. My wife and I used to hold Pounds 10,000 each in premium bonds, but their performance was even more dismal than in previous years. Up to late November, when I reduced my holding to Pounds 8,000, I had won only five Pounds 50 prizes during the year. But the Ernie computer, continuing to show its sexist nature, allotted my wife seven Pounds 50 prizes. This meant that in every year but one since 1987, my wife had won more money than me. Meanwhile, my two daughters, who each hold less than Pounds 200 worth of bonds, both won Pounds 50. Page 549 of the Teletext service on Channel 4 gives the main bond-winning numbers each week. Noticing that the winners tend not to have holdings that end in three zeros, my wife reduced her holding to Pounds 7,980. So, we hope we will be more successful in 1994. Indeed, in view of the coming changes to bond prizes, we could well review our holdings again.</p>

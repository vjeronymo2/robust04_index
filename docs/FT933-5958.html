			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Close links likely to remain in economic reconstruction - Reversing the decline in occupied territories PALESTINIANS preparing to assume interim self-government in the Israeli-occupied territories will face a huge challenge to reverse the economic decline of the West Bank and Gaza. The economies of Israel and the territories are likely to remain closely linked and Palestinian and Israeli economists believe both could benefit from an influx of international aid and private investment into a Palestinian entity. Opportunities for expanded trade, combined with economic liberalisation and regional integration, could provide the basis for sustainable peace and an economic boom. The economy in the territories, however, is underdeveloped and depressed. Combined gross national product per capita of the 1.7m residents of the West Bank and Gaza in 1991 was Dollars 1,800 - 16 per cent of Israel's Dollars 10,878. Almost a third of the economy of the occupied territories is derived, traditionally, from sales of Palestinian goods and labour into Israel. Agriculture contributes 25 per cent of the economy, absorbs 23 per cent of the labour force and accounts for 60 per cent of exports. Israel's dependence on the territories is small - they contribute less than 3 per cent of Israel's gross national product - a figure that is declining with the substitution of immigrant labourers in the place of Palestinians. The Gaza economy - which will be the initial focus of an expanded Palestinian authority - is much the worst hit with income per head of less than Dollars 850. Gaza, a 360 sq km strip of land, is home to 780,000 Palestinians, many living in sprawling shanty refugee camps. Gaza has also been more severely hit by the five-month closure of the territories which has cut off at least 20,000 migrant labourers and their families from their only source of income - work in Israel. Before the latest closure, the economy was already suffering from a long-term lack of job-creating investment, a restrictive trade regime with Israel and a population growing at 4.7 per cent a year. Unemployment is estimated at 40-50 per cent. Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, will wish to act swiftly to redress growing poverty in Gaza, a breeding ground for Islamic fundamentalism and opposition to the PLO - a goal shared by Israel. Palestinians are putting much faith in a Marshall-style investment plan of several billion dollars over five years. The World Bank has recommended Dollars 1bn over five years, a figure Palestinians and Israelis believe is too small. Israel is backing external investment because the peace process will be made or broken by economic development. Many economists say the costs for the territories of severing economic relationships with Israel would be prohibitively high. Mr Ezra Sadan, a former director-general of the finance ministry, has said: 'If Gaza disconnects from our economy it will become a mini-Bangladesh. It will have a kamikaze economy. I wouldn't like to have a kamikaze as my neighbour.' Furthermore, any economic growth in the territories will help Israel by increasing the demand for Israeli goods and services because Israel will remain the Palestinians' key trading partner. Israel also hopes that economic growth in the territories will create jobs for Palestinians, thereby reducing migrant labour which would in turn free jobs for Israelis suffering from 11 per cent unemployment. However economists have said that the ability of the occupied territories to absorb capital is limited, given the poor infrastructure and administration and the size of the domestic economy. Considerable job-creating investment could be soaked up in a public works programme but industrial development will be much slower. Ambitious Palestinian plans for an airport and port are likely to be uneconomic. Most economists agree that, at least for a five-year period, Israel will continue to have a powerful influence over the shape of Palestinian economic policy, particularly regarding the development of industries which could compete with Israel's protected markets. A recent Harvard University report on economic transition recommended the development of free trade between the Palestinian, Israeli and Jordanian economies as the key to mutual economic growth. It recommended that Palestinians assume leadership and utilise the institutions of Israel's civil administration in the territories, harmonise the tax structure with Israel and introduce the Jordanian dinar as legal tender.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YELTSIN VIEWS VICTORY IN MOSCOW AS CALL FOR SPEEDED-UP REFORMS  </P> <P> Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, savoring his landslide electoral victory,  said today that his success proved a need to speed up Kremlin chief Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's perestroika reform program.  </P> <P> Yeltsin won almost 90% of the vote in a battle against an officially backed  candidate in Moscow in the first contested Soviet general election in 70 years.  </P> <P> In an interview with Reuters, the white-haired former Moscow party boss seemed  to regret that his relationship with Gorbachev had lost its old warmth.  </P> <P> But he said his crushing victory created a need for a "faster choice on  speeding up perestroika."  </P> <P> "I think this has given perestroika a certain urgency and has helped to break  away from our tradition of presenting all that we do in rosy colors," said  Yeltsin, fired from the Moscow party leadership in 1987.  </P> <P> "It is time to call a spade a spade," he added in the blunt manner that has won  him both enemies and admirers.  </P> <P> Yeltsin refused to speculate on his career, apparently wary of reviving charges  that he was driven by overwhelming ambition.  </P> <P> He dismissed charges from the camp of his defeated rival, automobile plant  director Yevgeny Brakov, that his campaign was based on "cheap publicity."  </P></p>

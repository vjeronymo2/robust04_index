			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Russia's rebel parliament turns down deal to surrender arms A DEAL to end the siege of the Russian parliament was rejected yesterday by the rebel deputies. The deal agreed by presidential and parliamentary negotiators would have restored services to the White House in exchange for deputies and their supporters handing in most of their weapons. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, gave a curt television interview in which he insisted that the handing over of weapons was an indispensable precondition to talks. 'It is difficult even to deal with them (the deputies),' he said. Although the White House defenders stayed put, the government has won a propaganda battle in making the parliamentary side appear to be fighting less to defend the constitution than for the right to remain armed. In the White House, where electricity was restored for a few hours this morning before being cut off again, General Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice president named as acting president by the deputies, said that arms would only be 'stored' once the thousands of troops ringing the parliament were removed. Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff and head of his negotiating team, said last night that 'experts' from both sides would meet overnight to discuss measures on disarming the White House. The negotiators would meet again this morning under the aegis of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Alexei II in his headquarters in the Donskoi Monastery in Moscow. Mr Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, said the president's side would insist that all weapons other than those legally held by the parliamentary guard must be stored under seal by officials of the Interior and Security Ministry. He estimated there were more than 2,000 weapons in the White House, including machine guns, grenade launchers and 'so-called missiles'. These weapons were in the hands of 600 paramilitaries who were organised in at least five independent groups. It was not clear, he said, that the parliamentary side would or could negotiate. The original negotiators, Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov and Mr Veniamin Sokolov, chairmen of parliament's two chambers, had agreed the original protocol to disarm - and had been repudiated. A second team, led by Mr Yuri Voronin, a hardline deputy chairman of parliament, had refused to sign any protocol: Mr Filatov said: 'I have the impression that they don't want these talks.' Pro-Yeltsin deputies last night attacked aspects of Mr Yeltsin's proposals to replace the old parliament with a new body. They complained that Mr Yeltsin had not fulfilled the terms of an agreement with them to increase the numbers of deputies to be elected on a party list system to the State Duma - the lower house of the proposed new federal assembly.</p>

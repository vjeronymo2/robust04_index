			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Healthy demand seen for Dutch guilder-denominated paper ABN Amro Bank, the Netherlands' largest bank, and Nederlandse Gasunie, the Dutch gas company, tapped the guilder sector of the international bond market yesterday with issues amounting to Fl 650m, following close on the heels of a Fl 400m deal by the Kingdom of Sweden on Tuesday. While activity remained fairly subdued, syndicate officials were optimistic that the Republic of Italy might tap the international bond market soon, following the general election outcome. Mr Alberto Giovannini, head of the Italian Treasury's international borrowing programme, said yesterday there were no plans to launch an international bond issue in the immediate future. He pointed out that the market background has been 'very unwelcoming' recently, but added that Italy has been looking at the possibility of doing a bond issue at some stage. Italy's foreign currency borrowing is expected to be between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn in 1994, of which about Dollars 3bn equivalent has already been achieved. In the guilder sector of the market, syndicate officials claimed there was fairly healthy demand for guilder-denominated paper, despite the recent volatility in the bond markets which has kept many borrowers away. Dutch government bonds, which have tended to yield less than German government paper, are currently yielding more than their German counterparts as the Dutch market has reacted badly to recent inflation figures. However, syndicate officials claim some investors are taking the view that there is scope for Dutch paper to trade through German bonds again, and that the market will pick up as and when the Bundesbank eases. ABN Amro's self-led Fl 500m bond issue has a six-year maturity, a coupon of 6.375 per cent and yields 25 basis points over the government paper. The bonds were mainly pre-placed with domestic institutions, according to the bank, and they traded at around 99.55 to 99.65, above the reoffer price. Nederlandse Gasunie's Fl 150m, five-year deal was aimed mainly at retail investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries who are attracted by the triple A rating. The bonds were priced to yield 8 basis points over government bonds and traded at 99.35 - 99.45 by late afternoon. Royal Bank of Scotland announced that it has raised Dollars 200m from US retail investors with an issue of perpetual notes exchangeable into preference shares. The bank issued 8m Exchangeable Capital Securities of Dollars 25 each with a coupon of 8.5 per cent. The notes count as upper tier two capital. Nomura's securitisation subsidiary has launched a Dollars 410m issue backed by US commercial mortgages, writes Antonia Sharpe in London. Of the total issue, Dollars 353m will be sold through a public offering and the remainder through a private placement. Thirty-three per cent of the issue is secured on loans on hotels and 67 per cent on retail properties. Around 60 per cent of the multi-tranche deal is rated triple A. Maturities go up to 20 years and payment on the deal is due April 15.</p>

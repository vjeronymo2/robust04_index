			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Ritzaus Bureau report: ``Salmonella Thriving''] </F>   [Text] There is far more salmonella in Danish processed  pork products than in comparable Swedish products.    This can be seen from a comparison between the Agriculture  Ministry's analysis of salmonella in processed products from  slaughterhouses and the Danish Slaughterhouse Associations' own  study of salmonella in Swedish pork.    The Nordic Council has set a limit of 5 percent on the  content of salmonella in samples from slaughterhouses. At the  annual meeting of the National Committee on Swine yesterday the  chairman of the Danish Slaughterhouse Association, Bent Sloth,  revealed that the Danish slaughterhouse average is 2.7 percent.    On Friday the slaughterhouse group will meet with  Agriculture  Minister Bjorn Westh (Social Democrat) to discuss an action plan  to combat salmonella.</p>

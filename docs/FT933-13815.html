			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Lloyds Theatre Challenge Like babies to the font, the three severely disabled youths were carried reverentially to the front of the stage and laid on cushions. They were dressed in kimonos and greeted with oriental music. Their attendants wafted Japanese fans over them; the youths stared wide-eyed with joy. One screeched his pleasure. There was nothing patronising about the tableau: it was one of the most moving examples of reverence for life observed on a stage. And this was no prefabricated platform in a community arts centre. This was the Olivier at the National Theatre in London. The participants came from the Harlow College Community Arts group, which involves more than 30 under-19-year-olds, ranging from the able bodied to the most afflicted. They were presenting Tower of Dreams, which through music, movement, and spectacle, makes the case for the disabled to be allowed on to the raft of life, represented as a fairground carousel. It was part of the 1993 Lloyds Bank Theatre Challenge, the last such Challenge. After five years and Pounds 1.2m, this investment in youth theatre has ended. However, the National is already planning another programme involving youth and is seeking a sponsor. A great attraction of the Challenge is that the 10 groups which this year caught the judge's eye from over 250 entries get the chance to strut for an hour on the UK's most prestigious stage. The three-night festival lets an audience see not so much new acting talent as the issues that excite youth. Rather than take a received text, most of the contributions this year were devised within the companies. It is an inspiring experience and one which dispels doubts about the importance of theatre in education. Of course there is an abundance of youthful worthiness and idealism on display, but also a great deal of fun. The level of acting assurance is amazing, almost frighteningly so. At the opening night on Tuesday the Harlow spectacle contrasted with the contributions of Redbridge College Performance Art Group and Burnley Youth Theatre which were both built around issues. There is something galvanising about plays involving teenagers which are devised and performed by teenagers: the language is so much more credible than the second-hand observations of older 'realist' playwrights. Both works were loosely structured, with ideas running way beyond anything so obvious as a plot, and they were inevitably a bit didactic. But from Burnley, along with frighteningly confident performances, there was wit and good nature and the ability to take a serious issue, contraception, light heartedly. There was even room for romance, even if did lead to divorce. Redbridge was an ensemble work, using mime and music to put over the dispiriting message than men are bastards. Perhaps the girls do not really believe it; perhaps they have been watching too much television. But it was enthusiastically performed and had the saddest of endings. Sandy Toksvig, the evening's presenter, announced that this would be Redbridge's last performance. It was the victim of local authority spending cuts, an unwelcome reminder of cruel and blinkered reality on an uplifting evening.</p>

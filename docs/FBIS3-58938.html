The advanced  party of almost 1,000 technicians from former Yugoslavia are  repairing old machinery in the Libyan desert, building  factories, and carrying out maintenance work on Libyan bombers.  However, Saleh Ferjani, head of Libyan Arab Airlines, has  grander plans. The manager is thinking of forming a  Serbian-Libyan air company, as well as a joint fleet, and of  closer military cooperation.    Leader of the revolution Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi is pleased with  the cooperation. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is fond of  recalling the historic friendship between the two peoples -- an  axis is being established between the two pariahs of the  international community. Both regimes are internationally  disdained: That is the case with Belgrade, because of its  aggression in the Balkans and with Tripoli, because of its  support for Arab terrorist organizations.    Because unlike Libya, rump Yugoslavia has lost its UN seat,  it does not feel bound by the Security Council's sanctions  catalogue and can at least conduct trade freely in one  direction. Belgrade has found a useful loophole: Serbian  companies are investing millions, flight capital from arms sales  and smuggling is flowing into Colonel Qadhdhafi's country.    From Libya, Serbian trading activities are being extended to  other countries in the Middle East and the entire world: from  Cairo to Nicosia and via New York and Ottawa, as far as the  Caribbean Cayman Islands. Succeeding the largest Yugoslav  foreign trade concern, General-Export, which was dissolved in  1989, the Serbian syndicate now operates under the name of Genex.    Acting in a manner that is a combination of gangsterism and  secret service activities, 45 department heads and 200 former  Communist Party functionaries are organizing the worldwide  transfer of booty from the war in Bosnia and the laundering of  money from criminal business transactions -- it is the main  lifeline for the regime of Greater Serbian warlord Slobodan  Milosevic.    "Only this network of deals permits the financing of the war  in Bosnia," reports a Belgrade agent who is tired of taking  risks, "the secret reserves have been used up and the economy is  on its knees."    There is no doubt that the Serbian military apparatus  consumes huge sums every month, the domestic defense industry  lacks spare parts as well as electronic logistics, and the  generals also are becoming increasingly worried about troop  morale. With earnings of under $10 a month, there are fewer and  fewer troops going to war voluntarily.    Since the beginning of the year, most wages in Milosevic's  poor house are being paid out in goods. Wage packets usually  consists of 10 kilos of potatoes, as well as bread and milk  coupons -- four-fifths of families live below the official  poverty line. Inflation, which reached the surreal level of 1  million percent in December, has eliminated the last savings  that people had.    Milosevic was aware of what was happening at the beginning  of  the war: In view of the UN sanctions, the regime could only  survive on dollars earned abroad through trade. Above all, Arab  states that were founders of the nonaligned movement along with  Tito's communist Yugoslavia, became important centers of  activity for the Serbian leader. "We are running around there,  the way the Italians used to in Chicago," says the Genex  dissident.    One important Genex center is on Cairo's Nile island Gasira.  Retired Colonel D. Dragan Petronjevic, who represents the  import-export company Direkcija za Robe Rezerve, a company that  deals solely in parts for defense machinery lives there in a  luxurious residence.    Vladimir Jovanovic, military attache at rump Yugoslavia's  Cairo embassy, is behind all the deals and transfers money to  accounts in the Greek part of Cyprus. There, his aide, Miodrag  Savicevic, who only recently turned his back on Milan, his home  town of choice, because of the general anticorruption drive in  Italy, sees to the laundering of money and looks for new  investment possibilities in the Middle East.    Some of the assets also flow into dozens of Belgrade trading  company branches that have addresses on the Mediterranean  island. The jungle of about 500 Serbian subsidiaries is  coordinated by Vladimir Delic, Petronjevic's predecessor in  Cairo, who also looks after the construction of retirement homes  and refuges for a select few: Thus, Serbian Tsar Slobodan  Milosevic has bought a luxurious villa close to Larnaka where  members of his clan already reside, protected by an army of  bodyguards.    However, the days when these Balkan friends could conduct  large-scale business deals on Aphrodite's island without  attracting attention are over.    The Cypriot Government increasingly is coming under pressure  from the European Union and the United States to investigate the  rapid growth of these branches of companies and to uncover the  illegal machinations of the gangster cartels.    The World Bank estimates that, in the past three years  alone,  $20 billion have been transferred from states formerly belonging  to the Soviet Union via Cyprus, a further $10 billion came from  East Europe, and possibly as much as $5 billion from Serbia.  Genex bosses already talk of Cyprus being a "financial parking  place" that should be used, but with caution. That is because  there are agents of all political colors there, from the CIA to  pro-Bosnian Arab circles.    That does not discourage Israeli arms dealers from also  getting involved in Serbian business on the island. Jezdimir  Vasiljevic, a Belgrade banker resident in Tel Aviv, has been  running a lucrative deal benefiting both sides for over a year.  Jewish firms have received prospecting rights for several gold  mines in Serbia, and, in return, the Israelis are providing  electronic equipment for military purposes. The bank accounts  are being administered by Daniel Roman, president of the  Serbian-Jewish Friendship Society based in the Cypriot capital  Nicosia.    Sofia, Bucharest, and Budapest also serve as centers for  such  activity. Genex trade representatives used the Bulgarian  capital to arrange the purchase of Russian T-55 tanks worth $360  million, forged documents in Bucharest for the transportation of  goods via the Danube, and in Budapest, they negotiated a long  term contract, one that will extend until the year 2013, for the  supply of 3.3 billion cubic meters of Siberian natural gas at a  price of $270 million.    However, the Genex traders nevertheless prefer business in  the Arab world. It is easier to pull things off there and the  profits are better. Thus, the weapons dealer Bekir Trhulij  (whose nickname is Georgy) outbid the Russian and Slovakian  competition to obtain handguns worth $290 million from the  Lebanese Kataib Christian militia.    Military equipment can be sold at a high price to buyers in  Latin America and black Africa -- some items get back to the old  country by way of the Danube. There was a second coup a few  weeks ago: Along with his friend Copa Babic, nicknamed Peg Leg,  Georgy supplied electronic equipment manufactured in Serbia  under U.S. and Swiss licenses, worth $100 million to Saudi  Arabia.    During the Gulf War, he supplied 40 M-84 tanks, based on the  Russian T-84, to the Saudis and thus gained their confidence.    Through Riyad, he has thus been able to set up arms deals in  all the regions of the world. That was at a time when official  Belgrade was helping out Iraqi leader Sadam Husayn with the same  equipment: It was a double game that the Iraqi leader still  holds against his Serbian friends.    Relations between the two nonaligned states are strained.  The visit that Zivota Panic, the former head of the general  staff, paid in March of last year did not produce the  fundamental change that had been hoped for.    The Iraqis maintained their reserve vis-a-vis Belgrade, and  Milosevic's wish to acquire Scud missiles and the know-how for  long-range missile systems remained unfulfilled. Only by  acquiring such weapons would Milosevic have been in a clear  position to win the war in Bosnia -- Colonel Qadhdhafi in the  role of mediator is Belgrade's new hope now.    Time is running out. Research carried out by U.S. secret  services indicates that Bosnian Muslims, Croats, and Albanians  are trying to develop international criminal syndicates.    Milosevic's opponent in the war, Alija Izetbegovic, is  organizing the supply of weapons through Pakistan, Malaysia, and  the Algerian military government with apparent success. That,  at least, is what the Muslim president has been suggesting.    Over the last few weeks, his troops stopped the Serbian  advance and gained substantial territory from the Croats.  Izetbegovic's optimism provides some puzzles: "We will shortly  succeed in beating back the Serbs on all fronts and regain the  territories inhabited by Muslims."</p>

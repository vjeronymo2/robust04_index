			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Steel industry changes may see stockholders sold RESTRUCTURING Europe's recession-torn steel industry could have important knock-on effects as mills dispose of stockholding subsidiaries to concentrate their cash on steelmaking, according to a report. The shake-out could produce some 'interesting opportunities' for the financially stronger mills, since there are good reasons to integrate downstream into stockholding, says the study by London-based CRU International. Almost all European mills have expanded into stockholding - many during the late 1980s, when profits from steel production were high. British Steel also has stockholding interests in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Spain and Norway. Usinor-Sacilor, meanwhile, has bought stockholders in nine European countries outside France where it is based. Some mills have acquired stockholders to gain market share. But CRU says that the most compelling reason for integration between a steel mill and a stockholder is that it adds to the mill's processing capacity. The capital spending needed for additional processing facilities could introduce a valuable barrier to entry into a business where barriers are now low, says CRU. This could cause two types of stockholders to emerge. Larger companies, often owned by steel mills, will tend to specialise in the product range of their parent companies, and will increasingly focus on processing steel. These companies may have better profit margins than the second category of general stockholders, which do little or no processing. But takeovers may be more frequent in this category, because asset values have been depressed by the recession or owners have come under financial pressure. Steel Distribution in Western Europe.

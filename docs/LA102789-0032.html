			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> UAL Corp.: The parent of United Airlines said third-quarter earnings fell  nearly 40% because of costs related to recent takeover activity. The company  said the decline in earnings to $111 million was also because of higher  gasoline costs and commissions to travel agents. Revenue in the third quarter  rose 7% to $2.6 billion. UAL said takeover activity doubled its share price and  increased the value of stock options, resulting in a non-cash expense of $35.5  million.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> DALTON SHINES IN GLENDALE'S SEASON OF GLOOM  </P> <P> The Glendale High girls' basketball team might be in the process of rebuilding,  but sophomore Jenny Dalton continues to play like an experienced veteran.  </P> <P> Dalton, 5-foot-8, is the only returning starter from last year's team that was  18-6 overall, 7-3 in Pacific League play and made it to the second round of the  Southern Section playoffs before losing to Morningside.  </P> <P> This season, Glendale is 6-11 and 1-6. The Dynamiters start two sophomores and  three freshmen.  </P> <P> Dalton averaged eight points and 10 assists as a guard in 1989. This season she  has played guard, forward and center and is averaging 16 points and 16  rebounds.  </P> <P> "She's been our whole offense," Glendale Coach Paul Broneer said. "With the  experience the other players are getting this season, we should be right there  next year."  </P> <P> Future shock: Crescenta Valley is another girls' team waiting for next year.  </P> <P> With three games left, including today's game against powerful Pasadena, the  Falcons are 0-17 overall and 0-7 in league play.  </P> <P> First-year Coach Scott Sisson said his players are still goal-oriented.  </P> <P> "We sat down last week and decided the big future goal is just to win a game so  there is a bright note at the end of the rainbow," Sisson said.  </P> <P> The Falcons will get their chance next week when they conclude their schedule  with Glendale and Arcadia.  </P> <P> Winnin' times: While its girls' team struggles, the Crescenta Valley boys'  varsity is rolling along as usual.  </P> <P> When the Falcons defeated Arcadia on Jan. 19, they assured themselves of the  27th winning season in the school's 28-year history.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley's only losing season was in 1982, when the Falcons finished  9-14.  </P> <P> John Goffredo, in his 12th season, and Ed Goorjian are the only coaches the  school has had.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley (13-7, 5-2 in Pacific League play) meets league-leading  Pasadena (7-0) tonight at home.  </P> <P> Heading for a title: The La Canada High boys' soccer team, 15-1-1 overall and  6-0 in Rio Hondo League play, is on track to repeat as champion of the Southern  Section 1-A Division.  </P> <P> The Spartans, under co-coaches Louie Bilowitz and Afshin Ghotbi, lost 12  seniors from last year's team, including David Quesada, the 1-A Offensive  Player of the Year.  </P> <P> La Canada is led by returning All-Southern Section sweeper Ross Allan, who has  scored 18 goals.  </P> <P> On track: Rick Provenzano of Glendale College qualified for The Times/Eagle  Indoor Meet on Feb. 16 at the Forum by placing second in the 800 meters last  Saturday in a meet at USC.  </P> <P> Provenzano's time of 1 minute, 53.55 seconds was just off his personal best  (1:52.54), set last May at Arcadia High.  </P> <P> By participating in The Times meet, Provenzano will miss Glendale's opener  against West Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, which is also scheduled for Feb.  16.  </P> <P> Kirby Lee contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

Section 112 of the Act specifies that the MACT floor for new sources shall be no less stringent than the level of control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source. The Committee determined the MACT floor for new sources using an approach similar to that for existing sources; that is, one that represents the multiple industry segments within the source category. For new sources, the MACT floor was calculated by determining the HAP limit of the best performing source in each industry segment that comprised the existing source MACT floor (kitchen cabinets, residential furniture, radio/TV cabinets, office furniture). Then, a weighted average (weighted by the relative coating usage of each industry segment) was calculated to determine the HAP limit for new sources. This HAP limit was calculated to be 0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids (0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied, and is the MACT floor for new sources for all industry segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT Floor for Gluing Operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards would only regulate the HAP content of contact adhesives. Hot melts are not sources of HAP emissions, there are no lower emitting alternatives for PVA adhesives, and regulation of formaldehyde based adhesives is being deferred to later rulemaking. As discussed in section II, contact adhesives are used primarily for laminating and for upholstery operations. Contact adhesives used for upholstery operations are also referred to as foam adhesives. The emission limit for contact adhesives is expressed as a HAP limit, in pounds of VHAP per pound of solids, as applied. The MACT floor for contact adhesives was determined as an average (equivalent to the mean) of the HAP limit achieved by the best performing 12 percent of contact adhesives used by major sources in quantities greater than 200 gallons per year; this limit was calculated as 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids (1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied. The HAP limit for each contact adhesive was determined from data provided by the adhesive supplier for each major source in the EPA's data base using contact adhesives. The HAP limit for the lowest emitting contact adhesive is 0.2 lb VHAP/lb solids, as applied. Thus, the MACT floor for contact adhesives used by new sources is a HAP content of no more than 0.2 lb HAP/lb solids (0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Selection of MACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee proposed that MACT for finishing operations should be set at the same level as the MACT floor. This proposal was supported by review of the data on which the MACT floor is based. The Committee determined that HAP emission limits substantially lower than the MACT floor were not being met, nor could they be met by most facilities in the industry segments comprising the MACT floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that most sources will comply with the proposed standards by reformulating existing coatings. Control devices are not widely used by sources covered by the proposed rule to control emissions from finishing operations. In addition, State rules do not require this level of control, and the Committee did not favor a proposal that would mandate the use of control devices. Thus, more stringent control could only be achieved in most cases by the exclusive use of coatings with a very low- or zero-HAP content. Currently, finishing materials with a very low or zero-HAP content have not been demonstrated to be feasible for all industry segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another factor that the Committee evaluated in selecting MACT was the impact of the proposed rule when the work practice standards are considered. These standards will result in additional reduction in HAP emissions. Because numerical limits are not assigned to all work practice standards, the total reduction in emissions that results from implementing such standards is not quantified. Given that an emission limit more stringent than the MACT floor could not be achieved by all segments of the industry and the fact that work practices will further reduce HAP emissions, the Committee favored setting the finishing material emission limits based on the MACT floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In selecting MACT, the industry members of the Committee raised the possibility that EPA might, at some future time, conduct rulemaking activities to expand or reduce the current HAP list. The emission limits calculated for the wood furniture NESHAP were based on the list of 189 hazardous air pollutants published in the 1990 Clean Air Act and were not intended to apply to any changes that may be made to the list in the future. In the event the list is changed, either by the addition or deletion of VHAP, the Committee recommended that EPA re-examine the wood furniture emission limits and determine whether it should be adjusted to account for the change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

His remark came in an interview with the  Britith Sky Television network screened last night. The  disagreements between the PLO and Israel should not stand in the  way of implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord, 'Arafat stated. It  is an international document the signing of which was witnessed  by the cosponsors of the Middle East peace process, President  Bill Clinton, and the whole world, he noted.</p>

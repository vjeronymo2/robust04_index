			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- More than 200 experts  from both at home and abroad will meet in Beijing in May to  discuss issues concerning the protection of intellectual  property rights [IPR], announced Zhao Damou, chairman of the  board of the Zhongcheng Intellectual Property Right Protection  Service Co. Ltd. here today.    The symposium will be co-sponsored by the China Intellectual  Property Right Society, the China Copyright Society and the  Zhongcheng Intellectual Property Right Protection Service Co.  Ltd.    The representatives will come from the U.S.A., Japan, the  Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and some European countries.    Cai Cheng, chairman of the organizing committee of the  meeting and member of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress, said that China has improved its own legal  system regarding intellectual property right protection and has  brought it into line with international practice.    He said that if an overseas company found its intellectual  property rights infringed upon, it could file a complaint with a  Chinese court in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations,  Cai said.    He said that China has attracted more investors by the  strength of its open policy and reform process.    "In order to maintain the legal rights and interests of  overseas investors and other intellectual property rights  owners," Cai said, "the Chinese Government has promulgated a  series of laws, regulations and rules."    China adopted the Copyright Law in 1991, enforced the new  Patent Law at the beginning of last year, and passed the Law on  Trademarks in March of last year.    China has also opened special courts in Shenzhen, Beijing  and  Shanghai cities and Hainan and Fujian Provinces, to handle cases  involving intellectual property rights.    Moreover, China has acceded to the world intellectual  property right organization as well as a series of multilateral  accords, including the Paris pact on industrial property right  protection, the Madrid agreement concerning the international  registration of trademarks, the patent cooperation treaty, and  the Bern Convention for the protection of literary and artistic  works.</p>

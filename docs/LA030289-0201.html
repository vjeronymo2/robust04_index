			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> BRONCO WOMEN FAVORED IN BASKETBALL TOURNEY  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona's women's basketball team has yet to lose a game in the three  years that the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Tournament has been played,  and the Broncos are the top seed again when competition starts tonight at Poly  Pavilion in Pomona.  </P> <P> The Broncos, 22-5 overall record and ranked No. 2 nationally in NCAA Division  II, will face fourth-seeded Cal State Los Angeles (17-11) in their first-round  game at 8 after second-seeded and 17th-ranked Cal State Northridge (20-7) meets  Chapman (13-12) at 6.  </P> <P> First-round winners will meet for the championship at 6 p.m. Saturday at  Riverside Community College.  </P> <P> It is the second time in less than a week that Pomona has faced Cal State L.A..  The Broncos rolled to a 90-59 victory over the Golden Eagles in the  regular-season finale last Friday.  </P> <P> The one-sided win couldn't have come at a better time for Pomona, which had  suffered its first -- and only -- conference loss to Northridge (67-61) earlier  in the week. Pomona finished 11-1 in the CCAA.  </P> <P> "(That) game was a good springboard for us going into the playoffs," Coach  Darlene May said. "It's always better going in with a win than a loss and if we  continue to play like that, we have a good shot the rest of the way."  </P> <P> Pomona has been led by its All-American tandem of junior center Niki Bracken  (6-2), who averages a team-high 18.5 points and 8.8 rebounds, and senior guard  Cathy Gooden (5-5), who is averaging 15.9 points and a team-high 5.4 assists.  </P> <P> Another standout in the game against Cal State L.A. was senior forward Susan  Luckinbill (5-9), who grabbed a career-high 20 rebounds and is averaging 9.2  points and 5.5 rebounds for the season. The Broncos also start sophomores  Stephanie Coons (5-10) at forward and Carrie Egan (5-8) at guard.  </P> <P> In Cal State L.A., the Broncos will face a team that has an outstanding front  line including center Lupe Quintana. The 6-0 senior, the leading rebounder in  CCAA history, averaging 11.3 rebounds and 14.5 points.  </P> <P> The Golden Eagles, who finished at 7-5 in the CCAA, including two losses to  Pomona, have other standouts in 6-0 junior forwards Tina Slatinsky and Trisha  Maly. Slatinsky averages 12.8 points and 6.6 rebounds and Maly 10.4 points.  </P> <P> After playing impressively in non-conference games, the Cal Poly Pomona women's  softball team opens its Big West Conference season with doubleheaders against  the University of Hawaii at 1:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday in Pomona.  </P> <P> The Broncos, who had a 57-16 record and finished third in the NCAA Division I  World Series last year, lost many of their top players to graduation but have  won 10 of 12 games.  </P> <P> Pomona returns outstanding pitchers Nicky Luce and Lori Thompson and All-Big  West Conference catcher Denise Correa. Luce batted .304 with 4 home runs and 26  runs batted in last season, Luce was 25-8 with 13 shutouts and an 0.67  earned-run average, and Thompson was 9-3 with an 0.81 ERA.  </P> <P> The Broncos have also flourished behind the play of two freshman infielders,  shortstop Shellie McCall and second baseman Kathy Twisselman. McCall, an  All-CIF player at Corona High last season, is the team's leading hitter at  .333.  </P> <P> Pomona's infield has also benefited from the addition of third baseman Heather  DeLuca, who started in right field last year.  </P> <P> The Broncos are fresh from a 7-0 finish in round-robin play at the Arizona  State Tournament last week. The unranked Broncos defeated four teams rated in  the Division I top 20: No. 10 Iowa State, No. 11 Minnesota, No. 16 Arizona  State and No. 17 Pacific.  </P> <P> They will face a Hawaii team that was 30-29 last season but has struggled to a  2-7 record in nonconference play. The Rainbow Wahines are led by pitcher Cindy  Schneller, who also is the team's top hitter at .357.  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona and UC Riverside, baseball teams that were expected to be among  the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. favorites this season but are having  slow starts, will meet in conference games Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> They will play at 2:30 p.m. Friday at Pomona and 1 p.m. Saturday at Riverside.  Pomona also hosts Keio University of Japan in an game at 2:30 p.m. today.  </P> <P> Pomona entered the week at 1-2 in the CCAA and 2-11 overall while Riverside was  0-3 in the conference and 4-10 overall. But both are ranked in the NCAA  Division II top 20 by Baseball America magazine, largely because the losses  have come mostly against Division I opponents.  </P> <P> Riverside, which finished second in the CCAA last season, is ranked 18th and  Pomona, which won the conference a year ago, is No. 19.  </P></p>

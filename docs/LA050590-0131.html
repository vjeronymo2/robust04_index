			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> JOBLESS REPORT TRIGGERS RALLY IN BOND PRICES  </P> <P> A weak employment report triggered a furious rally Friday in the bond market,  sending interest rates sharply lower.  </P> <P> The bond buying binge offered a marked contrast to the gloom that depressed the  market for much of April, hammering bond prices and pushing long-term interest  rates above 9% for the first time since last May.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 1 5/8 points, or $16.25 for every  $1,000 face amount, in one of the year's biggest rallies.  </P> <P> Its yield tumbled to 8.81% from 8.97% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Analysts said the government's report that the unemployment rate rose to 5.4%  in April was the catalyst for the big price rally.  </P> <P> What caught most bond traders' interest was the report of a measly net gain of  64,000 nonfarm jobs in April, well below what analysts had expected.  </P> <P> Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;  Jenrette Securities Corp., said that if the addition of 78,000 temporary census  workers were excluded from the numbers, jobs would have fallen by 14,000 last  month. He said analysts had expected an increase of 150,000 jobs, not counting  the census workers.  </P> <P> In addition, he said wage inflation was up 0.3% in April, when many analysts  were expecting 0.5% growth, partly because of the April 1 boost in the minimum  wage. But the increase had minimal impact on overall wage growth, officials  indicated.  </P> <P> "This report indicates a lot of weakness in the economy. People had thought the  economy was stronger, with a much deeper inflation problem," Platt said.  </P> <P> The bond market benefits from slow economic growth and low inflation because  credit demand generally falls off during sluggish periods and allows interest  rates to decline.  </P> <P> Rising inflation and rapid growth, on the other hand, erode the value of  fixed-income securities such as notes and bonds and could prompt the Federal  Reserve to encourage higher interest rates.  </P> <P> "There is nothing the bond market likes better than bad news," said Robert  Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities International.  </P> <P> He said the bond market had overreacted during the past few months to  indications that the economy was growing rapidly and inflation was  accelerating.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks charge each other on  overnight loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from late Thursday.  </P></p>

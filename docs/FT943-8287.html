			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Decline in unemployment continues to slow The 11,800 fall in seasonally adjusted unemployment in July - the smallest decrease in six months - may indicate that the rate of decline is slowing. Although the fall in July was the sixth successive monthly decline, according to the Department of Employment, the size of the change has been steadily dwindling since April's fall of 37,800. City analysts had expected an 18,000 fall in July. The seasonally adjusted unemployment total is 2.632m - 9.3 per cent of the workforce. Unadjusted, the total rose 57,531 to 2.643m. Unadjusted unemployment normally rises in the summer as young people leave education and join the workforce. The employment data also show that the number of long-term unemployed is at last starting to decline. The number of those out of work for more than a year fell 41,300 between April and July to reach 1.004m, the lowest since October 1992. Those out of work for more than six months fell 91,300 to 1.511m. Early results from the government's spring Labour Force Survey - which covers the period from March to May - were released yesterday. The survey found that employment rose 80,000 between the winter and the spring, with male employment rising 58,000 and female employment 22,000. The increase in employment was more than accounted for by part-time jobs which rose 86,000. Full-time employment fell 8,000. Using the International Labour Office definition of unemployment, an internationally accepted standard, the survey found that the jobless total fell 79,000 between winter and spring. Unemployment on this definition was 61,000 higher than the average official claimant count over the same period. The number of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres rose 4,000 in July, on a seasonally adjusted basis, to reach 157,000, the highest since September 1990. The number of new vacancies notified to Jobcentres fell slightly to 206,100 last month, from 209,700 in June. Unemployment fell in all regions in July, except Scotland and the north of England. Male unemployment fell in every region apart from Scotland while female unemployment rose in every region except East Anglia and the south-west. Overall, 12.6 per cent of males and 5.1 per cent of females are unemployed and claiming benefit. There was a fall between April and July in unemployment across all age groups, except those aged between 20 and 24. The number of manufacturing employees fell 9,000 in June to 4.229m. Over the year to June employment in manufacturing fell 41,000. The Department of Employment pointed out that there had been only four annual rises in manufacturing employment in the past 23 years. Overtime hours worked in manufacturing jumped from a revised 8.65m in May to 9.39m in June. Hours lost through short-time working fell slightly from a revised 0.25m to 0.24m in the same period. Output per head, the measure of productivity in manufacturing, was 4.3 per cent higher in the three months to June than in the same period last year. The effect of the signal workers' strike pushed up the number of working days lost through industrial stoppages to 70,000 in June from 31,000 in May. Nevertheless, the 170 stoppages in the 12 months to June were the lowest figure recorded since 1920. Regional percentage unemployment figures in July were: south-east 9.1; Greater London 10.7; East Anglia 7.2; south-west 8.4; west Midlands 9.5; east Midlands 8.8; Yorks/Humberside 9.5; north-west 9.7; north 11.3; Wales 9.6; Scotland 9.3.</p>

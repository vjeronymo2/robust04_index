			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): A persuasive case for US reform REVIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM by Alice M Rivlin The Brookings Institution Dollars 15.95 190 pages THERE IS no shortage of books and pamphlets arguing the case for US domestic reforms. What makes Alice Rivlin's contribution unique and timely is her focus on different levels of US government. She argues convincingly that social and economic problems are likely to be solved only if far more careful attention is paid to the division of responsibilities between federal and state government. The American dream of rapidly rising prosperity has faded primarily because the growth of labour productivity has slowed sharply in the past two decades. With output per worker no longer growing quickly, real wages and the living standards of many families have stagnated. Ms Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, argues that the federal government should focus mainly on macroeconomic tasks. The most important is to eliminate the huge budget deficits that absorb the greater part of the savings of individuals and companies. Indeed, ideally the federal government should generate regular surpluses. What Washington should not be asked to do is oversee the microeconomic reforms that are so badly needed if workers are to use capital more efficiently. She argues that state governments - rather than distant bureaucrats in Washington - should assume full responsibility for running programmes designed to improve labour productivity. The 'productivity agenda' would include the reform of education, the creation of new job training programmes and the overhaul of crumbling infrastructure. Ms Rivlin argues persuasively that such tasks are best entrusted to state governments because they require 'bottom up' reforms and close attention to local conditions. The skill training required in Louisiana, for example, may differ sharply from that deemed appropriate in Maine or Montana. Giving states responsibility for the crucial task of raising productivity would allow Washington to devolve many of its responsibilities. It could eliminate most of its programmes in education, housing, social services, economic development and training. As a quid pro quo, says Ms Rivlin, Washington should assume full responsibility for controlling health care costs and guaranteeing access to care. At present, the soaring cost of Medicaid, the joint state-federal health care scheme for poor families, is putting state budgets under intense strain. But even if states were able to escape financial responsibility for escalating health care costs, the productivity agenda would represent an intolerable burden. Perhaps the most imaginative part of Ms Rivlin's plan is thus a radical reform of state finances. She argues that the US has much to learn from German federalism. In Germany, the central government collects most of the taxes but shares much of the revenue with the Lander. For example, German companies pay a value added tax whose proceeds are shared between the federal government and the Lander, with disproportionate shares going to the poorest regions. If similar shared taxes were introduced in the US, state governments could be put on a permanently stable financial footing. Starting in the 1930s, the role of the federal government expanded rapidly, partly because state governments were frequently corrupt and inefficient. Ms Rivlin points out that the quality of state government has improved sharply since the 1960s: the most talented individuals and the most imaginative reform plans are now often to be found in state capitals rather than Washington. The time is thus ripe for a transfer of responsibilities back to the states. A redrawing of boundaries between state and federal government, Ms Rivlin suggests, might help restore faith in government as well as enhance productivity. People are cynical because modern presidents have repeatedly promised action in spheres - such as education and industrial development - where their ability to influence events is limited. If tasks were allocated to the appropriate level of government, promises might be met and public cynicism reduced. As one of the more original contributions to the growing literature on US domestic reform, Ms Rivlin's book deserves a wide readership. It is likely to influence public policy whoever wins this year's presidential race.</p>

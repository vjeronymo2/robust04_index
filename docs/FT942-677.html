			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Directors' pay rises 67% at stockbroker Payments to directors at stockbrokers Smith New Court rose more than two-thirds in the year to April 1994, from Pounds 10m to Pounds 16.7m. The firm had earlier reported pre-tax profits for the year more than doubled to Pounds 95.2m, from Pounds 38.7m. Overall the size of the board expanded to 35 from 29, and a fifth of those - seven directors - earned more than Pounds 500,000 in total remuneration last year. A further 14 directors earned between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 500,000. The highest paid director, who was not named in the annual report released yesterday, earned a total package of Pounds 1.28m, of which Pounds 750,000 was a performance-related bonus. The chairman, Sir Michael Richardson, earned a more modest Pounds 141,000, the same sum as in the previous year and, as in 1992-93, earned no profit-related pay or pension contributions. Sir Michael is also an executive vice chairman at merchant bank NM Rothschild and Sons. He is also a non-executive director of a number of other companies including Sedgewick Group and the Savoy Hotel and is chairman of five quoted investment trusts. Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, had earlier said a portion of the bonuses would be paid in the form of Smith New Court shares. The report does not disclose how much of the bonus was in the form of shares although it does show that share options for some directors have increased sharply over the preceding year. Mr Marks, for instance, is now the holder of 557,390 'fully paid' share options, while a year ago, he held 73,134 share options but was granted additional options following a rights issue last May.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irina Kiryanova: "Kuban Will Warm, Feed, </F> and...Expel. Hunt on for Foreigners in Southern Russia. From  Near Abroad"]    [Text] For several years now Kuban society has been in a  state close to panic owing to the intensive immigration into the  kray of refugees from all corners of the former Union. At  present, the actual number of migrants in the region is put by  experts at 600,000. It is not surprising that real estate  prices here are growing faster than anywhere in Russia, and that  public health conditions have sharply deteriorated. Competition  for jobs has become tougher, and there is no need to talk about  crime -- the Russian minister of internal affairs, who recently  visited Krasnodar, confirmed what everyone already knew --that  Krasnodar Kray has a steady lead in this area.    Another detail of some importance is that in recent years  the  Kuban has virtually become a no-man's land or joint rear area  (quite safe and therefore particularly convenient and  attractive) for at least three warring states....    Fear of being buried under the debris of other people's  disasters is forcing the Kuban authorities to take increasingly  severe administrative measures. As of April last year the  registration of citizens from the near abroad has been under way  in the kray. In the space of 12 months the Kuban has expelled  around 700 unregistered migrants, and the fines levied on  miscreants total 76 million rubles [R]. Total fines levied on  illegal migrants have come to R46 million in the first quarter  of this year alone....    The Kuban authorities used B. Yeltsin's vacation in Sochi to  try to persuade the president "on the spot" of the need for  further steps in this direction. As a result, the presidential  "go-ahead" was given for the introduction of a visa system in  the kray, and the Kuban governor immediately signed the relevant  decree. It came into force the other day.    Will this turn into a painful offensive against human rights  in the kray? Mikhail Savva, chief of the kray administration  for nationalities affairs and migration issues, replied  categorically in the negative. The decree does not apply to  Russian citizens at all, much less to "foreigners from far  away." The decree is aimed at our homegrown "near abroad."  Movement of these citizens around Russia has hitherto been  entirely uncontrolled. Paradoxical situations have emerged:  For instance, one such foreigner, exploiting his absolute  freedom, committed a crime on Russian territory and went back  home -- from where it subsequently proved exceptionally  difficult to extradite him ("Sorry, we're a sovereign  country...").    As for human rights, Mikhail Savva said, they are being  trampled not in the kray, but rather in Moscow, which is  creating such an amazing normative base that the provinces have  simply been forced to protect themselves. For instance, just  what are we to make of an open border with Azerbaijan -- which,  in its turn, has an open border with Iran and Turkey? This  means one thing -- we have been turned into a cesspit, a sieve,  a transit lounge....    The kray administration's administration for nationalities  affairs and migration issues has drawn up a document entitled  "Description of the Economic Situation and Likely Scenarios for  the Development of Events in the Caucasus," setting out a  concept for the kray's "Caucasian" policy. Among the main tasks  it mentions are to protect the rights of Russians in the  Caucasus and to reduce the criminal influence exerted on the  kray by neighboring republics.    As for the rumors in the press that certain emergency  measures will soon be introduced in Krasnodar Kray -- along the  lines of Tatarstan -- we can only say that deep in the bowels of  the administration work is indeed being done on a number of  "hardline" documents within the framework of the latest attempt  to launch an anticrime offensive. But these documents have no  direct bearing on the visa regime.</p>

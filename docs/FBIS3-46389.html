			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The State  Statistical Bureau Population Statistics Department disclosed  that a total of 420 million people actually engage in farming in  China, accounting for 60 percent of the working population.    An analysis of related materials shows that the so-called  "900 million peasants" refers to the "900 million people" whose  domiciles are in the countryside. Since China introduced the  reform and opening up policy, however, some peasants have  transferred to urban areas. Of the so-called 900 million  peasants, only 797 million, namely 88.4 percent of the total,  reside in the countryside, while the remaining 105 million have  moved to cities and towns. Therefore, China actually has 797  million farmers, of these 523 million work in the countryside  and the remaining 274 million are children and elderly people  who can no longer work. Of the 523 million working in the  countryside, only 420 million engage in farming and the  remaining 60 million [figures as published] work in  non-agricultural fields.</p>

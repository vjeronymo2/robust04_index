			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans has  called on the rebel Cambodian guerrilla faction, the Khmer  Rouge, to end its war and talk peace with the government in  Phnom Penh. Senator Evans told journalists in the Cambodian  capital that the Khmer Rouge was a diminishing force with no  credibility. He said the guerrillas continue to loose their  power and influence and predicted that Cambodian Government  troops would remain in control of the faction's former  stronghold of Pailin, which they captured last month. Senator  Evans said for the Khmer Rouge to engage in a proper  reconciliation process, it would have to give up areas it still  controlled, end its military campaign, and recognize the  legitimacy of the Cambodian Government.</p>

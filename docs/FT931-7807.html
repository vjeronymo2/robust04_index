			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: French rail chaos after protests FRENCH farmers yesterday caused chaos after blocking railway lines across the country in protest against the EC's agricultural reforms and its recent farm trade agreement with the US, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The demonstrations, which coincide with a postal dispute and protests by fishermen, come at a sensitive time for France's Socialist government, which is heading for a resounding defeat by the conservative coalition at next month's parliamentary elections. The farmers' protest, which followed a call for a national day of action by Co-ordination Rurale, one of the most powerful farm unions, was the most dramatic and widespread this year. Militant farmers began blocking railway lines with barricades of tyres, agricultural produce and old agricultural equipment. Rush-hour train schedules were severely disrupted. The worst affected areas were the rail routes around Tours, Chartres, Orleans and Toulouse. However, farmers also disrupted some of the main lines in and out of Paris.</p>

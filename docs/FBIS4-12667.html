			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. Deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe  talbott, had a meeting in Islamabad with Prime Minister Ms.  Benazir Bhutto during which they discussed matters of mutual  interest to both the countries. Earlier, Mr. Talbott discussed  bilateral matters, including Kashmir and nuclear  nonproliferation, with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali.  He also held talks with officials in Islamabad during which  they reviewed entire spectrum of bilateral relations.    Briefing newsmen about the talks, a Foreign Office spokesman  said the two countries have agreed to the concept of  multilateral talks on South Asian security and to hold  consultations with each other in order to develop an appropriate  framework. The spokesman said that the president and the prime  minister reiterated Pakistan's desire for continued close and  cooperative relations with the United States in the post-cold  war period.    The spokesman said during the talks consideration was given  to the two nonpapers presented by the United States to Pakistan.  These dealt with the proposal for multilateral talks on South  Asian security, proposing a verifiable capping of the production  of fissile material by Pakistan in the context of removing the  impediments in the supply of defense materials. Consistent with  its well-known position, Pakistan expressed support for the  objectives of promoting nonproliferation regionally and  globally. The two sides agreed to proceed with further  consideration of this initiative with a view to evolving an  agreed and equitable approach.    Replying to a question, the spokesman said Pakistan made it  clear that it would not accept any unequal and inequitable  obligation as far as nonproliferation is concerned. Pakistan  would not accept anything which places it at an disadvantageous  position politically, militarily, and security-wise. It was  ready to accept any nondiscriminatory and equitable proposal for  this purpose vis-a-vis India, but not unilateral capping of its  nuclear program and it remained our position even today.    To another question, the spokesman emphatically stated that  Pakistan is opposed to the deployment of ballistic missiles in  South Asia.    He said Mr. Talbott reiterated the desire of the United  States to maintain the long-standing friendly and cooperative  relationship with Pakistan. He informed the president and the  prime minister that Pakistan was today as important as it was  during the cold war era, both regionally and globally and it had  a crucial role in the region. The spokesman in reply to another  question said Pakistan's stand on Kashmir remains the same that  the dispute should be resolved in accordance with the United  Nations resolution that calls for plebiscite in Jammu and  Kashmir. The United States, the spokesman said, has expressed  its willingness to assist in the solution of the dispute if this  was agreeable to both the parties.    Addressing a news conference in Islamabad this afternoon,  the  U.S. deputy secretary of state underscored strong commitment of  his country of maintaining good friendly relations with  Pakistan. He said the two sides also agreed on the elimination  of nuclear weapons from the entire South Asian region,  especially through talks in a multinational forum. He  emphasized that the American proposal for nuclear  nonproliferation in South Asia qualifies to be even-handed and  has a regional and trans-regional approach. Mr. Talbott said  President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher had  asked him to convey this commitment to Pakistani leaders that  the United States was determined to champion and broaden this  relationship further. He said his talks with the president, the  prime minister, and the foreign minister covered supply of  F-16's aircraft, capping of nuclear program, and other regional  and global issues. He said his dialogue with Pakistan will  continue to advance the goals of nonproliferation and to end  arms race in the region. Mr. Talbott said they are aware that  Pakistan Government is not going to accept any initiative unless  the government and the people are convinced that the American  initiatives serve the security interests of Pakistan. He said  the United States is not asking for a roll back of the nuclear  program, but is suggesting a verifiable capping. About the  supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, he said further discussion  on this will take place.</p>

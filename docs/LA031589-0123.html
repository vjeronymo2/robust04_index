			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BLUEGRASS AND WESTERN SWING: TWO BANDS DOING THEIR THING  </P> <P> Along with the grit that got washed out of country music when it was watered  down by "crossover appeal" in the '70s, country's longtime emphasis on  instrumental prowess also seemed to get lost in the flood. Outside of Ricky  Scaggs, the indomitable Merle Haggard and a handful of others, the notion that  axes can speak louder than words has largely gone ignored in these past two  decades.  </P> <P> It figures then that two of the best instrumental acts in country during that  time, New Grass Revival and Asleep at the Wheel, have existed only at the  fringes of the country-music community. But, if the two bands' clamorously  received early show Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana was any  indication, it's high time they came in from the cold.  </P> <P> Since it was formed by frontman-singer-guitarist Ray Benson in the early '70s,  Asleep at the Wheel has been rivaled only by Haggard in keeping alive the brand  of music known as Western swing, a hybrid of country and jazz originated by Bob  Wills and His Texas Playboys in the '30s. It's a music well worth saving, a  true piece of America, with both hard times and an expansive view of the future  shaping its musical moods. And, true to its title, it most certainly swings.  </P> <P> Through the years Benson has gone through well over 60 band mates (an attrition  due more, perhaps, to the band's 300-days-a-year touring schedule than Benson's  reputedly volatile nature). While his present seven-piece lineup didn't burn  quite as hot as it did in the days when steel guitar monster Lucky Oceans was  in the band, it was still a remarkably tight outfit. And, on stage, the lanky  Benson is nothing but pure entertainer, with an engaging-if-limited voice, some  tremendous chops on the guitar and a flair for showmanship that had him  juggling potatoes and catching them on his hat brim by show's end.  </P> <P> The material ranged from the rock classics "Route 66" and "Hot Rod Lincoln" to  Louis Jordan's R&amp;B novelty "Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens" to the  boogie-woogie "The House of Blue Lights." Throughout, the hot ensemble playing  and solo flashes recalled Wills' band, which was directly represented by "San  Antonio Rose," "Roly Poly," and "Take Me Back to Tulsa."  </P> <P> While the band has strong soloists on piano, sax and fiddle, the most  consistently inventive playing came from steel player John Ely, particularly on  a harmonic-studded solo on "Cotton Patch Rag." Benson's best moment came when  he strapped on an acoustic guitar for a brief, but remarkably detailed, solo  version of Robert Wilkins' country blues "Prodigal Son."  </P> <P> Of the two bands, Asleep at the Wheel had the easier row to hoe. While the  band's set relied almost entirely on Wills' proven style and a songbook of  standards, New Grass Revival applied a challenging and unique reworking of  bluegrass playing to original material and obscure covers. Even longtime fans  couldn't count on familiarity, as much of the set came from the forthcoming  "Friday Night in America" album.  </P> <P> Quartet members banjoist Bela Fleck, guitarist Pat Flynn and mandolin-fiddle  player Sam Bush are among the most respected of "musicians' musicians" on their  respective instruments, while bassist John Cowan brings a strong high-tenor  voice to their songs. Though their opening spot on the bill required them to  compress their abilities into a far-too-short eight-song set, even one song  would have conveyed how special the band is.  </P> <P> Working from a thorough grounding in bluegrass, Fleck, Bush and Flynn propelled  the picking in new directions, most notably on the encore instrumental "Metric  Lips," incorporating Irish and Eastern European folk influences into its  staggered rhythms and complex movements. Though more orthodox, "Can't Stop Now"  was no less impressive, with breakneck, jazz and blues-inflected solos  rampaging seamlessly from instrument to instrument.  </P></p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Insurers fear stress claims will increase Insurers met yesterday to discuss potential claims from employees suffering from occupational stress, amid increasing concern about industrial diseases and their impact on employers' liability business. 'Everybody is conscious that they have been taken unaware in the past by conditions such as repetitive strain injury (RSI),' said Mr Tony Baker, head of public relations at the Association of British Insurers, whose annual seminar on employers' liability issues yesterday focused on stress. 'Insurers are not bracing themselves for extensive claims,' Mr Baker added, but 'the industry has to be ahead of the game. It needs to look to the future rather than waiting for things to happen.' Recent interest has been triggered by a Pounds 10,000 out-of-court settlement late last year to a manager of a leisure company who suffered a nervous breakdown. Mr Fraser Whitehead, of Russell Jones &amp; Walker, the solicitors which specialise in personal-injury work, said his firm was investigating six other potential claims. 'There is no doubt at all that there will be more claims,' said Mr Whitehead, who said middle managers, especially in businesses becoming subject to pressures after privatisation, were particularly susceptible. Mr David Rogers, of Davies Arnold Cooper, which represents insurers, told the ABI seminar that employers were entitled to impose some stress on employees. But if employers learn that by exposing an employee to increases in stress they are increasing the risk of stress-induced injury, then employers must adjust their conduct. Employers' liability insurers outside the Lloyd's market paid Pounds 583m in claims in 1991, about half of which stemmed from disease claims rather than accidents. Most claims have been lodged by blue-collar workers suffering from various work-related lung diseases or deafness. But more recently insurers have paid claims following court awards or out-of-court settlements to white-collar workers such as typists suffering RSI. An Inland Revenue typist was awarded more than Pounds 70,000 in an RSI out-of-court settlement last month. Employers' liability premiums for companies mainly employing office or other white-collar workers have risen sharply as a result. Cost of work ailments, Page 10</p>

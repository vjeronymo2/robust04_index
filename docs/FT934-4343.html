			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Caracas coup talk brings US warning Venezuela's 1993 presidential campaign ended yesterday amid rumours of a military uprising and a warning from the Clinton administration that a coup would bring serious consequences. The country is to vote tomorrow for a new president, the 235 members of congress and 362 state legislators. The US, concerned at the coup rumours and a recent wave of terrorist bombings, sent its assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, Mr Alexander Watson, to Caracas to warn that any non-democratic government would face an economic embargo and other sanctions. Venezuela depends heavily on oil exports to the US. The leading presidential contender is Mr Rafael Caldera, 77, who was president from 1969 to 1974. Mr Caldera, who is running as an independent, has been a strong critic of free market reforms and privatisation. Last year saw two failed coups and hostility to free market reforms.</p>

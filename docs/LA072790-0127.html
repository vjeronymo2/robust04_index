			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRUSTACEANS FORCE CLOSURE OF RESERVOIR  </P> <P> Small crustaceans have made their way into the drinking water supply of a  neighborhood southwest of downtown, prompting the closure Thursday of Rowena  Reservoir in Silver Lake for at least a month, officials said.  </P> <P> It was the second time in eight days that the Department of Water and Power has  been forced to temporarily close a reservoir in the same area because of an  infestation believed to have been triggered by a prolonged hot spell this  summer and the proliferation of algae, DWP spokeswoman Debra Sass said.  </P> <P> On July 16, the agency closed the 77-acre Silver Lake Reservoir after residents  in the 2900 block of Van Buren Place reported tiny brown wormlike midge fly  larvae in their drinking water, Sass said.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the DWP closed the 5.7-acre Rowena Reservoir after  translucent-yellow aquatic amphipods measuring slightly larger than a half-inch  were discovered in the water supply for the same neighborhood.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EU, SUPPORTERS FINED $20,000 FOR REPORTS FILED 2 YEARS LATE  </P> <P> The Fair Political Practices Commission imposed a $20,000 fine Tuesday on  Secretary of State March Fong Eu and supporters for filing campaign finance  reports more than two years late.  </P> <P> Eu, who is in charge of the state agency that oversees elections and monitors  campaign funds, agreed to pay the fine for violating financial disclosure laws  during her 1986 reelection campaign but said she did not deliberately break the  law.  </P> <P> Eu said she was not aware that a group of supporters in San Francisco, the Bay  Area Asians to Re-Elect March Fong Eu Committee, failed to file campaign  finance reports on time.  </P> <P> "When I discovered the deficiencies, I immediately directed that the statements  be filed," Eu said in a statement.  </P> <P> "The public has an absolute right to full and timely disclosure of campaign  contributions and expenditures and I have taken steps to ensure that the  problems experienced by this committee will not be repeated by any committee  with which I may be associated," she said.  </P> <P> The commission fined Eu, her San Francisco campaign committee and its  treasurer, Catherine Lee, for waiting until early 1989 to report $40,000 in  donations and $37,000 in expenditures for 1986.  </P> <P> "Eu (as secretary of state) is responsible for imposing fines against  committees that fail to file timely campaign statements," the commission said  in a statement. "As such, she should have been well aware of the importance of  these requirements and taken steps to ensure that (her committee) complied with  the requirements."  </P> <P> The fine is the second imposed by the political watchdog agency against Eu this  year. Last February, the commission imposed an $8,000 fine against the Friends  of March Fong Eu Committee for campaign reporting violations.  </P> <P> During her recent reelection campaign, Eu was accused by her Republican rival  of reducing fines for a variety of political figures and businesses as well as  cutting fines levied against her own campaign committee. Eu did not dispute the  charge, but she said she routinely reduced fines when violations were  unintentional.  </P></p>

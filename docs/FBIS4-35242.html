			<p>BFN     [Text] Jordan constitutes a strategic extension of the  Palestinian economy. This was stressed by the Palestinian side  during its meeting with the Jordanian side at the Amman Chamber  of Commerce this morning. The two sides discussed ways of  establishing and enhancing Jordanian-Palestinian economic  cooperation in the fields of trade, industry, agriculture,  tourism, hotel management, finance, services, transportation,  and contracts. The two sides also discussed the possibility of  establishing joint companies to market Palestinian and Jordanian  products and promote goods in foreign and local markets.    The two sides also tackled ways of attracting capital and  investment companies in order to create a Palestinian-Jordanian  economic entity by establishing joint industrial, trade,  agricultural, housing, services, and touristic projects in the  interest of both sides. They then reviewed joint coordination  to unify standards and specifications and establish the proposed  standards and specifications center in Palestine that will fully  coordinate with the standards and specifications center in  Jordan.    [Begin 'Abd-al-Rahman Abu-Layl, head of the Palestinian  Chamber of Industry, recording] We have come here to coordinate  with our brothers in Amman the future economic march in the  interest of both the Palestinian and Jordanian economies and to  establish joint cooperation. We view Jordan as a strategic  extension of the Palestinian economy. Therefore, doors will be  opened, and we will have an outlet to the Arab world from our  beloved Jordan. So, we would like to lay the groundwork for  building that economy. We are now talking on behalf of the  Palestinian businessmen and the Palestinian private sector that  will carry out that duty. [end recording]    The Jordanian-Palestinian conference on development and  investment, which will be held under the patronage of His  Highness Crown Prince Hasan, was one of the most important  proposals made by both sides during today's meeting--a  conference which will be a manifestation of economic cooperation  between the two countries. More than 300 people will be invited  to attend the conference, in addition to both sides' officials.</p>

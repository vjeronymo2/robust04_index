			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOSPITAL CORP. OF AMERICA APPROVES $5-BILLION SALE  </P> <P> Hospital Corp. of America shareholders today overwhelmingly approved selling  the nation's largest hospital management company to a management-led group for  $5 billion.  </P> <P> More than 41.7 million shares of common stock were voted in favor of the  debt-financed acquisition. About 5 million shares were voted against the sale.  </P> <P> Corporation Chairman Thomas Frist Jr. told a standing-room-only group of  shareholders, "This has been a fantastic 20-plus years.  </P> <P> "It's exceeded many times over the founders' dreams for the company," he said.  </P> <P> Shareholders voted on the offer of $51 a share by TF Investments Inc., the  management-led group headed by Frist.  </P> <P> Corporation spokesman Victor L. Campbell said the transaction can be valued at  $6 billion if both debt and equity in the new company are counted. If the cost  of financing is not counted, the price tag is about $3.6 billion, he said.  </P> <P> A $1.3-billion short-term loan must be repaid within two years, and Campbell  said some corporation assets will be sold to meet that obligation. The loan  helped finance the buyout.  </P> <P> Campbell said a decision still has not been reached on which assets will be  sold.  </P> <P> The corporation is the leading hospital management company in the United  States, with properties that include 79 medical-surgical hospitals and 48  psychiatric hospitals.  </P> <P> He said the company's proxy statement to shareholders indicated that subsidiary  properties probably will be the first to go.  </P> <P> "It would be fair to say the company has no agreement to sell any of its  hospital facilities at this time," Campbell said.  </P> <P> The management group submitted the only buyout proposal by a Nov. 18 deadline  set by the corporation's board of directors. The board approved the buyout Nov.  22.  </P></p>

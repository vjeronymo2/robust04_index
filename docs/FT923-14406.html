			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: 3i Yesterday's annual report and accounts from 3i reads like the pathfinder prospectus that never was. The flotation may wisely have been postponed until next year, but by breaking down the main investments and disclosing its valuation policy for the first time 3i is clearly signalling that the roadshow has begun. There is room to ponder the transformation from the mission-driven business of the last 40 years to the more fully commercial organisation which 3i will inevitably become. In particular, will the company's proven long-termism be compatible with the demands of ordinary shareholders? Moreover, 3i should not be allowed to get away with claiming the accounting moral high ground just because competitors are less open. The allocation of half the investment division's operating costs to an investment realisation reserve, for instance, is primarily designed to secure a better yield. As for the valuation issue, an admittedly very conservative policy is simply coming into line with less conservative market thinking. That said, the results underline the enormous strength of 3i's portfolio and its dominant market position. When they do arrive, the shares will be well worth buying on a discount to net assets at anything over 20 per cent.</p>

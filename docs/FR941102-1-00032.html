			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 42.10&blank;Recertification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A person who has been temporarily decertified may apply for recertification by MSHA after the end of the temporary decertification period. To obtain recertification, the person must fulfill the requirements for certification or qualification as required under the applicable regulations before a new certification or qualification is issued. In addition, if the district manager, administrator or administrative law judge imposed additional requirements for recertification beyond the basic application, the certified person must also show that those requirements have been fulfilled. MSHA intends that applications for recertification would be forwarded by the Qualification and Certification Unit to the Technical Compliance and Investigation Division, which is responsible for coordinating those cases involving revocation of certification. By transferring cases involving decertification from the district offices to a single administrative office, the Agency would eliminate the likelihood that a person whose certification is suspended or revoked could become recertified without fulfilling the necessary requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The analysis contained in this preamble meets the Agency's responsibilities under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Under Executive Order 12866, MSHA has made a preliminary assessment of the costs and benefits of the proposed rule. The proposed rule does not meet the criteria of a significant regulatory action and, therefore, MSHA has not prepared a separate analysis of costs and benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Executive Order also requires Federal agencies to seek the views of State governments on regulatory actions that would affect them. MSHA intends to work closely with the States that have certification programs to coordinate implementation of this proposal. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires MSHA to consider the proposed rule's impact on small entities. MSHA defines small entities as mines with 20 or fewer employees. This proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of such small mines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal addresses procedures for decertifying individuals, either temporarily or permanently, who have failed to maintain the knowledge and skills required to perform certain tasks or duties of an ``approved,'' ``certified'' or ``qualified'' person or who have failed to comply with the law in their role as an approved, certified or qualified person. Any costs associated with the requirement that an individual be certified to perform a specific task or duty are not included in this analysis. Such costs are attributed to the Agency's existing certification requirements, and this rule does not impose any new such requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA estimates that about 105,000 individuals have been certified by the Agency to perform required procedures. Many of these individuals have been certified in more than one area. In addition, MSHA estimates that about 20,000 mine foremen have been certified by State governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is clear from MSHA's enforcement experience that some certified persons do not adhere to the Agency's requirements. Therefore, the proposed rule establishes procedures for temporary or permanent decertification of such individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA has not attributed any costs to the pay loss or potential loss of employment a certified person faces if Agency action ultimately leads to that individual's decertification. Such costs result from the individual's failure to follow Federal requirements, which in many instances could potentially endanger other miners. As such, these costs are far outweighed by no longer allowing the individual to jeopardize the safety and health of other miners. For the certified person, these losses would occur from the loss of pay differential or ultimately the loss of employment. For the mine operator, these losses might range from the cost of retraining the individual to significant lost production if the operator cannot readily replace someone who has been decertified. In order for the mine to continue production after MSHA has decertified an individual, the mine operator would need to hire a replacement who has the proper certification or qualification or have one of the more experienced miners achieve certification or qualification status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA has not attempted to calculate the financial losses that might accrue should an Agency decertification action ultimately be overturned on appeal or if an individual convinces the district manager that decertification action in not warranted. At this time, MSHA is unable to estimate how many such cases would occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA anticipates that the majority of actions under the proposed rule would begin with a letter from the MSHA district manager to the certified person warning that the person's conduct in performing certain tasks is deficient. As proposed, the warning letter may or may not require that remedial measures be undertaken by the individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Euromoney shows 28% rise to Pounds 17.7m EUROMONEY Publications, the information group 75 per cent-owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust, lifted pre-tax profits by 28 per cent from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 17.7m in the year to September 30. All parts of the group increased profits, except transport and leasing publishing. This, Mr Richard Ensor, Euromoney managing director, ascribed to the flatness of the aviation industry. Operating profits in the group's core activity, international financial publishing, grew to Pounds 9.54m (Pounds 8.79m). Mr Ensor said that this area had been steadily rising over the years and profits were not simply derived from Euromoney magazine. Another engine behind the profits advance was training, which was swelled by the Pounds 3.7m acquisition of the banking and management training arm of DC Gardner in June. It was now Euromoney's second main activity and lifted operating profits to Pounds 2.71m (Pounds 1.34m). Mr Ensor said that Gardner had only contributed for its poorest quarter and that there had been some disruption from moving following the purchase. Mr Ensor saw scope for both organic and acquisition expansion, though any of the latter would be in 'niche' training - either in geography or subject. Profits were also boosted by a greater contribution from associated undertakings, up to Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 237,000). This was partly due to AIC, the international seminars business. In July, Euromoney lifted its stake in AIC from 40 per cent to 60 per cent. Indeed, the group said it had paid Pounds 14m for 33 businesses since September 1989 and expected to spend a further Pounds 18m over the next two years increasing its stakes in them. Mr Ensor said that this gradual method of acquisition gave vendors an incentive to manage the businesses as well as possible in the earn-out period. Group turnover expanded to Pounds 49.7m (Pounds 44.9m), with Pounds 4.05m coming from acquisitions during the year. Earnings were up at 56.84p (44.41p) per share and the dividend is increased to a proposed 38p (29.5p).</p>

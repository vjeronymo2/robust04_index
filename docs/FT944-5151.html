			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Japanese government bonds ended little changed last week; while the JGB futures contract was up slightly on the previous Friday, the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond remained steady at 4.64 per cent. Early this week, the market is likely to be dominated by Friday's developments in the currency markets, when the US dollar broke key resistance against the Japanese currency at Y100 to the dollar. The dollar's gains were fuelled by stronger than expected US employment data, which revived speculation that the US Federal Reserve may soon raise interest rates again. Later in the week, attention will turn to Friday's release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey on economic sentiment. Analysts expect it to show a marked improvement in business sentiment for the period from August to November and to confirm signs of continuing economic recovery. 'Previous cycles suggest that when the Japanese economy improves, it does so quite sharply,' said Mr Eric Fishwick, an economist at IBJ International in London. Friday's release of third-quarter gross domestic product data also provided evidence of steady growth, showing a 3.7 per cent annualised quarter-on-quarter gain, and accompanied by a chunky upward revision to the second-quarter GDP number.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Thailand reneges on Dollars 1bn contract - Motorway Dispute A DECISION by the Thai government to renege on the terms of a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 636m) elevated motorway contract for Bangkok just as the road is due to open has outraged foreign and local investors, and threatens to undermine efforts to finance future infrastructure projects in Thailand. Foreign and Thai banks which have committed the equivalent of Bt20bn (Pounds 513m) to Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL), the construction consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan, are due to meet in Hong Kong today to discuss the increasingly bitter dis-pute. The banks have suspended loan disbursements to BECL since March BECL signed the 30-year contract to build and operate the road with the state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA) in 1988. BECL consortium members and lenders now accuse both the ETA and the Thai government of breaching the contract on a number of counts - in particular by refusing to charge the toll fees for motorists clearly specified in the contract. The expressway dispute is regarded as a vital test-case because Thailand is expected to seek billions of dollars in credits in the next few years for much-needed infrastructure projects. Bangkok is probably the most traffic-congested capital in the world there are three elevated railway projects planned for the city worth a total of about Dollars 7bn. Eleven Thai banks agreed to provide up to Bt15bn in credit facilities for the new expressway and several of them also have equity; a group of 31 foreign banks, led by DKB Asia, LTCB Asia, Credit Lyonnais and National Westminster, agreed to lend the equivalent of Bt5bn; and the Asian Development Bank provided Dollars 40m in long-term credit and equity. It was regarded as a commercial 'build-operate-transfer' project - one of the first in Thailand - and there were no government guarantees or subsidies. Predictable cash flow as specified in the con - tract is therefore seen as vital by the lenders and investors. The worst blow to BECL came when the cabinet decided unilaterally last month to impose a 20-baht toll for cars using the expressway system, instead of the contracted 30-baht fee, apparently because it feared opposition from Palang Dharma, one of the Bangkok-based political parties in the coalition government.</p>

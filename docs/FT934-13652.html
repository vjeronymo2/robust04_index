			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / 10,000 jobs may go as more pits face closure AT LEAST half of the 30 surviving coal pits in Britain are expected to be shut down following British Coal's decision yesterday to set in motion a final round of closures before privatisation. The disclosure of the move, expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs, brought a scathing House of Commons attack from opposition parties but only a muted protest from the Conservative backbench MPs who last year halted the original closure programme. The corporation's announcement of talks with unions on the future of its collieries came as the government further angered opposition parties and miners by saying it would repeal next month an 85-year-old act restricting underground working hours. However, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, provided some comfort for the 20,000 remaining underground miners and managers by extending existing enhanced redundancy terms, allowing payments of up to Pounds 37,000, until April 30. British Coal said it would conduct talks under the Modified Colliery Review Procedure, which can delay closure implementations for up to nine months. Closures announced last year were ruled illegal by the High Court after British Coal suspended the MCRP. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that by April the workforce would be 10,000 compared with 40,000 a year ago. But his charges that the government had 'rigged the market' against coal and was seeking a return to 19th century working practices failed to evoke more than an air of disgruntled resignation among Tory MPs. British Coal would not say yesterday which pits were earmarked for closure, or how many were involved. However industry analysts expect at least half of the remaining 30 mines to close. Twenty-one have been closed in the past year. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, said the government was hoping to close more pits 'by stealth' to avoid a repetition of last October's outcry. In the Commons, Mr Eggar said the government had approved a subsidy to British Coal, the first under a white paper scheme announced last March, to sell coal to Alcan, an aluminium producer, from its Ellington, Northumberland, pit. He also announced the appointment of former civil servant Dr Martin Holdgate, to chair an energy advisory panel set up by the department of trade and industry. Mr Eggar said the repeal of the 1908 act restricting underground working to 7 1/2 hours a day would not endanger safety. He refused to offer any guarantees on the future of the remaining pits.</p>

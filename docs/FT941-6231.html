			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lankan planters thirsty for privatisation - Conflicting interests in the world's leading tea industry Sri Lanka's tea and rubber industries, two major export sectors, have done remarkably well in the first year of partial privatisation and President DB Wijetunge is keen to move on to the next stage. But there are political obstacles. Tea production rose to 117m kg in the first six months of 1993 and the estimate for the full year is 230m kg. The first half figure represents a 37 per cent rise over 1992, when a severe drought, the worst in 30 years, cut production to 179m kg. Rubber production in the first six months was 62m kg, up 30 per cent on the same period in 1992. Coconut production did less well, dropping by 14 per cent. The first phase of privatisation began in July 1992 when 22 management companies signed profit-sharing contracts with the government, which retained ownership of the plantations nationalised by the centre left coalition of prime minister Mrs Bandaranaike in 1972. Politics decided the issue then - Mrs Bandaranaike's minister of plantation industries was a Marxist - and it was the decisive factor in President Premadasa's compromise in 1992. Mr Premadasa's dilemma was understood by the IMF and the World Bank, which had been pressing the government to dismantle the two state corporations that owned the plantations. The estates employ well over 500,000 workers, of which 80 per cent are members of the Ceylon Workers' Congress, which is also a political party with five members in parliament. The CWC president, Mr S. Thondaman, the most successful trade union boss in the island's history, has been a cabinet minister since Mr JR Jayawardene led the conservative UNP to a sweeping victory in the 1977 election. This UNP/CWC alliance not only guaranteed a block vote but trade union 'peace' on the strategic plantations. If anything, President Premadasa, Mr Jayawardene's successor, was even friendlier, and Mr Thondaman stood by him in every crisis. Mr Jayawardene and Mr Premadasa, Colombo-based 'low-country' politicians, saw Mr Thondaman as an important ally in view of the danger that that the separatist Tamil 'tigers' of the north might infiltrate the tea estates and open a new front. But Mr Wijetunge, Mr Premadasa's successor, has been determined to limit the union boss's influence. The new president is a hill country 'Kandyan' (Kandy is the central province capital) and the Kandyans have no reason to like the tea pluckers. The British evicted them from their traditional homelands to plant tea and settle cheap indentured Indian Tamil labour. If he is to press forward with privatisation, however, Mr Wijetunge will have to balance commercial advantage against electoral cost. Moving this highly regulated industry into private ownership will entail a loss of economic protection for Mr Thondaman's members and of many of their votes for the president. But planters are impatient for measures to reduce their cost disadvantage in the export market. The basic daily wage for tea pluckers was raised from SLRs60 to SLRs70 last June and then to SLRs82, about USDollars 1.70, in July. Wages amount to 60 to 70 per cent of the cost of tea production in Sri Lanka, compared with only about 40 per cent in India, Kenya and Indonesia. More recently devaluation of the Indian rupee has given Sri Lanka's main rival a further advantage. The critical factors are cost of production and net sale average. India and Kenya help producers to limit production costs and Indonesia has assisted planters by reducing interest rates. And in all three countries lower wages are paid. 'Mr Thondaman, who is a cabinet minister, has got us by the throat,' says a Sri Lankan planters' association official. Spelling out Sri Lanka's strategy, plantations industries minister Mr Rupa Karunatilleke stresses privatisation, removal of excessive export duties and exchange liberalisation. 'Aggressive marketing should emphasise health now that there is increasing consumer preference for natural products,' he argues. But the main problem, he admits, is that Sri Lanka's production is almost 90 per cent orthodox tea, when 50 per cent of world demand is for the CTC (cut, tear and curl) type. Sri Lanka has now decided to convert 20 per cent of its tea production to CTC over the next three years, and 25 CTC products are in the pipeline. The cost of conversion will be about USDollars 18m. 'All matters are open to negotiation,' Mr Thondaman says.</p>

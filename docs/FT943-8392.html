			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Castle Energy says its future hangs on MG Corp's goodwill Castle Energy, the Pennsylvania-based oil refiner that featured earlier this year in the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the German engineering group, said yesterday that its future depended on the diminishing goodwill of its largest shareholder, MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's New York-based subsidiary. 'The uncertainties resulting from MG's and its affiliates' possible inability or unwillingness to continue to meet their obligations to the company raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern,' Castle said in its quarterly regulatory filing. Metallgesellschaft has said that it is seeking to end its affiliation with Castle, which it deems not to be in MG Corp's best interest. Negotiations between Castle and the Metallgesellschaft group of companies to restructure contractual and other relationships are continuing, Castle confirmed yesterday. MG Corp, which has a 43.2 per cent stake in Castle, is contractually obliged to purchase almost all of Castle's refinery output at above-market prices for the remainder of this century. MG Corp is also Castle's major creditor and source of capital. In its third quarter, Castle said it earned Dollars 4.3m, or 35 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 268m. That compares with profits of Dollars 5.1m, or 65 cents, on sales of Dollars 154m in the same 1993 period. The increase was mainly due to the company's acquisition of Powerine Oil in October 1993. Castle issued 2.8m shares to the public in November, and sold additional shares to MG Corp, diluting per-share earnings. The company had 12.4m shares at the end of the third quarter, compared with 7.9m shares at the end of last year's third quarter. For the nine months ended June 30, Castle said it had profits of Dollars 19.4m, or Dollars 1.69 a share, on sales of Dollars 683m, up from the year-ago period's profits of Dollars 15.1m, or Dollars 2.14 a share, on sales of Dollars 456m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Automakers including Nissan Motor Company and Toyota  Motor Corporation have agreed with major steelmakers including  Nippon Steel Corporation to cut the prices of steel plates,  including surfaced-processed steel plates, by about 5,000 yen  (about 4-6 percent) per ton beginning in April. This is the  first time that the prices of steel plates supplied to  automakers have been cut since 1989. Automakers, eager to  quickly reduce their production costs, have strongly urged major  steelmakers to lower their prices on steel plates. Major  steelmakers have gone along with the request because of the wide  price differentials existing between Japanese-produced plates  and those of other nations. With the prices of steel plates set  to be lowered, the manufacturers of rubber, nonferrous metals,  and plastic products will certainly be pressed to lower their  prices. Negotiations are now under way between major  steelmakers and commercial electric appliance makers on price  cuts, and the prices of steel plates supplied to electric  appliance makers are expected to be lowered by about 4 percent.    The prices of surface-processed steel plates, cold-rolled  steel plates, and hot-rolled steel plates will be reduced. In  the case of cold-rolled steel plates that are used to  manufacture car bodies, both major steelmakers and automakers  appear to have agreed to lower their prices from 90,000 yen to  85,000 yen per ton.    Automakers have adopted a concentrated purchase system under  which they make a large purchase of steel plates which they then  sell to their subsidiaries which manufacture auto parts.  Automakers have pressed them to sharply cut their production  costs in order to bolster their international competitiveness.  Auto parts makers are increasingly voicing complaints about the  prices of steel plates supplied by automakers that are higher  than those on the open Japanese and foreign markets.    Major steelmakers which registered large deficits in their  1993 settlement of accounts have gone along with the request.</p>

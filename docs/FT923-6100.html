			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Minister confuses Argentine traders MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, threw the country's struggling equities market into turmoil yesterday with a confusing statement about government action to smooth sharp fluctuations in share prices. Mr Cavallo, addressing a conference of financial executives on Monday, said that money raised from privatisations would in future be ploughed back into the capital markets. Asked for an explanation, a top government official said yesterday: 'The proposal is to put proceeds from privatisations back into the market through a partially state-owned institution that would intervene to stop prices going up too far or falling too far.' Mr Cavallo spoke after the market index fell 8.8 per cent on Monday. Prices continued falling yesterday, with a 6 per cent drop at lunchtime. So far this year share prices have fallen by half, after rising 393 per cent in 1991. The suggestion appeared not only to be ill-defined but to run counter to government efforts to deregulate the economy. One market operator said: 'Nobody can understand exactly what he is proposing.' Even the government official said: 'I think Cavallo has got it wrong. It goes against our free-market philosophy. The market should learn from its mistakes. Cavallo was just thinking out loud. I don't think anything will come of this.' The government is partly blamed for the market's collapse by encouraging inexperienced investors to pay too much for shares in Telecom, a privatised telephone company that raised Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 900m) for the treasury in March. Telecom's share price has since fallen by a quarter. Officials denied Mr Cavallo's statement was intended to talk up the market in expectation of further flotations.</p>

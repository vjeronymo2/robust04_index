This change is intended to ensure that temporary appointments, under which employees receive no benefits, are used to meet truly short-term needs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> November 14, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Tracy E. Spencer, (202) 606&hyph;0960, or fax (202) 606&hyph;2329. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4601), OPM published proposed regulations to reduce the time limit for temporary appointments, curtail use of temporary hiring for extended seasonal work, and prohibit successive temporary appointments to the same or successor jobs. We developed those regulations in response to Congressional and employee concerns and evidence that some employees were, indeed, serving for years under a succession of temporary appointments with no benefits and no job security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations generated numerous comments from agencies, individual managers and employees, and local employee organizations. Many of the commenters took opposite positions. Many anticipated changes that will be proposed in legislation implementing the recommendations of the National Performance Review (NPR). We could not adopt all of their suggestions, which are summarized below. We have, however, attempted to balance their various concerns and to provide reasonable operating flexibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship to NPR <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of the commenters felt that the proposal did not go far enough. They stated that the issue of benefits for temporary employees should be addressed directly by affording benefits and within-grade increases to temporary employees, that long-term temporaries who have demonstrated their abilities on the job should not have to compete with the public for permanent vacancies, and that agencies should be able to set the length of temporary appointments based on mission needs, not arbitrary regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM supports all of those goals. These regulations are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> intended to be the final solution to all of the problems of temporary employment. Rather, they are an interim measure to address those issues within our control pending more comprehensive reform. We expect that legislation implementing the human resource recommendations of the NPR will be proposed within the next few months. Until such legislation is passed, however, OPM has no authority to establish those provisions by regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

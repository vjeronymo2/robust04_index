			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alfred Schwarz on interview with Bosnian Prime </F> Minister Haris Silajdzic in Vienna on 11 March--recorded;  Silajdzic's statements in English]    [Text] [Schwarz] What has not been accomplished by the  three parties so far is now to be accomplished by two--finding a  peace solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since last week, Muslims  and Croats have been together in Vienna to unite their two  so-far hostile ethnic groups in one state. For this purpose,  many issues must be clarified--the constitution, the division of  the territory into cantons, and, not least, the problem of the  overall territory. And here, the circle closes with the so-far  unsuccessful negotiations of all three ethnic groups--Muslims,  Croats, and Serbs.    The Serbs are currently occupying about 70 percent of the  Bosnian territory. A state of Muslims and Croats with only 30  percent of the territory seems to be impossible. Thus, the Serbs  would have to give up territory that they have conquered.  However, they are not part of the negotiations in Vienna.    This defect is also seen by Bosnian Prime Minister  Silajdzic.  Since the Serbs are not willing to participate in the  negotiations in Vienna, one now has to discuss the possibility  of a Muslim-Croat state.    [Silajdzic] They will be invited to join this common effort  of the Bosniaks and the Croats. For the time being, their  statements show that they are not willing to do that. In that  case, we can talk about a possibility of creating a political  entity with a status, of course, within the international body  of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Schwarz] However, even if a Muslim-Croat state in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is established without the Serbs, this will  be a weak state. Therefore, a loose union with Croatia is  envisaged. There are even voices from Zagreb that want to make  this one of the basic preconditions for the negotiations in  Vienna.    Prime Minister Silajdzic does not think anything of that.  The  new state will be a strong state, he says, and both Croatia and  the new Muslim-Croat federation will be separate, sovereign, and  independent states.    [Silajdzic] Well, of course, it will be even a stronger  country. The two countries will retain their identity, their  independence, their sovereignty.    [Schwarz] With consideration for the negotiations that are  still underway, the Bosnian head of government was not able to  say anything more specific about the planned Muslim-Croat state.  However, there are continued efforts to include the Serbs in the  planned solution in some way. Therefore, Silajdzic visited  Serbia's protector, Russia, in Moscow yesterday. And he  believes that Moscow will still play a positive role in the  negotiations.    [Silajdzic] Yesterday, I came from Moscow, and Mr. Kozyrev  assured me that Russia will do its best to play a constructive  role in seeking the final negotiating settlement.    [Schwarz] One thing is clear in any case. The negotiations  are now entering their decisive stage. This is also indicated  by the fact that, this afternoon, Croatian Foreign Minister  Granic will also come to the negotiations in Vienna.  Nevertheless, Muslim Prime Minister Silajdzic does not expect a  speedy conclusion. One is not in such a hurry, it will still  take some time until peace will reign in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he  said.</p>

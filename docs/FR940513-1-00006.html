We have determined that in the Wilmington, NC, area, there are climatic and biological barriers that are adequate to prevent the introduction of certain plant pests into the United States in the event they escape from shipments of fruit before undergoing cold treatment. We are also proposing to delete cold treatments in the regulations and replace them with a reference to cold treatments in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by reference. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before June 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the regulations, APHIS allows certain fruits to be imported into the United States if they undergo sustained refrigeration (cold treatment) sufficient to kill certain insect pests. Cold treatment temperature and refrigeration period requirements vary according to the type of fruit and the pests involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most imported fruit that requires cold treatment undergoes cold treatment in transit to the United States. However, APHIS allows imported fruit to undergo cold treatment after arrival in the United States at certain ports designated by APHIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, cold treatment is limited to ports in the northern United States because APHIS has determined that insect pests escaping from shipments of imported fruit after arrival in the United States would be unable to survive winter weather conditions in the north. The following ports are currently authorized by APHIS to conduct cold treatment on imported fruit: Atlantic ports north of, and including, Baltimore, MD; ports on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway; Canadian border ports on the North Dakota border and east of North Dakota; and, for air shipments, Washington DC, at Baltimore-Washington International and Dulles International airports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recently, we received petitions from individuals at the ports of Wilmington, NC, and Gulfport, MS, requesting that we amend the regulations to allow cold treatment to be conducted at these ports. On November 12, 1993, in response to these petitions, we published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 59953, Docket No. 93&hyph;121&hyph;1) an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting public comment on whether we should allow cold treatment at ports in the Southern United States and in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We solicited comments concerning this notice for a 45-day period ending on December 27, 1993. During that period, we received four comments, three from State governments and one from a grower organization. Two comments opposed allowing cold treatment at ports in the Southern United States and California, arguing that allowing such treatments would place California and Florida citrus crops at too great a risk of fruit fly infestation. Another comment requested that we perform a detailed pest-risk analysis before deciding whether to allow cold treatment at southern and California ports. Another comment supported allowing cold treatment at the port of Wilmington, NC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While we are still considering whether to allow cold treatment at other ports in the Southern United States and California, we are now proposing to allow cold treatment of certain fruit, under certain conditions, at the port of Wilmington, NC. We have determined that in the Wilmington, NC, area, there are climatic and biological barriers adequate to prevent introduction of certain plant pests into the United States in the event they escape from shipments of fruit before undergoing cold treatment. Also, we are proposing to impose additional special conditions regarding cold treatment at Wilmington, NC, that would further reduce the risk of fruit fly introduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to meeting the requirements in &sect;319.56&hyph;2d of the regulations regarding cold treatment, the port of Wilmington, NC, cold treatment facilities would be required to operate under the following additional special conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Bulk shipments (those shipments which are stowed and unloaded by the case or bin) of fruit arriving for cold treatment must be packaged in fly-proof packaging that prevents the escape of adult, larval, or pupal fruit flies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Bulk and containerized shipments of fruit arriving at the port of Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment must be cold-treated within the port, that is, the area over which the Bureau of Customs is assigned the authority to accept entries of merchandise, to collect duties, and to enforce the various provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Advance reservations for cold treatment space at the port of Wilmington, NC, must be made prior to the departure of a shipment from its port of origin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe these requirements would reduce the risk of fruit fly introduction into the United States in the event infested shipments of fruit entered the port of Wilmington, NC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

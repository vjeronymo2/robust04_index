			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- In an article entitled "The  Crisis of the Voter," Stefan Hrib comments in today's issue of  the Czech independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY on the current  situation in Slovakia, saying that the crisis is first of all  the crisis of the Slovak voter.    The current crisis in Slovakia broke out last week when the  balance of forces between the government and opposition parties  reached the ratio of 75-75 votes.    "Since the summer 1992 election catastrophe (victory of  Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), the  Slovak parliament has been neither a decisive part of Slovak  politics, nor even a relatively respected part," Hrib writes.    At present "the government has no support in the parliament,  but the parliament is not capable of dismissing it."    "In this situation only two existing projects can solve `the  crisis'. The project of the Slovak premier and the project of  the political remainder of Slovakia," Hrib says.    If Meciar succeeds in calling a referendum to strip all  deputies who have "betrayed" his movement of their mandates,  Slovakia would be faced with one prospect -- "quick adoption of  a law protecting the republic, repressive measures against  Hungarian fellow-citizens, and the settling of accounts with  `anti-Slovak' critics in court," Hrib writes.    The deputies whom Meciar would like to dismiss from  parliament are one-time Foreign Minister Milan Knazko and seven  of his followers who left the HZDS last march, and six deputies  from the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) who have refused  to obey Meciar.    "The opposition project... offers three alternatives --  first, to call early elections, second, to create a broader  coalition without Meciar (this is almost within reach since the  Alternative of Political Realism faction was created within the  HZDS), and third, to form a union with Meciar (but according to  the latest information the (post-communist) Democratic Left  Party has refused to cooperate with Meciar)," Hrib says.    "Early elections would probably change practically nothing  because according to polls, the present deputies would fill the  parliament again. Meciar would again be the strongest, though  less than now, and Weiss would again be decisive, maybe more  than now. Generally speaking, post-election politics would  duplicate the present exactly," Hrib stresses.    "An SDL coalition with Meciar would civilize the expressions  of the new government, but would further deform economic policy  towards leftist solutions: budgetary deficit, "controlled"  inflation, and subsidies to state enterprises. In a certain way  the Weiss-Meciar union would be the worst alternative for  Slovakia. It would be a union of vulgar amateurism with the  still living socialist illusion."    "The broader coalition without Meciar, which is almost  certain (since Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik and Deputy  Premier Roman Kovac created the Alternative of Political  Realism), will be a coalition between the right and the left,  between nationalists and ex-communists, and their ideological  opponents. The result will be a shapeless, internally chaotic  coalition. Its discords and incapacity will necessarily result  in early elections (the future coalition partners themselves do  not deny this at all). The likely result of the elections is  described above," Hrib points out.    "What Slovakia needs is neither a broader coalition without  Meciar, nor a Meciar-Weiss union. Slovakia cannot be salvaged  by new elections either. The only road towards healing Slovak  politics leads paradoxically outside it -- it rests in the  appearance of a new voter. Indeed, if there is a crisis in  Slovakia, it is neither a crisis of the HZDS nor of the  parliament or parties, but a long-lasting crisis of the Slovak  voter," Hrib concludes.</p>

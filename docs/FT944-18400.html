			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Insurance cover - Legal briefs Commercial litigators and senior barristers attending a recent litigation seminar in London favoured changing court rules to force defendants to disclose their insurance cover at the start of a trial. The lawyers believe that, by making defendants put their cards on the table at the outset, time and money could be saved in not pursuing people without resources. This would bring the UK into line with practice in Canada and the US. The change would require legislation, because under English law there is a fiduciary duty on the insured not to disclose details of cover until there has been a finding of liability. The move is opposed by insurers, which think plaintiffs would sue only those with 'deep pockets'. But Mr Justice Otton said he was in favour, provided the trial judge, who decides damages in the UK, was not told whether the defendant had cover.</p>

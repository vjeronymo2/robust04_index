			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 1.1% on hopes of a rate cut ARBITRAGE-related trading pushed cash share prices higher in tandem with the futures market, which rose on renewed hopes of a cut in the official discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 206.72, or 1.1 per cent, at 19,829.78 on buying by arbitrageurs and investment trusts. The index fell to the day's low of 19,589.66 just after the opening, and hit the day's high of 19,833.38 in the afternoon. Volume remained subdued at 180m shares against 140m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.48 to 1,592.90. Advances led declines by 555 to 397, with 188 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.52 to 1,207.57. The cash market fluctuated on technical trading due to the low volume. Speculation that Japan will emphasise economic recovery in the G7 communique added to hopes of further monetary easing. However, traders expect investors to remain inactive ahead of the July 18 lower house elections. In a recent report, Salomon Brothers in Tokyo maintains an optimistic view on equities, commenting that the market will begin to recover as a result of better economic news and opposition proposals to reduce taxes and stimulate the economy. Hopes of an imminent cut in the discount rate helped interest rate-sensitive large capital issues. Nippon Steel rose Y5 to Y366 while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y6 at Y642. Reports of a sharp fall in crude oil prices during recent weeks helped oil refiners on expectations of wider profit margins: Nippon Oil appreciated Y16 to Y806 and Cosmo Oil advanced Y12 to Y852. Reports that Unicharm had decided to close Academic Unicharm, a computer dating subsidiary, encouraged investors, pushing the nappy manufacturer up Y60 to Y2,780. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 85.73 to 21,791.81 in volume of 15.5m shares. Rohm, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y50 to Y3,170. Roundup THERE WERE mixed performances from the region's markets yesterday. TAIWAN surged 3.6 per cent in a technical rebound triggered by news that the Formosa Plastics group would soon begin building its long-delayed Dollars 7.5bn petrochemical complex. The weighted index finished 140.09 higher at 4,047.42 as turnover expanded to TDollars 19.35bn from Monday's TDollars 11.92bn. The plastics sector led the gains, forging ahead 5.1 per cent. Formosa Plastics strengthened TDollars 2.20 to TDollars 43.50 in heavy trading. HONG KONG retreated in subdued trading as investors awaited developments in Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index shed 37.07 to 7,168.34 in turnover down to HKDollars 2.9bn from Monday's HKDollars 4.2bn. Some brokers said most fund managers were waiting for the visit of Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, to Beijing later this week to discuss Hong Kong's political reform plans. A separate round of Sino-UK talks ended in Beijing yesterday, with further discussions scheduled for later in the month. NEW ZEALAND continued to rise, setting a fresh three-year high with Telecom again the focus, adding 3 cents at NZDollars 3.28. The NZSE-40 index closed 2.33 up at 1,717.85 in turnover of NZDollars 23.2m. SINGAPORE eased in thin volume, but with activity particularly noted in Malaysian plantation stocks traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 6.95 at 1,818.97. KARACHI rose on institutional buying, with investors largely ignoring the continuing political uncertainty arising from what is being seen as a power struggle between President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The KSE index moved ahead 10.92 to 1,243.97.</p>

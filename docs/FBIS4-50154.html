			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "`No Conflicts' With America"] </F>   [Text] The United States and China should look beyond  their ideological differences for better insight into what they  have in common, a senior Chinese trade expert advises.    "The two countries have no fundamental conflicts of  interests, either from the geopolitical or geo-economic point of  view," said Zhou Shijian, deputy director of the Institute of  International Trade Research under the foreign trade ministry.    "What we have in common outweighs what divides us," he said  in an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY.    Despite the differences that do exist, he said, bilateral  trade and economic relations will continue growing steadily.    "We should be clearly aware of the fact that despite all the  major or minor skirmishes between the two nations in the past,  bilateral trade has developed in the fast lane."    For example, bilateral relations suffered major setbacks in  1981 and 1989. While two-way trade plummeted in 1982 and 1983,  it has maintained astonishing growth since 1989.    According to Chinese figures, two-way trade in 1993 was 176  per cent over that in 1988. Under American accounting  standards, two-way trade last year was quadruple that of 1987.    "The exceptional growth momentum proves that the mutually  beneficial nature of the two countries' economies is not subject  to changes by wishful thinking," Zhou said.    The potential for co-operation lies in more than just  economics, he said.    Zhou believes the two countries need each other when it  comes  to strategic and political interests in the face of the new  international situation.    "The U.S. cannot ignore the fact that China has one-fifth of  the world's population and has its own nuclear power, that China  is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and is an  important element for stability in the Asia-Pacific region," he  said.    "Sino-U.S. relations are expected to improve further with  the  fall of U.S. hegemony and the rise of conflicts between the U.S.  and Japan, Europe and Russia."    Because of the differences in social systems and values,  Zhou  said, it isn't strange to see China and the United States locked  in skirmishes over some major issues. However, he cautioned  that the direction of bilateral trade-fast growth -- should not  be overshadowed by these differences.    "Isn't it out of date for the U.S. administration to be  simmering with debate over whether or under what conditions to  continue most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status for China while  most Western countries are helping their businesses to enter the  Chinese market?" Zhou pointed out that many U.S. senators,  policy strategists and business executives have demanded an end  to the U.S. practice of annually reviewing China's MFN status.    They argue that wielding MFN renewal as a possible trade  sanction is a tactic of the Cold War period and no longer suits  the current world situation.    Zhou said the Clinton administration cannot afford to ignore  the importance of the Chinese market if it wants to keep the  U.S. economy growing.    He noted that China plans to import; $1 trillion in goods  over the next seven years.    "This vast market," Zhou stressed, "will be attractive to  U.S. and other foreign businesses."</p>

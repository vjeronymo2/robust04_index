			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Hans Memling's tortured souls take a trip - Susan Moore admires the Last Judgment in Bruges but feels it should have stayed in Gdansk Hans Memling is the most accessible of the so-called Flemish Primitives. He tempered the angular, agonised style of his probable master Rogier van der Weyden with a softness and sweetness of expression learnt in his native Rhineland; his poetic dreaminess and tranquility of mood is arguably more appealing than Van Eyck's enamel-hard perfection. Memling can be monumental but he is never heroic. That, at least, is how he is often perceived. The achievement of the substantial exhibition in Bruges commemorating the 500th anniversary of his death in the city is to encourage us to adjust this conventional view. The process begins almost at once. It is hard to imagine anyone standing before his little-known and vast 'Last Judgment' for the first time and not reeling. The triptych's panels rise some 2.5m high. Underneath the figure of Christ seated on a brilliant rainbow and in the centre of an arc of human flesh, stands St Michael, resplendent in gleaming gold armour and peacock wings. He is weighing the souls of the dead who clamber out of their graves all around him, indicating the damned with the point of his crozier and dispatching them to the demons beyond. To the left, guided by St Peter, the righteous and redeemed calmly climb the crystal staircase to the Gothic gates of heaven, regaining their earthly identities en route. On the right, the damned - clerics among them - are herded into the furnace of hell. In the foreground one doomed soul attempts to claw his way towards salvation but is stopped in his tracks and dragged back: there is no escape. For this writhing mass of terrified and tormented humanity, Memling obviously took great pains to depict the full gamut of man's possible reaction through gesture and facial expression. Amid the sulphurous flames, men and women are railing, imploring, recoiling, struggling, screaming, crying. Although we have no proof, it is tempting to assume that he, like Leonardo, spent time studying his own grimacing face in a mirror to understand the grotesque distortions of fear. Tempting, too, to believe that he made studies from life for the dramatically foreshortened and peculiarly posed figures in the foreground. Such painstaking attention to detail is characteristic of Memling's response to the natural world. The colours of his rainbow are accurately recorded, the gold of globe and breastplate reflect in miniature the panorama opening before us, even detailing the barely visible Romanesque towers that loom behind the heavenly gate. Each petal and leaf, peacock feather and scattered gemstone is precisely rendered. This massive altarpiece, arguably Memling's masterpiece, is the coup of the show. But its loan from the Narodowe Museum in Gdansk smacks of cultural opportunism. The triptych has only recently been lent to the Stefan Lochner exhibition in Cologne; any more fortunate institution than the Narodowe is unlikely to have allowed such a large and vulnerable work of art to travel at all. Certainly no other big panel painting has come to Bruges. Even a glance at the central panel of the 'Triptych of Jan Crabbe' is a salutary reminder of how a panel painting can suffer. How the painting came to Gdansk is a dramatic tale in itself. Commissioned by the Florentines Angelo di Jacopo Tani, manager of the Medici bank in Bruges, and his wife for the chapel they founded and dedicated to St Michael in his employer's church in Fiesoli, the altarpiece was on its way south when its ship was intercepted by a Polish warship operating on behalf of the Hanseatic League. The League was engaged in a trade war with England, the vessel's first port of call. The donors so soberly depicted on the triptych's closed doors were never to see their altarpiece again. Significantly, a number of Memling's most important patrons were Italian. The astonishing tour de force which represents all the scenes of Christ's Passion compressed into a single - and fairly small - continuous narrative image was, for instance, commissioned by Tani's successor Tommaso Portinari. Memling's position in the cross-current of artistic ideas between North and South is fascinating. He appears to have been the first in the Low Countries to paint allegories on themes of love and virtue, a genre popular in Venice at the time. He also seems to be the first artist anywhere to have the highly artificial idea of placing his sitters against a pure landscape background - a device appreciated by his Italian patrons and found later in the portraits of Leonardo and Botticelli. The series of small, bust-length portraits here is one of the highlights of the show - even if the inclusionist approach of curator Dirk De Vos gives us more than we might have expected. Some were made as wings of lost devotional works, almost all are tightly framed. Memling's cropping of tops of heads, hands and shoulders brings to his images the concentration of the close-up. For all their microscopic detail - every fingernail, eyeball and iris is outlined, each hair and tuft of stubble individually delineated - these are personalities that remain enigmatic. No gaze is focused. The sense of other-worldliness and generalisation is emphasised by the diffuse light and softened contours. In the case of his sole surviving secular female portrait, we feel she represents no more than a fashionable ideal of feminine beauty and piety. Visitors to Bruges will always be rewarded by the masterpieces permanently on view in St John's Hospital. Those who come for the exhibition will discover a subtly different Memling. The exhibition continues at the Groeningemuseum in Bruges until November 15. Dirk De Vos' new monograph, Hans Memling: The Complete Works, is published in English by Thames &amp; Hudson.</p>

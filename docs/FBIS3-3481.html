They  are Mr. Cheng Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous  Region; Mr. Lei Ning, vice chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Region; Mr. Hong Puzhou, chairman of the Guangxi  Zhuang Autonomous Regional Planning Commission; and Mr. Shui  Liguo, mayor of Beihai City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the China  Chinese Language Broadcasting Company. My question is: Guangxi  is the most convenient passageway linking China's southwest  region with Southeast Asia. The CPC Central Committee proposed  in 1992 that efforts should be made to give full play to  Guangxi's role as a passageway for linking China with the  outside world. Focusing on construction with this aim in mind,  Guangxi has strengthened the construction of infrastructural  facilities and basic industries in the past two years. How is  this work progressing and what difficulties are being  encountered?    [Cheng] In its Document No. Four issued in 1992, the CPC  Central Committee explicitly stipulated that efforts will be  made to build Guangxi's coastal areas into a most convenient  passageway for China's southwest region. [passage omitted] We  have been concentrating on construction in these areas --  transport, energy, and communications. In the transportation  area, we are now building or expanding five airports; building  five new railroads; and two superhighways. The first one is a  139-km four-lane superhighway from Liuzhou to Guilin; the second  one is a six-lane superhighway from Nanning to Qinzhou,  Fangcheng, and Beihai. We realize that there is insufficient  electric power in Guangxi to better serve China's southwest  region and also to serve Guangxi's economic development.  Therefore, we are now stepping up the construction of  hydroelectric and thermal power stations, the combined capacity  of which will come to around 8.2 million kilowatts. When these  facilities are completed, we believe they will create better  conditions for opening up the southwest region and Guangxi to  the outside world and for their economic development.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the Asian  Television of Hong Kong. Many criminal cases in Hong Kong  involved firearms which were smuggled from Mainland China to  Hong Kong, and Guangxi is one of sources from which firearms are  smuggled into Hong Kong. May I ask what has the regional  government done to check the outflow of firearms?    [Lei] Guangxi shares a 1,020-km land border with neighboring  countries and has a 1,595-km coastline. Some criminals have  taken advantage of the long border and coastline to engage in  firearms smuggling and drug trafficking. The autonomous  regional government and its law-enforcing departments have  always adopted strict measures to crack down on these illegal  activities. To strengthen the fight against these activities so  as to give the criminal elements no opening to exploit, last  year we increased our police force by more 700 people, who were  especially assigned to crack down on firearms smuggling and drug  trafficking. Through our struggle last year, we seized more  than a 100 kilograms of heroin, over 800 kg of opium, and about  300 firearms. The arrested criminals have been handled  according to law.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the  Central Television Stations. According to statistics, the  amount of investment, the number of foreign-funded enterprises,  and the amount of foreign exchange earned through exports have  increased considerably in Guangxi in the past two years. Where  did most of the foreign investment come from? What industries  have these investments have channeled into? What are the  prospects of these investment projects for earning foreign  exchange?    [Lei] [passage omitted] In 1992 Guangxi's foreign trade  came to $1.108 billion, up 33 percent over 1991. In 1993 its  foreign trade volume was $1.325 billion, up 19.6 percent over  1992. At the end of 1991, there were only 559 "san zi"  enterprises [joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly  owned enterprises] in Guangxi. In that year, only $63 million  worth of foreign capital was used, but by the end of 1992 there  were 1,870 "san zi" enterprises, and $246 million worth of  foreign capital was used. By the end of 1993, there were 4,368  "san zi" enterprises in Guangxi, and $1 billion worth of foreign  capital was used that year. Guangxi has moved from 12th place  to eighth among the 12 provinces and cities in the coastal areas  in using foreign capital. First, investment has been expanding  to different fields. Originally, most investments were used in  real estate and the service industries. In the past two years,  investments have expanded to infrastructural facilities, basic  industries, agricultural development, and the transformation of  old enterprises.    Second, investments have expanded to other areas. In the  past, investments were mainly concentrated in coastal cities.  Now, investments have spread to the hinterland and some hilly  areas. For example, in Bose Prefecture 25 "san zi" enterprises  were approved 1993, with a combined investment of $5 million.  [passage omitted]    Third, the number of countries and regions making  investments  has increased. By the end of 1993, there were 44 countries and  regions investing in Guangxi. The main investors were from Hong  Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The ratio of investments from Hong  Kong and Macao in Guangxi is roughly 25 percent; the ratio of  Taiwan's investments in Guangxi was 11 percent in 1993.    Fourth, there are many investment projects by big consortia.  Last year, there were over 70 investment projects, each with an  investment of over $10 million. In 1992, there were only four  such projects. In exports, "san zi" enterprises are a force  that should not be underestimated. Their exports now account for  about one-eight of Guangxi's total exports.    [Unidentified Vietnamese correspondent in Mandarin] I am a  reporter with VNA. First, in the past few years, especially  since the normalization of relations between the two countries,  what progress has been made in Guangxi's ties with Vietnam?  Second, what are the prospects for development between Guangxi  and Vietnam?    [Cheng] Since China and Vietnam normalized their relations  in November 1991, significant progress has been made in economic  and friendly contacts between the two countries. The  development in this area has been healthy, and it has brought  benefits to the people of the two countries. [passage omitted]    Take trade as an example. According to the situation in  border trade in the past few years, such trade is mutually  complementary. We have built several economic projects in  Vietnam. These projects require that both sides continue  cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY. Recently, many experts from international economic  circles have predicted that an international metropolis will  emerge in Southeast Asia and the Beibu Wan [gulf] area. It has  been learned that Guangxi's Beihai city has drawn up some plans  in this connection. Would Mayor Shuai please brief us about the  plans?    [Shuai] Beihai city has eight major resources. Its fresh  water, land, port construction, and tourism resources are  especially good. In short, with these resources a large port  for commerce with foreign countries can be built. In addition,  it has a huge potential of becoming a large metropolis.  [passage omitted]    [Chinese-American correspondent in Mandarin] I am Zhou  Youkang, a reporter with the Voice of America. I have a  question concerning investment: Mr. Chairman, you have just  mentioned that investments in Guangxi were mainly from Taiwan  and Hong Kong. What about the United States? In your opinion,  what can the United States do to contribute to Guangxi's  economic development? How do you promote trade between Guangxi  and the United States?    [Lei] In fact, apart from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, the  next biggest investor is the United States. The biggest wholly  owned enterprise, the [Tule] Company I have just mentioned, has  invested $40 million in leasing 60,000 mu of land in [Hepu] for  agricultural development. The company will import fine seed  strains from the United States and will assume responsibilities  for seeds, processing, and marketing. In fact, our economic  cooperative relations with the United States are also  significant. Due to the lack of time, we cannot go into detail  one by one.    [Shuai] The doors of Beihai city are open. We welcome the  United States to quickly enter its markets. Don't be late.    [Moderator] That's the end of the news conference. Thank  you.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BZW revises accounting bulletin BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, the UK clearing bank, yesterday issued an emasculated version of its circular on changes in UK accounting policy which created an embarrassing storm of protest when a draft was first circulated earlier this month. The bulletin describes the changes in accounting standards currently being introduced by the Accounting Standards Board, and presents some analysis of their implications. An earlier draft, which was never officially released, though details of it were reported in the press, gave examples of five companies in which earnings figures would be significantly different if re-drafted under the new standards. News of the analysis affected the share price of the companies concerned - Fisons, P&amp;O, Ladbroke, Cable &amp; Wireless and British Airways. It is also believed to have generated angry letters and phone calls from some of these companies, putting BZW under pressure to withdraw its document. BZW was at pains yesterday to distance itself from the earlier draft, which it said had been misinterpreted. Copies of this document have been recalled and shredded. However, a copy obtained by the Financial Times, shows that the report says the companies complied with existing accounting standards, but under the changes their results would be shown 'in less favourable light'. In each case, earnings would have been lower using the new standards. The companies involved claimed when the report was withdrawn that the analysis contained inaccuracies, although they refused to elaborate. The new report simply contains some abstract examples of the impact of the accounting changes, and lists certain characteristics sensitive to the changes. These include cash absorption, substantial profits derived from acquisitions and disposals, large non-recurring costs and significant amounts of off-balance sheet financing.</p>

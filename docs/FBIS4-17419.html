In the course of his visit he  met the Latvian prime minister, Valdis Birkavs, the Saeima's  [parliament] chairman, Anatolijs Gorbunovs, and some Latvian  ministers and experts.    Mr. Teilgard said that he told the Latvian Government about  the six basic principles of this organization which is mainly  purposed for the promotion of international cooperation and the  development of trade among its 124 member country. The first  condition providing the participation in GATT is that Latvia has  to work out the memorandum on the state political and economic  situations plus the documents reflecting the current external  trade procedure in the country and send them to the GATT  headquarters.    The leadership of GATT shows its understanding of the  present  economic situation in Latvia, and will take it into account when  the issue of Latvia's participation in GATT is under discussion,  Mr. Teilgard said.</p>

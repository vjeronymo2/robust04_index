			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Testing time in prospect for investors - New York The stock market this week faces one of its most critical tests in several months. First, investors and traders will probably have to withstand an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, whose open market committee meets tomorrow to decide whether to tighten monetary policy for the sixth time in 10 months. Second, the market will have to cope with more pronouncements from Republican leaders in Washington about what they plan to do now they have a majority in both houses of Congress. Some reckless talk from victorious Republicans unsettled the market at the end of last week - talk of big tax cuts (including the outright elimination of income tax) and increases in defence spending conjured up unwelcome images of ballooning deficits and rising interest rates. Euphoria over the elections should begin to die down this week, and the Republican party is likely to present a more carefully-considered agenda for the new Congress in the coming days. But Wall Street remains divided over whether the Republicans' mid-term triumphs will be good or bad for shares. Among those who see a brighter future under a Republican Congress are Mr Joseph Liro and Mr Timothy Hiscock, economists with SG Warburg. Pronouncing the Clinton agenda dead, they say proposals put forward by Republicans since the election - measures to cut taxes, resist a minimum wage increase and reduce government regulation - are all positive for stocks. Others disagree. Mr David Shulman, chief strategist at Salomon Brothers, says euphoria over the victory of the more market-oriented Republicans will soon give way to a variety of concerns, such as the possibility that a Republican-controlled Congress will block the passage of free trade legislation, and the possibility that aggressive tax-cutting measures could unsettle a bond market worried about the deficit and an overheating economy. The outlook for share prices, concludes Mr Shulman, is bleak, and late last week he was recommending clients to sell into any post-election rally. That rally, however, never really materialised, and probably never will. Share prices did jump sharply the morning after the mid-term election, but they soon fell back, and the market ended the week nursing losses. How the equity market will respond to another monetary tightening depends on the extent of any rate increase. Most analysts believe the Fed will raise its target for the federal funds rate from 4 3/4 to 5 1/4 per cent. Any increase larger than 50 basis points could spell trouble for share prices, because it would deepen fears that the economic recovery and corporate earnings growth would be choked off if interest rates rose too far too fast.</p>

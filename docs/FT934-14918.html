			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Arts: Struggles for liberty - Cinema THREE COLOURS BLUE (18) Krzysztof Kieslowski TRUE ROMANCE (18) Tony Scott RISING SUN (18) Philip Kaufman THE SECRET GARDEN (U) Agnieszka Holland THIS BOY'S LIFE (15) Michael Caton-Jones What does it mean when a director gets an attack of Serial Cinema? Is it bad for him? Should we try to help? It happened with Eric Rohmer, whose 'Moral Tales' were followed by 'Tales And Proverbs' and 'Tales Of The Seasons' and whose movies seem more and more like rent-a-theme fables with dwindling variations. Now Poland's Krzysztof Kieslowski, having made ten films under the sign of the Decalogue, promises three movies with colours as titles begining with - that hue again - Blue. Since each film in the French-made trilogy will also deal with a different tricouleur-inspired theme - in Blue it is 'Liberty' - we feel attacked by tags and flags, labels and gift-wrapping even before the credits start. But after the annoyance, the masterpiece. After the signposting, a film about living without signposts. A car crash; a husband and daughter killed; and a survivor wife (Juliette Binoche) who wakes in hospital to a world bearing down on her with bright lights and antiseptic concern. Soon she is taking the approved path to rehabilitation. She exorcises her grief - or tries to - by watching a video of her loved ones' funeral. She swaps her manorial country pile for a town flat. (Her husband was a famous composer.) And she takes with her an iconic memento of her past life - a blue-crystal chandelier - like an inoculation to cure her of the disease of memory. But care-counselling is not the film's business. The man who made A Short Film About Killing and The Double Life Of Veronique is not European cinema's answer to Claire Rayner. Kieslowski soon hits Mlle Binoche with bereavement's aftershocks. A litter of baby rats appears in her box-room - in mocking parody of a vanished family life. And her dead husband rattles his chains from the grave: first when she discovers a lost music manuscript whose notes pursue her on the soundtrack even after she has thrown it in a dust-van, later when she discovers her husband's bygone mistress. Kieslowski's genius - and he may be the only European director now earning that word - is for shuffling his deck of images so that animate and inanimate become indistinguishable. Vivified by subtle colour filters or skewed camera angles, trivial objects assume an eerie life: like the blue lollipop, once her daughter's, that Binoche sucks on like a memory-teat. Meanwhile human faces turn into mystery objects. Not least Binoche's own luminous, frozen features, crossed by tiny shadows of emotion like a snowbound mountain-face patrolled by changing clouds. If Blue is about liberty, it is about the struggles we go through to achieve that liberty. Liberty from memory, from grief. Liberty from the panaceas of the well-meaning. Above all, liberty from the false comfort of lives we try too neatly to compartmentalise, only to find that warmth, want and chaos keep flooding in at the edges. And in a good movie week, chaos will come again. True Romance is not so much a film, more an advanced case of delirium tremens. But see if you can resist its pop-art vitality. The paths of blonde call-girl Patricia Arquette and lonely comics-store assistant Christian Slater cross in Detroit one night when she spills her popcorn over him in a cinema. He says to her 'Accidents will happen.' She says to him 'What a wonderful philosophy'. Consequence: they are soon fleeing to Los Angeles with a suitcaseful of stolen cocaine. I have left out four murders and sundry plot twists. But you get the point. The movie, directed by Tony (Last Boy Scout) Scott and written by Quentin (Reservoir Dogs) Tarantino, is the dramatic equivalent of having half-a-dozen buckets of popcorn spilled over you. Everything you can think of happens: love, death, violence, substance-abuse, dreams of escape, ghosts of Elvis Presley. More to the point, they all keep happening simultaneously. Fantasy crashes into reality. Sex gets enmeshed in plot development. (Marvel at the gymnastic love bout that takes place in a roadside phone booth while we are still trying to untangle the significance of the recent phone call). And comedy is mixed with brutality. This last cocktail comes in the film's most brilliantly unnerving scene. Mafia smoothie Christopher Walken is elegantly, surgically insulted by interrogation victim Dennis Hopper (Slater's father) before Walken finally walks into the camera lens (Hopper's P-o-V) to blow his head off. As a writer/director duo Scott and Tarantino are pulp cinema's answer to Losey and Pinter. Tarantino provides the gnomic dialogue, Scott the ornate visuals. Gasp at the gilded, smoke-textured interiors and the light-sculpted close-ups; or at the gorgeously overblown 'balcony scene' on a poster-dominated fire-escape outside Slater's flat, where the couple sit swirled about by street steam and by their own reveries of escape. Do not be deterred by the violence. There was worse in Webster and Ford, and Tarantino is nothing if not a New Jacobean. Do not be deterred either by the fact that True Romance was a box-office flop in the US. Originality is not always a crowdpleaser; nor is a movie style that gobbles up different moods like a child let loose on a chocolate box. Much of Rising Sun is shot at night in the pouring rain. This must be an irony: a comment on modern America's view of modern Japan as not so much a sunrise neighbour, more a nation determined to rain on the US's parade. As we know, Tokyo has already annexed much of Tinseltown. In this screen version of the yellow-peril bestseller by Michael (Jurassic Park) Crichton, Japan is about to close its jaws around a giant US computer company - with what consequences for national security] - when Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes arrive on the scene. Sean is an Armani-dressed East-West liaison veteran. Wesley is a short-fused black cop learning Japanese on his car cassette-player. They arrive to solve a murder: the late-night strangling of a call-girl on the Nakamoto boardroom table. They stay to unravel one of Those Plots, in which conspiracy spreads all the way from LA to Washington. Director Philip Kaufman has spent his career trying on different genre hats from sci-fi (The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers) to high-tone erotica (Henry And June). But the thriller hat fails to suit him. It slides off the back of his head, revealing a cranium empty of ideas on how to make stage-Japanese supporting characters live; how to stop his three screenwriters attaching messages to their dialogue ('We're giving the country away'); or how to fool us into believing that Connery and Snipes are more than another tired variant on the rookie/oldtimer partnership of a million cop films. But we still prefer it to The Secret Garden. Here the body of a famous children's classic is found dead on a boardroom table: that of Warner Brothers. Means: genteel strangulation. The culprit is director and former Wajda scenarist Agnieszka Holland (of Man Of Iron). Determined to avoid Frances Hodgson Burnett's Victorian sentimentality, she manages to avoid every other tolerable emotion too. There is glum photography, a glum heroine (Kate Maberly) and a glum garden, in which rabbits ruminate and ruins glower. Stars, though, will happily be stars. As the snooty Yorkshire housekeeper Maggie Smith is Maggie Smith, for which relief some thanks. Robert De Niro in This Boy's Life is Robert De Niro. We enjoy - for a while  -the Seattle accent and the overdressed-masher routine, as he courts single mother Ellen Barkin prior to making life hell for her and her son Tobias. Scene: a remote company town in Washington State. Time: 1950s. The real Tobias (Wolff) wrote the memoir about life with bullying Stepdad from which British director Michael Caton-Jones of Memphis Belle draws this film. Well, not draws: rather pulls it protestingly forth like a thread from an overlarge sweater. The plot seems too slight, the characters at once overwrought and under-occupied: familiar signs that the original book was richer in emotional texture than movie-friendly drama and has caused collapsed inspiration at the studio story conference.</p>

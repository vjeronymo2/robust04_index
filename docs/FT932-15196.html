			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Bosnia threatens to renege on peace plan THE Moslem-led Bosnian government yesterday warned it would withdraw support for the international peace plan if Srebrenica, the besieged town near the Serbian border, was captured by Bosnian Serb forces. As reports came in that another eight people had been killed and 21 wounded in the latest Serb artillery attack on the town on Tuesday night, the Bosnian Foreign Ministry said: 'The fall of Srebrenica will signal the final demise of the Vance-Owen plan.' Under the plan, already signed by Bosnian Croats and Moslems, but rejected by Serbs, the country would be divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. Srebrenica, surrounded by Serb militia, is in a region which has been allocated to the Moslems, but which Bosnian Serbs want to absorb into their territory because it is in a region adjoining the Serbian border. The renewed attack on Srebrenica, which followed a fierce Serb bombardment of the centre of the city last Monday during which at least 56 people, many of them children, were killed, coincided with a fresh diplomatic offensive by the US and Russia in support of the Vance-Owen plan. Both the US and Russian special envoys to the Bosnian peace talks, Mr Reginald Bartholomew and Mr Vitaly Churkin, had talks in Belgrade yesterday with Serb and Yugoslav leaders, including President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia. Mr Bartholomew, appointed by President Bill Clinton in February to give a fresh impetus to the peace effort, emphasised time was running out for Bosnia's Serbs to sign the plan. He warned that, while the US was pursuing 'the diplomatic track' for the moment, it was not prepared to wait much longer for Serbia to endorse the peace plan. If it failed to do so, Washington would very soon press its allies to help Bosnian Moslems arm themselves by a partial lifting of the UN arms embargo. 'The military action must stop, the atrocities in places like Srebrenica must stop,' Mr Bartholomew said, warning that Serbia would otherwise become a 'pariah state' subject to the stiffest sanctions ever imposed. Yugoslav officials said Mr Bartholomew, who also saw Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, wanted Serbs to come up with concrete proposals on what modifications they wanted to agree to the peace plan. Mr Karadzic said he was not ready to sign the plan but that peace was still possible. 'We are working hard on possible corrections that have been announced (by US secretary of state Warren Christopher) and we do hope that we will make some progress.' However, he made clear he would never concede control of the corridor across northern Bosnia which links Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has  defended its decision that no further policemen should be  deployed in KwaZulu, saying the situation there had improved  somewhat. The chairman of yesterday's sitting, Dr. Dawie de  Villiers, said there had been a slight decrease in violence  since the TEC had given orders last month for the police to  bring the situation there under control. He said that the  situation was not yet satisfactory, and that it would be  monitored continually. KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi warned earlier that the deployment of more police in  kwaZulu would be seen as an invasion.    On the controversy surrounding the government's campaign to  promote the new constitution, the council decided that it would  control the campaign in future. The South African  Communications Service will continue promoting the constitution  in the media, but it will now do so in consultation and  collaboration with the TEC.</p>

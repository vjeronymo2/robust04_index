			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: HELPING THE QUAYLES REDECORATE THEIR D.C. NEST  </P> <P> "EINSTEIN'S three rules of work: (1) Out of clutter find simplicity. (2) From  discord make harmony. (3) In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity."  </P> <P> This is from the new Safire/Safir quote book, "Words of Wisdom."  </P> <P> LET'S GIVE some space to Paula Perlini, a decorator we haven't already heard of  ad nauseum. She is getting ready to decorate the  soon-to-be-structurally-renovated third-floor quarters of the vice president's  children in the veep's home in Washington -- The Naval Observatory. At the  moment, the young Quayles -- Corinne, 14; Tucker, 12; and Benjamin, 11 -- are  living in a tiny rabbit warren of rooms, making do and muddling through, as  they have had to do since last January. It is these youngsters who have had a  lot of "adjusting" to do, plus the fact that they had to make new places for  themselves as VIPs in the nation's capital.  </P> <P> Ms. Perlini has been working for the last eight months trying to improve their  lot. The Third Avenue-based, New York partner of Perlini-Tanksley Associates  used to toil in the service of her very famous brother-in-law, that top man  always seen in the pages of Architectural Digest and HG, the one and only Mark  Hampton. Paula was working for Mark when he decorated the downstairs and second  floor of The Naval Observatory for George and Barbara Bush.  </P> <P> The Quayles think Hampton did a great job on floors one and two and these rooms  have been left much as they were. Paula, recommended to Marilyn Quayle by a  mutual friend, will do a tiny touch-up on the Quayle's second-floor master  bedroom and sitting room. But her big challenge is how to design for the  children when security is so strict that no plans of the observatory can even  be sent to her.  </P> <P> FROM TIME to time, Paula kids Mrs. Quayle by saying, "For heaven's sake,  Marilyn, I'm not a terrorist!" But to make her projections, Paula has to go to  Washington and study the carefully-guarded third-floor plans in private. She  finds, however, that the vice president's wife is a person who is "lovely to  work with. She is very bright. We have lunch, we laugh and we go around with  the Secret Service. Mrs. Quayle knows what she likes, but admits she is no  decorator and actually seems to like to take advice."  </P> <P> NOW, JUST the other day, your Liz happened to find herself seated next to  Marilyn Quayle at a luncheon. I discovered that her photographs do not begin to  do her justice and her print image has not always come across as less than  harsh.  </P> <P> Marilyn Quayle had a lot to say at lunch about her children and her feelings  about being torn between devotion to them and the schedule she keeps. She  talked of efforts in planning against natural disasters; her "cause." She told  of going to an earthquake seminar last August in San Francisco and credits work  done there with some of the preparedness attitudes that prevailed during the  recent quake. Her remarks about all of this were dynamic and sincere.  </P></p>

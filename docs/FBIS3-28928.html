			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Monday [14 February] there were "somewhat speculative  movements" involved in the day's sudden surge in the yen against  the U.S. dollar.    Fujii repeatedly told a regular press conference that there  appeared to be speculative elements in currency trading, but he  declined to tie the surge to any cause. He said Tokyo would  take "appropriate measures at the right time" but refused to be  specific.    The Japanese currency soared 2.56 yen in Tokyo trading to  105.69 yen to the dollar, with dealers citing the failure of  Japan-U.S. trade talks at last Friday's summit in Washington.    Market players have said failure by the two countries to  pare  Japan's huge trade surplus would invite high-yen pressure from  Washington, and U.S. officials were quoted by the Japanese press  as saying a higher yen would not be surprising. But Fujii said,  "I would like to avoid comment" on causes of the yen's rise.    He said it is the "common understanding" of seven leading  industrial nations that exchange rates should move in a stable  manner, reflecting economic fundamentals.    Asked about Japan-U.S. trade relations, Fujii defended  Tokyo's macro- and microeconomic efforts, saying  "misunderstandings remain" on the U.S. side.    On the insurance sector, which is under his ministry's  jurisdiction, Fujii refuted charges that Japan is dragging its  feet, saying the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  is making every effort to "solemnly" deregulate its insurance  market.    Separately, a senior ministry official said the two sides  had  nearly agreed on the insurance sector before Friday's meeting of  Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton, remaining hung up on how to  define "objective criteria" to gauge progress.    Japan remains opposed to U.S. calls for what he said were  essentially numerical targets of market share, which is decided  by private business decisions, not government fiat, he said.  Deregulation is the key to improving market access in  insurance, and measuring market share is unrelated to progress  on deregulation, the official said.    Despite U.S. warnings that it may review the bilateral trade  "framework," the official said a July deadline for the talks has  not changed and that Japan will proceed with its insurance  deregulation.    Fujii said Japan's politically divisive tax cut, decided  last  week, has also been misunderstood.    Although the nearly 6 trillion yen worth of income and  residential tax cuts were proposed for one year only, they are  not single-year rebates, Fujii said, stressing that they  comprise reduced rates of application.    The tax cuts are "the first step in a full-fledged tax  reform" promised by the governing coalition, he said.    Fujii also defended the strict curbs in growth of spending  on  the military and for official development assistance (ODA),  agreed Monday for inclusion Tuesday in the government's draft of  the fiscal 1994 budget.    The final adjustments reflect the accumulated individual  policy needs of each ministry or agency, Fujii said.    As all the government's cabinet ministers visited the  Finance  Ministry in turn for final budget talks with Fujii, attention  focused on the record low 4.8 percent ODA rise from the initial  fiscal 1993 budget and the 34-year low 0.9 percent increase for  the Defense Agency.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / CBI report warns of continuing recession A GRIM warning that poor prospects for UK manufacturers were likely to prolong the recession still further came last night from the Confederation of British Industry. According to the CBI, manufacturers see little hope of raising output over the next four months. This increases the probability that the recession - the longest since the 1930s  - will enter a seventh quarter. The CBI said weak demand was further squeezing company profits, and Britain was 'unlikely to see the rise in investment needed to improve and sustain competitiveness over the longer term'. The bleak tone of the CBI's latest survey of industrial trends - which provides a barometer of overall economic activity - increased pressure on government ministers to stimulate the economy. It came at the end of a week in which official figures showed that the recession had so far lasted six quarters, and in which the cabinet agreed to an expansionary pre-election Budget on March 10. The picture of the factory sector stuck in recession is underlined by only a small improvement in companies' order books, which have been depressed for two years. Manufacturing accounts for just under a quarter of the economy and influences other sectors such as services. According to the survey of 1,425 businesses in 50 industries, 22 per cent of companies believe output volumes will be lower over the next four months, with 19 per cent expecting an increase. Because of competition and weak demand, inflationary pressures at a wholesale level are extremely low. The same number of manufacturers expect to cut prices in the next four months as increase them. This marks the lowest inflationary pressures recorded for manufacturing in a February survey since 1967. Prompt payment call, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 8 Risk and reward, Page 9</p>

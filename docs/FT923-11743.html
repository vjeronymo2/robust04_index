			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Balancing the steps taken to restore profits - The recent gloomy results of West Midlands industrial groups VERSON International will this week write its own epitaph on a gloomy reporting season for industrial groups based in the West Midlands - traditionally the geographical heart of British manufacturing. Doubtless there will be promises of future profitability after reorganisation and report of a first half loss. To some extent, therefore, Verson will be typical. This month, nine other small and medium-sized quoted industrial groups - Brasway, Bromsgrove Industries, Hampson Industries, Newman Tonks, Transfer Technology, Triplex Lloyd, Victoria Carpet, Wheway and Wyko - have published figures. They represent a cross-section of industry with activities running from carpets and architectural hardware to environmental engineering and foundry products. However, all except Brasway and Transfer Technology reported falls in their pre-tax profits and Wheway sank into losses. In different and limited ways Brasway and Transfer Technology offer a guide to the future. Brasway came, as Mr Mark Swaby, chairman, noted, from a very low base point: its tube operations saw the downward spiral earlier than most industrial groups. 'We had the pain earlier, we took earlier action,' he said. For its part, Transfer Technology is dependent on export markets and thus shielded to a degree from the UK recession. But while this former Maxwell company may gather strength from its diversity of markets, its 1992 shape is different from its first half 1991 structure, making growth comparisons difficult. Against the background of receding profits, it is not surprising that the market has turned a jaundiced eye on engineering companies. All of the recently reporting companies, except Transfer Technology, had been trading at or near to the bottom of their 1992 range even before more general uncertainty swept the Stock Exchange at the end of last week. Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based broker, says p/e ratios of engineering companies are high 'because of low profitability. But relative dividend yields are, by historic standards, low. This coupled with the failure of the UK economy to 'follow through' after the general election, has caused the sector to have something of a relapse over the last two months'. Sensitive to the market, however, all the recently reporting companies - despite their cost and trading problems - have maintained or increased their dividends, sometimes dipping into reserves to do so. Yet the market is now forced to make a fine calculation. It has to balance the steps which the companies have been taking to restore profitability against an estimate of how far, if at all, trading conditions are likely to improve. Although Mr John Bettinson, chairman of Victoria Carpet, could claim this week that 'to a large extent we have avoided redundancies,' this is not the case with other recently reporting West Midlands-based groups. Seven of the nine have disposed of businesses or closed capacity or taken job losses, or, indeed, done all three. Cost-cutting in an effort to raise productivity and ward off margin pressure has been endemic. At the same time, all the companies with the exception of Triplex Lloyd have either kept gearing static or reduced it. 'Although interest rates have fallen, there is little sign of them coming down further, and, with the widening of the margins of the banks, nobody wants to be extended on borrowing,' observed Mr Chris Clayton, finance director of Hampson Industries. Triplex Lloyd, however, where borrowing is linked to expansion, feels comfortable with gearing raised over its last financial year from 38 per cent to 45 per cent. There is some evidence that the cost-cutting, where it has been allied to investment, has put companies in the position where they can increase profitability even if trading conditions do not improve. It has already been the case at Brasway. It is likely to be the case at Wyko, for example, which has rationalised its components distribution branch network. Triplex Lloyd reported significant margin improvement in both its automotive and power divisions. In stock market terms this phenomenon is more encouraging than the trading prospects. It is now clear that, across the board, the rise in UK demand during the second quarter and particularly in April simply faded away. 'There is noticeably less optimism generally than was the case during the late spring,' Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands, said yesterday. Although, last week, the West Midlands regional council of the Confederation of British Industry reported that export demand was holding up, the international scene remains problematic. All of the nine have international interests, reflecting the now accepted nostrum that, to survive, Midlands industrial groups cannot depend on the UK market. But Wheway, the environmental engineer, reported that although demand had been good in the US and Scandinavia it had been poor in Australia. Newman Tonks, the architectural hardware group, found its European sales profits had been dropping. Bromsgrove Industries has found lower European demand. On the other hand Transfer Technology found that sales were holding up well in south-east Asia. Given the trading uncertainties, industrial activity will probably remain at a low level. Midlands Electricity, as good an indicator as most, is predicting a 0.5 per cent rise in industrial sales of electricity this year. This points also to further cost-cutting and the reduction of capacity for large and smaller groups alike. Indeed, in recent weeks British Steel, Chubb, the Racal locks subsidiary, Glynwed, the engineering group, Grasshopper, the privately-owned babywear group, and United Engineering Steels have all announced further job losses in their West Midlands operations.</p>

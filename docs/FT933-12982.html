			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Long-dated D-Mark offering attracts foreign interest EUROPEAN currencies provided the talking point of the international bond market yesterday, as market participants focused on a substantial long-dated D-Mark issue from LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance and an aggressively-priced Eurolira deal from GECC. Recent tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism and a shortage of 10-year D-Mark denominated Eurobonds provided the main impetus for the launch of LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance's DM1bn deal, according to Deutsche Bank, book-runner for the issue. It said currency strains were likely to prompt more D-Mark issues. The bonds were sold mainly to foreign investors who want to hold D-Mark assets in view of the recent turbulence in the foreign exchange markets. The LKB Baden Wurttemberg bonds, which have a triple-A rating, were priced to yield 18 basis points over the 6 3/4 per cent bund due 2003, providing an annual yield of 6.705 per cent. By late afternoon, the bonds were trading within fees at 99.36 bid, having kept the yield spread of 18 basis points over the bund. The launch of yet another aggressively-priced Eurolira deal - a L200bn, 10-year issue from GECC - drew a stream of fairly caustic comments from rival Eurolira specialists. Credito Italiano, book-runner to the deal, said there was still good retail demand in Switzerland and the Benelux countries for Eurolira bonds, given the relative stability of the currency and the prospect of falling interest rates. The deal comes hard on the heels of a tightly-priced issue from the World Bank, which yielded 9.47 per cent at full fees. GECC's bonds have a coupon of 9.55 per cent and yielded 9.51 per cent at full fees. Market participants complained that the yield pick-up of four basis points over the World Bank issue looked mean, while even Credito Italiano conceded that the deal was 'on the aggressive side'. Abbey National, the UK financial services group, announced yesterday it hoped to tap the nascent Dragon bond market, adding another corporate name to the steady list of borrowers in south-east Asia. The bank, which has a Aa2/AA credit rating, is expected to raise between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m in the three- to five-year maturity range. Abbey National said it was keen to broaden its investor base in Asia using a Dragon bond, an international bond offering listed in Hong Kong or Singapore, and aimed at investors in the region. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, has improved its long-term outlook on the Peoples Republic of China to positive from stable. The agency confirmed China's BBB foreign currency debt rating and its A-2 short term currency debt rating. However, the agency noted: 'Recent political events neither ensure that reform will proceed without interruption nor clarify long-standing questions about China's potentially difficult leadership succession.'</p>

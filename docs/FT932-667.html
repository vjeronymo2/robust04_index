			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Croats and Serbs end south Bosnia fighting SERBS and Croats launched at the weekend a joint offensive on Moslem-held towns in central Bosnia as Croat commanders to the south announced an end to war with the Serbs. Sarajevo radio said dozens of people were killed on Saturday when Croat and Serb forces shelled Maglaj, north of the Bosnian capital. The report could not be independently confirmed. In Sarajevo, seven people were killed when a mortar shell hit the old town centre. The victims, whose ages ranged from four years to 22 years, had been playing on the street, according to a local doctor. Meanwhile, at Bijela kod Konjica in south-west Bosnia, Croat commanders hailed a weekend agreement with local Serbs, their former enemies. 'The time when the Croatian and Serbian soldiers look at each other down a barrel has passed,' said commander Dragan Juric of the Croatian Defence Force (HVO) in the Neretva river valley, the scene of some of the bloodiest Serbo-Croat clashes of the 15-month war in Bosnia. 'The Croatian population and army in this area, faced with a Moslem onslaught, simply would have been destroyed if the Serbs had not offered the hand of salvation,' said commander Drago Simunovic Magda, according to Tanjug, the Serbian news agency. A tactical alliance between Bosnia's Croat and Serbs has emerged as both sides, assuming they have the backing of some key members of the international community, hasten the partition of the former Yugoslav republic. But at international talks in Geneva, Croat leaders have failed to reveal their proposed map on the division of Bosnia. They are also seeking to assert control over Serb-held territory in Croatia's south-west, which cuts the republic in two. Remarks by General Janko Bobetko, the Croat army chief-of-staff, over the weekend dismiss the possibility of a lasting truce with the Serbs. 'It is only a pause for breath before the important events which lie ahead,' Croatian radio reported him as saying. 'The world seems to have accepted Serbian conquests but Croatia cannot and will not accept this.' Croatian President Franjo Tudjman threatened at the weekend to cancel hospitality to Bosnia's Moslem leaders. He said Moslem leaders had used Zagreb as a base for meetings and links to the outside world, while accusing them of 'open aggression and crimes towards the Croatian nation'. Meanwhile, General Rasim Delic, commander of the Moslem-led Bosnian army, warned of a 'general escalation' if his troops were subjected to further joint attacks. He appealed to the UN to enforce a ceasefire agreed earlier this month, Sarajevo radio reported. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, will meet today in Geneva with part of the Bosnian presidency, represented by Croats, Serbs and a single Moslem. Mr Alija Izetbegovic and two key Moslem allies are boycotting the session. They believe the proposed three-way partition is a precursor to a two-way carve-up and the annexation of Bosnia to neighbouring Serbia and Croatia. The only Moslem representative attending the meeting is Mr Fikret Abdic, a rival of Mr Izetbegovic who said he could be assassinated if he travelled to Sarajevo.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ashton-Tate Sued Over dBase: The Torrance-based software firm said it has been  served with a class-action lawsuit filed by a Pennsylvania partnership, Rudolph  Palitz, as a representative of those who licensed Ashton-Tate's dBase database  software products. The lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los  Angeles, seeks unspecified damages based on alleged practices that caused those  licensees to pay more than they might have otherwise. Ashton-Tate said that the  charges are completely without merit and that it will defend vigorously against  them.  </P></p>

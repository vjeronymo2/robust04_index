			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Marat Ospanov, deputy chairman of Kazakhstan's </F> Supreme Kenges, to an unidentified correspondent in Almaty on 31  May--recorded]    [Text] I think we can call the parliament statement a  historical event. For the first ever, such a statement was  released by a parliament that was elected by the people. I  think this is a very timely statement.    Second, I think that the executive power should work  properly  for the benefit of the people.    Third, the executive power and our legislative power should  go along one common road and find one common language. I think  we should be able to work together in the future. In this  respect, the statement is absolutely correct. I think we need  the impetus to embark on a new road.    Fourth, being a new, professional parliament, we should show  the people that we are able to carry out our own policy. We  should not comply with circumstances and, by doing so, bring  more economic hardship and weaker social protection to our  people. We should aim at future changes for the better for the  people. All our 177 deputies thought like this. The country  will never benefit if we do not unite. Our primary aim is to  work for the nation. Our primary aim is to change people's life  for the better.    We should help to firm up our national currency. Prices are  increasing. We should curb this growth. We should stop  irreversible changes in the economy. This is our main concern  and nothing else. We are not against the president or against  the government. We have no such aims. We believe our motives  will be correctly understood.</p>

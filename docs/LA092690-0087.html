			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS / CAPITAL CONTEST;  </P> <P> D.C. MAYOR HOPEFUL WINS VOTES BY PUSHING REFORMS  </P> <P> In a race increasingly centered on this city's crime problem, Democratic  mayoral candidate Sharon Pratt Dixon is holding fast to the "clean house"  philosophy that led to her surprise primary victory earlier this month.  </P> <P> Dixon is using the same message she used to defeat three members of the City  Council and the District of Columbia delegate to Congress in the Democratic  primary campaign: charging that her Republican opponent -- the district's  former police chief -- is "part of the problems" the city faces. During the  primary, the 46-year-old district native urged voters to kick out the present  city Democratic Administration.  </P> <P> SOFT ON CRIME?: Days after her upset win, Dixon's opponent, Republican Maurice  T. Turner, charged her with being "soft on crime," and the issue has driven the  campaign since. Dixon's response has been to continue capitalizing on the  negative emotions lingering after a tumultuous summer highlighted by Mayor  Marion Barry's trial on cocaine possession charges.  </P> <P> "Her theme has struck a responsive chord; she's an outsider and people like  that," said Russell Owens, director of national policy at the Joint Center for  Political and Economic Studies, a black-oriented think tank.  </P> <P> Dixon is not a newcomer to the city's rough-and-tumble political scene, though.  "She's not a political novice, she's just not been involved in the Barry  Administration or the City Council," Owens said.  </P> <P> The winner of the Democratic primary generally wins the mayor's race in this  city, where significantly more than two-thirds of the voters are Democrats. But  Turner, who became a Republican just a few months ago, is well-respected and  could prove to be a viable opponent, said the joint center's research director,  Milton Morris.  </P> <P> Dixon's experience in private business drew voters to her camp, as did the fact  that "she was the first and only one who came out and demanded that Barry step  down and get out of the election" after his January arrest at the Vista Hotel,  city public affairs specialist Michael Simpson said.  </P> <P> But the Washington milieu "goes way beyond an anti-Marion Barry sentiment,"  said Stephen Raiche, chairman of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for Ward  3E, a mixed-race area that Dixon captured. "She tapped a very strong anti-D.C.  government sentiment."  </P> <P> Dixon also offers voters a varied and diverse background.  </P> <P> "She's very aggressive and very determined," said Dixon's aunt, Aimee Pratt,  who helped raise Dixon and her sister after their mother died when Dixon was 4.  "Instead of jumping rope when she was young, she'd play '20 Questions.' "  </P> <P> Dixon graduated with honors from Howard University's law school and went to  work at the practice of her father, now-retired Superior Court Judge Carlisle  E. Pratt. Later she became the first black woman to be named a vice president  at Potomac Electrical Power Co., where she worked for 13 years.  </P> <P> POLITICAL BACKGROUND: Her political education blossomed with former husband  Arrington Dixon, a past district council chairman. She was vice chairwoman of  the D.C. Law Revision Commission, which transferred the local criminal code  from Congress to the city, and served on the Democratic National Committee for  a dozen years, part of that time as treasurer.  </P> <P> Dixon's daughter, Aimee, 21, accompanies her on campaign appearances and her  son, Drew, 19, helps in fund raising.  </P> <P> If she is elected, Dixon says, she will cut the city payroll by 2,000 jobs to  help reduce the city's runaway budget deficit. She also has proposed a capital  growth fund to help minority businesses get established.  </P></p>

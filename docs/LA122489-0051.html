			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCHANGE RULES  </P> <P> Here's some important news regarding tax-deferred real estate exchanges that  should interest many of your readers. Those who followed the progress of tax  law changes this year know that last July the House of Representatives passed a  bill to require that property transferred and property acquired in a  "like-kind" property exchange under Section 1031 of the tax code must be  "similar or related in service or use." This threatened to prevent swaps  between different types of property.  </P> <P> But the day before Thanksgiving, Congress dropped the proposed restrictions and  left the meaning of "like-kind" right where it's been for years. So virtually  any type of real estate held for business use or investment can still be traded  tax-free for any other real estate. In simple terms, you can still trade an  investment condo for a shopping center or an office building for raw land, or  apartments for an industrial building, or any other combination you can  imagine.  </P> <P> Congress also left open the minimum holding time before property can be  exchanged. The House had proposed a one-year minimum, but this too was dropped.  </P> <P> However, the new law has imposed tough new restrictions on exchanges involving  "related persons," so readers should consult with their tax advisers to make  sure they properly arrange their trades with an independent party to avoid this  trap. Family members, trusts and related corporations are particularly  dangerous trading partners now.  </P> <P> RICHARD L.

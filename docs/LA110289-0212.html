			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINA AIMS FINANCIAL LURES AT EMIGRE COLLEGE GRADUATES  </P> <P> China, facing a severe brain drain, announced financial incentives today to woo  back thousands of college graduates overseas who refused to return after  soldiers crushed the student-led democracy movement.  </P> <P> Liu Jialin of the Ministry of Personnel, which oversees employment, said new  regulations are expected to aid and subsidize scientific and technological  activities of returnees involved in research.  </P> <P> Preference will be shown to the newly returned who are "promising, young and  have a low academic position" and could not normally expect to get funds from  other channels, New China News Agency said.  </P> <P> It was the first detailed announcement of a program aimed at luring back  students since the crackdown on pro-demoncracy demonstrators June 3 and 4. Many  Western nations have allowed Chinese students fearful of returning to remain  beyond the expiration of their visas.  </P> <P> A July poll conducted by Chinese students at Harvard University showed that  only 1% of the 50,000 Chinese studying in the United States planned to return  to China. Nearly 58% said that before the Beijing crackdown they had intended  to return to what they perceived as a rapidly liberalizing China.  </P></p>

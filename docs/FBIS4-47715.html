			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 30 SAPA -- The magnificent  achievement of the SA [South African] Police [SAP] in keeping  the election virtually violence free, shows that South Africa  has a first rate police service, which deserves the support of  all its people, Minister of Law and Order Mr Hernus Kriel said  on Saturday [30 April]. "Keeping voters' faith and ensuring  South Africa's first democratic election was not disrupted was  probably the biggest challenge in the history of the SAP."    Mr Kriel said the professionalism and sheer hardwork of  members of the force, far exceeded the call of duty. The  performance of the police has shown that members of the force  were fully committed to democracy and defending the constitution.    Mr Kriel congratulated the Commissioner of Police Gen Johan  van der Merwe and every man and woman of the force for their  indispensable contribution to democracy. A sincere word of  thanks should also go to the SA National Defence Force for ably  supporting the SAP in its task, Mr Kriel said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kholodov: "General Tragedy: Russia </F> Threatened From the West Once Again"]    [Text] A new disaster threatens Russia in the very near  future -- general unemployment. Withdrawal of forces from  Eastern Europe will be concluded in August of this year, and a  large number of highly placed military officials will have to  find positions for themselves in Russia.    The huge Western grouping numbers 600,000 persons. The  position of the commander-in-chief of the Western Group of  Forces corresponded to the rank of a general of the army, and  naturally Colonel-General Burlakov, who presently occupies it,  and his deputies are not counting on a demotion when they  transfer to Russia. There are many personal friends of Pavel  Grachev among them. It would be sufficient to name that same  General Burlakov, who gave the keys to a new Mercedes as a  wedding present to Grachev's son and the daughter of General  Kharchenko. Now Burlakov is on track for a job as chief of  General Staff or, at the worst, commander of the Moscow Military  District.    Grachev himself has long been endeavoring to clean up the  generals' Olympus. In the fall of last year he announced to a  small government circle that he intended to dismiss six of his  close associates -- generals Mironov, Kuznetsov, Deynekin,  Semenov, and even the Afghanistan veteran Gromov. Then, however,  no one really understood what Grachev was intending.  Nonetheless, he is gradually freeing the prestigious fifth floor  of the Defense Ministry building; the telephones of his  deputies, generals Mironov and Toporov, are no longer being  answered. Grachev unleashed a main military "inspection" upon  the command of the Moscow Military District -- to seek  shortcomings. When on 4 February, during an official visit to  the Taman Division the vehicle carrying the Russian and French  defense ministers collided with a truck, Grachev rather bluntly  promised to deal with the present commander of the Moscow  Military District, Leontiy Kuznetsov.    A report that Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov  submitted his retirement papers fits into that same operatic  scenario. The Information and Press Directorate of the RF  Ministry of Defense denied this, and General Kolesnikov himself  directly declared: "Our door is open, we are always ready for  frank, constructive discussion. We made no secrets of our plans  or of the status of the armed forces, and are making no secrets  of our work."    The "Western" generals enjoy a great advantage. These are  rich people by our yardsticks. The average wage of Russian  generals in Germany is 1,200-1,500 marks, at the same time that  a respectable automobile could be acquired there for a couple of  hundred, or even for free, if the vehicle fails to meet  ecological standards and is destined to be scrapped.    Service in the Western Group of Forces was considered to be  a  privilege in the army. In former times, officers were sent there  after serving in a hot spot on the basis of a direct order from  Grachev. However, this order was not followed completely.  General Burlakov had never been in any hot spots.    The massive influx of generals from the West threatens to  ruin the Russian Army's administration. New jobs are hastily  being created. Pavel Grachev voiced the idea of resurrecting the  operational sectors that used to stand over the districts and  were abolished under Marshal Yazov. This idea would make sense  if everything wasn't being done for the sake of creating jobs.  Such a chair could also be fabricated out of mobile forces  quickly slapped together to accommodate someone's rear end. As a  result of restructuring the administration, the Moscow Military  District risks being left without communications: The central  signal brigade is being taken away from the district and placed  into the composition of mobile forces. It will take time and  money to set up a new brigade.    Russia has found itself with too many generals. Awarding  general ranks before referendums has become a real tradition. In  April, 187 persons received the big stars. Around another dozen  did so before the December elections. As a result, the annual  production volume of generals quintupled in comparison with the  Soviet period.    The last reduction in general staff was carried out by  Marshal Yazov in 1989. At that time, under public pressure, the  central administration of the ministry shrank substantially  (especially the Main Political Directorate), and in the words of  deceased Marshal Akhromeyev, the Union was left with 1,700  generals. Now the ministry has recovered -- never before had the  defense minister had so many deputies.    Pavel Grachev is to set off for Germany on 13 March, after  which he will probably turn in his suggestions to Yeltsin  regarding appointments of generals of the Western Group of  Forces. The generals are making ready to move. Many already have  apartments here in Russia. The situation is complicated by the  fact that withdrawal of the troops from the Baltics is also  coming to its conclusion simultaneously.    General unemployment may become a fatal blow to the country.  These aren't miners accustomed to living in barracks. Even  before the first light of day, black Volgas surround the  fashionable multistory buildings on Rublevskiy Highway. Generals  of different ranks -- one, two, three stars -- come out of their  homes and board their transportation together with their wives  and children.    Personal use of official transportation has become the  scourge of the Russian Army. Generals use it to drive to and  from work and to vacation homes, and to drive their families  here and there. Those who are not entitled to a Volga by their  position (as an example, an automobile is provided in the Moscow  Military District only to two persons -- the commander and the  chief of staff) make use of transportation allocated to the  needs of an entire directorate or department.    Officers working for such a department naturally never see  the vehicle, and as they carry out their operational  assignments, they curse the whole world for having to ride the  crowded metro. A list of motor vehicles our correspondents  discovered at the homes of generals on Rublevskiy Highway is  published below. We ask the General Procurator to verify that  the vehicles are being used in compliance with Defense Ministry  Order No 22, Order No 60 (a secret order listing the persons  using transportation) and Government Decree No 1159.    87-93 MMZ, 59-22 MMG, 24-29 MMZh, 42-80 MMZh (a pickup),  04-44 MOK, 36-63 SP, 00-85 MMA, 04-64 MZ (a UAZ), 2257 MMZh,  35-52 MMKh, 00-07 DT, 38-22 MMYe, 97-09 MMZh, 15-88 MMA, 06-60  MOK, 28-87 MOL, 15-32 ZhSh, 03-00 MKS, 07-80 MMD, 38-55 MMYe,  04-61 MOT, 15-46 MMA, 00-63 MMZ, 17-75 MMV, 83-11 LYe, 26-00 MOL.</p>

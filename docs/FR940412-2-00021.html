Section 4(j) of the CPSA provides further that before establishing its agenda and priorities for action, the Commission shall conduct a public hearing and provide an opportunity for the submission of comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Selection of priorities from the Commission's agenda of projects and programs is a crucial step in the development of the Commission's budget for each fiscal year. The Office of Management and Budget requires all Federal agencies to submit their budget requests 13 months before the beginning of each fiscal year. The Commission is beginning the process of formulating its budget request for fiscal year 1996, which begins on October 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, the Commission will conduct a public hearing on May 12, 1994, to receive comments from the public concerning its agenda and priorities for fiscal year 1996. The Commissioners desire to obtain the views of a wide range of interested persons including consumers; manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers of consumer products; members of the academic community; consumer advocates; and health and safety officers of state and local governments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is charged by Congress with protection of the public from unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products. The Commission enforces and administers the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (15 U.S.C. 1471  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); and the Refrigerator Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1211  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Standards and regulations issued under provisions of those statutes are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations, title 16, chapter II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Commission has broad jurisdiction over products used by consumers in or around their homes, in schools, in recreation, and other settings, its staff and budget are limited. Section 4(j) of the CPSA expresses Congressional direction to the Commission to establish an agenda for action each fiscal year and to select from that agenda a limited number of projects for priority attention. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission priorities are selected in accordance with the Commission statement of policy governing establishment of priorities codified at 16 CFR 1009.8. That policy statement includes the following factors to be considered by the Commission when selecting its priorities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Frequency and severity of injuries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Causality of injuries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Chronic illness and future injuries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Costs and benefits of Commission action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Unforeseen nature of a risk of injury. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vulnerability of the population at risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Probability of exposure to hazard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order of listing of these criteria does not indicate their relative importance. The Commission will consider these criteria to the extent feasible and as interactively as possible when evaluating each candidate project in the selection of its priorities for fiscal year 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons who desire to make oral presentations at the hearing on May 12, 1994, should call or write Sheldon Butts, Deputy Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, telephone (301) 504&hyph;0800, telefax (301) 504&hyph;0127, not later than April 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presentations should be limited to approximately ten minutes. Persons desiring to make presentations must submit the written text of their presentations to the Office of the Secretary not later than May 5, 1994. The Commission reserves the right to impose further time limitations on all presentations and further restrictions to avoid duplication of presentations. The hearing will begin at 10 a.m. on May 12, 1994, and will conclude the same day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments on the Commission's agenda and priorities for fiscal year 1996, should be received in the Office of the Secretary not later than May 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Sadye E.

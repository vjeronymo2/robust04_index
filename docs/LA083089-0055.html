			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Don R. O'Hare, 67, chairman of Sundstrand Corp., will retire as an employee and  officer effective Sept. 30. He will act as a consultant to Harry C.  Stonecipher, president and chief executive, and will continue as chairman of  the board. Aerospace contractor Sundstrand, based in Rockford, Ill., pleaded  guilty to federal contract fraud last year and agreed to pay a $115-million  fine, the largest fraud settlement in Defense Department history. Several  shareholders have filed suit against the board and some officers, saying they  should be personally liable for the penalties.  </P></p>

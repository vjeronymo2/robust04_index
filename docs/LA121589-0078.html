			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ALASKA VOLCANO ERUPTS, SENDS ASH 7 MILES HIGH  </P> <P> Redoubt volcano southwest of Anchorage shook with thousands of small  earthquakes Thursday, then erupted and shot a cloud of ash 7 miles high.  </P> <P> The eruption of the 10,197-foot volcano began shortly after 10 a.m. and lasted  for an hour, U.S. Geological Survey geologist Don Richter said.  </P> <P> "It's steaming vigorously," volcanologist Tom Miller said on his return from a  flight to the volcano 100 miles southwest of Anchorage. "There's steady  pulsating and a steam cloud but no more ash."  </P> <P> He said there was no immediate evidence of a lava flow.  </P> <P> The eruption followed 24 hours of constant warning tremors, which calmed down  after the eruption ended, then picked up again, Miller said. Scientists were  unable to predict whether Redoubt would settle down or explode again.  </P> <P> Workers were evacuated from the Drift River crude oil storage site 22 miles  from the exploding mountain, but there appeared to be no danger to the facility  and 37 million gallons of oil stored there from Cook Inlet drilling platforms,  Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co. manager Harold Mouser said. He said no tankers were  due to pick up oil at the facility until next week.  </P> <P> The ash plume -- which shot 35,000 feet above the 2-mile-high mountain -- was  carried toward Anchorage by strong winds, National Weather Service  meteorologist Bob Hopkins said. But the ash cloud skirted Anchorage and dusted  towns beyond the city.  </P> <P> Wasilla and other small cities north of Anchorage received light ash fall, said  Kevin Koechlein, emergency services coordinator for the Matanuska-Susitna  Borough. "I have a pile of it sitting on my desk," he said of the fine, sandy  ash.  </P> <P> Terrie Godfrey of the Wasilla Chamber of Commerce said that the ash is "thick  enough that I had to turn my windshield wipers on. There's little bitty  speckles."  </P> <P> Radio stations warned people with respiratory problems to remain inside because  of the ash.  </P> <P> Ash was falling over unpopulated mountainous areas also, and some of the debris  was dissipating in the atmosphere, officials said.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration issued flight restrictions, warning pilots  to steer 15 miles clear of Redoubt because ash can damage jet engines.  Anchorage International Airport officials reported no interference with flights  such as occurred in 1986, when Augustine volcano erupted.  </P> <P> Miller said his surveillance flight showed that the volcano blew a hole in a  vent left over from its last eruption more than 20 years ago. Redoubt erupted  in 1902, 1933 and several times during a period of activity from 1965 to 1968.  </P> <P> He said there was no indication that the eruption and heavy steaming were  suddenly melting snow on the mountain, which occurred during Redoubt's 1966  eruption and caused flash flooding on the Drift River. The oil storage area  there, built after Redoubt's last eruption, is protected by dikes in case of  new flooding, Mouser said.  </P> <P> A dozen oil workers at Drift River were the closest people to the volcano, and  Mouser said they would stay out of the area until it is safe to return.  </P> <P> Redoubt gave short notice that it might explode. The mountain, visible from  Anchorage on a clear day, let off a little steam last week, as all active  volcanoes do occasionally. But it was not until seismic monitors showed  constant earth tremors Wednesday and Thursday that geologists and emergency  services officials mobilized.  </P></p>

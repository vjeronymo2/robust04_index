			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "On Behalf of LDPR" rubric: </F> "This Is What Zhirinovskiy Thinks..."]    [Text] The editorial board has received a letter from the  Russian Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] signed by its chairman  V. Zhirinovskiy and A. Moiseyev, deputy of the State Duma of the  Russian Federation, concerning the active debate on the future  development of Kaliningrad Oblast among Russian and foreign  circles. The letter states that no Russian can remain  indifferent toward the oblast's future, because the latter is  responsible for Russia's geopolitical situation, the reliability  of its borders, and the stability of economic relations. The  LDPR proceeds from the fact that the fate of Kaliningrad is a  historical reality that emerged after World War II. Kaliningrad  is part of Russia and it will remain so forever.    However, some people are currently trying to distort the  official party stand by speaking about LDPR's alleged readiness  to make concessions to other states in the Kaliningrad issue.  This is an open fraud. Its aim is obvious -- to force the  constituents to turn away from the party and degrade the  importance of its victory in the 1993 parliamentary elections.  Residents of Kaliningrad and its oblast must know that the LDPR  speaks out for the immediate resolution of the regional economic  problems, the buildup of the military and trade ports, the  development of relations with foreign partners, and the  surmounting of transit difficulties through the adjacent  territory.    At the same time, the party notes that any economic reforms  and experiments are senseless if they infringe upon the  Russians' rights, who are turned into second-rate people  attending to rich foreigners. Such reforms are doomed, and the  LDPR will offer a tough resistance to them.    Enjoying support from millions of its constituents, the LDPR  is ready to work in the interests of the residents of  Kaliningrad and its oblast.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Islamic Hamas Movement </F> spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah by correspondent Muhammad Tishkar in  Beirut; date not given]    [Excerpt] In the name of God, the merciful and the  compassionate. The Palestinian Islamic Hamas Movement has  announced that it rejects the dispatch of UN forces to the West  Bank and the Gaza Strip in order to protect the Palestinians.  Hamas Movement spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah said in a telephone  interview that this plan is designed to circumvent the basic  problem, which is the presence of the Zionist occupation and the  Zionist settlers on Palestinian territory. He affirmed that the  PLO's purpose in making this suggestion is to attempt to tone  down the escalating opposition among the Palestinian people  inside and outside Palestine to enable the organization to  resume its negotiations with the Zionist occupation. Ghawshah  noted that the dispatch of UN observers will not ensure  protection for the Palestinian people. Even if the UN Security  Council decides to send armed forces to protect the  Palestinians, he said, these forces will not be able to provide  such protection. Proof of this is that thousands of UN armed  forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina could not prevent massacres there.  [passage omitted]</p>

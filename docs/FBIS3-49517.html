[passage omitted]    The next speaker to come to the Czech radio microphone was  Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski.

We think it is an innovative, constructive,  and optimistic program. As we have often been saying, our  problem with this program is that, although it is a step in the  right direction, it is a very small step, because this program  does not provide a clear prospect for our NATO membership. We  have noticed, unfortunately, that in all the Western  institutions in which we are seeking membership, there are  various stages of preparation for our membership. No promise  has been given to us that we will actually get this membership.  This is where the essence of Polish criticism lies. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

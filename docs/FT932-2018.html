			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Observer: Number one While many no doubt forgot that yesterday was Father's Day, woe betide any one who forgets Mother's Day. That's certainly the case in the US where pop's day runs a distant second to mom's day on most counts. US mothers had their special day for 58 years before their spouses were so honoured. They also still get 50 million more cards, as well as far more phone calls from the kids than the fathers get on their appointed occasion. But US dads can still claim one victory over their wives. According to AT &amp; T the portion of collect calls on Father's Day was 27 per cent higher last year than on Mother's Day.</p>

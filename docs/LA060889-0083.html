			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED LAW HAS BUSINESS THINKING ABOUT SMOG  </P> <P> Clarence Walthall probably won't get the notice in the mail from the county  until early next year, but he's already thinking about it. Walthall is the  operations manager of Petoseed Co. in Saticoy -- "in charge of everything that  doesn't have to do with seeds," as he puts it -- and the notice he's expecting  will require his company to change the commuting habits of the 160 people who  work there.  </P> <P> Walthall has a few ideas already: preferred parking places for car-poolers,  flexible hours for some employees, awards for those departments with the most  ride-sharing. But it's likely to be an uphill battle. "Flex-time" isn't an  option for most of his workers. And rush-hour traffic, while congested, isn't  bad enough to encourage most people to share a car or throw themselves on the  mercy of notoriously circuitous bus routes. In the end, he says, "I'm just  going to have to call them in here group by group and sell it to them."  </P> <P> Most other big employers in Ventura County will be going through the same  frustrating routine soon. Next week, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors  will consider an air-pollution control rule that would force companies with 50  or more employees to draw up so-called "trip-reduction" plans, designed to cut  the number of commuter trips in cars and trucks. The measure is expected to  pass.  </P> <P> If the plan succeeds in Ventura County, it will be a first. No other locality  has tried to cut air pollution with such measures, although a few have  succeeded in thinning peak-hour traffic. And the local business community is  less than enthusiastic about a rule that could dramatically affect work  schedules and business hours.  </P> <P> The rule is similar to a requirement recently imposed on the four-county Los  Angeles region by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Spokesman  William Kelly said the South Coast agency has rejected about 40% of the  companies' ride-sharing plans so far. "A lot of the companies seem to want to  do the minimal amount required -- as little as possible," he said.  </P> <P> If the Ventura County ride-sharing rule meets its goal, it will reduce air  pollution in the county by only about one-half of one percent. But its symbolic  value is considerable. It would be the first regulation in Ventura County aimed  at reducing smog from "mobile" sources -- such as cars and trucks -- rather  than "stationary" sources such as factories and oil fields. As such, the rule  is probably an indication of things to come, as county and federal officials  struggle over the next few years to attain federal clean air standards.  </P> <P> Though Ventura County has suffered only two smog alerts in the last six years,  its pollution problems are among the worst in the nation. In fact, the Air  Pollution Control District has never set forth a strategy to meet federal air  quality standards -- a violation of federal law which led a local environmental  group, Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, to file suit in an effort to force  tougher smog-fighting measures.  </P> <P> Under terms of a settlement last February, the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency has until June, 1991, to prepare a clean air strategy for Ventura  County. County air pollution officials are working with the EPA on the plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Court Orders Feared  </P> <P> The ride-sharing rule is one step in that direction. "We are trying to avoid a  situation where some federal judge says: 'Employees in Ventura County can drive  to work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only,' " said County Supervisor Susan  Lacey.  </P> <P> The county doesn't intend to force people out of their cars, at least not  directly. Rather, it may require large employers to draw up plans to encourage  their employees to share rides or commute during off-peak hours --  specifically, before 6 a.m. and after 10 a.m. Those hours are considered  critical because pollutants emitted from vehicles during morning hours "bake"  in the air on hot, still days to create afternoon smog.  </P> <P> Although company officials could be fined or even jailed if they refuse to draw  up the trip-reduction plans, they cannot be penalized if their employees do not  reduce their trips. For the most part, the county will take the word of  companies that the plans are being followed, although it will require a  progress report each year.  </P> <P> Most organized business leaders in the county, including the Ventura County  Economic Development Assn., support the rule. But individual firms vary in  their commitment to the cause.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Old Plans Exist  </P> <P> Some have old ride-sharing plans dating to the energy crisis of the late 1970s.  GTE instituted an extensive, employer-subsidized van pool and private bus  system when it moved its corporate headquarters from Santa Monica to Thousand  Oaks four years ago. "We plan to do this at least until construction of the  Ventura Freeway is done and possibly thereafter," said spokesman Larry Cox.  </P> <P> Other employers fear that they will not be able to induce their workers to  change their habits, especially if they live close to work. "Car-pooling may  not make sense here," said Connie Taylor, public information officer at the  Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center. Many of the base's 10,000  employees live "almost on the perimeter of the base," Taylor said.  </P> <P> Transportation experts acknowledge that it will be difficult for companies to  meet the goals required of them, especially in a suburban county where  dependence on the automobile is high and traffic congestion is not as great as  it is in a large city such as Los Angeles. "There is no perceived need;  therefore the effort is going to be so much more difficult," said Tricia Price,  head of the Ventura office of Commuter Transportation Services, a nonprofit  organization that runs the Commuter Computer and assists companies with  ride-sharing plans.  </P> <P> The most successful ride-sharing programs typically involve employees who  travel long distances to work. For example, more than 10% of the 2,500  employees who work at GTE's corporate headquarters use the company's private  buses and van pools -- many from such distant locations as Long Beach and San  Bernardino. These employees pay, on average, about $60 to $70 per month for the  van service, but such fees only cover about a third of the cost. GTE picks up  the rest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Help Seen  </P> <P> By the same token, flexible work hours may be not be much help in achieving the  goals because of the expansive definition of morning rush hours -- 6 a.m. to 10  a.m. For example, the Naval Ship Weapons System Engineering Station at Port  Hueneme, which has a mostly white-collar work force of 2,000 people, permits  flexible work hours. But, said spokesman Russ Pyle, "we have to be at work by  9."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Executive  Officer Richard Baldwin pointed out, a four-day, 10-hour-per-day work schedule  might be an effective tool to cut morning rush hour trips. Such schedules are  still relatively rare, although in Los Angeles, virtually all 900 employees of  the Air Quality Management District work a "4/10" schedule. Pyle said the Port  Hueneme engineering operation has a four-day work week as an option, but no  survey has been conducted to determine how many employees use it.  </P> <P> Cities elsewhere have experienced some success at reducing traffic through  car-pooling plans.  </P> <P> For example, the Northern California city of Pleasanton has aggressively  required developers to reduce employees' commuting trips. In commending  Pleasanton's efforts, urban planners around the U.S. have pointed to the city's  dramatic results: 54% of all commuters either ride mass transit or drive during  off-peak hours. But because the Pleasanton ordinance is designed to reduce  traffic congestion, not smog, the definition of "peak" hours is narrow:  7:30-8:30 a.m. and 4:30-5:30 p.m. Only 15% of the employees walk, bicycle, or  ride a bus to work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company Pride Helps  </P> <P> Transportation experts say that corporate pride plays a role in implementing  ride-sharing plans. Pasadena consultant Peter Valk, who has assisted L.A.-area  companies in complying with the ride-sharing rule there, acknowledged that his  clients may be reluctant at first to push hard. "But once they face the reality  of having to make the investment, they figure they might as well make it pay  off, both symbolically and in a real dollar way," he said.  </P> <P> In Pleasanton, city transportation director Gail Gilpin said the bad publicity  associated with not meeting the ride-sharing targets often motivates businesses  to try harder. "All the information that comes through my office is on the  public record, so if they don't reach their goal, it gets into the press real  easily," she said. "That disincentive is probably greater than any fine."  </P> <P> If the rule is approved, the Air Pollution Control District will begin working  with companies of 100 employees or more next year. Companies of 75 to 99  employees will be affected in 1991, and companies with 50 to 74 employees will  be affected in 1992.  </P> <P> The county has about 580 companies with 50 or more employees; together, these  companies employ about half the county's 250,000-member work force. The rule  will apply only to employees who must report to the same location at least 10  days per month. Most field workers will be exempt.  </P> <P> Under the trip-reduction rule, each company's "average vehicle ridership" must  rise from an average of about 1.1 persons per vehicle today to 1.35 initially  and 1.5 by 1997.  </P></p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Novopharm appeals Zantac ruling NOVOPHARM, a Toronto-based generic drug maker, said it would appeal the recent US court ruling upholding American patents on Glaxo's ulcer drug, Zantac, writes Robert Gibbens. Novopharm and another Canadian generic producer argue that Glaxo's two US patents on Zantac, expiring in 1995 and 2002, are really the same and should end in 1995.</p>

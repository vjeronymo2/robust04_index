The money  comes mainly from illegal drugs and arms dealing and is  laundered via more than 200 private banks and foreign exchange  bureaus, as well as foreign branches of Serbian banks.    The BND says that the blackmailing of officials is a common  practice both in setting up new banks and in banks' business  transactions. Several political groups are said to be involved  in cooperating with organized crime.</p>

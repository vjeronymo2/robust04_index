			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: ROC Taiwan Fund makes equity offer THE ROC Taiwan Fund, a closed-end investment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and one of several quoted funds to invest in the Taiwan stock market, is launching an international equity offering which could raise Dollars 45m in new money, writes Sara Webb. The ROC Taiwan Fund plans to increase the number of its shares from 25m to 29m by offering 2m shares in North America and a further 2m to international investors. The shares have currently been trading at around Dollars 11 1/8 with a premium of about 17 per cent to the net asset value (NAV), according to Credit Suisse First Boston, the lead manager for the international tranche. First Boston Corporation is lead manager for the North American part of the issue. The shares will be priced at the beginning of April. Taiwan's central bank said earlier this year that it would restrict the flow of equity investment funds into the island, much to the annoyance of Taiwan fund managers. The central bank has delayed the approval of remittances of funds by foreign firms investing in Taiwanese stocks because of concern about the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar against the US dollar.</p>

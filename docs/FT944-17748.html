			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (7): Building for success - Andrew Fisher studies innovation at HILTI Group 'Innovation is very, very important to us,' says Mr Pius Baschera, head of the executive board at Hilti, the Liechtenstein-based maker of fastening systems for the construction industry. This year, the company is spending SFr70m (Pounds 35m), roughly 3 per cent of turnover, on research and development. It is also introducing more than 50 new products to its range of power drills, screw- and nail-guns, chisels, and pneumatic and adhesive fastening equipment. But, says Mr Baschera, innovation at the company goes far beyond the products. It extends to the manufacturing process, logistics and marketing. Hilti, which employs more than 12,000 people worldwide, is also subjecting its management structures and attitudes to a decisive blast of innovation. It has laid down that no board member should stay in office beyond the age of 56 - the average age of the present board is 46 - and that their contracts should run for three years, with renewal depending on performance. The idea says, Mr Michael Hilti, chairman of the (non-executive or supervisory) board of directors and son of the founder, Mr Martin Hilti, is to keep management alert and to encourage those still climbing the corporate ladder. 'We want to give young people a chance to move into the high ranks. If they're 40 to 45 years old, they can really contribute their best to the company.' Mr Baschera, he noted, was only 39 when he joined the executive board. 'It's too long if you stay in the board until 60.' Baschera is now 44 and the younger Hilti 48. The oldest board member is 54. Two executive board members in their mid-50s retired last year after the new rule came in; one is on the non-executive board, the other has joined the trust owning the shares in the company. Michael Hilti also left the executive board, stepping up to the supervisory board in a full-time role when his father bowed out at nearly 80. Because Hilti's markets are so widely spread - last year's turnover of SFr2.1bn was achieved in more than 100 countries from plants in Germany, the UK, the US, Austria and Hungary, as well as Liechtenstein - it is keen to focus its manufacturing and sales efforts as efficiently as possible. Thus it has changed the way its plants are organised, reordered its sales force and tightened its management. Its 6,000 salesmen now concentrate on specialist customer areas such as construction, mechanical and electrical engineering, general industry and government. This segmentation approach, already introduced in Germany (its biggest customer, accounting for 20 per cent of business) has led to much closer links with customers, says Mr Michael Hilti. The company's new computerised information system has made it possible for managers to be much more mobile and in touch with customers and the shopfloor. 'We want people to be really down in the organisation, especially top management. We don't want them sitting in a glass house, however nice it is,' he adds, gesturing to the big office window and the mountains beyond. Hilti also places great stress on educating up-and-coming managers and developing their potential. 'We give responsibility very young, earlier than other companies,' explains Mr Baschera. 'We have a lot of general managers in their early 30s and our experience with them has been very good.' On the manufacturing side, the company has assigned each plant a core technology, thus concentrating its efforts. It has also introduced a more team-oriented approach in the plants, with managers responsible for a range of functions such as quality, maintenance, planning and personnel. This has speeded up manufacturing times and boosted productivity, though Mr Baschera declines to give figures. As well as motivating younger managers, Mr Hilti says the more streamlined management structure keeps the more experienced ones on their toes and prevents empire-building. Managers tend to stay in their jobs for a maximum of five years. 'This gives air to the system.'</p>

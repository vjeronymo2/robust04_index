			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (9): Oil - the state's most prized resource / The industry needs investment that the government does not possess OIL remains the most prized and precious resource of the Russian state: the one which gives this, of all the states of the former union, the best long chances of success - if the industry, now failing, can be renewed and revived. In the short-term, the industry presents a grim picture. The London-based Centre of Global Energy studies forecast earlier this month that the 515m tonnes of production last year from all the former Union republics - dominated by Russia, but with significant production from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan - would fall to between 460-470m tonnes in 1992. Separate figures from the World Energy Analysis and Forecasting Group earlier this year show Russia down from a level of 462m tonnes this year to between 396-412m this. At the same time, demand in these states would remain high - at about 420-470m tonnes in spite of falling production - because of difficulties in the supply of other energy sources, notably coal and nuclear electric power. On this analysis, it is easy to see states formerly oil-rich realising a scenario only last year dismissed as absurd: that they become oil importers in the first half of the 1990s. To avoid this, the industry needs investment the government does not have, technology the country does not make and management and exploitation skills the industry has not developed. Logic thus points to extensive foreign involvement: as yet, there have been only tentative engagements which give mixed signals. After a prolonged and confusing struggle between different levels of administration, the government awarded a contract for the feasibility study of offshore oil reserves off Sakhalin, in the far east, to the 3M consortium of Mitsui(Japan), McDermott and Marathon Oil, (both US). The award of the feasibility study would normally be expected to result in a substantive exploitation contract - but while this is world practice, there is no precedent in Russia. The French company, Elf Aquitaine, has signed two exploration deals - one with Kazakhstan and one with Russia for exploration in the Saratov Volgograd area. In doing so, it has put itself ahead of the rest of the foreign companies, who still worry about legislation, tax rates and political instability: Elf executives admit to the risk, but decided to plunge. These worries are real and intense. They have not stopped most of the oil majors, and many of the minors and oil service companies, beating paths to the former Soviet Union: but they have, as yet, stopped subtstantial deals. In particular, the recently imposed export tax of 26 per cent a tonne is seen as a big deterrent, and is the particular object of lobbying on the part of the companies. Mr George Reese, the managing partner of consultants Ernst and Young in Moscow, says that 'without the tax, you would have had a dozen major deals by now.' The various authorities still active in the industry compounds the problem. A new Vladimir Lopukhin, is thrashing out legislation: but the state oil company, Rosneftigas, continues to operate as a kind of holding company for the state oil corporations: while the local authorities, especially the republican authorities, like those in Tatarstan and Chechen Ingushetia (both of which, significantly, have declared 'independence' from Russia), insist on oversight at least and more often on the right to choose and to veto. Rosneftigas has taken advice from the Daiwa Bank and from Bankers Trust on how to restructure itself: it remains, however, an anomaly, poised awkwardly between the companies which fund it and the ministry which duplicates many of its functions. Mr Reinhold Heus, head of Daiwa's energy division, says that 'there is now a debate on Rosneftigas' future - it may become a state oil and gas comopany, as we have in the west; it may provide central services for the companies on the purchase and supply side; it may become more of an association. It must justify its existence to the companies: if it doesn't provide a service, then there would be serious questions asked about its existence.' There is now legislation passed on underground resources, and a licensing law is in draft. The latter puts foreign and Russian companies on an equal basis, and proposes an auction system for licensing rights: as in many western countries, the companies cannot buy the wells outright. Further legislation which, it is hoped, will flesh out the details of licensing procedures and pipeline transportation, is now being prepared with the aid of western experts under Professor George Hardy, former Dean of the Law Faculty at Houston University. Domestically, the government has allowed the producers to sell up to 40 per cent of their production at free prices through the oil exchanges (it can be exported only under licence): and it still plans to 'free' prices (up to about one third of world levels) by the middle of this year, a move expected to add 50-70 per cent on all prices. Mr Lopukhin says that he wants to get 'vertical integration' in the industry to bring together the former conglomerates organised territorially: once that is effected, the companies will be transformed into joint stock corporations and shares will be issued. Already, two conglomerates - KNOS and Lukoil - have been formed which unite transport and refining facilities across Russia Change is now relatively rapid, but confusion remains - and even, is multiplied. At the core of it is a still unformed relationship between the centre and the regions on the one hand and the companies on the other. This is not in itself out of line with world practice: Ms Christine Ferguson, a lawyer specialising in energy with the UK law firm, Norton Rose in Moscow, says that 'most western federal countries which are oil producers have disputes between the centre and the states, some of them very bitter. There is usually a deal which splits the proceeds.' For all the confusion, the movement is presently clear: towards greater integration of the industry with the world. Given success for the economic reforms, that integration should proceed.</p>

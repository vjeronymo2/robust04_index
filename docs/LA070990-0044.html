			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TREAR CAN'T BEAT ODDS, FALLS TO BUJON AT LA JOLLA  </P> <P> The odds were not in Anthony Trear's favor. He was 11 years older than his  opponent, Tony Bujon, and he hadn't played a tournament in 2 1/2 years.  Meanwhile, Bujon, 20, was in the prime of his tennis career and coming off a  round of 16 performance at the NCAA's in his hometown of Palm Desert.  </P> <P> For a short while, it looked like Trear, a resident of San Diego, might buck  those odds as he led 4-1 in the first set. But reality and a thing called  physical conditioning became a factor late in the first set and before long  Bujon had swept away Trear, 7-5, 6-2, to win the men's open finals Sunday at  the 74th La Jolla Tennis Tournament at the La Jolla Tennis Club.  </P> <P> In the women's open finals, University of San Diego's Tonya Fuller broke San  Diego State's Dorey Brandt's serve four consecutive times in the second set and  went on to win, 6-4, 7-5.  </P> <P> Trear, who played college tennis at UCLA, began the match by winning 12 points  in a row off his serve and by breaking in the fourth game.  </P> <P> "He started out playing well," said Bujon, a junior at Texas Christian  University. "I'm supposed to win these matches since I'm still in college. I  was a little tight."  </P> <P> But Bujon loosened up by holding his serve and then breaking Trear's serve to  make it 4-3. Trear had a game point, but he netted a forehand approach shot.  </P> <P> "The match seemed to turn after that," Trear said.  </P> <P> It did. Trear was subsequently broken on five of the next six service games to  fall behind 4-1 in the second set.  </P> <P> Trear said he began to feel the effects of his inactivity after the first set.  </P> <P> "I wasn't physically up," Trear said. 'All the matches just caught up to me.  That, combined with him hitting awesome shots."  </P> <P> Bujon's passing shots and volleys were just too much for Trear to handle. And  when Bujon wasn't at the net, he was chasing down Trear's volleys for running  forehand winners.  </P> <P> "I just started getting confident and swinging through the ball," said Bujon,  who was coming off a month layoff due to surgery on his ingrown toenails.  </P> <P> Fuller trailed in both sets, 4-3 in the first and 3-0 in the second. But each  time she came back by attacking Brandt's forehand.  </P> <P> "Any smart person's going to play my forehand," said Brandt, who was seeded  fourth.  </P> <P> Fuller, seeded fifth, kept the ball in play and forced Brandt to make all the  errors.  </P> <P> "That's my game," said Fuller, who has now beaten Brandt three consecutive  times. "Keeping the ball in play is what won this tournament for me."  </P> <P> It's likely Brandt will have another shot at Fuller. Both will be seniors next  year.  </P></p>

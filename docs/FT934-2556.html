			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Outlying regions boost nationalist party Early parliamentary election results from regions in Russia's far east yesterday showed a late surge for Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, pushing the party ahead in areas distant from power yet suffering the effects of economic reform. In these regions, separated from Moscow by nine time zones, the nationalist LDP was running at more than double the strength of Russia's Choice - 25 per cent of votes cast as against 12. The Communists were just behind at 11 per cent and the Agrarians, Yabloko and Women of Russia each at 7 to 8 per cent. However, as results were coming in from further west, the vote for Russia's Choice and the rural Agrarian party was rising, at the expense of the Liberal Democrats and the Communists. Results for the first 53 of the 89 regions suggested that the Liberal Democrats had won 24.53 per cent; Russia's Choice 14.46 per cent; the Communist party 11.31 per cent; and the Agarian party 8.83 per cent. Nationally, the results are likely to favour the pro-reformists further, because of the stronger support for reform in European Russia, where two-thirds of the population live. Exit polls in both Moscow and St Petersburg, the largest cities in Russia, showed Russia's Choice was significantly ahead, though elsewhere Mr Zhirinovsky was reported to be in the lead. Mr Nikolai Ryabov, head of the Central Electoral Commission, yesterday refused to give a 'general picture' of the voting patterns. But he said that about half of the 13 blocs contending for 225 seats in the lower house elected by party lists would not achieve the necessary 5 per cent qualifying total. He said that 'in a range of regions' the LDP was leading, while in 'several' others it was in second or third place. The new parliament, he said, would show 'a sufficiently wide spectrum of political forces'. The constitution, which required a 50 per cent turnout to be valid and a majority of those voting to be passed, scraped through the first of these barriers, and appeared to have attracted the support of 60 per cent of those voting. However, in a significant number of regions and republics, the 50 per cent barrier was not passed. Though that has no significance for the passing of the constitution, it will be a future point of conflict with those areas which are claiming 'sovereignty' under their own constitutions. The 'hot spots' will be the North Caucasian republic of Chechnya, where no voting was allowed; the Republic of Tatarstan, where only 13 per cent voted and where no members were elected to the upper house of the parliament; and the region of Sverdlovsk, where Mr Eduard Rossel, the former governor, had attempted to change the region into the Urals Republic and where fewer than 50 per cent voted on the Russian constitution - though Mr Rossel was himself elected to the upper house. Other important regions where a 50 per cent vote on the constitution was not achieved were the republics of Ingushetia, Udmurtia and Komi; the regions of Kemerovo, Khabarovsk, Chelyabinsk and Perm; and the autonomous district of Khanty Mansisk.</p>

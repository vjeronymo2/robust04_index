			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: US metals group in silver-linked share issue Freeport-McMoRan has raised Dollars 100m through a silver-linked depositary share offering totalling 4.75m units. The shares were priced last Friday at Dollars 21.01, roughly four times the London fixing price for one ounce of silver. That day, the London price was Dollars 5.2525 per ounce. Dividends on the silver-denominated preferred shares, payable quarterly, have been set at 4.125 per cent per depositary share. The shares, which have a 12-year maturity, are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Freeport, a US-based metals and diversified company, has previously issued two gold-linked depositary shares, but this was the first silver-linked deal ever launched. According to a syndicate official at lead manager Lehman Brothers, the issue was oversubscribed, boosted by expectations of rising silver prices. 'The deal was driven primarily by dedicated natural resources and commodity funds, but also met with good interest from retail investors,' said Mr Hank Erbe, syndicate manager at Lehman Brothers, adding that some 75 per cent of the deal was bought by US-based investors. 'The structure combines the attractiveness of silver with the liquidity of a New York Stock Exchange listing,' said Mr Erbe. 'In addition, the shares carry a very competitive dividend yield.' Although the price of silver has recently been in decline, commodities analysts expect it to rebound towards Dollars 6 per ounce in coming months. At its height in the 1980s it traded at around Dollars 50.</p>

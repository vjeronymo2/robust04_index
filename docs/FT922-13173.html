			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The amazing Mr Chung raises the stakes: Roh's government could be forced to defuse the Hyundai row MORE THAN the fate of Hyundai is at stake in the bitter feud between the group's founder, Mr Chung Ju Yung, and the South Korean government. Hyundai is the country's second largest business group, with activities ranging from cars and shipbuilding to electronics and construction, and the outcome of the conflict could even affect the election of the country's next president and determine the future role of big business in Korea's economic structure and politics. Mr Chung did the unthinkable when he recently created the Unification National Party (UNP) to challenge the government of President Roh Tae Woo. Business has traditionally played a subservient role to government in Korea, providing financial contributions to the political establishment in return for receiving corporate favours. The launch of the party upset this equilibrium, and Mr Chung did it in a way that humiliated the government: the party's success in last month's national assembly elections helped deprive the government of a parliamentary majority. The clash began in earnest last autumn, when the authorities imposed a Dollars 181m (Pounds 105m) penalty tax on the Chung family and 14 Hyundai subsidiaries amid speculation that the Hyundai founder was planning to form his party. The Hyundai group subsequently complained that bank loans were being denied to them under state pressure, while the government was blocking approval of planned stock and bond issues. Legal actions then escalated after the elections. Hyundai's main creditor bank, the Korea Exchange Bank, suspended loans for industrial investments to five key subsidiaries for six months due to violations of credit controls. Hyundai Electronics Industries may lose its important right to unrestricted credit access because it allegedly used bank loans to finance the UNP. Hyundai Merchant Marine has been hit with a Won 27bn (Pounds 20m) tax penalty and several corporate officials have been arrested for alleged tax evasion. The state-run Korea Development Bank has suspended industrial loans to Hyundai because it fears that the group's credit-worthiness will fall as a result of its conflict with the government. The lastest legal sanctions coincide with government worries about the prospect of Mr Chung's standing in December's presidential election. Many political analysts believe that a Chung candidacy would deny victory to the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) in the race for the Blue House, the presidential office: he might split the conservative vote and deliver the election to Mr Kim Dae Jung, the likely candidate for the main opposition Democratic Party, or even squeak through to become president. Mr Chung proved skilful during the assembly elections in overcoming public suspicion of the chaebol, the conglomerates that dominate the Korean economy. His party's advertisements contrasted the international success of Hyundai with the economic problems confronting the country as a whole, including high inflation and a burgeoning trade deficit. The result was that the party captured 17 per cent of the vote. The party's goal is to reduce the government's strict economic controls. Mr Chung, for example, wants to deregulate the financial system. The government is using credit controls as part of an attempt to reduce the economic power of the chaebol, while promoting the growth of small and medium-sized business. Tighter borrowing rules have been imposed on the chaebol in the hope that they will divest some of their widespread industrial activities, although the policy has not been very successful. The chaebol initially grew rapidly due to cheap loans. Mr Chung wants a return to the days of easy credit. He argues that only the success of the chaebol can save the economy. He has also accused the government of favouring the other chaebol. While Hyundai benefited from Mr Chung's friendship with President Park Chung Hee in the 1960s and 1970s, relations between Hyundai and the state have cooled. Mr Chung has claimed that Daewoo, the country's fourth biggest conglomerate, grew under President Chun Doo Hwan in the 1980s because it was granted tax breaks and other privileges to take over ailing concerns. Daewoo is now spearheading proposed corporate investment in North Korea, replacing Hyundai in this government-sanctioned role. 'Why only us?' asks Mr Chung Mong Joon, a son of the Hyundai founder. 'The irregularities that the authorities are charging us with are common practices in domestic business management.' The government denies that it is targeting Hyundai in its examination of financial practices. Officials warn that the other chaebol are also being scrutinised for illegal practices. Analysts wonder how long Hyundai can stand the financial pressure before it starts suffering damage. However, most believe that the government's goal is to frighten Hyundai away from financing the UNP and that it has no intention of inflicting permanent harm. The health of Hyundai is considered too important to the Korean economy. Its 43 subsidiaries generated an unconsolidated turnover of Won 40 trillion (million million) in fiscal 1991, which was equivalent to 17 per cent of the country's gross national product. 'I expect the government will have to back down because of the economic consequences of a Hyundai collapse,' says Professor Sohn Hak-Kyu of Sogang University. 'A retreat by the government will confirm that the chaebol have grown too powerful to control and that they are likely to play a growing role in the political process.' Indeed, there have been signs in the last few days that the government is trying to defuse the situation. It suspended for a week its threat to withdraw unrestricted credit rights from Hyundai Electronics, while a presidential aide met with the current Hyundai chairman, the younger brother of Mr Chung. Although the elder Chung may emerge victorious from his battle with the government, the other chaebol will try to prevent him from using his new political power to benefit Hyundai. They have declared that they may band together to combat Hyundai. Mr Chung will be closely watched to see if he can successfully separate his business interests from his political activity.</p>

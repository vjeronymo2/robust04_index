Its basis was the mis-matched set of  expectations of the two countries, the so-called "world's  largest democracies."    India, which had a "special relationship" with the Soviet  Union, after its collapse sought to establish similar  relationship with the United States. However, all that the  United States wanted was a subservient "poor relative" in the  Indian Ocean region. For this reason, even while the United  States invested in India's economic future, it has made it  clear that it is not willing to see India complicate the  world's power balance by becoming a power like China.    India could, if it wanted to, become a Germany or a Japan,  whose foreign and security policies would be aligned to, or  guided by Washington, all in the interests of global stability  and peace.    So the primary effort of the United States in India in the  past one year has been on the proliferation front. Additional  countries acquiring nuclear weapons are the "joker in the  pack"(as THE ECONOMIST describes it) that are liable to upset  the present international card game. One pincer of this policy  is to delay and halt any addition to India's technological  capabilities that can assist in the making of long-range  missiles.    This was the background to the American demand on the  Russians to block the technology transfer component of the  cryogenic motor deal, as well as the autumn demarche to halt the  deployment of missiles. (This, notwithstanding that Pakistan has  deployed short range missiles on the Indian border for the past  two years and Indian deployments are at least a year away!)    The second and more dangerous leg of this policy is to use  Indian difficulties in Kashmir to compel India to freeze and  roll back its nuclear weapons options--essentially enter into  bilateral or multilateral agreements to place all its nuclear  facilities under safeguards and declare all stocks of fissile  material.    So in a kind of an international "Mutt and Jeff" show,  Pakistan is encouraged to threaten India with nuclear war, and  India is told how dangerous things are and that it must  co-operate to end the threat to regional and world peace. For  that reason, Pakistan's role in facilitating and aiding  terrorist activity in India are ignored.    The tone and tenor of recent remarks indicate that while the  Americans do not recognise India as a "problem" state as they  did in the 1970s or early 1980s, they do not see it as requiring  any high-level attention either. No American President has  visited India since Mr Jimmy Carter, nor for that matter, has  any secretary of state come in the past decade. There does not  seem to be any plans for any visits in the near future either.    The Americans have managed without an ambassador to India.  Of  the three high-level meetings that Mr S.S. Ray managed in  Washington, two were with the vice-president, Mr Al Gore, whose  task was to push the reluctant Indians to commit forces in  Somalia. The third was with the secretary of state, Mr Warren  Christopher, on the eve of his visit to India in November in the  wake of the Robin Raphel imbroglio.    There is a love-hate relationship between India and the  United States. But the reality is that all the loving and hating  is done by India. For its part, the United States scarcely  notices India. As long as India remains poor or militarily weak,  this situation will remain unaltered. India being a democracy or  an "open" society does not count for much; most American  policy-makers would take objection to America being placed in  the same slot with India on these two counts. Their reference is  all right as long as it is confined to provide the rhetorical  flourish to joint statements and declarations.    It is against this background that one has to understand the  strange state of Indo-American relations today. At the political  level, relations between the two countries have never been so  good. The end of the Soviet Union has eliminated all suspicions  in America about India's geopolitical perspectives. Likewise,  official India believes that all is well and that the continuing  dialogue between the two countries has persuaded America to come  around to India's long-held views on disarmament.    America finds it difficult to deal with the third world,  especially non-white nations in a framework of equality that the  international system demands, in form if not in content. So  there are problems in assigning a place to India. A major share  of the problem lies in India itself. It has not decided what it  wants to be and so it does not seem to be moving anywhere. It  has not built up military power and, thus, not quite sought  great power status, yet it is not quite willing to renounce it.  Poverty and persisting misgovernance make mockery of its claim  to be taken seriously as a great nation. Under Mr P.V. Narasimha  Rao, it is attempting to achieve this through another path--that  of economic growth.    The loudest applause is coming from America. America appears  to be bullish about India's economic prospects and companies  like Coca Cola, IBM, and a host of others have made the United  States the leading investor in India, just as it makes it  India's largest trading partner. Were relations to be confined  to the economy or commerce, there would not be much of a  problem. With India signing the GATT treaty, even the remaining  ones have been more or less resolved.    The real difficulties, however, arise from America's  perceived role for itself as the only superpower. The  contradictions in America's positions come through its advocacy  of a test ban even though it has carried out the highest number  of nuclear test explosions, or its call for India and other  countries to desist from producing fissile materials for nuclear  weapons, while the United States itself is acquiring some 500  tonnes of the stuff from the erstwhile Soviet Union.    The biggest stumbling block, however, appears to be  America's  political and cultural perceptions of India. Instead of being  more understanding of India's efforts to construct a nation on  the basis of modern nationalism, a liberal democracy without  regard to caste, creed or colour, the United States, in the name  of human rights, seems to want to encourage sub-national forces  who proclaim the right to nationhood on the basis of religion or  ethnicity. From these strategic misunderstandings arise the  seemingly minor yet damaging, difficulties over Kashmir, Punjab,  or the cryogenic engines.</p>

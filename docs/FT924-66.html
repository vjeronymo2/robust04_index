			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): US brewer moves ahead When James Koch asked distributors eight years ago to carry beer from a brewery he had just started up in Boston, Massachusetts, none took him seriously. 'They thought it was a joke,' Koch said. 'We couldn't get a single distributor to take our brand.' But they are not laughing any more. Koch's creation, the Boston Beer Company, whose flagship is the Sam Adams brand, is now the 13th largest brewer in the US, with 1992 sales up more than 60 per cent on 1991. The beer is sold in nearly all parts of the US and has made inroads into Europe. In Sweden, for instance, Sam Adams is among the top 12 imported beers. 'Having a good product is the best marketing strategy in the world,' Koch said. Koch's success is even more impressive considering the market he competes in. Sam Adams has a distinctive taste, a far cry from the mild variety Americans are used to drinking. Starting out with no advertising budget and no distributor, Koch tried some novel marketing routes. He entered, and continues to enter, his beer in as many taste contests as possible. Winning awards for the best overall American beer four years in a row at the American Brewers' Association tasting contest brought Koch free publicity. The company jealously guards the beer's quality. To make sure the taste is never compromised, the company prints expiry dates on its labels. Koch recalls with humour the first days of Boston Beer Company's existence. 'I had nothing but what was in the bottles,' he explained. 'Because no distributor would take on the brand, I had to go around to Boston bars myself, asking them to offer it to their customers.' Koch is uncertain how much the company will expand. 'This is a strong-tasting beer which will probably only appeal to, say, 2 per cent of Americans. But 2 per cent of the US is a large market. And then there's the export market into Europe.'</p>

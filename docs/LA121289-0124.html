			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Tighter Management: Distributed Logic Corp. said Monday that it has made  organizational changes intended to streamline its worldwide operations.  </P> <P> The Anaheim company said the moves are designed to provide "tighter, more  responsive management control on a regional basis."  </P> <P> Under the restructuring, Distributed Logic formed operating units for its  Pacific Rim, European and Canadian operations.  </P> <P> The company said the need for the reorganization became apparent after it  acquired Plessey Peripheral Systems subsidiaries in 1987 and began to merge  that operation into the rest of its businesses.  </P> <P> "These new operating units will provide more local control over engineering,  manufacturing, sales, marketing and administrative activities," said company  Chairman Glenn C. Salley.  </P> <P> Distributed Logic said it has promoted Jon C. Klotz, formerly senior vice  president of operations, to president and chief operating officer of European  operations. Andrew Betterton, formerly president of Canadian operations for the  Plessey business, has been promoted to president of Dilog Canada.  </P> <P> The company also said it has hired John F. Wilson to serve as president and  chief operating officer of its U.S. operations.  </P></p>

In his reply to the French president on Feb. 21, Demirel  said  that the judicial authorities will reach a conclusion on certain  claims and proofs against certain deputies and that a legal  process was in place, rather than an arbitrary one.    Demirel stressed that judgement in Turkey was independent  and  the right to defend oneself was limitless.    In his letter of Feb. 1, Mitterrand told Demirel that his  government did not support the idea of an independent Kurdish  state and had expressed some concerns on the removal of the  immunity of some deputies.    Six members of the Democracy Party (DEP), one former DEP  member and one fundementalist deputy were stripped from their  immunity by parliament and were taken into custody today.    The DEP, with deputies from the southeast drew public  reaction as they seemed to support the killing of innocent  people by a separatist terrorist organization.    The organization is responsible of the death of more than  10,800 people in Turkey in the last 10 years when it launched a  bloody campaign against the Turkish state and its people.    Hasan Mezarci, then member of the fundamentalist Prosperity  Party (RP), drew public anger and reaction when he led a group  of 11 deputies in a motion to posthumously restore the honor of  a group of anti-Kemalists who plotted to assassinate Mustafa  Kemal Ataturk 70 years ago.    The motion sparked anger and prompted a pro-Kemalist rally  led by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller Monday. Public anger reached  a fever pitch after Mezarci made defamatory remarks about  Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.</p>

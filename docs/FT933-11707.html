			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Computer viruses The heroic charges being taken by IBM are in proportion to the epic scale of the problem facing the company. Yet while Dollars 8bn-worth of red ink and another 60,000 job losses will slim IBM's distended cost base, it is by no means clear that current plans will solve the underlying difficulty. IBM has a near monopoly control of mainframe computer technology but it is rapidly being undercut by lower cost alternatives. Perhaps the most disturbing element of yesterday's figures was the 12.9 per cent fall in hardware sales during the second quarter. The company is losing market share in mainframe computers to networked personal and mini-computers and other large system manufacturers. The downturn in mainframe sales is not as bad as the first quarter, but the pricing structure of the entire market is being progressively undermined. Those price and market share pressures will only intensify as the industry consolidates on standard equipment. IBM, however, cannot easily extricate itself or its customers from its existing technology. Almost all of its business units are involved in mainframes, and the company's unified salesforce is focused on selling packages of this 'big iron'. Mr Lou Gerstner, the new chairman, has the near-impossible task of managing the exit from the old mainframe technology while the company is still heavily dependent on the revenues it provides. Breaking the company up into more responsive business units may well be sensible in theory, and might have been more easily done in happier times. What bits of Big Blue would now be worth is impossible to say, and the route from here to there is as murky as ever.</p>

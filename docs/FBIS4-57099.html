			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia] </F>   [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro arrived in the  fatherland moments ago. Castro's trip began on 4 May in Barbados  where he participated in the First Small Island States  Conference on Sustainable Development. Fidel then traveled to  Africa to attend [South African] President Nelson Mandela's  inauguration. On a stopover in Ghana, Castro and his delegation  met with Ghananian President Jerry Rawlings. In South Africa,  Fidel met with dozens of people attending the inaugural in  Pretoria. After the inauguration, Fidel met with Mandela and  various people to discuss issues of bilateral interest. The next  stop was Salvador, Brazil, where Castro met with the governor of  Bahia State. The commander in chief's trip can be described as  highly productive in view of the expressions of solidarity and  affection toward Cuba he received at every stop.    The delegation accompanying Fidel included Rosa Elena  Simeon,  minister of science, technology, and the environment; and  Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government, and Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina.    Commander in Chief Fidel Castro was greeted at Jose Marti  International Airport by Army General Raul Castro, Politburo  member Carlos Lage, and [Interior Minister] Abelardo Colome  Ibarra.</p>

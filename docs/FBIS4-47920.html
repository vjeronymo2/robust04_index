			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The painfully slow process of the Angolan peace  talks in Lusaka means that the war has continued relentlessly?  [words indistinct] it seems the government has been taking the  action to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola]-held areas, notably N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza  Norte Province, east of the capital Luanda. There have been  reports of heavy fighting there, and now the government claims  to have captured the town. From Luanda Neto Shackson reports:    The state's news agency ANGOP [ANGOLAN PRESS AGENCY] said  today government troops captured N'dalatando, but there has been  no confirmation from military headquarters. UNITA radio two  days ago reported heavy government shellings to the town, and  government commander in Dondo, about 100 km south west of  N'dalatando, told me late last month a government offensive had  reached positions very close to the town. The matter of who  controls Huambo in Andola is [words indistinct]. The government  holds many towns and cities, while UNITA holds most of the  surrounding countryside. The progress of war is patchy. Last  month UNITA captured Chongoroi, in the western Province of  Benguela, and the government newspapers said today there has  been heavy fighting in the southern government-held town of  Cuchi. But, as with all military information in Angola, there  has been no reliable confirmation.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> RTD LAUDS FREE-RIDE PROGRAM  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Rapid Transit District's free-ride pilot program to patrons  whose buses are at least 15 minutes late was a "phenomenal" success in its  first month, with ridership increasing by about 1 million over the same period  last year, officials announced today.  </P> <P> Of the nearly 34 million passengers who rode RTD buses in September, about  59,000 -- or 0.18% of the total -- qualified for free rides under the agency's  warranty program, far less than the 600,000 officials had predicted.  </P> <P> "This is a phenomenal RTD success story," board President Nick Patsaouras said  at a downtown news conference, adding that he will recommend that the program  be permanently implemented beyond its scheduled December expiration if the  success continues.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dariusz Szymczycha under the rubric "100 </F> Words"]    [Text] When the president says that he is fighting for  political balance, he is actually destabilizing it.    He brought about a conflict recently, as well, when he  refused to sign the "new popiwek" [tax on excess wage increases]  law and appointed Ryszard Bender to the post of chairman of the  National Council of Radio and Television before the legal  dispute ended over whether the president had the right to recall  the previous chairman, Marek Markiewicz. Thus, the Belweder is  taking advantage of accomplished facts and accepts only the  president's own interpretation of laws. However, one could  expect more from the president, who is the moderator of  political life.    It is very characteristic that, in recent days, the Belweder  has multiplied conflicts. The "no" for Rosati, the budget  blackmail, and, finally, the appointment of Mr. Bender and the  veto of the "new popiwek" show clearly that Lech Walesa has  decided to extend the area of his influence. All this actually  happened, even though the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party  and the Democratic Left Alliance often declared the will of  constructive cooperation with the president. It also proved this  by recognizing the president's right to fill the highest  positions in three strategic ministries.    Thus, there was a chance for cooperation and balance.  However, Lech Walesa is balancing in his own way.</p>

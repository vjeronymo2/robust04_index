			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Election spending to be curbed Labour is to introduce new rules restricting expenditure by candidates in future elections for the party leadership, Ivor Owen writes. This follows the disclosure that Mr Tony Blair spent far more than his two rivals, Mr John Prescott and Mrs Margaret Beckett, in the contest that followed the death of John Smith. Mr Robin Cook confirmed that the party's national executive had agreed in principle that expenditure curbs and other rules should be in place before any future contest. He said Mr Blair had received support from all sections of the party, and claimed that the outcome would have been the same whatever financial restrictions had applied. According to some estimates Mr Blair had a campaign fund of Pounds 88,000 at his disposal, and spent Pounds 79,000. This compares with the Pounds 17,000 spent by Mrs Beckett and the Pounds 13,000 believed to have been spent by Mr Prescott.</p>

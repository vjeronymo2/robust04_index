			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / War museum to open branch in Hartlepool THE IMPERIAL War Museum is to establish a new complex, with a maritime bias, on a former dockland site at Hartlepool, Cleveland, it was announced yesterday, Chris Tighe writes. The development, the first part of which will open by 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, is the museum's first site in northern England. It will cost at least Pounds 10m and attract up to 500,000 visitors a year. Hartlepool was chosen partly because no national museum has a presence in north-east England. Financial help and encouragement from the Teesside Development Corporation was also a factor. So were Hartlepool's wartime links. It was the first British town to be bombarded by German warships in 1914 and has strong maritime traditions. The museum will cover the two world wars and the post-1945 world.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Argos profits fall despite higher sales: Trading climate and research costs cause catalogue-based retailer to drop 17% ARGOS, the catalogue showroom retailer, yesterday reported a 17 per cent fall in annual profits in the face of 'the most dif-ficult retailing environment since the company was launched in 1973'. Pre-tax profits slipped from Pounds 75.1m to Pounds 62.1m as a result of the difficult trading climate and the additional costs of researching and launching a new furniture store concept. Although sales this year had shown a small increase on the previous year, Argos said it was difficult to predict future trading conditions because of continuing political and economic uncertainty. Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, said the company still had great scope for geographical expansion and had identified 500 sites. The company opened 18 stores in 1991 and ended the year with 285 outlets. It is currently opening about 25 stores a year. Argos is also testing the furniture market by launching four Chesterman stores. Mr Smith said Argos had identified an opportunity to exploit the upper end of the furniture market which was poorly served. The first Chesterman store will open on Thursday in Mill Hill, London. Three more will be opened this year in Chatham, Fareham and Bristol and, if successful, the format will be extended. Mr Smith said he could envisage the company opening 30 stores within five years. Mr Smith also revealed yesterday that Argos had researched the possibility of launching a US-style 'warehouse club', which sells a narrow range of goods at heavily discounted prices from large out-of-town stores. He added that the different cost structures of retailing in the UK had deterred it from opening such stores but he did not rule out the possibility of eventually doing so. In the year to December 28, sales rose from Pounds 905.57m to Pounds 926.65m although operating profits slipped from Pounds 68.23m to Pounds 55.44m. Interest income of Pounds 6.7m was Pounds 200,000 lower than the previous year, reflecting the general fall in interest rates. A final dividend of 4.3p will increase the annual payout by 7 per cent to 6.4p from 6p. Earnings per share were helped by a lower rate of corporation tax but still slipped from 16p to 13.9p. Argos shares closed down 4p at 253p. Lex, Page 22</p>

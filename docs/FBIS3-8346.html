			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 9 March within its  regular 11-minute newscast carries several reports on the  situation in the Republic.    In his report from the Bihac region, Mirza Sadikovic says  that "the Serbian aggressor forces' offensive on the Bihac  region has entered its second month with unabated ferocity. The  past 24 hours have been marked by constant aggressor's artillery  operations on the outskirts of the Bihac and Cazin communes.  Yesterday afternoon and last night, howitzers and mortars  targeted the Cazin region more. The situation along the defense  lines was as usual: With the activity with Bofors weapons,  [word indistinct], (?machine-guns), mortars of all kinds, and an  increased sniper activity on Grabez, (Hasin Vrh), and  Grmusko-Srbljanski Height, the Chetniks marked last night and  the morning so far. In this period, a dozen people were  seriously or lightly wounded. The Serbian aggressors acted  along the lines of the fighters of the Croatian Defense Council  [HVO] of the Bihac region, particularly in the Pljesevica region  and shelled parts of Veliki Skocaj."    A report by the Press Center of the Maglaj Commune War  Presidency read by an unidentified correspondent says that  "yesterday and this morning on the Maglaj battlefield there has  been a strange lull with only occasional artillery provocations  along the entire line of separation and sniper activity on [word  indistinct] in the northern part of the city. However, the visit  by [Serbian Republic Presidency Member Biljana] Plavsic and  Mirko Jovic [chairman of the Serbian National Defense] to Ozren,  as well as an intensive concentration and regrouping of manpower  and artillery pieces around Maglaj, harbinger a continuation of  even fiercer attacks on the city soon."    A partly indistinct report by a Press Center of the 3d Corps  says that "shots fired from the HVO positions in the zone  covered by the 3d Corps can be counted on the fingers of one  hand. A sniper is heard from time to time, as was the case in  Stari Vitez. A mortar bomb fell on (Busovaca) [word  indistinct]. These were incidents that failed to seriously  threaten the truce.    "However, the Chetniks have not been calm. At 2030 last  night, they fired seven howitzer shells from (Zmetan) on  Travnik. On the Zavidovici battlefield [word indistinct] and  Karaula, Chetniks opened fire from antiaircraft weapons. In the  Bugojno region, they occasionally acted with infantry weapons.  At about 0800 this morning, a general danger alarm was sounded  in Zenica. Three shells were launched from the Chetnik  strongholds on Vlasic. According to reports so far, two people  have been lightly injured.    "Prisoners were exchanged yesterday between the Army of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO in the region of  Zepce. Seventeen Croatian fighters were released by our side,  while 31 fighters of our army left Zepce."</p>

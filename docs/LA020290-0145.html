			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> COSGROVE CASE IS NOW UP TO THE JUDGE  </P> <P> Participants in a lawsuit challenging City Councilman Cameron Cosgrove's right  to hold office concluded the first part of their trial Thursday, as a Superior  Court judge took the matter under advisement.  </P> <P> Saying he hoped that it would be a "matter of days, not weeks," before he  rendered an opinion, Judge Claude M. Owens concluded the portion of the trial  devoted to debate of legal matters.  </P> <P> Owens will rule on whether the legal issues alone are enough to decide the  case. If they are, Cosgrove is expected to retain his seat; if not, the second  phase of the trial would pick up in March.  </P> <P> In Thursday's session with lawyers, Owens picked holes in each side's  arguments, leaving both the plaintiffs and the defendants puzzled as to which  way the judge may be leaning.  </P> <P> "He's very inscrutable," said Thomas M. Jones, lawyer for two Irvine residents  who filed the case. "I really can't read him at all."  </P> <P> The suit, which has been the object of intense scrutiny and debate in Irvine  for months, seeks to remove Cosgrove from office, arguing that his seating on  the council violated Measure D. That measure passed in June, 1988, and stated  that in certain council elections, residents could circulate a petition to  prevent a council candidate from taking office.  </P> <P> Measure D applies in elections where an incumbent council member is elected  mayor, leaving a vacancy on the council. That occurred in 1988, when Larry  Agran, then a councilman, easily won election as mayor.  </P> <P> Two council seats were open that year, and Cosgrove finished third in the  balloting by just over 100 votes. But because Agran's seat became open when he  became mayor, Cosgrove was sworn in as a councilman to fill Agran's unexpired  term.  </P> <P> At issue is whether Measure D is binding on the 1988 race, since it passed as  part of that same election.  </P> <P> Much of the courtroom debate centered on another related issue of timing. The  Measure D petitions calling for a special election to fill Cosgrove's seat were  dated July 5, 10 days before the secretary of state certified the measure as  being valid.  </P> <P> The judge has twice questioned Jones about whether the petitions can be  considered valid since they predate the formal adoption of the law that allowed  for them.  </P> <P> Howard J. Klein, an Irvine patent attorney and one of the plaintiffs in the  case, agreed that the timing of the petition posed "an important question, but  we feel that we have arguments and precedent to support our position."  </P> <P> Lawyers for Cosgrove, however, argued that on the basis of the timing alone,  the case against their client should be thrown out.  </P> <P> "It's pretty clear," said Franklin J. Lunding, one of two lawyers the City of  Irvine has retained to represent Cosgrove. "If the petitions weren't good, then  there is nothing else to decide." JIM NEWTON  </P></p>

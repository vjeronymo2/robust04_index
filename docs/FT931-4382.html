			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Letter: Dogged by the spectre of doom and gloom Sir, American Ambassador Raymond Seitz told Christian Tyler (Private View, March 6) that he made two resolutions when posted to the Court of St James; never to use the phrase 'special relationship' and never to quote Winston Churchill. Both are laudable objectives and it would be pleasant to think that this might signal a fresh departure for the English language, with public figures all undertaking to forsake certain tired and dreary cliches for more innovative expressions and other means of getting their messages across. However, in the course of the interview Ambassador Seitz, commenting on the current mood of doom and gloom in the UK, remarked: 'There is a black dog that wanders around Britain worrying about its future. . .' Black dog? Not related to the famous 'Black Dog' that used to haunt the aforementioned Winston Churchill in his fits of depression by any chance?

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Dame Judith Anderson Honored: Dame Judith Anderson, now 92 and living in Santa  Barbara, was honored Wednesday night at the first acting awards competition  held by UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television. In her native Adelaide,  Australia, Dame Judith told the audience, she'd had no interest in studies at  all.  </P> <P> "I was the dumbest girl, not only in my class but the whole school. All I  wanted to do was show off, which I did." So she did, making her stage debut at  17 and later gaining screen immortality as the wicked Mrs. Danvers in Alfred  Hitchcock's film of Daphne DuMaurier's "Rebecca." Dame Judith was introduced by  George Schaefer, associate dean of the school, who had directed her in Maurice  Evans' GI version of "Macbeth" during World War II. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

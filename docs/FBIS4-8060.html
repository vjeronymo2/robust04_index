			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zagreb, April 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb troops  besieging the Moslem town of Gorazde on Sunday began crossing  the Drina river just to the south following a massive artillery  offensive, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees announced.    The soldiers began crossing the river, which had marked the  front line between warring forces, shortly after 3:00 p.m. (1300  GMT), the UNHCR spokesman in Zagreb, Peter Kessler said.    Half an hour later, shells continued to "pour down" on the  villages of Bacci and Vinarici to the south of Gorazde, while  three other villages to the east were in flames, he added.    General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, called off a flight to Brussels from the  Croatian port of Split and returned rapidly to the Bosnian  capital Sarajevo, UNPROFOR officials here said.    Rose's spokesman here was unable to say whether the sudden  change in his plans was due to developments in Gorazde. [passage  omitted]</p>

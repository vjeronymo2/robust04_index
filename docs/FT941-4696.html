			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Tories on attack over local tax: Curry's claim to undercut Labour council charges by average Pounds 129 disputed The Conservative party yesterday signalled that it will place what it claims are the high levels of council tax levied by Labour-controlled authorities at the forefront of its campaign for May's local council elections. At the party's first campaign news conference for the elections, Mr David Curry, local government minister, unveiled figures suggesting that nine of the 10 highest council taxes levied in the next financial year would be in Labour councils. He also said that, of the 10 lowest taxes, five would be levied by Conservative controlled councils, including Westminster, Wandsworth and Ealing. But Labour said he had chosen an invalid base of comparison, by assessing every council on the tax charged to households in band C - which applies to properties valued between Pounds 52,000 and Pounds 68,000. Figures from the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities showed that 82 per cent of households in Liverpool, which has the most expensive band C tax, lived in properties below the band C threshold, and would therefore pay less than the amount quoted by Mr Curry. In Westminster, with the lowest band C tax, 84 per cent of households are in properties valued above Pounds 68,000, and would therefore pay more. Mr Curry said that the government had been officially notified of the precise levels of council tax to be levied by about 300 of the 419 local authorities in England and Wales. He said that the figures showed that on average councils were levying tax increases of 2.7 per cent in the band C range. Although the survey is not complete, this is nearly 4 percentage points below the amount that the government predicted last autumn, when announcing its grant settlement for 1994-95, and may reflect the determination of councils to contain taxes in an election year. Mr Curry said that on the information the government had received Labour councils would charge Pounds 129 more on average in council tax next year than Conservative councils. He said that larger council tax bills were often levied by councils - such as Lambeth, Tower Hamlets and Islington - which already receive above average grants from central government. Mr Curry said: 'What we can demonstrate is that we can provide better value for money and provide better services.' Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, said that Mr Curry's figures were 'unconvincing'. He said: 'You can't trust the Tories to tell the truth on tax, whether it's on VAT, personal allowances or council tax. They cannot resist twisting the truth.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTDOWN TO THE LOCAL ELECTIONS: TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE COUNCIL TAX  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Most expensive'           Tory figs   Lab figs                             (Pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Liverpool            NOC         770        82% Manchester           LAB         691        83% Newcastle            LAB         686        75% Coventry             LAB         669        72% Salford              LAB         658        77% Bristol              LAB         652        61% Middlesbrough        LAB         645        73% Hartlepool           LAB         643        79% Kirklees             LAB         635        65% Rossendale           LAB         634        69%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Least expensive'          Tory figs   Lab figs  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Westminster          CON         218        84% Wellingborough       CON         261        18% Wandsworth           CON         306        58% Isles of Scilly      IND         358        92% City of London       IND         368        89% Hambleton            CON         396        48% Tewkesbury           NOC         398        41% Rochester            NOC         402        21% Sth Cambridgeshire   NOC         408        54% Ealing               CON         418        66%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- NOC: no overall control Source: DoE/AMA  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tory figures show tax payable for properties in Band C Labour figures show proportion of households paying less than Band C rate in the most expensive authorities; and more than the Band C rate in the least expensive authorities  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

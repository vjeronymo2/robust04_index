			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GATES' DISMAY FORCES 2 AIDES TO SELL STOCKS  </P> <P> At the urging of Chief Daryl F. Gates, two officials of the Los Angeles Police  Department -- one a civilian computer manager and the other the department's  chief spokesman -- have sold their stock in a company that will provide the  city with an electronic stolen-car recovery system.  </P> <P> The stock sale followed a meeting of top LAPD officials last week at which  Gates expressed dismay that any of his top aides would have purchased stock in  LoJack Corp., the Massachusetts firm involved in the project.  </P> <P> "We are concerned about this. I would hope the top staff of this department  wouldn't buy any LoJack stock," Gates said. "Given the sensitivity of the  project, I wish no one had bought any stock."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought Stock Last Year  </P> <P> Gates spoke out after learning that Charles Drescher, civilian commanding  officer of LAPD's information resource division, and Cmdr. William Booth, the  department's chief spokesman since 1977, both had purchased LoJack stock last  year.  </P> <P> At the time, LoJack Corp. was lobbying for passage of state legislation that  would have permitted it to set up operations throughout California. The  legislation was dropped, however, after an amendment was introduced that would  have forced the firm to share its technology with rival companies.  </P> <P> LoJack and the LAPD then began talks that led in March to unanimous passage by  the City Council of a contract in which the firm will provide the city with  $1.5 million in computers and electronic tracking devices in exchange for the  right to sell car security transponders to the public.  </P> <P> With the LoJack system, police can track stolen cars using small transmitting  devices hidden in the vehicles and tracking devices in patrol cars that can  monitor the movements of the stolen vehicles.  </P> <P> In urging his top officials to avoid buying stock in LoJack, Gates stressed  that he saw no conflict of interest in the actions of Drescher and Booth. But,  he said, the LAPD views its contract with LoJack as sensitive because the  company holds a temporary monopoly on the technology required to plug into its  recovery system.  </P> <P> While Gates avoided any rebuke of Booth for buying 400 shares of LoJack stock  last year, he singled out Drescher for criticism, calling his purchase of 500  shares a "very unfortunate" decision.  </P> <P> Booth, Gates said, "certainly doesn't make decisions about this issue. As for  Drescher, he's not in the line (of command on LoJack), but he does have  department computer and information systems. I think it was very poor taste and  very poor judgement."  </P> <P> Responding to the comments from Gates, at a meeting with The Times and five top  LAPD commanders last Wednesday, Booth immediately sold his stock, which he had  purchased for about $3 a share, making a profit of about $500.  </P> <P> "I suffer no feelings of conflict or anything wrong, but I do wish I had never  bought it," Booth said.  </P> <P> Drescher, who purchased his shares at $5 last July, sold his shares Monday at a  slight loss. He said he saw no conflict at the time he bought the stock, but  had begun to wonder about the issue and was happy to dispose of the stock in  view of Gates' comments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contract Defended  </P> <P> Gates defended LAPD's contract with LoJack, a firm that so far operates in  Massachusetts and Florida. In an earlier controversy, a Massachusetts State  Police officer drew criticism for profiting from LoJack stock.  </P> <P> "All I want to do is solve the damn auto theft problem and this seems to be a  way to do it," Gates said. "I don't see how we can lose. They are giving us the  equipment. They are also giving us a contract that says it can be broken if  somebody else comes along."  </P> <P> City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who introduced the proposed contract with  LoJack in the City Council, first uncovered Drescher's purchase of stock and  criticized LAPD officials for not keeping Gates and the City Council better  informed of any possible controversies relating to LoJack.  </P> <P> "I do think the higher-ups need to be sensitive to the problems being  presented," Yaroslavsky said. "This is an issue of public trust."  </P> <P> The LAPD said that all its employees directly involved with LoJack have  promised not to purchase stock in the company.  </P> <P> According to LoJack officials, the company's earlier stock controversy involved  a Massachusetts police official who allegedly made a profit in LoJack stock  while involved in testing the system.  </P> <P> LoJack President C. Michael Daley said the firm, after a management  reorganization three years ago, has been expanding its sales and has launched  an aggressive national marketing program.  </P></p>

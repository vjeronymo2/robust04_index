			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Blagden shares fall 59p after warning on core activity SHARES in Blagden Industries, the packaging and chemicals group, plunged 59p to 144p yesterday after the company warned that its core packaging division would be hit in the second half. Group pre-tax profit for the full year was 'now expected to be significantly lower than the Pounds 11m achieved in 1991.' The balance sheet remained strong and trading at the chemical and protective equipment divisions had held up well. All product areas remained profitable, Blagden said. The warning comes only three months after profit increases across the board were reported at the interim stage. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 28 rose 11 per cent to Pounds 6m. Mr Lance Levine, finance director, said a very poor September and October had followed a poor July and August, two months from which the company never drew any conclusions. 'Trading profits in the group's packaging division, particularly in the UK and Germany, have increasingly been severely affected by the deepening recession.' In the past, Blagden's high exposure to continental Europe had sheltered it from the downturn in the UK. 'What is being seen is a deterioration in the European markets in general,' Mr Levine said. Because packaging was a business with high fixed costs, the 15 per cent drop in volumes had a significant impact, Mr Levine said. Packaging accounts for about 70 per cent of group sales and more of its profits. The group had bucked the market trend in the first half and had been hit by recession particularly late in the cycle.</p>

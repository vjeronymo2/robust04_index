Signing the document were on the Lao  side Mr. Leuan Sombounkhan, vice president of the Committee for  Planning and Cooperation, and on the Thai side, Mr. Loi  Itsaraphonsuthapha, representative of the Thai MDX Public Co.,  Ltd. [passage omitted]    According to the MOU, the Lao government has allowed the  Thai  company to conduct a survey for preparing an economic, technical  feasibility report. About U.S. $1 million is needed to complete  the survey that will be made at the junction between Nam Ngum  and Nam Ma [rivers].    Following the signed document, a joint committee will be set  up with four members, two from each side. The head of the  committee will be one of the two members from the Lao side. An  estimate by technicians shows that when completed the Nam Ngum-3  hydropower project is capable of providing electric power of up  to 400 mgw [megawatts] per year. In the electric power  generation venture, the Lao side holds a share of 45 percent,  while the Thai company holds 55 percent.    Shortly before the signing of the memorandum, Mr. Subin  Pinkhayan, honorary consultative president of the Thai MDX  Public Co., Ltd., presented some 500,000 Baht cash to Vice Prime  Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha for the Lao government to use in  rehabilitating the head of the Mekong bridge on the Lao side.</p>

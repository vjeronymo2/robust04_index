			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Hollywood on a desk-top disc Technology developed for the big Hollywood film studios has now been shrunk to suit the needs of companies which use desk-top publishing or applications that involve moving video images. Microdisk, developed by Micropolis of Chatsworth, California, is a hard disc drive which delivers an uninterrupted flow of data, unlike many other hard discs. It was specially developed for use in film studios, as video images need a continuous data flow. The desk-top version - a board and a disc drive - sell for less than Pounds 10,000 and can be used with a PC or Macintosh. Micropolis: US, 818 709 3300; UK, 0734 751315.</p>

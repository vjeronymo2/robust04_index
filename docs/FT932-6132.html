			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Exchange undercut on new dealing system: Row over US offer to build replacement scheme NASDAQ, the US over-the-counter stock exchange, has offered to build a replacement for London's ageing dealing system, known as Seaq, for Pounds 37m, an estimated Pounds 20m less than a rival system planned by the Stock Exchange itself. The surprise proposal, endorsed by a group of Stock Exchange board members, was the subject of a heated four-hour board meeting on Wednesday at which Nasdaq officials were present. Supporters of the Stock Exchange's own proposal were said to have argued at that meeting that the Nasdaq proposal fails to take account of additional required spending, and that the total costs of both systems were broadly equal. The Stock Exchange's board met last week to discuss the results of a review by IBM, the US computer group, of the Stock Exchange proposal, developed in conjunction with management consultants Andersen Consulting, against those of an earlier, more expensive plan put forward by Nasdaq. That review, commissioned by the Stock Exchange, strongly urged adoption of the system proposed by the exchange itself. Among other things, it said the exchange plan offered a 'British' solution to the matter. In spite of IBM's recommendations, intended to provide an independent view of the two proposals, Stock Exchange members remain deeply divided about the best replacement for the ageing system which, all agree, will be unable to cope with the exchange's future growth. For one thing, members have become increasingly sceptical about the exchange's ability to develop an inexpensive system because of its failure to make the proposed Taurus paperless trading and settlement system work. In addition, market makers, who agree to buy and sell specific company shares under all conditions, feared that the exchange was contemplating a system that would eliminate the need for market making. In April, a group of leading market makers who are members of the Stock Exchange board retained consultants Booz Allen to examine alternatives to the exchange's proposals. They recommended a system to be developed by Nasdaq. The Nasdaq system proposed at Wednesday's meeting would be able to take two-way price quotes electronically from market makers and distribute them on screen; directly handle interacting orders, beginning with inactive stocks for which there are few or no market makers; and produce a stream of quotations for commercial vendors of stock prices such as Reuters. Supporters argue that its chief advantage is that it would prove more adaptable as trading volumes increased.</p>

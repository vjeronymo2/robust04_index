			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Don't pay the rich to be ill: The chancellor's dilemma: an inside view Our social security system exists to help the poor. That should not be too expensive. We could guarantee the poorest 10 per cent of the population an income of Pounds 100 a week for Pounds 25bn. Yet the social security budget is more than Pounds 70bn, growing rapidly out of control, and still the streets are full of beggars. This situation has occurred because we choose to perpetuate a powerful myth: that the social security system is an insurance system, to which we make contributions (like an insurance premium), as a result of which we are entitled to benefits if and when we become old, sick or unemployed. The result of this is that some Pounds 40bn of the Pounds 70bn budget is spent on the so-called contributory benefits - state pensions, unemployment and sickness benefit. A substantial part of this money goes to people who are not poor. Why does a Conservative government dedicated to the principle of privatisation run this large nationalised industry, an insurance scheme that ignores all the basic actuarial principles and makes a massive loss? The answer is partly historical and partly that, by giving money to people because they meet certain conditions (old, ill, out of work) rather than because they are poor, the government hopes to minimise the poverty trap. The poverty trap - very high marginal rates of tax on the incomes of the poor - is an inevitable and unwelcome consequence of means-testing  - giving money to the poor and taking it away as they get richer. Means-testing is necessary to target resources and keep down costs. But it does impose a high rate of tax on those trying to escape from poverty by their own efforts. Better, many believe, to tackle the causes of poverty, and leave people an incentive to work. It is a beguiling argument. The only problem is that it has turned out to be incredibly expensive. If social security payments depend on anything but income, you end up giving away large swathes of a Pounds 70bn budget to well-off pensioners, well-off families with children, and well-off invalids. But targeting is not the only thing wrong with the present system. It also faces the classic 'moral hazard' problem that confronts all insurers: the existence of the insurance makes the condition insured against more likely. If you promise to pay people money when they are ill, they are more likely to become ill. If you promise to pay them if they become single parents, they are more likely to become single par-ents. The same is true, at the margin, even of disablement and unemployment. Insurance is based on the principle that an accident, like lightning, strikes a helpless victim. In most cases, this paradigm is accurate. Most of those who become unemployed, sick or disabled cannot change their condition by an act of will. But what about the marginal cases? When does a backache become so bad that you really have to stop work? And who decides that it is that bad - you, or your doctor? We all face days when we feel unwell. Those with highly paid, interesting jobs are, unsurprisingly, more inclined to struggle into work than the lowly paid in boring jobs. So if the latter are offered a new benefit when they are unwell that is more generous than unemployment benefit or the state pension, some who previously chose to work despite chronic illness or disability will no longer do so. As more learn about the benefit, the number of claimants soars. To prevent malingering, the state has to ask doctors to judge whether these people are 'really' sick. And the natural response to budgetary pressures is to tighten up the medical criteria - to a predictable political outcry. The history of invalidity benefit - payable tax free to those who are 'incapable of work because of illness or disablement' - shows what happens if you give people money because they are sick and ask doctors to decide who qualifies. The numbers who qualify have increased from half a million in 1978 to more than a million and a half today. And many of them are not poor. The solution is simple. Don't give money to people because they are sick. Give it only if their sickness makes them poor. The advantages are immense: the state does not have to judge how sick they are; the incentive to malinger is completely removed; the money which goes to the well-off sick is saved; and the decision whether or not to work when somewhat unwell is taken from doctors and given back to the individual. Unfortunately this radical solution - abolish invalidity benefit and use some of the money saved to make the means-tested benefits more generous - is blocked by the insurance myth, because invalidity benefit is one of the contributory benefits. It is difficult to defend taking money away from the sick. It is even harder to defend taking from the sick a benefit that they have paid for. So a sensible transfer from better-off, supposedly unwell, people to the genuinely poor is ruled out. The implications are grim. The government presides over a poorly targeted system in which benefits for the ill, for the disabled, for single parents, are growing at a frightening speed. The numbers, small 15 years ago, are now large enough to have a macro-economic impact. Successive governments have, with the best intentions, drifted into commitments that are already crowding out other desirable public spending and that are ultimately unaffordable. In the long run these issues must be addressed. But in the immediate future the most promising way of reining back the budget is to tackle the flat-rate benefits which, though not especially fast-growing, are very large. An obvious target is the Pounds 6bn in child benefit, of which a big share goes to the better off. Means-testing it and clawing it back from them could easily be defended, as child benefit is non-contributory. The government also has an opportunity to save some of the Pounds 27bn cost of the state retirement pension (a contributory benefit and therefore normally sacrosanct) because it is required to equalise the pension age for women and men. It should not hesitate to do so by raising the pension age for women to 65. Failure to grasp that nettle will send the worst possible signal to the financial markets about the government's willingness to tackle its budget problem. But most important of all, the government must, in its long-term spending review, re-examine the basic principles governing our social security system. Until they are changed, the social security budget will remain an uncontrollable monster. Next week: The missing oil revenue billions.

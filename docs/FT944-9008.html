			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Arts: The Brno Philharmonic - Concert For Western classical music lovers the city of Brno, the provincial capital of Moravia in the Czech republic, probably means just one thing: Janacek. It was there that he worked for the greater part of his life and there in the city's opera house where, during the 1920s, the last four of his remarkable operas were first performed. Curiously, the official founding of the city's flagship symphony orchestra, the Brno Philharmonic, postdates even that memorable era: although the Brno Philharmonic Society started giving concerts as far back as 1808, and in various guises (at one point as the Brunner Philharmoniker playing for the German Opera) has actively participated in the city's musical life ever since, it was not until 1956 that its present status - as the Brno State Philharmonic Orchestra - was fully established. Yet one would hardly have guessed its relative youthfulness from the assurance and love with which the orchestra under its Principal Conductor, Laos Svarovsky, played a programme ideally suited to its many qualities at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday: nothing from the core Austro-German repertoire, but Smetana, Tchaikovsky, Suk and Janacek, all composers who found a perfect match in the orchestra's unanimity of purpose and radiant delivery. If the choice of the overture to Smetana's The Bartered Bride as opener was somewhat predictable (though not inappropriate, since this was the opera which inaugurated Brno's National Theatre in 1884), it certainly set the tone of the evening in the agility and incisiveness with which it was projected, qualities even more evident in the glowing textures of Josef Suk's attractive if slight Fantastic Scherzo which the orchestra convinced us was nothing less than a masterpiece. Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto certainly benefited from the orchestra's warmth and vernal freshness, and in Igor Oistrakh it found an ideal partner. Admittedly Oistrakh's rubato was a little free to begin with, causing some problems of ensemble, but once he embarked on his first bout of passage-work, strict - though by no means inflexible - time was the order of the day and the interpretation - objective but intense, robust but capable of delicacy - took wing. The slow movement, natural and supple was imbued with a lyricsm free of mawkish sentiment, the finale precise and rhythmically poised. And, of course, to end it had to be the Janacek Sinfonietta, complete with the luxury of 13 extra Czech brass players. Janacek's sinewy orchestration can often sound simply bizarre in the wrong hands, but here seemed to hold no terrors: confirming the Brno Philharmonic's inborn musicality and utter unselfconsiousness, qualities which seem to infuse all it comes into contact with, traditional - and fast-disappearing - music-making at its best.</p>

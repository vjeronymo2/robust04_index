			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Technology: Life in a snapshot - Computers are predicting the spending patterns of British consumers You are the maker of a new consumer widget which you think appeals to the thirtysomething social climbers among Britain's middle classes. How would you find out which part of the country would be most appropriate as a test market? You may be helped by a new package of information about Britain's social and economic fabric due to be assembled over the next few years. In a new study, researchers at Essex University are to track the lives of about 10,000 individuals chosen at random from around the UK. The survey staff will return to the individuals each year to see how their lives have changed. The research will provide a view not just about, say, the numbers of people who own a video recorder - but the way in which ownership patterns change depending on individuals' circumstances. On a macroeconomic level, the study should also shed light on how decisions by millions of individual consumers come together to influence spending patterns in the economy. This area is of particular relevance in the current recession. The recovery has been held back by weak levels of consumer spending - an area which accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic product. The information from the Essex study will be contained in a computerised database, which will be available to commercial groups such as market researchers and consumer-goods companies. It should be possible for businesses with the relevant computer equipment to connect up their offices to the database over the telephone system. Ultimately, the data will be linked with similar information about social change in other European countries, providing a snapshot of how life across the continent differs. Working on the British Household Panel Study is a 35-strong team of sociologists, economists and computer technicians. The group is backed with Pounds 5.5m by the government's Economic and Social Research Council. Results from the study will be available from the council's data archive unit, also based at Essex. All the people selected in the study will be interviewed on an annual basis, starting later this year, to discover information about subjects such as income, health and employment. The individuals will also be questioned on their living accommodation, the kind of goods and services they purchase and political views. From the research should emerge a new perspective on life in Britain. Other surveys, for example those organised by the Central Statistical Office or the Employment Department (see panel), provide a view of the proportion of the population who own particular types of goods, have specific illnesses or work in certain jobs. But while nearly all of these projects build up information by interviewing on a regular basis different groups of people, the Essex study will be the first large-scale UK study to return to the same individuals each year. As a result, the project should obtain not only information about social and economic change, but insights as to how and why groups of people move between different levels in society, judged by their incomes and other factors. David Rose, acting head of the Essex team, says: 'Our analysis will be going much deeper than other surveys. For example, we will be able to find out not just how many people are below the poverty line, but what kind of people they are.' Although the data will be used primarily by academics, the information could also help companies. A business selling household equipment, food or consumer magazines could, for instance, use the information to obtain a detailed sociological profile of individuals in a specific part of Britain. Such a company will be able to determine at what rate people in a specific region and age group are becoming owners of video players, buying baked beans on a regular basis or installing double glazing. That could help businesses to target marketing efforts. Other areas of research which will be helped by the study include: The labour market. The study should provide extra information about career patterns, why people move between specific jobs and how these factors are influenced by aspects such as education, health and income. How households make spending decisions. The degree to which households are willing to run down savings to fund consumer purchases or move house will be one aspect under study. The project might also shed light on how general consumer confidence affects spending decisions. Transitions in and out of poverty. Key influences such as education, family background and social or political views will come under study. Housing. The study will obtain a snapshot of views from people about the desirability of renting or buying houses, together with details about why they move and specific difficulties such as availability of accommodation and finance. That should provide a mass of extra information about the housing market. Health. Links between individuals' health and other aspects of their lives such as age, income and employment will also be explored. Values. The study should provide new information on shifts in ideas among specific segments of the population in areas such as equality, freedom, fairness and political thinking. Extra and more timely information about the UK labour market will emerge later this year as a result of improvements to the Employment Department's labour force survey. The survey is to be conducted quarterly, instead of annually. Partly as a result of greater use of computers, results from the exercise will become available in six months, halving the current waiting period. The data will be useful for economists, businesses and politicians who are attempting to monitor changes in the numbers employed and out of work. The new exercise builds on the department's existing labour force survey, one aim of which is to provide a check against the department's monthly unemployment statistics. These are based on the numbers of people who claim unemployment benefit at government jobcentres, and so provide only a relatively superficial view of the jobs market. Results from the first of the quarterly surveys, based on research taking place over the next three months, will be published in the autumn. After this, new results will emerge on a three-monthly basis. The relatively short time between the research and publication of results will increase the survey's relevance. It is a considerable improvement on the waiting time of one year which applies to the current, annual survey. The results from the 1991 survey are still being collated and are expected to become available by early next month. The format of the survey remains much the same as before. Interviewers employed by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys gather information from a random sample of about 120,000 people in 60,000 households around Britain. In this way, the survey determines broad trends, in areas such as training, shifts between different types of work and the periods specific groups of unemployed people have been without jobs. While up to now the interviewers have recorded answers on paper, in the new quarterly survey they are using Toshiba hand-held computers. By plugging their machines into a central computer over the telephone network, the interviewers can feed data to government statisticians more quickly, helping to speed up the job of analysis. Also contributing to a reduction in the waiting time is that the job of collecting and analysing the information has been given to a new 200-strong team at the OPCS, which the Employment Department says will produce results more quickly. The department says the cost of producing the four surveys a year is less than four times that of the annual survey.</p>

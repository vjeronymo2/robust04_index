			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Raising the stakes for Games of 2000  -John Major is heading for Spain to hobnob with Olympic royalty JOHN MAJOR is said to be highly excited about coming to Barcelona tomorrow. Britain's sports-fan prime minister has never attended an Olympic Games before. Two months ago Major invited Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), to London. Immediate warmth between them led to Major agreeing to press Samaranch's views on the status of athletes from former Yugoslav states at the G7 summit. Now the hospitality is being returned. As he is whisked around this Pounds 5bn pageant, the prime minister will see that an IOC chieftain has power and influence scarcely imagined by the elected leader of a middleweight north European democracy. The experience will prove intoxicating. It always does. And the prime minister will begin to speak softly to the president about Manchester's worthwhile and energetic claims to host the Games in 2000. 'I know that Samaranch and other senior IOC members are highly impressed by this government's commitment to our bid,' says Bob Scott, head of the Manchester campaign. In the case of an earlier, unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Games (which went to Atlanta), the IOC was sceptical of the viability of prime minister Margaret Thatcher's 'hands-off' approach to the subject of government involvement. Experience has taught the IOC that outside the US, national rather than regional private-sector resources have to be used to underpin the Olympics. Scott and his team have been in Spain for nearly a month now, constantly studying and lobbying. 'The biggest thing I see is that having the Games in Barcelona has shifted the geographic and economic axis of this country,' says Scott. 'Madrid isn't the beginning and end of every story - and never will be again.' Could the same thing happen if the Games were staged in north-west England? 'Absolutely,' replied Scott. 'Nothing that is likely to happen in our lifetimes could do so much to change the damaging imbalance which tilts so many resources into London and the south-east.' Whitehall has already pledged about Pounds 50m to help with facilities and infrastructure related to Manchester's bid, a radically new combination of money and mouth duly noted by the hard-to-please IOC. However, seven other cities stand between Manchester and its dream. Before the IOC vote in Monte Carlo next year, the claims to preferment of candidates as diverse as Milan and Tashkent have to be overcome, Braslia and Istanbul vanquished. Sydney and Beijing are regarded by observers as the front-runners at present. Berlin was up there with them but has faded after an enjoyable scandal concerning the Berlin campaigners' use of private detectives to investigate the lives of the 92 IOC members who will choose the venue for 2000. Every candidate city admits to keeping dossiers on IOC members: basic and harmless information useful when hosting them on visits. However, the Germans focused on the bank accounts and sexual preferences of the IOC elite. Anger turned to outrage when a disgruntled ex-employee leaked the investigators' conclusions to the IOC. Only seven of the members, they concluded, could not be 'bought'. Eyebrows were raised at Buckingham Palace when it became known that the Princess Royal, a former Olympic horsewoman and prominent do-gooder in the highest reaches of world sport, was not one of the seven. Sydney attracts everyone. The potential for staging the Olympics in such a stunning outdoor city is clear to all. But hard-heads always cavil at the cost and logistical problems entailed in staging the world's biggest festival in such a remote spot and such an obscure time-zone. In turn, Beijing has to overcome its status as an international pariah. Interestingly, its lobbyists and senior figures have been much in evidence in Barcelona, pushing the line that China needs the Olympics to help counter its rock-bottom image. Winning the Games would propel us into the modern world, say Beijing's campaigners with breath-taking frankness. 'At present, I'm happy to hear people say that Manchester is third and closing,' says Scott. 'With the two favourites at such extremes there is considerable merit in being a well-prepared, unglamorous middle candidate.' All of which will strike a pleasing chord with the British prime minister.</p>

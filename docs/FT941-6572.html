			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tomorrows Leisure losses deepen to Pounds 0.2m Tomorrows Leisure, the USM-quoted hotels and leisure group based in north-east England, reported deepening pre-tax losses for the six months to September 30 1993, up to Pounds 204,000 against Pounds 110,000 last time. Operating profits were up at Pounds 476,000 (Pounds 284,000). However, increased interest charges of Pounds 680,000 (Pounds 394,000), as a result of the higher level of borrowing following the group's Pleasure Island investment, pushed the group into loss. Turnover was ahead at Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 4.48m). In November 1993, Tomorrow's Leisure sold Lavender Park Golf Centre in Berkshire and surplus farm buildings in County Durham. It said yesterday that more disposals of non-core assets are under active negotiation. Such disposals, to reduce the company's overdraft, and the achievement of certain minimum levels of trading contribution to Group profits this year, are conditions of the current support from its banker, Barclays, to March 31. Negotiations have begun for facilities beyond this date. 'We are taking positive action on all fronts,' said Tomorrows Leisure chairman Mr John Sanderson. He said some progress had been made on reducing debt, which stood at around Pounds 15m on September 30 1993. Mr Sanderson said it was encouraging that Redworth Hall, the company's County Durham hotel, had increased operating profits by 22 per cent and that the sale of Lavender Park was at a value well above that reflected in the March 31 1993 balance sheet. There was a loss per share of 1.7p (loss 0.9p).</p>

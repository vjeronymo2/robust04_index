			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Travel: Journey by Batty Bus to whimsical Belize - The easy-going ways of the Belizean reefs and cays entirely to his liking PORING OVER the pages of an atlas not long ago, I came across a country that I immediately wanted to visit for no reason other than its names. It is a tiny place, not much more than a spot on the map, but its names filled my imagination. Only a complete cynic could fail to see happy portents in the likes of Bound To Shine and More Tomorrow. But what of ominous places like Pull-Trouser Swamp, Burnt House, Go To Hell Camp? Would you prefer to live in Gallon Jug, Baking Pot, or Tea Kettle? Imagine life on Dog Flea Cay - perhaps Cockroach Cay would suit you better. What is Saturday night like in Dancing School Eddy? Any country with such whimsical and outlandish names, I thought, must be worth a visit. It is. Belize is a whimsical, outlandish and satisfying place. While Belize has at least in theory taken its place among the modern, independent and responsible nations of this world, I am not so sure it has caught up with this world, or is even entirely part of it. The whole country seems dottily misplaced. It functions, but in a wacky, improvised way. This became apparent as soon as I stepped on to a Belizean bus in Chetumal, a border town in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. To begin with, no one in his right mind who owns a bus company, even if his surname is Batty, names it the Batty Bus Company. Nor does anyone normally press a brand new, low-slung, low-geared city bus, the kind with seats facing each other and straps for hanging, into long-haul service on tropical jungle highways; it does not stay new for long. Nonetheless, off we set on the Batty Bus to Belize City, the motor howling as the driver put his foot to the floor and roared through the mangrove swamps at 30 mph. Not even the musical choice on board was entirely sane. Gone were the hot and excited Latin rhythms one finds blaring over the speakers of Mexican buses. Instead, whining our way southward through the muggy December afternoon, we were accompanied by Bing Crosby in a mellow medley of Christmas songs. 'Chestnuts roasting on an open fire . . . ', crooned Crosby as we ground past coconut plantations and sweated into our shirts. Not only the music, but my fellow passengers, too, seemed out of place. Here we were in the heart of central America. To the north lay Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, to the east Guatemala, to the south Honduras and El Salvador. For 1,000 miles in every direction this was an Hispanic region, a world of brown skins, rapid Spanish inflections and excitable Latin temperaments. Yet the people riding with me were more than a little relaxed, black, and speaking English. Like a foreign ship aground, Belize seems to have drifted into central America by accident, become stuck, and never left. My impressions were only reinforced in Belize City, a place which, with 50,000 people, holds about one-third of the nation's population. If Belize, the country, is a ship aground, Belize the city is already breaking up and sinking. Built on a swamp at the mouth of a sluggish creek, it stands only 18 inches above sea level. Hot, steamy and odorous, flooded when rainy and mosquito-ridden when windless, it seems just the place not to choose to build a city. So unsuitable is it that the Belizean government has installed itself in distant Belmopan. Ministers and bureaucrats are now lost far in the jungles of the interior - at last safe, however, from the hurricanes that periodically devastate the coast. In an age of urban modernisation and blandness, Belize City has a certain swash-buckling, picaresque appeal. There is little that is up-to-date, well-maintained or efficient in it. Even the Mayan ruins rising from jungle clearings in the interior seem better preserved. Its wooden houses and shops, perched on stilts to avoid the worst humidity, are slowly crumbling. Every year their clapboard sides grow more weather-beaten and peeled, their tin roofs more rust-stained. What is the earthly fruit of man's vaunting ambition? In the heat, dampness, corrosion and rot of Belize, not a great deal. In fact, if it were not for a certain Baron Bliss, an English philanthropist, Belize City would have lost count of time altogether and receded back into the primordial ooze. In a long history of colonial neglect under the British crown, Bliss appears the only one to have cared for the fate of Belize. Today the city's most notable landmarks are the results of his beneficence - the Bliss Institute, the Bliss school of nursing, the Bliss promenade, the Bliss airport transit lounge, the Bliss lighthouse and the Bliss memorial are only some of them. There is, naturally, a national Bliss Day every year to celebrate the baron's generosity. Belize's own home-grown vitality, if it exists anywhere, reposes in its people, a true salad of genes. Hacked out of virgin forest nominally under Spanish control, the country was in large part populated by African slaves brought in to work British timber concessions. But the English 'Baymen' and their black slaves were just part of the mix of the colony then known as British Honduras. There were also indigenous Maya Indians, Carib tribes from the seas to the east, immigrant Mexicans, Garifunas - the offspring of Caribs and escaped slaves - indentured East Indians and Mennonite settlers from Switzerland. Walk down a street in Belize City today and you might find yourself as culturally confused as the people who live there. Where, in this great tropical hodge-podge, does the visitor to Belize find his place? You might - like the British army units which still come to post-independence Belize - practise jungle warfare deep in the interior until you were destroyed by mosquitos. You could waste away in the bars of Belize City until you were mugged by Rastafarians. Or, like most visitors, you could head out to the cays for one of the most idyllic marine holidays it is possible to enjoy anywhere. Just a mile or two off the Belize coast lies the longest coral reef in the western hemisphere, 250 kms of warm, crystal-clear Caribbean water, colourful submarine life and the scattered small green islands known as cays. It is here that the Belizean penchant for relaxed, makeshift living reaches the level of genius. You need not be efficient, time-conscious or even vaguely formal on the cays. Such anti-social behaviour is even frowned upon as a cramp to the island style of life - witness the sign on the wall of most cay bars and restaurants: 'No shirt, no shoes, no problem.' I spent a few days on Cay Caulker, a mile-long island an hour from Belize City by fast boat. It is delightful. There is nothing out there to tax even the most stressed brain. The soothing effect of living with sky, water, leafy green island and not much else is immediate. Suddenly, everyone begins enjoying life. Like Jack and Jake, a couple of dried-out septuagenarian New York wise-crackers I met, you can spend all day drinking rum punch and fishing for tarpon. Or, like Wendy, a Labour council housing manager from London, you can put scuba tanks on your back, get away from all those people, and sort out schools of fish instead. My own choice was to spend long breezy days on Miss Conduct, a 32-ft wooden sailing boat which, shared with three other people, cost me just Dollars 7 a day. Lugging along beside the reef under patched canvas sails and a warm sun, it seemed to me there was not much more one could ask from life. When we were hungry we dropped anchor and fished for snapper. If we wanted lobster or the firm white meat of the conch shell, we dived down and hunted for it. If we felt like doing nothing, we did. The easy-going ways of the cays are quickly adopted. In no time I felt myself turning soft and lazy. One morning I told myself it was time to leave Caulker and hurry back to the real world. But that evening, when the boat returned, I met a bare-footed woman fishing from the dock. 'How many are you going to catch', I asked as she pulled in three fish. She could have caught a dozen, or six dozen, if she had wanted. 'Just enough for tea', she said. 'Fish always impatient to get caught.' She coiled her hook and line. 'Don't do them no good, though.' I thought that over. I would stay a little longer. The Batty Bus back to the real world could wait. There are no direct flights from the UK to Belize. Nicholas Woodsworth flew to Belize City via Miami with American Airlines, which offers a return fare of Pounds 508. One reason why Belize tourism remains relatively undeveloped is its capital's reputation for drug-related street crime, and care should be exercised. Happily, such provisos apply only to Belize City. There is not a great deal of travel literature on Belize. Perhaps the best guide is the Belize Handbook, from Moon Publications.</p>

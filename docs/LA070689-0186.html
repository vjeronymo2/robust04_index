			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BING SEEKS MONEY FOR SCHOOL SPORTS  </P> <P> Former Detroit Pistons star David Bing, now a steel company owner, says he  wants to raise $2 million to restore sports in the Detroit public schools.  </P> <P> The Board of Education cut all sports programs and laid off hundreds of  teachers and other employees as part of a $50-million budget-cutting plan.  Interscholastic sports made up $1.4 million of the cuts.  </P> <P> "Somebody needs to do something," said Bing, who averaged 22.6 points a game in  nine seasons with the Pistons from 1966 through 1975. He said Wednesday that he  is forming a group to raise money to continue the athletic programs.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I would love to see the sports programs saved," said school board  member David Olmstead. "'Dave Bing is probably the one person in this community  who can galvanize that kind of support." School board member George Vaughn was  less enthusiastic, saying he prefers to save academic programs.  </P> <P> "I realize there is a need for athletics, but in reality, most students do not  participate in interscholastic sports," Vaughn said.  </P></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Technology: Taiwan's hole in one Taiwan is aiming to capture the lion's share of a fledgling but potentially huge market in the newest high-tech wrinkle in golf paraphernalia. In a textbook case of Taiwan's state-led industrial advancement, the government has transferred technology which it developed for the defence and aerospace industries to the manufacture of golf clubs. The Materials Research Laboratory, part of the quasi-official Industrial Technology Research Institute, took existing carbon filament winding technology and applied it to the construction of golf club shafts. Gloria Wu, a spokeswoman for the laboratory, says the technique provides greater power and control for the player. She compared the conventional tape-rolling technique with making an egg roll, which leaves pockets of empty space. 'Using the filament winding method, there are no air spaces,' she explained. A private Taiwanese sporting goods company, Advanced Composite Design, recently began production of clubs using the technology. Four other local manufacturers are to start by the end of the year. Wu believes filament winding will supplant other techniques over the next few years. With five Taiwan companies making clubs with it, the government hopes to corner a 70 to 80 per cent share of the world market. Taiwan sporting goods manufacturers have already established a strong position making tennis rackets, fishing rods, bicycles and golf clubs. Soaring land and labour costs have prompted many Taiwan companies to move factories to southeast Asian countries and China. But makers of carbon-fibre golf clubs and other high-tech sports products have kept their manufacturing facilities in Taiwan. Ever on the lookout for a club that can propel that little white ball further and with more precision, aficionados of the game are already lining up. 'We've already got so many orders for the new clubs, we can't keep up,' says Wu.</p>

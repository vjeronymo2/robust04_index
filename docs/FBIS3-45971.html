In an interview with Chinese reporters, Haller spoke highly  about China's great efforts and achievements in its economic  development.    She reviewed traditional friendship between the Swiss  Federal  Assembly and the China's NPC. The relations between the two  sides have developed steadily since former President of the  National Council Andre Gautier visited China in 1984.    Haller hoped that Qiao's visit to her country will promote  mutual understanding and friendship between the two sides, and  wished the visit a success.    Switzerland will be the second leg of Qiao's visit to three  West European nations including Germany and Austria.    The purpose of his visit is to further mutual understanding  and friendship and enhance the friendly ties and cooperation  between China and the West European countries and their  parliamentary exchanges in particular.    Qiao is currently in Germany. He is the first top Chinese  legislator to visit Western Europe.</p>

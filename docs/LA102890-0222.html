			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> All Hollow's Eve, in which the traditional ghosts and devils will compete for  porch space with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Little Mermaids, is  Wednesday. While Knott's Scary Farm has become the premiere Halloween event in  the county for adults, there are still plenty of other local haunted houses,  carnivals and parades.  </P> <P> City-sponsored events on Wednesday include: the city of Orange's Spooky  Spectacular from 2 to 6 p.m. at 326 E. Almond Ave.; the Haunted House and  Carnival from 6 to 9 p.m. at the Cypress Community Center, 5700 Orange Ave.;  Tustin Community Services Department's Halloween Carnival from 6 to 9 p.m. at  200 S. C St.; and a Haunted House, from 5:30 to 8 p.m., at the Grant Howard  Park and Community Center, 5th and Iris avenues in Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> Parents are strongly encouraged by local law enforcement officials to do the  following if their children will be trick-or-treating door to door:  </P> <P> * Children should not eat anything collected until someone has inspected it for  tampering. Anything that is unwrapped should be thrown away. If something that  looks suspicious is found in a child's bag, it should be taken to the local  police department.  </P> <P> * Costumes should be flameproof, easy to move around in and not impair a  child's vision.  </P> <P> * Children should stick to their own neighborhood if they are going door to  door.  </P></p>

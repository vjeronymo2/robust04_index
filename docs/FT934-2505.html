			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Names' right to sue agents upheld The Court of Appeal yesterday upheld the right of loss-making Names on the Lloyd's insurance market to sue members' agents in a move that paves the way for a series of legal actions next year. The decision removes one of the final barriers to litigation by Names - the individuals whose assets traditionally supported the insurance market - on the Gooda Walker and Feltrim syndicates. Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Hoffmann and Lord Justice Henry ruled in the Court of Appeal that members' agents were contractually responsible for any negligence by the management and underwriters of syndicates they selected for Names. They did not grant leave to appeal. The ruling comes as the Names are deciding whether to accept a Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offered by Lloyd's. The Gooda Walker Action Group is expected to write to its members at the end of this week recommending that they reject Lloyd's settlement offer and continue to pursue legal action.</p>

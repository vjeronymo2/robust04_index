			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / German job losses fuel pay restraint pressure GERMAN employers' attempts to damp pay demands were reinforced yesterday by official figures which showed a sharp increase in job losses in the west and a flood of new registrations in east German unemployment offices. The engineering industry said 20,000 workers had been put out of work last year because of high labour costs. It warned that 50,000-60,000 further jobs could go this year as companies attempted to cut costs and transfer work to low-cost labour markets outside Germany. Ministers appealed for more investment in eastern industry to create permanent employment and save jobs threatened by a lack of buyers for former state-owned businesses. Slowing economic growth caused unemployment in the west to rise steeply from 5.8 per cent in December to 6.3 per cent last month. The end of special short-time working subsidies in the east pushed up sharply the proportion in the former DDR from 11.8 per cent to 16.5 per cent. There are now more than 3.2m registered unemployed in the country: 1.88m in the west, and 1.34m in the east. Mr Heinrich Franke, president of the federal labour office in Nuremberg, said: 'The days of the employment boom are behind us.' Mr Dieter Kirchner, director of Gesamtmetall, an association representing most of the country's engineering, metal-working and electronics companies, described this year's 9.5 per cent pay claim from the IG Metall union as 'exaggerated'. A poll of members showed 90 per cent had been unable to cover increased labour costs - resulting from last year's 6.7 per cent award - by routine rationalisation measures. As a result, 20,000 jobs had been cut between May and November. For this year's negotiations, he added: 'It is a question of how ready our members are to resist wage demands which I can only describe as destructive for prices and employment.' Anxiety has grown among employers since last weekend's pay award of 6.35 per cent in the steel industry, which followed a 6 per cent rise in 1991. Union officials have seized on this as a 'guideline' for the rest of this year's settlements. Mr Kirchner claimed that even a 5.7 per cent rise for engineers was 'unreasonable'. Productivity, expected to rise 2.5 per cent in engineering this year, should be the guide, he added. Industry, government, economists and the central Bundesbank have all warned in recent weeks that excessive pay rises will lead to accelerated job cuts in the west and hamper recovery in the east. At present one in six of the east German labour force is out of work.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ningbo, April 20 (XINHUA) -- China's second round of  comprehensive supplementary urban reform is being instituted in  18 pilot cities to pioneer the establishment of a socialist  market economic structure.    This was revealed at a national conference held here on  comprehensive supplementary urban reform.    The 18 cities are Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Harbin,  Changchun, Shenyang, Nanjing, Chengdu, Xian, Chongqing, Ningbo,  Anshan, Tangshan, Yantai, Tongling, Changzhou, Quanzhou and  Yanji.    These cities, large and small, coastal and inland, are  highly  reform-motivated, with solid foundations in economic reform and  economic development, and the experience drawn from the pilot  cities could have great impact on the national urban reform.    The cities will be the major areas of the new round of urban  economic reform and their influence is expected to promote  China's market economy, said Wang Shiyuan, vice-minister of the  State Commission of Economic Restructuring.    The pilot reform measures carried out by these cities  include:    -- Reform the property rights system to transform  enterprises  in line with common practices in modern enterprises in the world;    -- Bring the market mechanism into full play in resources  allocation, and cultivate and develop the market system;    -- Change the functions of the government to serve the  market  development;    -- Establish a sound social security system and reform the  housing system.    -- Carry on other supplementary measures in other fields to  guaranteeing the overall economic reform.    The vice-minister said that different from other pilot  schemes, the 18 cities will not enjoy privileges as such cities  previously did.    "The experience drawn this way could be applicable in other  places," Wang said, noting that preferential policies run  against the market economy, which is based on competition on an  equal footing and international practice.    Wang's commission will be responsible for designing  standards  for the experimental work, establish a work conference system  among pilot cities, a liaison system and an "assessment quotas  system for reform experiments."</p>

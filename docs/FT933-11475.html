The sniffiest are the unmarried; those in wedlock being 'mostly less exposed to bodily contact or simply more tolerant', the institute somewhat arcanely explains. There are also differences by occupation. For example, only 30 per cent of farmers, no doubt distracted by earthier smells, make complaints about such olfactory offences. But those paradigms of pedantry, public officials, turn up their noses at the rate of 49 per cent.</p>

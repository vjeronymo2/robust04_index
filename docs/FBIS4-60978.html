			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fedor Ignatov] </F>   [Text] Almaty, 2 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Almaty city  committee for emergencies announced an emergency situation in  the capital of Kazakhstan from today. Due to the sharp  restriction in the supply of fuels to the Almatynefteprodukt  association and the Munayavtomatizatsiya joint-stock  association, the dispatch of fuel to all enterprises and  organizations, apart from those directly providing the city's  vital facilities, is to be prohibited until special instruction.  Tough restrictions on the supply of electricity to consumers  have been introduced. In certain districts of the city, the  temperature of hot water has been reduced to 40 degrees Celcius.    Speaking on republician television, the city's mayor  Zamanbek  Nurkadilov said that neither the prime minister nor his deputy  wishes to discuss the present situation with him. "If the prime  minister does not want to meet the city's head," Nurkadilov  said, "and if other high-ranking officials also ignore the  city's problems, then the natural question arises: Whyt do we  need such a government?"    The mayor expressed hope that the leadership of those  regions  which supply the capital of Kazakhstan with coal, petroleum  products, and gas will not remain indifferent to the emergency  situation that has been introduced.</p>

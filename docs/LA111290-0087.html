			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> As the Raiders discovered Sunday, guys named Magic are tough to beat in Los  Angeles. . . .  </P> <P> What courage and durability Don Majkowski showed by shrugging off eight sacks  to lead Green Bay to victory. . . .  </P> <P> Beginning next Monday in Miami, we'll find out whether the real Raiders are  those who won their first five or those who lost three of their last four. . .  .  </P> <P> Time of possession stat of the day: Green Bay had the ball for 13:37 of the  first quarter and trailed, 13-3. . . .  </P> <P> Bo Jackson and Marcus Allen should spend more time in the same backfield. . . .  </P> <P> Why were so many "experts" surprised that the unbeaten New York Giants  manhandled the oft-beaten Rams? . . .  </P> <P> The Indianapolis-New England game lived down to expectations. . . .  </P> <P> Didn't we just see the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night football? . . .  </P> <P> No NFL game Sunday or today matched two teams with winning records. . . .  </P> <P> So far, so good for Jim Shofner, the Cleveland Browns' new coach. . . .  </P> <P> Suddenly, UCLA-USC looks more interesting. . . .  </P> <P> The Bruins weren't lucky to upset Washington. They would have been unlucky if  the game had ended in a tie. They overcame the Huskies' physical advantages to  lead in every major statistical department. . . .  </P> <P> Washington no longer should worry so much about whether to tear down the goal  posts after the game. . . .  </P> <P> In a hostile environment, redshirt freshman quarterback Tommy Maddox showed the  kind of poise you wouldn't expect from even a senior. . . .  </P> <P> I know who's going to start at quarterback for UCLA Saturday in the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> I'm not so sure who's going to start for USC. . . .  </P> <P> If Tennessee had beaten Notre Dame, who would be No. 1 today? Colorado (9-1-1)  or maybe even Miami (6-2). . . .  </P> <P> News item: Notre Dame's Rocket Ismail carries the ball only six times against  Tennessee. Reaction: Lou Holtz must have wanted to hold the score down. . . .  </P> <P> You had to see Ohio State's victory over Iowa not to believe it. . . .  </P> <P> Next year, the bowls probably will send out their invitations Sept. 1. . . .  </P> <P> When Oregon State draws 18,795 in Corvallis for a USC game, it's time to toss  the Beavers out of the Pac-10 and bring BYU into the fold. . . .  </P> <P> Mr. Consistency, Ty Detmer, seems to be pulling away in the Heisman Trophy  race. . . .  </P> <P> Look for gutty Houston to rebound from its loss to Texas next Saturday against  Eastern Washington. . . .  </P> <P> Pitt's Paul Hackett may regret that he ever became a head coach. . . .  </P> <P> The Arizona Wildcats are the Cincinnati Bengals of the Pac-10. . . .  </P> <P> No wonder everybody is jealous of Los Angeles. It gives up so little talent to  obtain its superstars. . . .  </P> <P> The Dodgers will send the New York Mets a draft choice for free agent Darryl  Strawberry. Wilt Chamberlain came to the Lakers from Philadelphia for Darrall  Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers in 1968. The Lakers sent David Meyers,  Junior Bridgeman, Elmore Smith and Brian Winters to Milwaukee for Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar and Walt Wesley in 1975. And Wayne Gretzky came to the Kings along  with Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley from Edmonton for Jimmy Carson,  Martin Gelinas, and three draft picks in 1988. . . .  </P> <P> Strawberry will play hard for Tom Lasorda. . . .  </P> <P> The Mets are showing a lot of class with their horror stories about Strawberry  now that he no longer is in their employ. . . .  </P> <P> Can we retract those words of praise for Peter Ueberroth as baseball  commissioner? . . .  </P> <P> George Foreman is portraying a very large heavyweight contender on an episode  of the new Ryan O'Neal-Farrah Fawcett sitcom being shot this week. . . .  </P> <P> The boos the Clippers received during their whipping by Atlanta Saturday at the  Sports Arena were richly deserved. . . .  </P> <P> Shouldn't be long now before Mr. Robinson asks the San Antonio Spurs to  renegotiate his contract. . . .  </P> <P> The Lakers didn't sell out opening night at the Forum against Western  Conference champion Portland and there were plenty of empty seats Friday for  Sacramento. Must be a combination of the economy, high ticket prices and lower  expectations in the product. . . .  </P> <P> Paul Westhead is to basketball what the aluminum bat is to baseball.  </P></p>

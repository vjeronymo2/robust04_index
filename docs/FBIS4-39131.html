			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikita Gololobov report in the "Power" column: "The Battle </F> of Giants in the Capital. Rivalry Between Russia's Premier and  Moscow's Mayor Grows More Acute"]    [Text] The rivalry between the clans of Viktor  Chernomyrdin and Yuriy Luzhkov, which has until recently  proceeded "under the carpet," has now, as analysts predicted,  come out into the open, with appeals to the president and the  enlisting of the prosecutor's office, the press, and electronic  media.    The rivalry has been simmering for a long time. Yuriy  Luzhkov and the Moscow government, unhappy over their share of  revenues from the privatization of enterprises according to  federal laws and over what they see as infringement of the  Moscow administration's powers, have sharply attacked  "Chubays-style" privatization. Furthermore, Yuriy Luzhkov has  sought and obtained from Boris Yeltsin a special status for  Moscow and its government. Federal government resolutions have  virtually no effect on the territory of the capital, and it has  been accorded substantial tax breaks.    The nature of the Moscow mayor's influence on the president  is evident: Boris Yeltsin's political and power support is  based mainly in the capital, and the Kremlin, as is known, is  also located in Moscow.    Seeing such a strengthening of his rival's positions, the  government chairman, unhappy with the special status of the  Moscow "baron," as a warning to other regions supported Anatoliy  Chubays in his duel with Yuriy Luzhkov. In response, several  Moscow papers ran publications about Viktor Chernomyrdin's close  associate, Oleg Soskovets, accusing the latter of corruption in  privatizing the Novosibirsk tin plant and other metallurgical  enterprises. Viktor Chernomyrdin, for his part, organized an  inspection of Most-bank's performance, which began in early May.  The prosecutor's office has already started examination of the  letter by Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays alleging gross  violations of privatization laws by the mayor and the Moscow  city government. Yuriy Luzhkov took countermeasures. According  to information in our possession, before the premier went on a  two-week vacation, Luzhkov had a "no-holds-barred" conversation  with him. It is not ruled out that prior to that he had  enlisted the president's support.    What matters here, however, are not privatization methods.  Yuriy Luzhkov, just like all representatives of regional  elites, is unhappy with at least two features of the  "Chubays-style" privatization. First, as a result of  enterprises and factories being sold off, they lose control of a  substantial part of real estate located on their territory  without getting anything in exchange. Second, privatization of  large enterprises will lead to a change in the traditional  methods of management and possibly provoke discontent among the  population which has not yet become accustomed to its fate being  decided by a private owner.    The Kremlin seems to be watching with satisfaction the  mutual  weakening of these two powerful groupings and the discrediting  of their leaders.    In this situation, politicians conduct themselves  differently.    Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, as an experienced politician,  calculating various options for a long term, has recently sought  not to mar relations with the Yuriy Luzhkov group in order to  retain his political positions in the event of Viktor  Chernomyrdin's resignation.    Yuriy Skokov, Russian Commodity Producers Federation  chairman, who, according to many observers, is the main  candidate for the post of premier -- if it is vacated --  retaining the reputation as a man unblemished in the process  popularly stigmatized as "piratization" ["prikhvatizatsiya"], is  trying to avoid any intriguing either against Viktor  Chernomyrdin or Yuriy Luzhkov.    It is not ruled out that the first results of the "battle of  giants" will not be long in coming. According to a source in  the Moscow mayoral entourage, we shall learn about some serious  cadre reshuffles before Viktor Chernomyrdin returns from his  vacation.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Tea A more widespread demand prevailed, reports the Tea Brokers Association. Landed Assams met better competition although generally at lower levels. Brighter liquoring east African teas came to an improved market particularly for Pekoe Dusts. Coloury mediums ruled fully firm to dearer but plainer descriptions were irregular. Ceylons sold readily with little change in prices. Offshore good demand at firm to dearer rates. The highest price realised this week was 160p for a Kenya pf. 1. Prices: quality 150p, good medium 118p, medium 94p, low medium 78p.</p>

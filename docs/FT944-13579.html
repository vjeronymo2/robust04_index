			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Tighter checks on spending by quangos urged Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, last night called for more effective checks on the spending of taxpayers' money by quangos. He urged the government to expand the powers of the committee and the National Audit Office - the government spending watchdog - to enable them to inspect the books of all quangos primarily financed from public funds. Mr Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyme and a former Treasury minister, said he and Sir Peter Hordern, Conservative MP for Horsham and chairman of the Public Accounts Commission, had already discussed the issue with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. While hoping for a favourable response from the government, Mr Sheldon admitted that the public accounts committee was unlikely to be given the power to 'pursue public money wherever it goes'. Pressing for wider powers for the National Audit Office, he said it should be able to audit the accounts of all quangos. Quangos should also be required to change their auditors frequently so that they did not develop 'too close a relationship' with a particular group of accountants. More stringent checks on the activities of quangos were also demanded by Mr Robert Maclennan, president of the Liberal Democrats. Mr Maclennan said the government should recognise that there was something wrong going far beyond a few local difficulties. He insisted that the National Audit Office should have the power to decide which quangos it wished to investigate, and go where the government would prefer it not to go.</p>

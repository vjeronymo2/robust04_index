			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  convinced that the success or failure of his administration  depends on political reform and "an election revolution," plans  to bring about drastic changes as soon as the National Assembly  adopts political legislation at its extraordinary session in  February. Pending in the National Assembly are political reform  bills on unified elections, political fund-raising and local  autonomous bodies.    As part of the reforms, President Kim hopes to have the  political fund-raising law revised and passed by the National  Assembly so as to halt under-the-table contributions and other  illegal funding channels.    The current law on political fund-raising has been all but  dead since Kim's civilian administration was launched last  February, with the president declaring that he would receive no  money from political funds.    One senior Chongwadae [presidential offices] official on  Sunday acknowledged the persistent skepticism regarding the  practicality of revising the political fund-raising bill as "the  proposed revision is idealistic."    "But those who voice doubt about the revised bill are the  ones who do not know the will and determination of President Kim  for political reform," the official said, adding that the flow  of "all black money" will be shut off in the future.    The government will help carry out the current elections for  heads of the nation's agricultural, fishery and livestock  cooperatives in a fair and correct manner.    It hopes to apply the revised election law beginning with  by-  elections for local councils that are scheduled for this year,  the official said.    He said the government will then employ its power to hold  fair and clean elections for chiefs of local autonomous  governing bodies and polls for provincial and city councils in  1995.    President Kim has said that he will carry out political  reform at any cost, even if it means that all National Assembly  representatives lose their seats for violating the election law,  the official added.    The president also believes that political reform should be  realized not in stages but in a drastic manner, he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: OUT TO TOPPLE KOPPEL;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: CBS ENTERS THE RING IN A FIGHT FOR THE LATE-NIGHT AUDIENCE. NEWS  FANS WILL BE THE WINNERS AS THE BIG THREE AND CNN DUKE IT OUT.  </P> <P> Ted Koppel's decade-old ABC institution, "Nightline," is about to face some  first-class news competition.  </P> <P> Starting Monday at 11:30 p.m., CBS will pit Charles Kuralt and Lesley Stahl  against "Nightline" with their own half-hour series, "America Tonight."  </P> <P> Just as "Nightline" grew out of reports on the Iran hostage crisis, the  Kuralt-Stahl series is a product of their specials on the Persian Gulf  showdown.  </P> <P> And for TV, the new CBS challenge to Koppel is an opening shot in a suddenly  expanding network battle for the late-night -- in fact, all-night -- audience.  </P> <P> The impact of Ted Turner's 24-hour CNN on the Big Three has never been so  pronounced.  </P> <P> By January, the news departments of ABC and NBC plan to join CBS -- which  already has "Nightwatch" in the wee hours -- in offering programming that lasts  until dawn.  </P> <P> This week's CBS confirmation of the Kuralt-Stahl series, plus the announcements  of the ABC and NBC expansion plans, are significant network steps.  </P> <P> The result is hog heaven for news junkies. But it's also a major move by the  declining Big Three to woo new viewers, reap untapped profits and win praise  for worthy shows.  </P> <P> Kuralt acknowledges that he and Stahl may have until only the end of the year  to make their series a ratings winner. Some believe their nightly program may  be strictly a stopgap until CBS finds a high-profile entertainment alternative.  </P> <P> "But I think this series will last," Kuralt says. "There's an audience for it,  even against Ted's show. I think we'll do things so interestingly that people  will find our program just as compelling as Ted's."  </P> <P> Kuralt's job is to turn in "one solid piece each night. That's what they want  me to do."  </P> <P> And that means his trademark "On the Road" pieces are out for now -- no time --  although he'll continue his distinguished "Sunday Morning" series.  </P> <P> While Kuralt will be based in New York, Stahl will remain in Washington, where  she will also continue as anchor of "Face the Nation."  </P> <P> Koppel thinks of Kuralt and Stahl as "fine professionals, and I'm sure they'll  do a fine broadcast," but he also knows that other factors probably encouraged  CBS to start the new series.  </P> <P> Most important, CBS' "Pat Sajak Show" failed, and late-night has since been a  void for the network, prompting some of its stations to look toward syndicated  replacements such as the Arsenio Hall program.  </P> <P> "CBS has tried a number of different things over the past few years and none of  them has worked," Koppel says.  </P> <P> But, he adds, because "this is a time of high news interest in the Persian  Gulf," it's a good move to go with something like the Kuralt-Stahl series.  </P> <P> Says Koppel: "I think that what CBS is doing is an acknowledgement that  whatever they've done hasn't succeeded, and if you're going to wind up with a  smaller audience -- as all networks are -- you might as well get credit for  what you do."  </P> <P> As for ABC's planned 1-6 a.m. newscast aimed for a Jan. 7 start, and NBC's  launch the same month of a 24-hour service providing stories for its local  stations, Koppel says:  </P> <P> "It seems to me the networks are amortizing their expenses and using the only  time they have left. Given the success of CNN, it was inevitable."  </P> <P> Koppel figures the networks may have been influenced in their expansion by the  fact that CNN has been able "to make a go of it . . . even though CNN, in its  most-watched hours, doesn't match network audiences in their least-watched  hours."  </P> <P> But CNN executive vice president Ed Turner says he's "mystified" by the  networks' new late-night projects:  </P> <P> "Where's the appetite? News has such a narrow audience anyway, except in  crisis, and overnight it really falls off. And you've got CNN and Headline News  and C-SPAN and maybe CNBC -- and probably all-news radio in major markets.  </P> <P> "And now along comes NBC and ABC, plus CBS with its (Kuralt-Stahl) half-hour  and whatever it does with Charlie Rose's old show ('Nightwatch')."  </P> <P> Rose, however, and Linda Ellerbee -- both famous names in overnight TV --  believe that there's a strong appetite for news in the wee hours.  </P> <P> "I know there's an audience out there," says Rose, who left "Nightwatch" this  year to become anchor of Fox Broadcasting's new "Personalities" series.  </P> <P> "There's a community of people in the middle of the night who want to be  informed, engaged. They're looking for a companion, looking for stories. I'm  very pleased to see (the expansion) happening. It's just television pushing the  frontiers."  </P> <P> Ellerbee, anchor of the "NBC News Overnight" series in the early 1980s,  recalls:  </P> <P> "When we were canceled, we were told there simply was not an audience. And we  said, 'Oh yes, there is. You're not measuring it properly.' And then later on,  the networks started saying they didn't think overnight audiences were being  measured properly. I think the audience was always there."  </P> <P> But now, she says, "The threat is bigger from CNN. Isn't it funny how we've  seen it go from 'CNN will never last' to 'We want to be CNN'?"  </P> <P> Each network has other reasons for expanding its late-night news. CBS is  desperate to stop affiliate defection -- and hopes programs such as the  Kuralt-Stahl series will carry over viewers to the network's low-rated "This  Morning" show with Harry Smith and Paula Zahn.  </P> <P> ABC, which says its 1-6 a.m. project still must win budget approval, is  developing the show at the request of its stations. It plans to use two  anchors, and affiliates would be able to carry from two to five hours, produced  in 30-minute packages -- an apparent challenge to CNN's Headline News channel  and its format.  </P> <P> NBC is the strongest network in late-night with the Johnny Carson, David  Letterman and Bob Costas shows. Its 24-hour news feed will simply supply its  stations with raw material. But an NBC source says, "Once the service is up and  running, we can begin to examine program possibilities. Everyone's getting a  smaller piece of the TV pie, and we're looking for different sources of revenue  anywhere we can."  </P> <P> John Rohrbeck, general manager of KNBC Channel 4, says he's strongly in favor  of around-the-clock programming: "There's an audience out there. A station must  be on the air 24 hours a day. Any time a station signs off, it has to  jump-start itself again."  </P></p>

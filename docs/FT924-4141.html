			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (10): Activity still sluggish  -The US AN AIR of dreary inactivity hangs over the management buy-out business in the US. Few deals are being done, many leveraged buy-out funds are embarrassingly flush with funds and existing MBOs, undertaken in the heady 1980s, are mainly interested in refinancing their balance sheets, replacing high levels of borrowings with either equity or a less expensive debt securities. Industry figures paint the picture clearly. According to Securities Data, the financial information services group, the current year has generated 124 management buy-out deals, with a total value of Dollars 4.87bn (this is measured in terms of deals announced, not necessarily completed, and the cumulative total runs up until November 16). This level of activity is roughly on a par with the equally drab levels seen in 1991. Then, in the 12-month period, 170 transactions were announced, with an aggregate value of Dollars 4.79bn. This, in turn, repeated the 1990 experience, when managements and deal-makers produced 175 deals, with a combined total value of Dollars 5.61bn. But in all three years - 1990, 1991, and 1992 - activity was way short of the veritable feast of MBOs undertaken in the late-1980s. In 1989, for example, the industry notched up 296 transactions, with a value of Dollars 34.4bn while in 1988, the figures ran at 294, with a heady aggregate value of Dollars 84.5bn. The reasons for this drop-off in activity have been well-explored. For a start, the crisis in the US commercial banking sector - fuelled by its exposure to ailing property assets - has meant that banking support for anything but the most conservatively-structured deal has been hard to obtain. Second, the recession has made the profitability of many businesses unpredictable, and hence the stable cash-flow projections, essential to a successful MBO, cannot be guaranteed. In fact, the only significant management buy-out deal undertaken this year has been the purchase of American Re-Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the large Aetna Life &amp; Casualty insurance group, by a group led by Kolhberg, Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street LBO specialists. The deal put a price-tag of around Dollars 1.4bn on the reinsurance business, and represented the first billion-dollar-plus deal engineered by KKR since its record-breaking Dollars 25bn purchase of RJR Nabisco in 1989. It was all the more surprising that this single billion-dollar MBO should occur in the insurance sector, which was generally kept out of the debt-financed takeover binge of the 1980s - not least by wary state insurance regulators. The AmRe deal, however, was complex and a less than 'clean' disposal on Aetna's part. Although the seller received around Dollars 1.3bn in cash and took a Dollars 78m gain on the sale into its third quarter results, the Hartford-based insurer also provided a reinsurance contract to AmRe. This provided that Aetna would meet 80 per cent of any AmRe incurred losses for 1991 or earlier that are still outstanding at January 1, 1992, and in excess of Dollars 2.7bn. The maximum potential payment was capped at Dollars 500m. After the AmRe transaction, the value of individual deals announced this year falls away sharply. The next largest is the pending offer by a management group and First Chicago Venture Capital, part of First Chicago bank, for a variety of timber-related assets put up for sale by Procter &amp; Gamble. According to Securities Data, the estimated bid price is Dollars 700m. P&amp;G announced that it intended to divest its entire wood pulp division back in March, and has already agreed to sell part of the division to Weyerhaeuser, the large West Coast timber company. After that, there is the Dollars 525m purchase of MS/Essex Holdings, a New York-based manufacturer of electric cable, wire and wire insulating materials, by Bessmer Capital Partners, acting in conjunction with the management and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage house. In this case the seller was also an LBO investor - namely, the Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II. It is difficult to envisage any dramatic improvement in the climate for MBOs in the US in the immediate future. Although there are some signs of an improvement in the economic climate, they are tentative and the confidence which suffused the 1980s is still sadly lacking. The banking industry, if slowing recuperating, is scarcely healthy - and the real estate market remains tough. In short, the MBO market could be caught in the doldrums for a while yet.</p>

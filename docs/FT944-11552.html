			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Burtonwood Brewery edges ahead Burtonwood Brewery reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.97m to Pounds 2.05m in the half year to September 24. The 4 per cent advance was achieved on lower turnover of Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 26m), although directors said that if turnover was adjusted to reflect disposals of off-licences the underlying trend would show a 2.6 per cent increase. Earnings per share were 6.5p (6p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 0.8p (0.7p) to reduce disparity.</p>

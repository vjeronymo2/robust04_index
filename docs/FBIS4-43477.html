			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bank for International Settlements </F> Sees Italy's Options as Limited"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Basel, June 13 -- The high ratio of  Italy's primary deficit over its gross domestic product,  together with its pension costs which will swell when the  "baby-boomer" generation retires, leaves it little room to  maneuver in order to benefit from automatic stabilizers,  according to the latest report from the Bank for International  Settlements (BIS).    These problems are also on the horizon for other  industrialized countries, with the exception of Japan and  Ireland, which over the past four years have eased public debt  pressure on the GDP, but they are particularly evident in Italy  where the deficit is far above the GDP and pension costs  represent 21 percent of public spending, the highest among the  Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized countries.    The pension question in Italy will become even more serious  following last week's ruling by the Italian supreme  Constitutional Court that even those with more than one pension  could benefit from minimum pension treatment. A ruling that was  retroactive to 1984 and could cost Italy as much as 10 billion  dollars.    According to BIS calculations, the pressure of pension costs  on the Italian GDP will double in 50 years, passing from 11  percent in 1990 to 22 percent in the year 2040.    Italy, like many other countries, is seeking to raise the  retirement age, reduce benefits and introduce retirement funds.  These measures, the BIS pointed out, aim at defusing the pension  "bomb" and give public budget more flexibility.    "Given the future pressure caused by the general aging of  the  population" the BIS report said, "and the pressure this will  exert on public spending, a phenomena which has already hurt the  credibility of economic authorities in the current recessive  phase, many governments will have no choice except move towards  tight fiscal policies which aim at consolidating the debt to  ward off undesired effects on financial markets".    Last year, the BIS report recalled using OECD data, Italy's  net deficit reached 112 percent of its GDP, up fro 96 percent in  1989, greater than the average 10 percentage point growth among  G-7 countries.    The BIS also warned about the "vulnerability" of public debt  in connection with interest rates, stressing how "In Italy some  65 percent of the deficit is at short-term rates or at an index  adjusted rate. This makes it highly susceptible to rate  fluctuation," as demonstrated in the 1992-93 currency crisis.    "The credibility of economic authorities and budget plans"  the BIS report observed, "plays an essential role in determining  changes in fiscal policies. Medium-term budget plans, in order  to have an effect on the level of debt, public spending and  interest rates, must generate positive expectations." [passage  omitted]</p>

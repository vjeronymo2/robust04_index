The factory is located about 15 km from Angkor Wat  and the owner was not present when the factory was raided. The  Khmer Rouge took all valuables at the factory and continued  robbing other people in the vicinity. The bandits spent about  45 minutes looting until government troops arrived and exchanged  fire with them. A Khmer Rouge soldier was wounded and two  houses were destroyed. The bandits fled southward heading for  Tonle Sap and robbed people along the way.    Relief officials in Siem Reap are worried about their  security because it is possible that the group will return as  government soldiers are preparing operations to flush out the  Khmer Rouge from Angkor Wat because their presence affects  tourism. There was also a report from Phnom Penh that  government troops are preparing to take the Khmer Rouge  headquarters in Pailin.    Major General Por Vannak, a high-level military officer of  the Cambodian Army, said in Ratanakmondol, a government  stronghold about 40 km east of the Khmer Rouge command post,  that government forces were only two km away from the Khmer  Rouge stronghold. Maj. Gen. Por Vannak said the Khmer Rouge  stronghold had been encircled. A private of the government  Army, Mei Tit, said many houses in Pailin raised white flags  yesterday when the government forces were about to launch  attacks on the first day of the operation to take Pailin.    The Cambodian Government issued a warning several months in  advance that it would launch an operation to take Pailin because  the Khmer Rouge refused to negotiate in order to end the  decade-long civil war.</p>

(``NASD'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD hereby files, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, for Commission authorization to extend the operation of its Pilot Program with the Stock Exchange of Singapore Limited (``SES'') for six months. The Pilot Program currently consists of an interchange of closing price and volume data on up to 35 Nasdaq securities that also may be traded through the SES's facilities (collectively, ``Pilot Securities''). With the thirteen hour time difference (twelve hours during EDT), the trading hours of the SES and NASD markets do not overlap. The end-of-day information being exchanged under the Pilot Program may assist in the establishment of opening prices the following business day. The Pilot Program currently involves no automated order routing or execution capabilities, and no such capability will be established during the proposed extension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission originally authorized operation of the NASD&hyph;SES Pilot Program for a two-year term <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  that was extended most recently through May 12, 1994. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Commission approval of the instant filing would permit continuation of this Pilot Program through November 12, 1994. During this interval, no more than 35 Nasdaq issues will be included in this Pilot Program. That figure corresponds to the number originally authorized at the inception of the Pilot Program in 1988. As noted in File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;28, the SES information being transmitted to the NASD reflects the SES's use of an order-driven trading system (known as the ``CLOB''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Release No. 34&hyph;25457 (Mar. 14, 1988), 53 FR 9156 (Mar. 21, 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Release No. 34&hyph;33061 (Oct. 15, 1993), 58 FR 54617 (Oct. 22, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique by the Ministry of Royal Palaces, Protocol, and </F> Decorations; issued in Rabat on 27 February]    [Excerpt] His Majesty King Hassan II, may God render him  victorious, received Abu-Marwan, ambassador of the State of  Palestine in Morocco, at the Royal Palace on Saturday evening.  During the audience his majesty expressed again to the  ambassador his profound sentiments and condemnation of the  terrible massacre which was committed by the criminals at the  holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque [in Hebron]. He reaffirmed to the  ambassador that this massacre, despite its ugliness and  severity, will be an incentive for the international community  to understand more the sufferings of the Palestinian people, and  for the awareness of the international community of the need for  the withdrawal of the Israeli forces [from the occupied  territories] as soon as possible, as these painful events have  shown beyond any shadow of a doubt that the fanatics have no  regard for the sanctity of God's houses which are holy places  for both Muslims and Jews.    His majesty the king has graciously decided to adopt the  families of the martyrs of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque -- widows, and  orphans -- and reaffirmed that the Moroccan Kingdom will  undertake to meet the needs of these widows and look after their  children and ensure that they will receive their education until  they become of age.    In view of the aggravation of these events his majesty the  king phoned the Palestinian president [Yasir 'Arafat] to  exchange views regarding the steps which ought to be taken to  confront these situations and their consequences. He expressed  to him the royal will to look after the families of the martyrs  -- widows and orphans -- as a gesture of sympathy toward them  and to share their grief.    The ambassador expressed to his majesty the gratitude and  thanks of the Palestinian people and officials for the wise  counsel which his majesty continues to provide for the  Palestinian issue, and for his majesty's continuous attention  for Holy Jerusalem and the righteous strugglers. He implored  God Almighty to keep His Majesty as a strong support for his  homeland and nation. [passage omitted]</p>

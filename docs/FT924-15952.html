			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hostile conditions blamed for ADollars 432m losses at Jennings JENNINGS, Australia's biggest homebuilder, yesterday announced a 1991-92 loss of ADollars 432m (USDollars 309m) after extraordinary losses of ADollars 441m, and forecast that a revival of the commercial property market may be delayed until 1997. Jennings blamed 'hostile' conditions in non-residential property markets for the poor result, which followed a comparable loss of ADollars 144m in the previous year. 'It is now apparent that any recovery is distant and the normally-expected cyclical upturn may not occur for three to five years,' the board said. Jennings said the extraordinary loss included write-offs totalling ADollars 144m against two large commercial property projects in Victoria, together with heavy losses incurred in the US and in Australian leisure projects. The board said it had accepted proposals from its banks for an accelerated sale of assets in the current year. The group is also undergoing a financial restructuring supervised by Arthur Andersen, the firm of accountants. The restructuring involves a debt-for-equity swap with Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand, the group's biggest shareholder, which is intended to eliminate its deficiency on shareholder funds of ADollars 212m. Jennings said its core housing business was continuing to perform well in a difficult period and had contributed to a pre-tax operating profit of ADollars 8.7m, down from ADollars 9.5m in the previous year. Its shares closed steady at 11 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 19 (CTK) -- Slovakia needs 17  billion crowns (about 515 million USD) to complete construction  of the nuclear power plant at Mochovce, an official at the  Economy Ministry said today.    The plant's first two reactors, which are 90 percent  complete, were to have started operating by 1995, but now it  appears they will not be ready until 2000.    Work on the plant was interrupted last year due to a lack of  money and the breakup of its supply system. The Economy  Ministry and Slovak industry representatives are negotiating  conditions for a loan to pay sub-contractors.    Those from the Czech Republic who participated in the  plant's  construction, mainly through the Skoda Plzen engineering group,  are owed 2.1 billion Slovak crowns.    The Economy Ministry's Imrich Szitas said it appeared that  Russia, the plant's likely future supplier of nuclear fuel,  would provide a loan of 450 million USD. Preliminary talks  between Economics Minister Peter Magvasi and Russian officials  suggest that Slovak imports of fuel would be paid for with  exports of Slovak goods.    Talks are also being conducted with the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and a consortium of  Electricite de France and Bayernwerk of Germany on a possible  loan of 1.3 billion marks that would be paid through supplies of  electricity.    Szitas denied that the EBRD made a loan conditional on the  shutting down of a reactor at another Slovak nuclear plant,  located in Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia. It will be shut  down once the Mochovce plant is completed, he said.    The entire plant in Jaslovske Bohunice is undergoing changes  to increase safety in a gradual process that is to be completed  in 1997, Szitas noted.</p>

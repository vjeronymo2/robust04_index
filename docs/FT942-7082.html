			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / S Africa looks to growth in arms sales South Africa hopes to double arms exports over the next year following the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, which spurred previous governments to develop a sophisticated arms manufacturing industry. Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms procurement agency, told a news conference yesterday the company could boost defence exports by more than R1bn (Pounds 180m) in the current fiscal year. His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which are globally competitive. Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of moral arguments against arms exports. However South Africa's urgent need for foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably combine to protect Armscor's activities in future.</p>

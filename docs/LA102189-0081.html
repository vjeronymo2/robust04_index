			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLAZE EVICTS ATTY. GEN. AND STATE COURT STAFF;  </P> <P> FIRE: THREE DAYS AFTER THE BAY-AREA EARTHQUAKE SHUT DOWN THEIR SAN FRANCISCO  BRANCHES, STATE JUSTICE WORKERS HAVE BEEN FORCED FROM THEIR MID-WILSHIRE  QUARTERS.  </P> <P> Only three days after the Bay-Area earthquake shut down their San Francisco  branches, the state attorney general's office and the California appellate and  Supreme courts were forced out of their quarters in Los Angeles on Friday by a  fire in a Mid-Wilshire high-rise.  </P> <P> The 12:30 a.m. blaze, which engulfed a top-floor corner of the western  structure of twin-tower Paramount Plaza, damaged court records and idled  hundreds of state employees indefinitely, attorney general's spokesman Duane  Peterson said.  </P> <P> No one was hurt in the fire, which caused an estimated $2 million in damage to  the 21-story tower at 3580 Wilshire Blvd., according to Los Angeles Fire  Department spokesman Alan Barrios. Eleven floors of the building sustained  smoke and water damage, he said.  </P> <P> The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Barrios said.  </P> <P> Peterson said the state offices store records on the top floor of the building,  but only documents from the 2nd District Court of Appeal suffered damage. There  has not been a full inspection to determine how many documents were lost, he  said.  </P> <P> Lynn Holton, a spokeswoman for the state Supreme Court, said the fire would  inconvenience the public rather than the Supreme Court because the high court's  Los Angeles office is used only for the filing of cases.  </P> <P> "The fire doesn't really affect court operations," she said from the court's  Sacramento offices. "But it'll be a problem for people who need to file  documents because they'll have to wait.  </P> <P> "I would not think that's a substantial problem . . . if the building is closed  for one day. But if it's closed for a long time, it could be a problem."  </P> <P> The Supreme Court justices will hear cases at another location in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Officials of the Court of Appeal, which does hear arguments in the Los Angeles  building, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "I'm confident that no ongoing trials will be hampered," Peterson said. "But  for longer-term appeals, it remains to be seen what will happen."  </P> <P> After the fire, Peterson said, about 100 of the 450 employees in his office  were able to work out of offices in the adjoining tower. But he was unsure how  long the small team could handle the mounting workload.  </P> <P> "If the dislocation is just a few days," he said, "we won't feel the effects  much at all. . . . If it's permanently closed and we have to relocate 350  people, that may pose a problem."  </P> <P> But the Los Angeles employees were less concerned for themselves than for their  colleagues in the Bay Area, he added.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a burden to recover from the fire, but we can make do,"  Peterson said. "Compared to what happened in San Francisco, the Los Angeles  employees know that . . . our loss was negligible."  </P> <P> In Tuesday's devastating quake, the San Francisco building that houses the  courts and the attorney general's office suffered structural damage. Engineers  are determining whether it can ever be safely used.  </P> <P> Peterson said employees from the San Francisco branch of the state Supreme  Court had been expected to move into the Los Angeles office Friday.  </P> <P> "Now, they can't use the offices here, either," he said.  </P> <P> Paramount Plaza officials posted signs saying the damaged building will remain  closed at least until Monday.  </P> <P> But inspectors from the Department of Building and Safety, who condemned the  21st floor of the tower, said the building could be closed much longer because  of dangerous levels of asbestos within the structure.  </P> <P> "It's a very serious concern to the department and to the tenants," said Robert  Picott, deputy superintendent of the department. "Our inspection people were  asked to leave because of the asbestos problem in the air."  </P> <P> Inspectors will not go back into the building until "there is certification  that the air level is safe to breathe," he said.  </P></p>

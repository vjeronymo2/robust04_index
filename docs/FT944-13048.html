			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Tunnel collapse inquiry delayed An investigation into the cause of the collapse of a railway tunnel under construction at London's Heathrow airport could take longer than originally expected, BAA, the airport operator said yesterday. News of the delay followed an announcement by the Health and Safety Executive late on Thursday that it would carry out its own investigation of the collapse. It plans to publish its findings. The problems at Heathrow started a week ago when earth began slipping into a tunnel being excavated using a technique known as the new Austrian tunnelling method. The tunnel forms part of the Pounds 300m Heathrow express rail link to Paddington station in London. BAA said it would take until the end of next week at the earliest before its own inquiry produced any conclusions. Work on the collapse site, near the Terminal 3 car park, will remain suspended as will tunnelling using the same method at two sites on the Jubilee Line extension of the London Underground. The Health and Safety Executive's investigation will initially look at whether the Heathrow failure was specific to the site and then consider whether there are any broader implications for this method of tunnelling. The Austrian method dispenses with a boring machine and uses an excavator to create a tunnel with the walls being temporarily reinforced with wire mesh and concrete. It is normally used to provide short-term support before construction of the final lining.</p>

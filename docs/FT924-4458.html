			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Observer: Campaign's end Des Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' former campaign director, is terrific at public relations, and Burson-Marsteller is the world's biggest PR firm. But becoming a full-time flack, albeit with a seat on the board, is hardly a noble cause. Wilson says that if he were just joining Burson to make serious money, he would have done so long ago. It is hard to believe that a man who has done everything from establishing Shelter to chairing Friends of the Earth and campaigning very successfully for lead-free petrol, has run out of campaign ideas. But he insists that he has, and would have stopped two years ago if Paddy Ashdown had not twisted his arm to take the unpaid job of running the Liberal Democrat election campaign. Wilson, 51, is said to have one of the biggest egos in the business, which is not always an asset in the PR game. Indeed, some Liberal Democrat MPs were livid that he crowded them out of the TV studios during the election. However, even his critics admit that he is good at setting strategy and his experience in mobilising grassroots opinion is second to none. And lest anybody accuse him of selling his birthright for a mess of pottage, Wilson's contract covers his concern that his contribution at Burson should be consistent with his 'post-campaigning activities and publicly-stated views'.</p>

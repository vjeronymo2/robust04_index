			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 31 March editorial: "The Meeting of Party </F> Cell Secretaries of the Entire Party Which Will Record a  Brilliant Chapter in the History of Our Party"]    [Text] The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire  party will be convened, beginning today, amid the great interest  and expectation of all the people. Our party cell secretaries  are our party's core elements who assume responsibility for the  basic infrastructural organizations of our party and primary  political functionaries who are directly organizing and leading  the party life of party members.    Today, the combat capability of our party cells has  increased; our party is demonstrating its dignity of being an  ever-victorious and invincible party; and the singlehearted  unity of the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses are  strengthening with each passing day. This is thanks to the  unheralded efforts of party cell secretaries.    Today, all party members and the working people throughout  the country sincerely rejoice over and extend warm  congratulations to the fact that party cell secretaries of all  various sectors--who have actively contributed to strengthening  and developing our party and to accelerating the revolution and  construction, cherishing infinite loyalty to the great leader  [widaehan yongdoja], by enhancing the function and role of party  cells--gather at one place to convene the historic meeting.    The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is  a meeting which is held for the first time in the history of our  party and is of great significance in strengthening and  developing our party into an ever-victorious and invincible  party and in consummating the socialist cause of chuche.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Party  cells occupy a very important position in strengthening and  developing the party and in vigorously advancing the revolution  and construction.    The meeting will become a signicant meeting which marks a  new  turn in constantly strengthening and developing our party into  an impregnable fortress and in enhancing by all means its combat  capability and leadership ability.    Party cells are the cornerstones holding up the party and  are  the lowest level of combat units implementing the party's line  and policy. A man becomes healthy only when the cells which  form his body are strong and healthy. Likewise, only when party  cells which form the party are sound and their function and role  are high can the party become strong. Strengthening party cells  becomes an important factor in strengthening the entire party.    Today, our party is taking pride in its existence as a party  of impregnable fortress, which is unprecedented in history. This  is because all party cells forming our party have been firmly  built and their combat capabilities are strong.    In the glorious history of our party there has been no  period  in the past in which party cells grew up and strengthened and  the party strengthened like today when the dear comrade leader's  great party building ideology and theory are being thoroughly  embodied.    Through the current meeting of party cell secretaries of the  entire party the wisdom of leadership of the dear comrade leader  who has always paid deep interest to enhancing party cells'  combat function and role will be vigorously demonstrated and, at  the same time, all party members and the working people will  more firmly cherish in their hearts the firm faith that as long  as the dear comrade leader is with them our party can take pride  in its dignity of being an ever-victorious party forever.    With the current meeting as an occasion the struggle to  enhance the function and role of party cells and the outstanding  successes and experiences attained in the work with the masses  of all strata will be generalized widely and the work to build  all party cells into cells of loyalty will be more vigorously  waged among party organizations at all levels. Thus, the current  meeting will make a great contribution to further strengthening  our party's might and to deepening all means the single-hearted  unity of our revolutionary ranks.    The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party  under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, is a  historical meeting which is greatly significant in its struggle  to resolutely advocate, adhere to, and complete, to the end,  socialism of our own style which has been elucidated and  obtained with blood.    Socialism of our own style, which our people chose  themselves  and built with their own strength by highly upholding the banner  of the great chuche idea, is the most superior socialism in this  world. As shown in countries where socialism was frustrated and  capitalism reinstated, there can only be bitter pains, twists,  and turns, and a wretched fate for the people who have lost  socialism.    The road to defending and elucidating socialism lies in  first, second, and third, strengthening the working-class  party--the general staff of the revolution--and endlessly  enhancing its leadership role. To achieve this, the party  cell--the primary-level infrastructural organizations--must be  strengthened. The party cell must be strong so that the party  can be strong, and the party must be powerful so that socialism  can vigorously advance in whatever hardships and without the  slightest wavering.    How to thoroughly embody all lines and policies of the party  to highly manifest the superiority and might of socialism and to  change them into a great reality, are largely dependent on the  role of the party cells who are the primary-level militant unit  in implementing the party's policy.    The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is  a meeting of faith and will that shows our party's firm  determination to strengthen the party and all the more enhance  the function and role of the party organizations to smash  [chitbusigo] all kinds of antisocial and antirepublic maneuvers  by the imperialists and reactionaries and complete socialism of  our own style to the end.    As long as the imperialists and reactionaries drive the  situation to a brink of war and viciously carry out the reckless  provocative maneuver opposing our republic, our party cell  secretaries will defend to the end, socialism of our own style  through the might of single-hearted unity firmly united around  the dear comrade leader. The voice of faith of our party cell  secretaries will resound vigorously throughout the meeting.    At the meeting, our party's firm determination and will  displayed on the road to advocate, adhere to, and elucidate  socialism without the slightest wavering and the magnificent  spiritual world of the members of the Workers' Party of Korea,  who are endlessly loyal to socialism, will be manifest itself  vigorously and the revolutionary struggle trait and way of life  will dominate the whole party and society all the more.    The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party  will become a meeting that has epoch-making significance in the  struggle to bring about a new upsurge in socialist construction  by thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic  strategy. The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire  party will enhance the role of the party organizations at all  levels and party cells to vigorously call forth all the party  members and workers in the struggle to implement the party's  revolutionary economic strategy.    Through this meeting, the political work and work with the  people will be carried out all the more vigorously at all  working places of socialist construction where our party cells,  party members, and workers are at work, and the justness and  vitality of our party's method in which it firmly gives priority  to ideology and revolution will manifest itself wholly.    Therefore, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  fortitude in all fields of socialist construction will manifest  itself further, and an infinite number of new miracles and feats  will be created.    The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party  will be brilliantly recorded in our party's history as a meeting  of loyalty and filial piety enabling the party members and  working people to become true loyalists and dutiful children, a  meeting of our party and people's belief and will to complete  socialist cause to the end with single-hearted might, and a  meeting of the grand march to effect a revolutionary upsurge in  socialist construction.    The meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party is  a proud meeting that could only be held in our country where the  historic cause of building an ever-victorious iron party  upholding the great leader [suryong] and the great leader  [yongdoja] has been most brilliantly achieved.    The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has led  the cause of the construction of our party straight to a single  road of victory during the long period from his early days of  revolution until today. During those days, he has consolidated  brilliant and immortal achievements of the century.    In our country, the historic cause of grounding the party's  historical root and founding the party was achieved by the great  leader, and the endlessly rich and lofty chuche lineage of our  party was also established by the great leader.    Our party, which was founded and fostered by the great  leader  Comrade Kim Il-song, has been able to more vigorously  demonstrate its dignity and might by upholding the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il at the fore.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader  [widaehan yongdoja] of the working class of our time for  achieving the cause of party construction. The dear comrade  leader plainly set forth unique party construction ideology and  theories for building an ever-victorious party and brilliantly  solved all theoretical and practical problems rising from  enhancing the function and role of the party cells.    Particularly, the dear comrade leader's immortal work "Let  Us  Strengthen the Party Cells" released on 10 May 1991 has great  historical significance. Valuable guidelines have been provided  for better fostering the party cells as a combat organization  endlessly loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] due to the  release of the immortal work, which is a synthesis of the  fundamental questions of bringing up the party members as  loyalists and dutiful children, organizing and giving guidance  concerning party life, carrying out work involving the masses  well, and of enhancing the role of the party cell secretaries.    The ideological theory explained in the work is acquiring  more vitality day after day due to its correctness and truth.  Without the tested leadership of the dear comrade leader, who  has always shown a great interest in strengthening and  developing the party cells, we cannot talk about our party being  strengthened and developed into a strong and mighty party  consisting of hundreds of thousands of cells with strong combat  capabilities, and we cannot imagine the party cell secretaries  being loved and respected by the people while excellently  fulfilling their roles as the core of our party.    That is why the participants of today's meeting of party  cell  secretaries of the entire party, and all the party members and  working people are paying their utmost honor to the dear comrade  leader, who has strengthened and developed our party as an  impregnable fortress, and are filled with firm resolution to  share, to the end, the party's destiny, in any storm.    Today, we are faced with the task of enhancing the party's  leading role, smashing [chitpusida] all kinds of antisocialist  maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries, and completing,  to the end, the chuche revolutionary cause in conformity with  the demand of the developing reality. To carry out the weighty  and honorable task, all cells that comprise our party should  excellently carry out their own functions and roles. "Let us  make all the party cells loyal cells." This is an important  slogan being put up by our party today, and this is the core  task to be advocated by party organizations of various levels.    On the occasion of the meeting of party cell secretaries  of the entire party, the party organizations at each level must  effect a new upsurge in the struggle of implementing the party's  such slogan. Today, our party members' sense of loyalty and  dutifulness to the party and the leader [suryong] are very high.    All party members are living and working in a revolutionary  manner by cherishing a firm determination that they want to  become rifles and bombs in the course of resolutely safeguarding  the leader [yongdoja] of the revolution and are overflowing with  conviction of going through fire and water for a struggle to  implement the party's policy.    The party cells must glorify every moment of their lives  with  loyalty by cherishing in their hearts a high sense of dignity  and pride that they are always the party members of the glorious  WPK led by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. They must  properly lead the party members to fully play a role, as the  vanguard fighters, in the revolution and construction.    The might of our party and socialism of our own style is the  might of the single-hearted unity of the leader [suryong], the  party, and the masses and, with this, we should vigorously carry  out our revolution. This is an important purpose of this  meeting.    On the occasion of the meeting, the party organizations at  each level must actively carry out the work of an ideology and  indoctrination among the party members and working people and  lead them to fight on for the leader [yongdoja] at the risk of  their lives by having a firm position and viewpoint that their  boundless happiness, future, and socialist fatherland exist  because there is always the dear comrade leader.    Along with this, all sectors and units must always firmly  continue on the alert in conformity with the demands of the  present situation. Also, they must lead all party members and  working people to live and work with an invincible faith and  revolutionary obligation, just like the anti-Japanese  revolutionary fighters who resolutely safeguarded the respected  and beloved comrade commander and the heroic combatants who  protected the hill of the fatherland at the risk of their lives  by keeping their pledge of loyalty made to the great leader  [suryong] at the general meeting of party cell during the harsh  Fatherland Liberation War.    A long time has passed since the first party organization  was  formed in period of the dawning of the Korean revolution.  During this period, our party cell has been developed and  strengthened more strongly.    Our party is great and our revolution's final victory is  certain because it has the vigorous party cells, which have a  combatant capacity that cannot be found in any places, in either  its loyalty to the leader [yongdoja] or its function or role.    All of us must hasten the independent reunification of the  fatherland and the complete victory of socialism by continuously  making an innovation and by moving forward, thus cherishing deep  in their hearts the great dignity and pride of embarking upon  the road of the party's guidance--invincible and  ever-victorious--under the leadership of the great leader  [yongdoja].</p>

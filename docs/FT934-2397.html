			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Calderburn paying up to Pounds 10m for specialist supplier Calderburn, the office furniture group, has paid an initial Pounds 6.25m for SBFI, a specialist supplier of dealing desks to financial institutions. Initial consideration comprises a mixture of new shares, cash and loan notes. In addition, deferred consideration of up to Pounds 4.5m is linked to profit targets. In the three years ended March 31 turnover of SBFI had risen from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 14.6m and pre-tax profits from Pounds 143,000 to Pounds 1.21m. Calderburn directors believed that the acquisition would significantly improve the group's growth prospects and enhance earnings per share. They anticipated that group pre-tax profits for 1993 would be in the order of Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.83m) after charging non-recurring costs of about Pounds 400,000. It was their intention to recommend a maintained total dividend of 7.7p via the payment of a 4.9p final. SBFI's markets take in the UK, Europe and east Asia. Shareholders' approval will be sought for the acquisition at an extraordinary meeting convened for December 29.</p>

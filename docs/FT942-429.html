			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television Today we are promised a unique insight into the lives of two men. The more tempting is BBC2's programme about artist KB Kitaj whose largest exhibition opened this month at the Tate. He has never before agreed to be filmed, so Kitaj - In The Picture is unusual (11.15). Programmes about the other man, Prince Charles, are not unusual. The idea that his difficulty is merely one of 'image', that all he needs is a more efficient PR effort to match his wife's, a second generation Dimbleby to act as 'gold microphone in waiting' (Malcolm Muggeridge's memorable phrase for Richard Dimbleby) and that all will then be well, is surely wrong. On the contrary, it is less publicity that will preserve the mystery and magic of monarchy. In today's 2 1/2 -hour promo for the Windsors plc on ITV, Charles: The Private Man, The Public Role (8.00), the prince might have avoided this being seen as yet another 'charm offensive' had he had the courage to come clean about his relationships with Diana Spencer and Camilla Parker Bowles. But industry talk suggests that, although raised, the issue is fudged.</p>

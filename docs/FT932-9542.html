			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / ICI prices Zeneca rights issue at 600p IMPERIAL Chemical Industries yesterday set the terms of its demerger and fund raising, pricing the rights issue for its Zeneca bioscience offshoot at 600p. The price was at the top end of expectations, but the issue was cut from the expected 1-for-3 basis to a 5-for-16 offer, involving the issue of about 225m new shares, raising Pounds 1.3bn. This brought some relief to the shares, with existing ICI shares rising 22p to 1285p yesterday. Documents relating to the rights and listing of the demerged shares showed the chief executives of the two new companies are to receive pay rises. Mr Ronnie Hampel, who is adding deputy chairman to his title of chief executive officer at new-ICI, will be paid Pounds 425,000, up from Pounds 340,840. Mr David Barnes of Zeneca will get Pounds 325,000, up from Pounds 285,000, and from a previous Pounds 257,340 before a pay rise he received in January when the demerger took effect operationally. Each will have a three-year contract. Mr Hampel's retirement date was set for September 30, 1995, and he will get a bonus of between 50 and 100 per cent of his final-year salary when he goes. Brokers said the issue was tightly priced. One said institutional investors ranged from 'distinctly unimpressed to downright anti' Zeneca shares. However, shareholders recorded general satisfaction with the Zeneca deal, noting that the underwriters had to achieve a pricing at a time of turmoil in the US pharmaceuticals market. Institutions said that the underwriters had apparently been able to place the entire sub-underwriting. Last week, institutions who gave firm commitments to underwrite their allocation at roughly Pounds 6 per share were promised additional allocations. As a result, institutions which only last night decided they liked the terms found themselves unable to increase their allocation. 'We would have taken more. It's money for nothing,' said one shareholder with a 1 per cent stake in ICI. At the rights price, the Zeneca shares yield 5.7 per cent on the forecast dividend of 27.5p for the year. The p/e is 13.3 historic on pro-forma earnings per share of 45p. 'The pricing was sensible,' said one shareholder, noting that at 600p the prospective p/e will be roughly 12. This compares with multiples of 14 and 15 for other pharmaceutical stocks. On the grey-market, which opened trading in the new-ICI, Zeneca ex-rights and Zeneca nil-paid shares yesterday afternoon, investors switched from Zeneca to new-ICI. Zeneca ex-rights fell from a first price of 682p to 664p, little more than a 10 per cent premium to the rights price, where they yield 5.2 per cent. That compares, institutions said, with a yield for Glaxo of 3.5 per cent or Wellcome of 2.5 per cent. The nil paid fell from 86p to 66p. New-ICI shares rose from 569p to 609p. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A coal miners' wildcat strike in Virginia and West Virginia escalated, with  roving pickets expanding their walkout to a northern West Virginia coal field,  Island Creek Coal Co. officials said. The company's southern West Virginia  mines, employing about 190, have been shut down since Monday as striking  workers ignored a federal judge's back-to-work order. The walkout spread to  other Island Creek mines employing 875 people. At least 10,000 miners are  estimated to be idled by the strike. The walkout began as a show of solidarity  with 1,600 United Mine Workers members in West Virginia and Virginia on strike  since April against the Pittston Coal Group.  </P></p>

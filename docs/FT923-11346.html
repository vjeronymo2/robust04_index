			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Dream ticket to ride: Richard Tomkins on a train journey into the future East Grinstead. The year: 2002. Greg Appleby sets out one morning from his home in the West Sussex commuter belt for a business meeting in Edinburgh. Arriving at East Grinstead station, he drives his electrically powered Rover into the multi-storey car park, takes the keys to the Star Wash kiosk, and leaves instructions for the car to be valeted. As the moving walkway transfers him from the car park to the station concourse, Greg recalls how, just 10 years ago, the station was a grim and unappealing place. A dreary pre-fab, it boasted nothing but a ticket office, a news stand, a men's and women's lavatory, and five doors on the platform marked 'PRIVATE'. Rail privatisation changed all that. A few years ago a local property developer bought the station, built a concourse above track level and created something akin to a mini-airport terminal. These days, the station hums with activity. A 7-Eleven convenience store sells sandwiches to passengers on their way to work and ready-to-cook meals to those on their way home. People take their clothes to the dry cleaner, swap films at the video library, leave their shoe repairs at the heel bar and pick up their holiday snaps from the photo-processor. The Brasserie de la Gare, meanwhile, has established itself as one of the better eateries in East Grinstead, and Greg has skipped breakfast at home in favour of coffee and croissants at a table on the air-conditioned concourse. Three minutes before his train is due to leave, Greg settles his bill and walks past the ticket desks to the departure gates. One leads to the steam-operated Bluebell Railway, which two years earlier extended its tracks to East Grinstead and now runs diesel trains into West Sussex during peak hours. The other leads to the platforms operated by SeaConRail, a subsidiary of Mr James Sherwood's Sea Containers shipping group, which holds the franchise for the main-line commuter services into central London. Greg, a regular customer at East Grinstead, shows his season ticket to the smartly dressed attendant at SeaConRail's departure gate. 'Everything running smoothly?' he asks as she swipes it through the validating machine. The platform door swishes open. 'Have we ever let you down, Mr Appleby?' she replies with a smile as he steps on to the waiting train. The peak-hour service into London is heavily used, but not uncomfortably so. British Rail's decrepit slam-door trains have been replaced with spacious SeaConRail double-deckers, guaranteeing everyone a comfortable seat. There are announcements about the journey's progress from the train captain, telephones and drinks vending machines at the end of each carriage, and complimentary copies of the Financial Times for all who want them. On the other hand, fares are 60 per cent higher in real terms than they were under British Rail. But because the Treasury is no longer required to subsidise the service, it allows commuters to claim the cost of their season tickets against tax: and passenger numbers have soared as a result of the increased frequency, reliability and comfort that privatisation has brought. Change is less evident at the London end. Most of the London terminals are listed buildings and the private sector has been chary about the prospects of doing much with them. But one difference is that they now provide a choice of train operators. At King's Cross, two companies run to Edinburgh: Stagecoach, with its frequent, no-frills economy trains, and Virgin, which offers a less-frequent but more comfortable, airline-style service. In fact Greg has made his choice already: he booked his seat on the Virgin Flyer by telephone from the SeaConRail train. He walks over to the Virgin check-in, picks up his ticket, and takes a complimentary coffee in the departure lounge while waiting for boarding to begin. Once on the train, Greg remarks on the changes privatisation has wrought. Even economy-class seats on the Virgin train have seat-back video with six channels to choose from. Meals, included in the ticket price, are served at seat by friendly cabin crew. Some carriages have been set aside for families, complete with play areas and baby-changing facilities; others have conference areas and meeting rooms for business people, complete with telephones, fax machines and computer terminals. Greg watches a business programme on the video, then switches channels for the news. After a pleasant lunch served with a glass of red wine, he finds himself gazing out of the window at the passing countryside, and falls into a slumber. Suddenly, he is awakened by a jolt. The train has come to an abrupt halt somewhere in northern England. The public address system is buzzing and crackling, but no meaningful sound is coming out of it. Greg is about to reach for the hostess call button when he realises it has disappeared - along with the friendly cabin crew, the airline-style seat, the six-channel video, the remains of his lunch . . . With a groan, he realises that it has all been a dream. Yes, it is 2002; yes, he is on his way to Edinburgh; but no, he is not on the Virgin Flyer. He is stuck on an ageing British Rail InterCity train in the wilds of Northumberland, there is no explanation for the breakdown, and the buffet car has just sold the last bacon and tomato roll. As he and his fellow passengers await a rescue, Greg has plenty of time to reflect on the realities of privatisation. Virgin, he recalls, did start up a pilot passenger train service in 1993, closely followed by Stagecoach; but they only lasted a few months. British Rail's track charges were too high to allow them to make any money. Besides, the private sector trains were constantly getting stuck behind British Rail's, so they gained nothing in speed or reliability. As for SeaConRail, its ambitions to become a franchisee foundered on the Treasury's refusal to make commuter fares allowable against tax. And would-be railway station operators soon realised that stations would never be as profitable as airports, where most passengers are ABC1s with an hour or more to kill while they wait for their planes. Ah well, at least the Bluebell Railway reached East Grinstead. But elsewhere, it is still the same old British Rail running the same old - very old - trains. Greg looks at his watch, stares gloomily out of the window, and groans again. His business meeting has already ended. It is going to be a long journey home.</p>

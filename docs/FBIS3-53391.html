			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH and AL-JUMHURIYAH in  Arabic in their 8 January issues carry articles calling for  resuming transmission of the Voice of Youth Radio and Youth  Television, reportedly owned by Saddam Husayn's son, 'Udayy.    Baghdad AL-THAWRAH, on page 8, carries a 250-word unsigned  article headlined "In Light of the Discontinuation of the Youth  Radio and Television; the Need To Resume Transmission"  emphasizing "that the Youth Television Channel and the Voice of  Youth Radio have been well received by the various sectors of  the people in view of their effective and developed performance  and their serious presentation."    The paper adds: "For these reasons, we believe it is  necessary to review the question of the discontinuation of the  Voice of Youth Radio and the Youth Television because this  discontinuation is an irreplaceable loss under these  circumstances where our militant country experiences the most  ferocious conspiracies in which the enemy forces use all means,  including war propaganda, which we must face with new methods."  The article further says: "We hope that these two stations will  resume transmission so that they may perform the role required  of them."    Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH, also on page 8, carries a 300-word  article by Ahmad Hatif on the same topic. The article says  "Suddenly, the Youth Radio and Television transmitters stopped  working, and thousands of the fans of this youthful voice waited  for a clear reply to a difficult question, and we received many  phone calls asking about the secret and seeking a reply that we  do not have about the interruption of a long-awaited dream."  The article goes on to say "We believe that in the interest of  Iraqi media, the media of the Mother of Battles, this honest  voice should resume transmission as soon as possible. If some  say that technical and operational mistakes accompanied this  mistake, this does not mean that this experiment should be  ignored. Mistakes should be corrected, initiatives encouragerd,  new plans should be formulated, and life reinfused in this  unique experiment."    Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network in Arabic at 1514 GMT  on 10 January carried an announcement filed as referent item  that: "The youth radio and television have resumed their  transmission as of 1800 [1500 GMT] this evening." The radio  does not give any reason for the interruption.</p>

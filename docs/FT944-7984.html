			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Saudi bank set to agree Dollars 245m BCCI payment: Charges to be dropped in return for settlement Liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are on the verge of agreeing an out-of-court settlement of more than Dollars 245m (Pounds 149m) from Saudi Arabia's largest commercial bank. National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, former chief operating officer, are to pay the cash and waive their own claims of Dollars 600m against the bank. In exchange, the liquidators will drop all further charges against them, according to sources close to the negotiations. The deal would end one of the most significant outstanding pieces of litigation in the BCCI saga. The bank was closed in July 1991 by global banking regulators following revelations of widespread fraud. The settlement follows the launch of five civil actions by the liquidators of BCCI at the accountancy firm Touche Ross against Sheikh Khalid and NCB in five countries. These sought damages in excess of Dollars 30bn. There would be no admission of responsibility with regard to the allegations made in the actions, which claim Sheikh Khalid made false statements about loans from BCCI. The actions further allege that he conspired to conceal the sale of shares in BCCI and elsewhere. It is understood the deal has been discussed by BCCI's creditors' committee, which is supervising the liquidation. The money could be released in the new year. It requires approval from the courts monitoring the liquidation, and signatures from NCB and the liquidators. Late last year, Sheikh Khalid and NCB made a settlement with the US authorities to pay Dollars 225m in exchange for the dropping of criminal charges brought against them in New York. As part of the latest agreement, Dollars 180m of the earlier US payment will be released to the liquidators for distribution to creditors. Sheikh Khalid will provide additional cash of Dollars 245m and is expected to waive claims for Dollars 330m in capital notes - a type of loan convertible to shares - and about Dollars 270m in deposits he was owed by BCCI at the time of its closure. Sheikh Khalid took a stake in BCCI in 1986 on behalf of NCB, but withdrew the following year. He resigned from BCCI's board in 1989, and later from NCB. The new settlement will leave outstanding three principal legal actions by the liquidators: against the Bank of England and the Luxembourg Monetary Institute, the banking regulator, for failures in regulation duties towards BCCI, and against accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney for failures as auditors to BCCI. Court approval is expected shortly for a Dollars 1.8bn payment from Abu Dhabi to the liquidators. They say creditors will receive a final dividend of 30p-40p for every pound lost.</p>

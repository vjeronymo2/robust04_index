Cheng An-kuo, the MAC's director of Hong Kong and Macao  affairs, made the comment at a hearing sponsored by Legislator  Parris Chang in the Legislative Yuan on the future course of the  government's Hong Kong and Macao policy in view of recent  developments there.    Chang, a scholar-turned-politican, invited government  officials and academics to give their views during the hearing.    Cheng, elaborating on the just-announced draft of the  statute  governing relations with Hong Kong and Macao, said that Taiwan  will still consider the colonies as "special areas" rather than  as Mainland Chinese territory after the colonies revert to  Mainland Chinese rule, and will not consider links with them to  constitute "direct" links with Mainland China.    He noted that all Taiwan Government offices in Hong Kong and  Macao would continue to operate on a civilian basis after the  handover, and said that the Taiwan-Hong Kong and Taiwan-Macao  relationships would continue much the same way as before. He  added that the rights of Taiwan residents living in the colonies  would be fully protected.    On whether Beijing would try to seize Taiwan Government  property in Hong Kong and Macao after 1997 and 1999, Cheng said  that he could not rule out that possibility, and said that  Taiwan has asked for legal help to safeguard against such an  exigency.</p>

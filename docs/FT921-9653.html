			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Budapest flotation for Samsung Hungarian unit SAMSUNG Electronics Hungary, a subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate, has announced plans for a share flotation on Budapest's fledgling stock exchange. Realisation of the scheme would make Samsung's the first foreign start-up venture to tap the Hungarian share market for funds. The issue will almost double the Samsung share capital, diluting the South Korean parent company's 100 per cent shareholding without depriving it of majority control. The pricing and timing of the offering are still to be decided in the light of 1991 earnings results expected next month. Samsung Electronics Hungary, which makes televisions and distributes electronic office equipment in Hungary, is turning to the stock market to finance further expansion in the wake of 1991 turnover growth of 40 per cent to Ft2.5bn (Dollars 32.5m). Analysts said Samsung's move pointed a way out of the dilemma faced by many western firms based in Hungary and earning local currency. They face exorbitant local bank interest rates and exchange rate risks if they borrow in hard currency. Samsung's resort to the Budapest capital market follows that of the Hungarian subsidiary of MacDonald's, the US fast food chain, which last October issued Ft400m in bonds with a four year gratuity.</p>

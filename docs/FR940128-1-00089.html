			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2) FDA also specifically requests comments on the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of cases of illness included in the baseline estimate (33,035)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may be due to factors outside the processors' control, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as those due to recreational harvests (that are not eventually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sent to processors), those due to restaurants and supermarkets,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and those due to consumer mishandling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) As mentioned above, FDA has also estimated potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits associated with increased seafood consumption. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits will only be realized if the price increase resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from this rule does not offset the effect of increased demand for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood which will result from reduced consumer anxiety. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests specific comment on the likelihood that seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption will be increased as a result of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) FDA has identified but not quantified benefits to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood exporters as well as reduced public anxiety associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the safety of seafood. FDA requests comments on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits (including how to quantify them) as well as other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential benefits such as how HACCP will help firms gain better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control over their operations, better sanitation and greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiencies such as reduced product waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> E. Tribal Governments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA is aware that some tribal governments are involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processing of seafood for interstate commerce. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects that the proposed regulations will apply to them in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases. Executive Order 12875 of October 26, 1993, requires,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among other things, consultation with tribal governments before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the formal promulgation of regulations containing unfunded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal mandates. While FDA does not believe that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations would impose an unfunded Federal mandate, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishes to foster consultation on matters that might significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect tribal communities. Consequently, FDA specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on the economic effect of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations on tribal governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> F. Availability of PRIA/RFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA acknowledges considerable uncertainty in both cost and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit estimates of the proposed regulations and requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on all aspects of the PRIA and the RFA. The full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PRIA/RIA is available at the Dockets Management Branch (address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> XI. Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The agency has carefully considered the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action will not have a significant impact on the human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> XII. Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interested persons may, on or before April 28, 1994, submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Friday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> XIII. References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The following references have been placed on display in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dockets Management Branch (address above) and may be seen by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Friday. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

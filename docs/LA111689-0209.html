			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> HARVEY A DRIVING FORCE OF THE WATER POLO TEAM  </P> <P> Five years ago, Julian Harvey jumped into the Laguna Hills High School pool  every afternoon for water polo practice, only to watch his team slowly sink  into the deep end of lost causes.  </P> <P> At the time, Laguna Hills was not a water polo power. Unlike some schools, the  team did not benefit from feeder programs or booster clubs, and it didn't get  much support from the student body. This, and the team's generally apathetic  nature, frustrated Harvey to no end.  </P> <P> "We had a very bad program, a very weak program," Harvey said. "The exposure  wasn't there and neither was the motivation. I'd watch the other teams play,  get excited. We were, well . . . low key."  </P> <P> Now Harvey is one of the top players for UC Irvine, a perennial power and  currently the nation's second-ranked team.  </P> <P> The Anteaters (23-6 overall, 7-2 in the Big West Conference) will travel to  Indianapolis next week for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. water polo  championships Nov. 24-26. Irvine, which has competed in 17 of the previous 20  NCAA championship tournaments, has finished in the top five 15 times and won  the title in 1970 and 1982.  </P> <P> Harvey, a fifth-year senior and a member of the U.S. national team, is UCI's  second-leading scorer with 71 goals; senior Tom Warde leads with 91. Harvey and  Warde share the "hole man" position, similar to the center in basketball.  </P> <P> Warde, who has been friends with Harvey since the two were 9-year-old junior  lifeguards at Huntington Beach, said: "In high school, Julian was the whole  team. Now that he's with a winning program, he's able to get fired up. He's  came a long way, but he's always been a good player."  </P> <P> Good enough to be invited, as a high school senior, to a youth development camp  sponsored by United States Water Polo, the national governing body. It was at  the camp that Harvey learned what winning water polo was all about.  </P> <P> "The quality of the players was better, the caliber was way up there," Harvey  said. "Everything was more intense."  </P> <P> When Harvey brought back what he had learned, namely the camp's conditioning  drills, to his high school team, few were interested. "My coach thought I was  out in left field and (the players) wanted to go play their video games or  something," he said.  </P> <P> Tustin Coach Boyd Philpot, a former All-American at UC Irvine, was one of the  camp's directors. He said Harvey stood out immediately.  </P> <P> "Since his team didn't make the playoffs, no one knew about him except people  in his league," Philpot said. "But when he came down here, I called (Irvine  Coach Ted) Newland. I said this kid is strong, talented and motivated . . . a  diamond in the rough."  </P> <P> A year later, Harvey, who had originally planned to attend Saddleback College,  ended up at Irvine. "When I first heard about Irvine I said, 'Irvine? What's  Irvine?' " he said. Harvey learned soon enough.  </P> <P> Coach Newland runs one of the nation's toughest water polo programs. Try 1,200  sit-ups every morning, five days a week.  </P> <P> "It was definitely culture shock when I got there," Harvey said. "You never get  used to waking up at 5:30."  </P> <P> But Harvey excelled, becoming the team's only freshman to play in 1985. At the  NCAA championships that year, Harvey gained valuable experience, playing nearly  an entire game when one of the team's upperclassmen fouled out.  </P> <P> Although Harvey said the transition from high school to college play was a  shock, Newland disagreed.  </P> <P> "I think, to me, he always wanted to be good, and so consequently, I think he  knew what it would take," Newland said. "He's always been an intense player,  he's a very intense person. It's what he wanted. He was looking for that."  </P> <P> Harvey agreed.  </P> <P> "In high school, there wasn't a lot of drive," Harvey said. "But I'm definitely  driven to win the NCAAs. That's something we (seniors) have never done. To win  it would be everything."  </P> <P> And this time, Harvey has 11 teammates that share his desire.  </P> <P> The Irvine women's cross-country team travels to Annapolis, Md., for Monday's  NCAA championships with the highest hopes in the team's history.  </P> <P> Though the Anteaters' national ranking dropped from seventh to 12th after  finishing second to Washington in the NCAA Region 8 meet at Fresno last  Saturday, Coach Vince O'Boyle says the Anteaters are capable of placing much  higher. Irvine has competed in the national championships twice, with its best  finish -- eighth -- coming in 1987.  </P> <P> "Getting to nationals has been a common goal for us all year," O'Boyle said.  "That dream is now becoming reality. My dream is that this team can place in  the top six or top five."  </P> <P> Junior Buffy Rabbitt led Irvine in the regional meet by winning the individual  title, becoming the first Irvine woman to do so. Rabbitt, who as a freshman  became Irvine's first female cross-country All-American in 1987, was about  three strides behind the leader, USC's Amy Goodwin, with 300 yards to go.  </P> <P> That's when O'Boyle said the right thing to Rabbitt. "I said, 'Buf! Make two  quick strides and catch her!' " O'Boyle said. Rabbitt did, and passed Goodwin.  </P> <P> Said Rabbitt: "I thought, 'Well, I'm right here, I might as well try.' When  Vince told me to go, I tried to kick for dear life. . . . I was very  surprised."  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> The women's volleyball team, which plays host to Fresno State Saturday in its  final Big West match this season, is led by senior Ali Wood with 455 kills.  Irvine is 17-13 overall and 5-11 in the Big West, but Coach Mike Puritz said he  hopes the NCAA selection committee will consider his team for a playoff bid. .  . . Former Anteater tennis standout Mike Briggs recently returned from a month  of competition in Hawaii, where he played four tournaments on Oahu, Maui and  Kona. In the past week, he won the Masters Week tournament and earned 17 points  in the Assn. of Tennis Professionals' ratings. According to his pro coach, Dave  Heffern, Briggs -- who leaves for a tournament in San Paulo, Brazil, on Dec. 4  -- will probably move up from 460 to 350 in the world rankings. . . .  Basketball Coach Bill Mulligan on the good and bad state of Anteater hoops:  "We're encouraged. We see a lot of positive things. I'm trying not to dwell on  the negatives." And: "We've spent four weeks practicing, but we still have guys  who don't know what we're doing."  </P></p>

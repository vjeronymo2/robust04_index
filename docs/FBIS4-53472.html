			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Recent U.S. trade policies  are based on the free trade principle, Japan's Economic Planning  Agency [EPA] said in a report Thursday, softening its earlier  assessment that the policies are protectionist.    In the report, the EPA said the recent trade policies, which  provide for ample funds for research and development in the  high-tech area, are effective in giving a competitive edge to  U.S. industries and in boosting the economy.    It is necessary for world trade partners, however, to  establish international rules on government subsidies for  high-tech projects in order to head off "subsidy competition,"  the agency said.    The EPA acknowledged that the U.S. trade policies are  generally based on free trade principles and promoting market  opening by its world trade partners.    But U.S. antidumping legislation is protectionist and blocks  the rational pricing of goods by foreign companies that mass  produce their goods and sell in bulk, the EPA said.    The U.S. antidumping policy should be discussed at the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), it added.    The EPA report was compiled by private-sector experts and  academics on trade.</p>

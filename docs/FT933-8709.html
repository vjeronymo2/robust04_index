			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / French consumer prices rise in June French consumer prices increased slightly in July, rising 0.1-0.2 per cent above the level in June, according to figures published yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office, writes John Ridding. The figures, which give an annual rate of inflation of 2.1-2.2 per cent, were welcomed by the Economics Ministry, which said they confirmed the 'strong state of French competitiveness'. A spokesman for the ministry said they would support the French franc in the medium term. Economists in Paris said that the figures were at the lower end of forecasts and that the rise reflected the impact of indirect taxes and a relatively strong rise in the cost of services. Petrol taxes were increased at the beginning of July, although the full effect of the price increase is not expected to be felt until August or September. Prices for services increased by an average of 0.4 per cent, partly reflecting higher costs in hotels and restaurants resulting from higher taxes on alcohol. The low rate of inflation is also a result of the depressed state of consumer demand in the recession-hit economy. Separate statistics published yesterday by Insee confirmed the difficulties facing the economy. According to a survey by the statistics institute, French industrialists said they expected economic activity to stabilise in the second half of the year but saw no signs of recovery before the end of 1993.</p>

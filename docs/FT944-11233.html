			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (7): Earning an accolade - Manufacturing company profile, Shanghai Fenghwa Ball Pen Company In China - notes Cai Ruixing, chairman of the Shanghai Fenghwa Ball Pen Company - the ownership of ball-point pens averages only 0.5 per person. In the US the figure is nine. If Chinese consumption were to reach US levels, more than 10bn additional pens would be sold. Against this, Fenghwa expects to make a mere 155m ball-point pens in 1994, writes Martin Wolf. As is often the case in China, the numbers are stupefying. But they are not implausible, since pens are a relatively cheap luxury item. The potential for growth must greatly exceed what Fenghwa has achieved since its founding in 1948, even though it already supplies 46 per cent of the domestic market for ball-point pens. As China's economy becomes more open, the company's growth will also depend on its international competitiveness. But Fenghwa does not have that much reason to worry. It already exports about a quarter of its output and derives 20 per cent of revenue from its sales to markets in eastern Europe, the middle east, the US, Latin America, South Africa and elsewhere in south-east Asia, including Japan. Furthermore, the retail price of one of its medium-quality ball-point pens is only some Yn4.5 (Dollars 0.55). What has made such success possible is, argues Mr Cai, the programme of management reform, investment, innovation, quality improvement and attention to markets undertaken since 1991, when he took over his present job. As important, Fenghwa's output lies squarely within the confines of China's comparative advantage. The manufacture of ball-point pens, propelling pencils, fountain pens and crayons demands precision and attention to quality. But the processes are labour-intensive and not that technically sophisticated. As a medium-sized company, employing 1,600 people and enjoying a strong domestic reputation, Fenghwa ought to thrive in China's new economic environment. So how has the company gone about becoming more competitive? Mr Cai points, first, to the transformation of management, noting the company's success in passing ISO 9001 (an internationally recognised standard of quality management) last year. An important aspect has been reform of employment practices. The enterprise remains responsible for providing housing, pensions and other benefits, as is normal in China. But the workers are now employed on contracts of up to five years. In compensation, they are paid relatively well by Chinese standards, the average annual wage now being Yn11,300, a rise of 140 per cent since 1992. Second, Mr Cai stresses Fenghwa's investments, including its purchase of advanced foreign machinery and its move in 1992 to a new plant in a development zone across the river from old Shanghai - 'ever since then,' he notes, 'we have enjoyed a fundamental transformation.' Finally, he notes the company's close attention to market developments and quality. One aspect is product innovation, with 50 per cent of the 180 models developed in the past three years. Another is the company's recent assumption from the state of all responsibility for marketing - both at home and abroad. Central to the strategy was the transformation of Fenghwa from a traditional state-owned enterprise into a share-holding company. In September 1992, the company was listed on the Shanghai stock exchange and issued 56m shares. Altogether the company has raised more than Yn120m in this way. This sum helped finance its investments, although the company also relied on bank loans and re-invested profits. Now there are 84m shares outstanding, 60 per cent of which are owned by the state, 25 per cent by other enterprises and the balance by individuals. The shares have at least been a reasonably good investment. Initially listed at Yn5.5 per share, their price peaked at Yn16 and was still - said the chairman, consulting one of Shanghai's ubiquitous bleepers - Yn9.2 on October 11, 1994. Where does Fenghwa go now? Its chairman has bold plans to turn it into a group. There will, he hopes, be three or four joint ventures with reputable foreign manufacturers. There are also plans for two office developments, one on the site of an old workshop in central Shanghai. But its staple businesses will not be forgotten. Fenghwa has been called a 'dragon head' plant in the production of ball-point pens. It expects to earn that accolade.</p>

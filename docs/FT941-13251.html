			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hakuhodo ends 34-year venture with US agency Hakuhodo, Japan's second largest advertising agency, yesterday dissolved a 34-year-old Tokyo-based joint venture with McCann-Erickson of the US. The Japanese group said the joint venture, the country's ninth biggest agency, had started to compete with its parent. The company has handed over its 49 per cent stake in the venture to McCann-Erickson. It said the subsidiary had originally done business with overseas groups wanting to advertise in Japan. But increasingly, the venture had taken on Japanese clients. The former subsidiary, called McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo, would have to change its name by March. Japan's advertising industry has been hit by the worst recession since the second world war. Mr Paul Smith, analyst at James Capel Pacific in Tokyo, estimates that billings were down between 5 and 6 per cent last year in all areas except spot television slots. 'There are slim pickings out there and the recession may have exacerbated structural and cultural problems,' said Mr Smith.</p>

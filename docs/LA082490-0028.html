			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW UNIVERSITY WINS ENDOWMENTS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: $250,000 CHAIRS IN COMMUNICATIONS AND EARTH SCIENCE/GEOLOGY ARE  DONATED TO CAL STATE SAN MARCOS BY TWO AREA BUSINESSMEN.  </P> <P> Before opening its doors to students, Cal State San Marcos has received two  endowed chairs from local businessmen who donated $250,000 each, university  officials announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The donations will provide a faculty position in communications and another in  earth science/geology, university officials said.  </P> <P> The endowed chairs provide money for research and partial salary to help  attract top professors. The two endowed chairs are impressive considering the  infancy of the university and that the 19 other Cal State campuses have a  combined total of 16 endowed chairs. The endowments bring to $750,000 the  donations the university has received from private individuals and  corporations.  </P> <P> "It is honestly a tribute to the public support that the people in the area  feel for the university," said university president Bill Stacy.  </P> <P> The university had not intended to hire a geology or communications professor  until the 1992 school year, but that is likely to change because of the  donations, Stacy said.  </P> <P> Allan O. Kelly, a resident of Carlsbad and self-educated geologist, endowed a  chair to continue research into his theories of the earth's geological  transformation.  </P> <P> Bill Daniels, chairman of Denver-based Daniels &amp; Associates and founder of  Prime Ticket Network, a regional cable television sports network, donated the  money toward a communications professorship.  </P> <P> "He is making a statement that he is happy to support education," said Phil  Urbina, a spokesman for the 70-year-old cable television pioneer.  </P> <P> Urbina said philanthropy is not new to Daniels, who donated $10 million to the  University of Denver last year to integrate ethics courses into its business  program.  </P> <P> Kelly, a lay geologist, has theories on how the Earth has developed and would  like to see research into those theories, said K.C. Cordes, a spokesman for  Kelly.  </P> <P> "He wants somebody to carry on investigating and attempting to prove his  theories in a scientific manner," Cordes said.  </P> <P> Kelly has written two books on the "impact theory," a hypothesis that many  Earth formations resulted from the impact of large space bodies, such as  asteroids, hitting the Earth.  </P> <P> "He's had a terrible time getting acceptance within the geological field,  partly because he's not from a geological background, and partly because people  are so set in their ways," Cordes said.  </P> <P> Kelly will also donate his collection of geological writings and artifacts to  the university.  </P> <P> A search for professors to fill the two posts will begin this year, and  university officials hope to have people in place for the 1991-92 school year.  There are no geologists or communications professors on staff at Cal State San  Marcos.  </P></p>

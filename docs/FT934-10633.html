			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Alcazar to choose US partner MERGER negotiations between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), and Austrian Airlines are expected to enter a decisive stage this weekend. Although no deadline has been set, the four carriers are hoping to resolve the last significant issue threatening their four airline co-operation project called Alcazar. This involves the choice of a US airline partner for the Alcazar group. Mr Otto Loepfe, Swissair's chief executive, yesterday said a breakthrough could be achieved during talks in Stockholm this week. However, Mr Jan Carlzon, the former SAS president who stepped down last month to devote all his efforts to the Alcazar project, also warned yesterday he would leave SAS if the co-operation talks were to fail, in remarks clearly designed to accelerate negotiations. Mr Carlzon said the choice of a US airline partner was 'the only real large question that can still endanger Alcazar'. The problem has been made more difficult because three of the European carriers have links with US airlines: KLM with Northwest Airlines, Swissair with Delta Air Lines, and SAS with Continental Airlines. But sources close to the negotiations said yesterday it would be 'tragic' if the US airline issue were to lead to a collapse of the proposed partnership to form a fourth airline force in Europe designed to compete against the big European carriers including British Airways, Lufthansa of Germany and Air France. They emphasised that the four European airlines already agreed on several difficult issues including the valuation of assets, headquarter location for the new company, and joint management structure. Co-operation is understood to account for most of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) benefits, with the US partner playing a minor role. World stock markets, Page 39</p>

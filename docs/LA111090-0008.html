He was 92.  </P> <P> Born Dec. 4, 1897, in Santa Barbara, Carty moved to Ventura County in 1909.  </P> <P> He was a resident of Oxnard.  </P> <P> Carty held more than a dozen offices, said his daughter, Patricia Loucks of  Camarillo. He was mayor of Oxnard from 1942 to 1950, and a county supervisor  from 1952 to 1965, serving as board chairman twice. He was appointed to the  state Fish and Game Commission three times between 1939 and 1950.  </P> <P> Carty also was the director of the California Duckhunters Assn., and several  other sporting groups.

"He got up every morning and put on a  suit and tie. He was a fighter."  </P> <P> A visitation will be held from 2 to 7 p.m. Monday at James A. Reardon Mortuary  in Oxnard. A Mass will be said 10:45 a.m. Tuesday at Santa Clara Church in  Oxnard, with burial following at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura.  </P></p>

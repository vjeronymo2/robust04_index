			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL CARDS -- THIEVES GET IN ON THE ACTION  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, someone broke into Pop's Sports Cards and Collectibles in the  Santa Clarita Valley and made off with $62,000 worth of baseball cards and  other sports memorabilia. Investigators say it was the skilled work of a  professional thief.  </P> <P> At Bases Loaded, a card shop in Chatsworth, bars on the windows and burglar  alarms didn't stop six break-ins in 12 months. About $15,000 worth of baseball  cards from the last burglary were recovered after they had apparently been  traded for cocaine.  </P> <P> Collecting player picture cards has become a big-time industry, and card  dealers and Los Angeles police say it is now breeding big-time crime.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles area, dealers and police report a trend in which numerous  card dealers' shops have been broken into in recent months.  </P> <P> In some instances, the thefts have led to injuries. A San Diego dealer was  attacked by a man who stole cards from his shop. And in San Luis Obispo, Frank  Gove was found beaten to death in March behind the counter of the baseball card  store where he worked. About $10,000 in sports cards and other memorabilia were  stolen.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt that what was once a fairly innocent hobby now has a darker  side," said Detective Mike Brennler, who is investigating the murder.  </P> <P> Nobody knows that better than Robert and Mike Manning, the father and son who  operate Pop's Sports Cards and Collectibles in Canyon Country.  </P> <P> Two years ago a burglar broke into a shop that the Mannings operated in nearby  Valencia to steal coins and try to open the safe. The display cases filled with  baseball cards were left untouched.  </P> <P> Last month, however, when a burglar broke into the new shop, the four display  cases of baseball cards were emptied and, this time, the coins were left  behind. Gone were the gems of the Mannings' card cases: a 1953 Willie Mays, a  1956 Mickey Mantle and others. Many were worth hundreds of dollars each.  </P> <P> "It used to be, in this business, that you worried about fire or water damaging  your stock," Mike Manning said. "Now you have to worry about the criminal  element."  </P> <P> In the old days -- which for card shops largely means the early 1980s -- many  shops didn't even have alarms. But the recent crimes are causing changes. Now  many shops have sophisticated alarms and other means of security. Like jewelry  stores, some shops place the most expensive cards in safes when they close up  for the night.  </P> <P> The Mannings, who thought an alarm system was enough for their shop in Canyon  Country, are now thinking about putting bars over the windows and doors.  </P> <P> "All this for baseball cards," said a dejected Robert Manning, who invested  much of his retirement savings in cards to sell at the store.  </P> <P> Other Southland dealers make similar observations.  </P> <P> "People are getting ripped off; you have to take precautions," said Matt  Federgreen, owner of the Beverly Hills Baseball Card Shop. "I protect my store  like it's a jewelry store. I have a second alarm, video cameras and bars on my  windows and doors."  </P> <P> Federgreen said he doesn't even keep his most valuable cards inside his store  on North Robertson Boulevard. They are in a safe deposit box and he shows them  by appointment only. "After I get to know someone, then I will bring out my  good stuff," he said.  </P> <P> Federgreen stressed that collectors need to be as careful as dealers these  days. He reported that one of his 14-year-old customers recently had a  collection valued at $10,000 stolen from his home.  </P> <P> Baseball cards have become a billion-dollar business, observers say. Though  still the domain of youngsters who collect and trade them, player picture cards  and other sports memorabilia have also become prime investment concerns to  collectors young and old with big bucks. A mint 1952 Mickey Mantle card can go  for $8,000 this year, next year maybe even more. Rarer specimens have even more  astronomical prices.  </P> <P> A sense of the growth can be seen in the San Fernando Valley, where in 10 years  the number of card shops has more than quadrupled from three to at least 14,  said Max Himmelstein, operator since 1980 of the Valley Baseball Card Shop in  Tarzana.  </P> <P> Along with the expansion and success of the market has come what dealers and  law enforcement authorities believe is a wave of crime.  </P> <P> "With the surge in prices and interest in sports memorabilia, you are going to  get the types who will resort to criminal means to get cards," Brennler said.  </P> <P> Mark Gorman, owner of Bases Loaded in Chatsworth, said the phenomenon is  discouraging and irritating but possibly unavoidable because of the value of  collector cards.  </P> <P> "I don't know what to do about it," Gorman said. "I put bars on the windows and  alarms all over the place but still they get in here."  </P> <P> In the first week of April, Bases Loaded was burglarized twice in five days,  losing $15,000 in baseball cards. Police recovered a number of the cards after  detectives learned from an informant that the burglar had stolen them to trade  for cocaine.  </P> <P> Police used a warrant to search a suspected drug dealer's home and found the  cards alongside a cache of cocaine. Detective Butch Cantalupo, who collected  cards as a boy, called the case a telling example of how the hobby has lost  some of its innocence.  </P> <P> "More and more, baseball cards keep coming up related to crime," Cantalupo  said. "There is a lot of value to some of these cards. They can be turned over  and sold" easily by thieves.  </P> <P> The burglar who hit Pop's Sports Cards and Collectibles on May 30 was both  cagey and knowledgeable. Before breaking in, the thief disconnected not only  the alarm, but the phones to all stores in the small strip shopping center. The  burglar then smashed in the shop's glass door, clearing the display counters  and stock shelves of more than 7,000 player cards.  </P> <P> "He knew what he was looking for," Mike Manning said of the burglar. Some cards  were taken, some were left behind. The burglar dumped one carton of baseball  cards out so the box could be used to haul others from the shop.  </P> <P> "The cards were what they wanted," Sheriff's Sgt. Dick Young said. "It looks  like it was done by a professional. This wasn't some kids breaking in to grab  cards."  </P> <P> Detective Brennler said numerous card shops have been robbed nationwide in the  last two to three years, but the Gove killing is apparently the only murder  that has resulted.  </P> <P> Gove was attacked as he was closing the Central Coast Baseball Cards shop. He  was beaten with a blunt object and his body found slumped behind a counter.  None of the stolen baseball cards or memorabilia have turned up, Brennler said.  </P> <P> Such crimes are difficult to solve, detectives say. Most cards -- except  extremely rare ones -- are hard to trace because they can't be marked by owners  and there are usually duplicates on the market. They are also easy to sell. In  addition to shops, sports cards are traded hand-to-hand by collectors as well  as bought and sold at swap meets, sports memorabilia shows and through  collector magazines and catalogues.  </P> <P> Detectives investigating baseball card crimes hope for breaks and stay in touch  with dealers, who in turn keep on the alert for stolen cards. Last week, a  Santa Clarita Valley dealer who was aware of the break-in at Pop's Sports Cards  called deputies to report that two young boys had just entered with a large box  of cards to sell. Deputies rushed to the shop but the cards didn't match those  taken during the Pop's burglary. The boys were allowed to go about their  business.  </P> <P> Dealers are eager to cooperate because many have been victimized. Increasingly,  the dealers work together to guard against losses as well as taking security  measures on their own.  </P> <P> "You have to be careful now," said Himmelstein, who is considered the dean of  San Fernando Valley dealers. "There might have been a time when shops didn't  have alarms, but it's not like that now. Anything that gets big and more  valuable brings attention" from criminals.  </P> <P> "The dealers I talk to are quite aware of the fact that there are some  frightening episodes occurring," said Brennler. "They are taking appropriate  precautions."  </P> <P> To some like Brennler, the trend is discouraging. As a boy he avidly collected  cards. As a detective he is investigating the bizarre extreme of the hobby, the  slaying of a card dealer, and collects information on other baseball  card-related crime.  </P> <P> He recently helped his 9-year-old son start up his own card collection.  </P> <P> "I haven't tried to sully his hobby by telling him about all of this," Brennler  said. "But it is a concern to me."  </P></p>

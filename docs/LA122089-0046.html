			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABT CANCELS L.A. DATES; FROZEN OUT BY JOFFREY?  </P> <P> American Ballet Theatre will not dance in Los Angeles in 1990, said Jane  Herman, executive director of the company. However, the company remains  scheduled to appear from March 6 to 18 at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The company had announced plans to dance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for  two weeks in July, nine years after its last engagement there.  </P> <P> Ballet Theatre's decision came after the collapse of negotiations with the  Music Center Operating Co. to bring the company back to the Pavilion for annual  engagements from 1990-92, sources said. But whether Ballet Theatre canceled or  the Music Center withdrew an offer remained open to debate.  </P> <P> Herman said that the Music Center Operating Co. "withdrew an offer (for annual  Ballet Theatre engagements) that was on the table and approved by the officers  of ABT," and she blames that withdrawal on the Joffrey Ballet, the resident  dance company of the Music Center.  </P> <P> "I was told not to fly out to sign the three-year agreement -- because I  couldn't have it," Herman said. "I was told in no uncertain terms that we could  not play two consecutive years (at the Pavilion) -- and this was a decision by  the Joffrey." She agreed that the initial proposal for annual ABT appearances  at the Pavilion was made by ABT, before she joined the company in September.  </P> <P> "For a company of our size to go into July, unassisted by anyone -- to be  completely at risk, and yet have no ability to build a subscription audience  (at the Pavilion, over a minimum three-year-period) -- was unacceptable," she  said. "We would have had no jurisdiction over our future."  </P> <P> Penelope Curry, executive director of the Joffrey Ballet, denied that her  company had any veto power over Music Center bookings. "That's strictly the  (Music Center) Operating Co.," she said. The operating company's executives  agreed and said that the Joffrey's role was strictly advisory.  </P> <P> However, Curry also said that the operating company had asked the Joffrey for  its opinion of the three-year Ballet Theatre proposal, and "we recommended  against it" on principle.  </P> <P> She explained that only the Music Center resident companies (which include, at  the Pavilion, the Joffrey Ballet, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Los Angeles  Master Chorale and Music Center Opera) are guaranteed annual performance dates.  "Having as little as three weeks more available (for dance at the heavily  booked Pavilion) up until Disney Hall opens, we wouldn't want L.A. closed out  to everyone except one or two companies," she said.  </P> <P> "It is our feeling that there should be a variety of dance at the Music Center.  Beginning in 1992, the Joffrey has been asked to coordinate dance at the Music  Center, and we wanted ABT to be the first company to be invited (for a proposed  subscription dance season)."  </P> <P> That invitation, made this July, was for appearances every other year, Curry  said, "but Jane (Herman) said that until she had finalized negotiations with  the operating company (over the three-year proposal), she didn't want to talk  about 1992." Herman agreed with Curry's account of the 1992 situation.  </P> <P> Sandra Kimberling, president of the Music Center Operating Co., confirmed the  Joffrey's influence on the decision to reject Ballet Theatre's three-year  proposal. "We chose to pursue musical theater for '91 (instead of offering the  time to Ballet Theatre) and support the Joffrey Ballet in our decision, she  explained."  </P> <P> However, Kimberling said the operating company "had made Jane a very fair deal  for 1990. But she considered 1990 only as the first step in an annual  commitment. . . . It was definitely a permanent arrangement (one that would  last beyond the three-year proposal) that ABT wanted as far as I'm concerned."  </P> <P> A gala celebrating the company's 50th anniversary was to have been part of the  1990 engagement.  </P> <P> Leslie E. Schoof, Ballet Theatre general manager, was in charge of negotiations  with the Music Center before Herman joined the company. He said that in  discussions and preliminary negotiations -- "all along" -- the Operating Co.  always accepted the premise that ABT would be coming each year on a  self-presentation basis. "They spoke about offering us a one-year contract,  renewable annually," he said.  </P> <P> Chuck Schneider, chairman and chief executive officer of the operating company,  explained that, since the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera ceased to be a Music  Center resident company, "the one thing we don't have on a regular basis is  musical theater."  </P> <P> He said that the possibility of "The Phantom of the Opera" continuing to play  the Ahmanson through the summer of 1991 helped shape the decision to put  musical theater in the Pavilion that summer rather than Ballet Theatre. But he  emphasized that "we'd love to have ABT there -- and we'd love to have other  dance companies there as well."  </P> <P> The Music Center is not yet prepared to announce what attraction will fill the  dates previously assigned to Ballet Theatre -- but operating company executives  said there is no shortage of applicants.  </P> <P> Curry said the Joffrey had never objected to plans for an ABT season at the  Pavilion in July, 1990, and, indeed, had agreed to a request from the operating  company to help market that season through flyers inserted into Joffrey  programs. But she also said that the ABT cancellation involved causes other  than the problem of the Pavilion's long-term availability.  </P> <P> "It is my understanding that the main concern that ABT had for 1990 was the  risk of playing against the Bolshoi (Ballet) at the Shrine," she said. (Half of  Ballet Theatre's two-week engagement at the Pavilion would have overlapped the  Bolshoi season.)  </P> <P> Curry agreed that unconfirmed reports of engagements in Orange County by the  Royal Ballet (in late July and early August) and the Australian Ballet from  (Aug. 7 to 12) -- plus the attention to be given the dance-dominated 1990 Los  Angeles Festival in September -- also made for what she called "a very risky  summer."  </P> <P> Kimberling also said that the Bolshoi engagement was a key factor in Ballet  Theatre's decision not to dance in Los Angeles. "If the Bolshoi hadn't been  there, ABT would have taken its chances," she declared. "I told Jane that if it  was my decision, I wouldn't come."  </P> <P> Schneider was even more emphatic. "There's just no doubt in my mind that the  direct competition with the Bolshoi, and ABT's own appearance in Orange County  in the spring caused them to cancel," he said.  </P> <P> Herman denied that the issue of Bolshoi competition was pivotal, though she  also said that she didn't know which dates the Bolshoi would play in Los  Angeles when she joined the company and picked up the negotiations.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying that the Bolshoi being there didn't cause us to worry about the  rep we were bringing," she said. "It certainly changed some of our (box-office)  projections, too. But the major problem was that the idea of an ABT presence  annually (at the Pavilion) was not what they (the Joffrey) saw to their  advantage. They wanted us every other year and to bring in other companies in  the interim years. All of which would be attached to their subscriptions."  </P> <P> "(We) cannot afford high-risk factors in the summer if we can't build (our own)  subscription audiences," she said. "We can't allow our company to be part of a  major financial risk in order to bolster subscriptions in which we have no  say."  </P> <P> She said the July, 1990, dates were not connected to any other nearby  engagements -- what's called a "runout."  </P> <P> "A completely segregated engagement like this one is extremely costly," she  explained. "We're talking about 140 people, 10 or 12 trucks out on tour. We  were prepared to do it as an investment, to build a (subscription) audience at  the Pavilion and in hopes of securing more attractive dates when the Disney  Hall opens (in 1992). But not as a one-year-deal with absolutely no knowledge  of where that would take us."  </P> <P> Herman said she wasn't sure whether Ballet Theatre would dance in Los Angeles  in 1991, and wanted to look at plans for that year "completely fresh."  </P> <P> As for the invitation to join the Pavilion's subscription dance season the  following year, she characterized herself as adaptable. "If we have to  negotiate with the Joffrey for '92," she said, "we will see what the future  is."  </P></p>

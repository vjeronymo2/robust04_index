			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CLAIMS CRITICISM IS UNFAIR;  </P> <P> REAGAN SAYS HE LEFT LITTLE FOR BUSH TO DO  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan told an audience of convention goers Sunday that  President Bush has been treated unfairly -- in part because his predecessor  accomplished so much.  </P> <P> "George Bush has been a major part of everything we've done these last eight  years. . . . It's just a case of him not having anything startling to introduce  so far," Reagan, now a speaker-for-hire, said at one of the nation's largest  trade shows, the National Restaurant Assn. and Hotel and Motel Show.  </P> <P> Reagan said Bush's problem is that so much was accomplished by the Reagan  Administration that there were few areas that need shoring up right away. He  added that because of this, Bush has received unfair treatment, presumably in  the form of press reviews criticizing the Administration's seeming lack of  direction.  </P> <P> He said what Bush needs -- and what he himself would be fighting for if he were  still President -- is a line-item veto on the budget and a constitutional rein  on congressional spending, which Reagan maintains is the source of the deficit.  </P> <P> Reagan did not attempt to address the political upheaval in China or any other  foreign policy issue but stuck to his anti-communist, pro-democracy posture in  brief references to Panama and the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

"The United States should approach the DPRK's proposal  prudently and make a decision on its judgement", he said.    U.S. media set afloat reports quoting recent remarks of the  U.S. official quarters that "there are both positive and  negative aspects" in the proposal of the DPRK, that "it is a  matter which should be examined carefully through consultation  with allies" and that "never-ceasing pressure should be put on  North Korea". Answering a question put by the KCNA in this  connection today, the spokesman said:    "This time we made to the U.S. side a detailed proposal to  expand the scope of inspection for fully guaranteeing the  continuity of safeguards by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA).    "This progressive proposal made by us was a step which was  taken in good faith after the U.S. side accepted the DPRK's  formula of package solution and should affirmative willingness  to practically improve the relations between the DPRK and the  USA.    "It is the largest concession on the part of the DPRK at the  present stage in view of the low level of confidence between the  DPRK and the USA and between the DPRK and the IAEA.    "Of course, it is a transitional measure adopted before the  third-stage talks and it is clear that an agreement on the  package solution at the third-stage talks would lead to a full  inspection of the facilities reported to the IAEA.    "And, in the afore-said proposal, we declared that, if the  South Korean authorities proposed a working contact for the  exchange of special envoys between the North and the South on an  understandable term, the North was ready to examine it  affirmatively.    "It is, in fact, improper for the United States to raise the  exchange of special envoys between the North and the South of  Korea as a precondition for its talks with the DPRK": The  exchange of special envoys between the North and the South had  been proposed by us and it is our stand to carry it into  practice by all means.    "As the exchange of special envoys is aimed at discussing  not  only nuclear problem but also a number of problems arising in  the relations between the North and the South, it is a domestic  issue of our nation which should be discussed and agreed upon  between the North and the South. So it is not a problem in  which the United States should interfere, still less a problem  requiring good offices of the United States.    "However, proceeding from the position to solve the nuclear  problem at any cost, the DPRK, with good intentions, made clear  its stand toward the exchange of special envoys between the  North and the South, fully taking into consideration the  embarrassing circumstances of the U.S. side.    "Now some quarters of the United States are raising a noisy  row as if the discontinuation of the `Team Spirit' joint  military exercises were a big concession. But, in fact, the  manoeuvres are an act of nuclear threat that plainly contradicts  the spirit of the joint statement between the DPRK and the  United States and so it is a big mistake for the United States  to try to wrest something from the DPRK in return for it. "The  United States would be well advised to give up the idea of using  the discontinuation of the war game as a bargaining chip.    "If the manoeuvres are forced, we are fully prepared to cope  with them."</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GREEN'S WIFE SEEKS TO DROP COUNTS  </P> <P> The wife of Hugh Green has filed a waiver to drop charges of spouse battery  against the Miami Dolphins linebacker, saying news accounts about the football  player's arrest were blown out of proportion.  </P> <P> Green was arrested early Sunday and released on $10,000 bond. He was charged  with striking Monique Green several times in the head and chest with his fist,  the police report said. The linebacker's wife allegedly hit her head on the bed  during the altercation and was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital where she was  treated and released.  </P> <P> Chris Hoyer, chief assistant state attorney, said his office will screen the  case and decide whether to file formal charges against Green even though the  complaint has been dropped.  </P></p>

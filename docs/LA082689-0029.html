			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LADY'S HAT LEAVES HIM BRIMMING WITH DISDAIN  </P> <P> Mike Downey's article, "Giant Hat Gets a Fan Tossed Out," was very insensitive  to the plight of the fan sitting behind the lady with the large hat. He paid  for his seat, as did the lady.  </P> <P> Several years ago, I sat behind a lady with a large hat at the Olympic  Auditorium. I was not able to see the ring, and asked the lady to remove the  hat. She would not because it would mess up her hair. I asked an usher to  request that she remove the hat. He did, and she did.  </P> <P> It is just good manners to be thoughtful of your fellow sports fan.  </P> <P> LARRY SANDERS, Whittier  </P></p>

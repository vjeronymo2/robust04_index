			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> S. AFRICA BARS USE OF WHIPS  </P> <P> South African police, responding to a wave of international and domestic  outrage, banned the use of whips to break up anti-apartheid demonstrations and  riots. A police spokesman in Johannesburg, Maj. Marius Bonhuys, said the order  applies to plastic quirts and that other crowd-dispersal methods will be  continued, including tear gas, birdshot and batons. An official statement said  police had regarded quirts as less harmful than batons but that their use is  being suspended because of "negative public reaction, locally and  internationally."  </P></p>

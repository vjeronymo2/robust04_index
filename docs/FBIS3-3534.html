			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Dongyun (3769 0392 0061) and Lei Weihua (7191 5588 </F> 5478)]    [Text] Guangzhou, 16 mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chen  Liuming, director of the Guangdong Provincial Taxation Bureau,  said at the Provincial Taxation Bureau Directors Conference held  here that in the past two months, the new taxation system has on  the whole operated steadily and smoothly in Guangdong and  initial achievements have been made.    Chen Liuming said that in the first two months of this year,  Guangdong's national economy continued to maintain rapid  development. Reform of the taxation system caused no big  fluctuation in commodity prices on the market and revenue from  taxation continued to grow quite rapidly. By 10 March, the  accumulated total of industrial and commercial taxes collected  in Guangdong reached 7.6 billion yuan, 38.5 percent up on the  same period last year.    Talking about recent problems cropping up in the course of  implementing the new taxation system, Chen Liuming said that the  tax reduction exemption policies adopted by the central  authorities and the provincial government before June last year  and which are not yet due will continue to be implemented until  1995, and taxes will be collected first and returned later.    With regard to returning the increased portion of taxes  after  the collection of a turnover tax paid by foreign-invested  enterprises whose operations were approved before the end of  last year, he stressed that we should clearly understand that,  firstly, the increased portion of taxes paid for products or  labor services at a unified industrial and commercial tax rate  lower than the existing value-added tax rate and sales tax rate  should be returned, and the value-added tax rate should be  converted according to unified taxes included in the calculated  prices. Secondly, regarding goods purchased by enterprises  without legal proof of tax reduction, the calculation of a  specific amount of tax payments for return should first be based  on the actual prime cost and the tax rate suited to the  value-added tax, and this portion should be deducted from the  amount of tax to be returned.</p>

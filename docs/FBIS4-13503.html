			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat  will meet again in Bucharest today and will discuss the  timetable for concluding the negotiations. Our correspondent  Gid'on Kouts reports that Mr. Peres believes the negotiations  between Israel and the PLO will end during the first week of May  and adds that Peres might join the Israeli delegation in Cairo  next weekend in order to facilitate the talks. Following the  meeting between the two last night, Mr. Peres said it transpired  that several disagreements between Israel and the PLO stemmed  from misunderstandings. Peres noted that 'Arafat was troubled  and that he had to calm him down. It was reported that during  the meeting, 'Arafat said he is committed to help on the matter  of the Israeli MIA's and will continue to act on this issue  despite the difficulties.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 21 April  carries a related report in which Kouts adds that "Shim'on Peres  told us that during his upcoming visit to Israel, Warren  Christopher will not be handed any document to relay to Syria.  He will simply be briefed on Israel's position in detail."]</p>

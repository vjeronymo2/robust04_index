			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F> Dragan Colovic; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Jovanovic] In whose interest could it possibly be  to commit such a horrendous crime, and what can somebody who  might be interested in such a crime expect from it? In this  respect, we must clearly see that the Serbian side is definitely  not the one that harbors any interest in prolonging the crisis  and even less in complicating and deteriorating it further by  producing such horrendous pictures of war. The perpetrators  should be sought among those who have been, even so far, staunch  opponents of the peace process or the factors that on several  occasions did everything they could to postpone, prolong, or  thwart this process.    In any case, the investigation, which we expect to be  meticulous and objective, should establish not merely the  physical executor, but also the side that was behind the  executor, that appears as the chief obstruction to the progress  toward peace. Understandably, all this could have been avoided  and we would not have needed to watch all these pictures of war  -- neither the less bloody ones nor these most horrific ones --  had the peace that was so readily on offer for acceptance in  Geneva been accepted wholeheartedly by those who care about  peace.    [Colovic] Mr. Minister, can this event influence, and to  what extent, the ways of the further resolution of the crisis in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina and also on the territories of former  Yugoslavia?    [Jovanovic] You see, with its drama and dimensions, this  horrendous crime can be misused by the opponents of peace to  further endanger the peace process and justify the policy of  force, that is to say, the war option as the only way out of  this situation.    On the other hand this terrible accident can act as a last  warning to all who have maintained a reasonable approach toward  the Bosnian crisis, namely, that the postponement of peace is no  longer counterproductive, but also criminal, and that we must  concentrate on the peace process and bring it to an end in one  or two swipes.    I hope, we hope, that the voices of sobriety and  responsibility will prevail and that this accident will, at the  same time, be the last large-scale accident in this war and that  a lesson will be learned from all this that will expedite the  peace process and bring it to a finale as soon as possible.</p>

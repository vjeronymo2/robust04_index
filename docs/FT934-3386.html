			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Bank governor defines scope on rates The Bank of England will have up to a month to decide the timing of future changes in interest rates, Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, said yesterday. Mr George said in evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that the new arrangement was a 'helpful' step towards monetary stability. Under the new system, announced last month, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will decide on shifts in borrowing rates, leaving the Bank to control the timing. Mr George said the Treasury's projection of 2.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product next year was 'plausible'. Although he held out little hope for a large increase in house prices, he said the number of people whose houses were worth less than the mortgages used to buy them had come down by about 'a third' this year. He broadly agreed with a study this week from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation saying that 26 per cent of homes bought between 1988 and 1991 were worth less than the mortgages on them, with this proportion having risen from 21 per cent a year ago. Behind this, however, was a sharp rise in the numbers late last year and a fall this year. Sketching out the latitude available to the Bank over the dates of monetary policy shifts, he said this would encourage perceptions in markets that economic rather than political events were the main driving forces. MPs also questioned Mr George about the way in which he and the chancellor would discuss changes in interest rates. Mr George said any new government views on these matters would be conveyed at the normal monthly meeting between the two. After this the chancellor 'would expect it (the change) to happen by the time we next met'.</p>

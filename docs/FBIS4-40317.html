			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Stepanenko: "Belorussia: Ever More Voices </F> for Union"]    [Text] "I am confident that a renovated Union will be  revived," said Vyacheslaw Kebich, chairman of the Republic's  Council of Ministers, at a meeting with the collective of the  Minsk Kirov Machine Tool Construction Plant. He underlined the  special importance of unity with Russia: "Should we be left  without Russia, it would be our ruin. One should be a realist  in politics and remember that the wheel of history can only roll  forward, not backward."    Millions of people see no life without a single union of  fraternal peoples. In Belorussia [Belarus] nearly  three-quarters of the citizens are for the revival. The most  consistent supporters of restoring the Union of SSR on a new,  mutually acceptable basis are Belorussian communists. It was  they who proposed to hold the next meeting of representatives of  the communist parties of the former USSR republics in Viskuli  where the shameful Belovezhskaya Forest agreement was adopted.</p>

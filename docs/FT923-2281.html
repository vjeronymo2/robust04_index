			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US buy helps Wassall to Pounds 6m WASSALL, the mini-conglom-erate run by former Hanson executives, doubled pre-tax profits in the six months ended June 30 on the back of its recent acquisition of DAP, a US supplier of construction products and filling compounds. Profits increased to Pounds 6.24m (Pounds 3.12m) on increased sales of Pounds 117m (Pounds 63.8m). The consumer division, which includes DAP and Antler, the UK luggage manufacturer, increased operating profit to Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 340,000). DAP generated Pounds 2.8m of this. The US business is undergoing a rationalisation programme which has meant the closure of a number of plants and a reduction in its product range. When Wassall bought DAP last year half of its sales were generated by 18 products, while the other half was generated by 700 products. Wassall has earmarked Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.2m) of capital expenditure over the next two years to replace old machinery, open a new warehouse and expand DAP's DIY sheds which is the fastest growing part of the US DIY market. By the year end margins are expected to have risen by almost 3 percentage points to 7 per cent. The closures businesses, which includes bottle top companies in the UK, Italy and South Africa, increased operating profits from Pounds 3.49m to Pounds 3.82m. The industrial and commercial side arrested last year's fall in profits with a strong performance from Gilchrist pre-press services which offset a disappointing result from office furniture. Operating profits rose to Pounds 195,000 (Pounds 156,000). Borrowings increased to Pounds 28m (Pounds 24m) representing gearing of 45 per cent. However, debt is expected to fall to Pounds 20m by the year end. Earnings per share improved to 3.46p (3.13p adjusted) and the interim dividend is increased to 0.8p (0.67p adjusted). COMMENT Wassall is one of the few companies content to be labelled a conglomerate. The C word may have become unfashionable in the nineties but Mr Christopher Miller, chairman, believes there are almost as many undervalued manufacturing companies for sale now as there were in the eighties. Wassall's doubling of profits on the back of its acquisition of DAP underlines his argument. Mr Miller would admit that there is an element of luck. About 70 per cent of sales are generated overseas, which is an added bonus during a sterling crisis. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.5m, giving earnings per share of 9.9p, the shares - up 14p to close at 172p - are on a prospective multiple of 17.2. It may look expensive but for the moment its 35 per cent premium to the market is justified.</p>

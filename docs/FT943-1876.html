			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Blunkett backs 2.4% for nurses Mr David Blunkett, opposition health spokesman, yesterday said that if in government the Labour party would probably be supporting a pay rise for nurses of around 2.4 per cent, the rate of inflation. The nurses have submitted a claim for 8.3 per cent and Mr Blunkett's comments are indicative of Labour's desire to distance itself from its traditional stance of unconditional support for unions as well as taking a firm approach towards public-sector pay.</p>

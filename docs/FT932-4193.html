			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Leasehold accounting review - Task force issues draft rules on property holdings for discussion COMPANIES will be required to promptly show any loss between the sale or rental of vacant leasehold property and their obligations on the lease, under draft rules from the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board, published yesterday. Any difference between the recoverable amount and future obligations on leasehold property which they have ceased to use and are unlikely to reoccupy must be deducted from profits. The shortfall should be recognised in the accounts as soon as it is identified and not in the periods to which the rent and other expenses relate. Since there will generally be no open market evidence, the task force recommends a valuation technique from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It says companies should assess the capital sum which would need to be set aside to offset the negative cash flow over a given period. Any provision should take account of other on-going expenses, such as rates and security, as well as costs associated with vacating the property. Mr Eugene Bannon, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said the impact of the proposals on some companies could be 'tens of millions of pounds.' They would be particularly likely to affect companies in London and the south-east, where rents have declined most steeply. Companies most likely to be affected are those which are rationalising their property portfolios, such as banks and building societies. The impact might also be felt by retailers who were closing high street shops to move to out-of-town shopping centres. The proposals were circulated for consultation and will be discussed at the task force's meeting on July 14. If approved, they are likely to be compulsory from September.</p>

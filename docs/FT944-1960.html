			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Retailers pressed on warranties Electrical goods retailers ought to implement Office of Fair Trading recommendations on the sale of extended warranties before Christmas, Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said yesterday. The OFT report, published yesterday, criticised techniques used by many retailers to sell warranties and the wide disparity between the prices of warranties on the same goods. Extended warranties are insurance policies providing extra protection against product breakdown after standard manufacturers' guarantees expire. More than 5m warranties are sold every year in a market worth Pounds 400m. The report called for retailers such as Dixons and Comet to provide customers with information on the prices and conditions of extended warranties - including those offered by manufacturers. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he would soon examine the setting up of a code of practice to regulate warranty sales. Mr Griffiths said: 'Millions of electrical goods will be bought in the week before Christmas, and I want to see retailers taking action now to ensure that the mis-selling stops.' Sir Bryan said he would consider a Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference if retailers failed to implement the OFT's recommendations 'without delay'. He was looking for 'early moves towards the provision of full point of sale information'. He said he would expect retailers' profit margins on extended warranties to fall more in line with margins on product sales. City analysts believe warranties account for a large part of many electrical retailers' pre-tax profits. The report highlighted the wide price discrepancies between warranty policies offered by different retailers and manufacturers for the same products (see table). Dixons, the UK's biggest electrical retailer, said its sales practices already reflected most of the OFT's recommendations. Since the OFT started its investigation, Dixons has introduced in stores leaflets carrying comprehensive price lists of its warranties. Kingfisher, owner of Comet, the second-biggest UK electrical retailer, said it was introducing a computer system in stores to provide information on both product and extended warranty prices.

The business community, after closely watching the  inter-Korean contacts on exchanging special envoys in the  expectation that they might pave the way for cross-border  establishment of economic offices or trade representatives, was  deeply disappointed at the rupture.    Large enterprises including Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and  Sunkyung as well as many small- and medium-sized businesses have  already formed task forces to prepare for economic links with  Pyongyang and have worked for more than a year to realize  actural cooperation including joint investment in the North.    However, their efforts are unlikely to bear fruit for now  after northern delegates unexpectedly walked out of the  inter-Korean contact and in light of the South's quick shift to  a hard-line policy.    One source said, "the large enterprises are expected to  continue their processing-on-commission trade with the North for  the time being through third countries, including China and Hong  Kong."    Processing-on-commission trade involves South Korean  businesses providing raw materials or half-finished goods to the  North and later importing finished goods through third  countries. But even this kind of trade may decrease with the  deterioration of inter-Korean relations, the sources expected.</p>

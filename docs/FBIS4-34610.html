			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 20 Jun (EFE) -- On 20 June, Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori reported that Abimael Guzman's arrest was  possible thanks to the report given by a Shining Path [SL]  leader who betrayed his leaders in exchange of his freedom. The  president released some unprecedented details on the Shining  Path leader's arrest, explaining the release of Luis Alberto  Arana Franco, which has prompted a scandal in Peru.    Fujimori said Arana Franco, logistics chief for the Maoist  group, was released in compliance with the Repentance Law  approved in August 1992 because he provided some clues to police  that led to Guzman's arrest in September the same year. Arana  was arrested in June 1992 and two months later, when the law was  approved, he decided to seek refuge under the law, which reduces  the sentence of a terrorist who cooperates in capturing the  heads of his organization.    The Peruvian president reported that Arana Franco betrayed  Zenon Vargas, Shining Path national coordinator, and Maritza  Garrido-Lecca, and Juan Inchaustegui, who were in charge of  Guzman's personal safety.    After following Garrido-Lecca and Inchaustegui, police  concluded that the couple was hiding an "important" Shining Path  leader in their home, and raided the house without imagining  that the top leader could be found inside.    Fujimori said that Arana Franco's decision "must serve as an  example for those who want to reorganize their lives instead of  earning a long prison sentence," and added that the released  collaborator is being protected and his identity has been  changed.    The Peruvian president also confirmed that in the past two  months, the Peruvian courts have released several Shining Path  terrorists "for lack of evidence" and asked the Supreme Court to  "thoroughly" investigate these cases.    He also categorically rejected reports that his government  has released some terrorists as a result of negotiations with  arrested Shining Path leaders, and said such rumors "are in bad  faith and biased."    The political opposition has said it will ask Congress to  call the justice and defense ministers to explain why those  Shining Path terrorists were released.    Most government officials have reported, however, that the  petition will be rejected because it intends to "politicize" the  problem and to blame the government for those cases "that are  the exclusive responsibility of the courts."</p>

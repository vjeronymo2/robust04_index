			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Companies resist accounting campaign COMPANIES are still resisting the Accounting Standards Board's campaign to outlaw extraordinary items, according to a survey by Company Reporting, the monthly monitor of annual accounts. The analysis showed that during the past 12 months 39 per cent of a sample of 570 companies continued to use extraordinary items. For accounts published in the first quarter of this year, the proportion was 32 per cent. Extraordinary items are income or expenditure outside the normal activities of a company that are not treated as part of earnings on the profit and loss account. Their continued widespread use comes in spite of standards issued in late 1991 by the Accounting Standards Board, which argued that very few items should be classified in this way. The new rules do not become mandatory for financial year-ends until June this year, but the board has been keen to encourage companies to comply as quickly as possible. Those companies still using extraordinary items in their latest accounts include Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, Thorn EMI, the entertainment group, and Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products company. The majority of those aspects classified as extraordinary were profits and losses on disposals and discontinuance, reorganisation and redundancy. The study shows that the number of companies using extraordinaries has fallen from 53 per cent two years ago. Company Reporting. 68 Dundas Street, Edinburgh EH3 6QZ. Pounds 325 per year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Doing the Right Thing, Cautiously"] </F>   [Text] The British Government seems at last to have  realised that it must reinforce its troops in Bosnia. The  welcome change of attitude was reflected in yesterday's more  positive statements by John Major and Malcolm Rifkind. Instead  of looking for a way out of Bosnia they now convey the  impression, albeit only half convincingly, that they are seeking  a way in by pressing others to join them in sending more troops.    The change has not been voluntary or happy, and it does not  yet extend to sending troops unilaterally, but it shows that the  Government is slowly facing reality. At home it would face  bitter recriminations if it were to leave a successful British  general in the lurch and British soldiers so vulnerable and  thinly stretched.    Internationally, it would have a lot of explaining to do if,  after such a string of failures and misjudgements, it missed the  fragile window of opportunity for peace that has now opened up  in Bosnia. It may not be enthusiastic but at least it is doing  the right thing.    The fighting continues but cease-fires are holding in  several  areas and may gradually be extended. The combatants are weary  and the intervention of the Americans and Russians has increased  pressure on them to settle. There is a chance that military  stability can open the way for diplomacy to end the war.    The window will not stay open long. The Muslims still want  the return of conquered areas and have been emboldened by  American support. The Serbs have periodically offered partial  withdrawals but not enough to satisfy the Muslims. So the  temptation to resume fighting as soon as the spring arrives  remains strong. It is therefore important to put in more UN  troops quickly to police the cease-fire lines.    There is also another reason for speed. At the moment the  Russians are using their influence on the Serbs to promote a  settlement. Indeed, they have reportedly been quite firm. But  Moscow is so politically unstable that it cannot be relied on to  remain in this frame of mind indefinitely. Now is the time to  make the most of Russian co-operation.    In these circumstances it is foolish to pretend, as the  Americans do, that there is a clear distinction between  peace-making and peacekeeping. If the Americans were to  acknowledge this and send in their own troops, the chances of  peace would be enormously enhanced.    Unfortunately the troubled Clinton administration lacks the  courage to take this step, so others will have to face much  higher risks. But if they also duck the challenge, the costs  and risks will eventually be higher still.</p>

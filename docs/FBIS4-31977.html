			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 17 Jun (TANJUG) -- Republic of Srpska  president Radovan Karadzic told VECERNJE NOVOSTI (Belgrade  daily) today that the River Drina could never again become a  border between the Serbs (in Bosnia and Serbia), and that the  Muslims could only be given enclaves in eastern Bosnia. In an  interview given in Moscow after his talks with Russian  officials, Karadzic pointed out that he had asked Andrey Kozyrev  and his aides to tell the contact group that the Serbs had to  have their part of Sarajevo. According to Karadzic, the central  part of Sarajevo, except for Grbavica, will be given to the  Muslims, and the republic of Srpska should get Dobrinja, Ilidza,  Lukavica, Hrasnica, and Rajlovac (western districts of Sarajevo).    "We will not give up the right bank of the Una river under  any circumstances, and there can be no haggling over Sanski  Most, our part of (Bosanska) Krupa, Novi Grad (former Bosanski  Novi), and Prijedor (all Serb-held towns in western Bosnia), or  over Podgrmecje and Potkozarje (areas in western Bosnia),"  Karadzic said.    Karadzic told the Russians to convey to the contact group  that the Sava river would be the best and the only possible  natural border in Posavina (Northern Bosnia). He said that the  republic of Srpska is very interested in a 1- or 2-km widening  (of the corridor) near Brcko and stressed the readiness to allow  the Muslims to use part of the Brcko port, but any interruption  of the republic of Srpska's territorial integrity is out of the  question. Karadzic pointed out that Croatia is offered an  honorable (Serb) proposal to get 250 square km in the Dubrovnik  hinterland in exchange for 30-35 km of the coast, between a  point north of Molunat and Prevlaka.    Saying that very soon it will become clear whether or not  the  United States is trying to involve Serbia and the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia in the war, Karadzic specified that  United States' insistence on a peace plan and maps dividing  Bosnia, which will be unacceptable for the Serbs, would be a  clear indication of this.</p>

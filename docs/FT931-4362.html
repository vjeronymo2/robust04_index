			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Palestinians reject plea on peace talks THE Palestinians yesterday refused to accept an invitation by the US and Russia, co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, to attend negotiations in Washington on April 20. Israel immediately accepted the invitation, while Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are likely to delay a response until after a meeting of foreign ministers in Damascus later this month. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said in Jerusalem that the invitation had been returned to the American consulate. 'We refused to accept it', she said. Despite this, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, remained confident that all the delegations would be in Washington on April 20. Mr Christopher added that he had decided to move ahead with separate multilateral regional Middle East talks beginning with a meeting on water issues in Geneva on April 22. The Palestinians based their rejection on Israel's refusal to comply fully with UN Security Council Resolution 799 calling for the return of the nearly 400 men deported from the occupied territories to southern Lebanon in December. While softening its insistence that all the deportees should be returned home before peace negotiations could resume, the Palestinians are demanding a public assurance from Israel that there will be no more mass deportations. Mr Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian in the occupied territories, stressed in London that the principle of deportations was the issue that had to be resolved. Britain yesterday gave its backing to the Palestinian stance on deportations. Mr Douglas Hogg, a minister at the Foreign Office, told parliament: 'It is essential that the Israeli government should make it plain that they do not intend to resort in the future to the policy of deportation.' He added that the Israeli government should also 'look urgently at other ways in which they can lift the weight of the occupation' of Gaza and the West Bank. Mr Hogg will deliver this message directly to Israel today when he meets Mr Yossi Beilin, the deputy foreign minister. Mr Beilin is expected to repeat his government's objection to Britain's resumption this week of ministerial contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Husseini emphasised that the Palestinians were committed to negotiations and talks could resume on April 20 'if there is a will from the Israeli side'. Egyptian crackdown, Page 6</p>

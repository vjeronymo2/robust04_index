The agreement with Greece, which was signed on June 22, 1993, is similar to U.S. social security agreements already in force with sixteen other countries_Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Agreements of this type are authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like the other agreements, the U.S.-Greek agreement eliminates dual social security coverage_the situation that occurs when a person from one country works in the other country and is required, along with his employer, to pay social security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Under the U.S.-Greek agreement, a worker who is sent by an employer in the United States to work in Greece for 5 years or less remains covered only by the U.S. system. The agreement includes additional rules that eliminate dual U.S. and Greek coverage in other work situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agreement also helps eliminate situations where workers suffer a loss of benefit rights because they have divided their careers between the two countries. Under the agreement, workers may qualify for partial U.S. or Greek benefits based on combined (totalized) work credits from both countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals who wish to obtain copies of the agreement or want more information about its provisions may write to the Social Security Administration, Office of International Policy, Post Office Box 17741, Baltimore, Maryland 21235. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Shirley S.

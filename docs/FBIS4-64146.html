			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva and Dmitriy Volkov report in the </F> "Money" column: "The Deputies Showered the Budget With  Amendments. Second Reading Has Been Postponed for Two Weeks"]    [Text] Yesterday the lower parliament chamber failed to  discuss the 1994 budget in its second reading. The State Duma's  Committee on Budget, Taxes and Prices did not complete work on  amendments to the draft law On the Federal Budget for 1994,  having by yesterday morning discussed only amendments to budget  revenues. Apparently the news conference by Mikhail Zadornov,  whose committee continued to work on the amendments, was  conducted by his deputy Gennadiy Kulik for this reason.    He told journalists that the committee will recommend to the  State Duma to redistribute the funds allocated to internal debt  servicing, maintenance of the administration apparatus, and  foreign economic activity in favor of increased appropriations  to the social sphere, fundamental research, and defense.  According to Mr. Kulik, the committee understands the  "difficult situation in which the army has found itself" and is  therefore going to advise the lower chamber to issue a special  military loan to support the sector. Economic Policy Committee  chairman Sergey Glazyev moved an amendment on increasing federal  budget revenues by 26 trillion rubles on account of pending  receipts from voucher privatization. Mr. Kulik however noted  that the privatization revenues planned by Sergey Glazyev should  be "assessed cautiously." The budget committee proposed  directing "excess" revenues -- if there are any, they will  hardly exceed 3 trillion -- to a special army support fund but  not including these funds immediately among revenues and  therefore not counting on them in spending. The question of  increasing army expenditures will apparently be decided at a  closed session of the lower chamber.    However, whether Sergey Glazyev's ideas about a constantly  growing revenue capability will prevail does not really matter.  In discussing the budgetary process, the deputies and the press  concentrate their attention mainly on numerical indicators of  revenues and expenditures, as well as the maximum size of  deficit. By proposing novel ideas like "introducing a market  mechanism of leasing/sale of equipment" to agrarians, the  deputies are trying to find a compromise between various  sectoral groups -- in this event the agro-industrial complex and  machine building.    Yet, as long as the present order of spending budget  resources continues, whereby appropriations are made as revenues  come into the treasury while the growth of credit emission is  limited by an agreement between the Central Bank and the Finance  Ministry, the government retains enough possibilities to hold a  more or less consistent financial policy. Therefore most  important will be the Duma's attitude to Mr. Glazyev's proposal  to "obligate the government and the Central Bank to ensure  guaranteed -- equally distributed by the months -- financing of  federal budget expenditures" which, in his opinion, will  "abolish the vicious practice of arbitrary sequestration of  state expenditures." In other words, first money is printed and  then backing is provided for it -- or not provided, but the  money has already been handed out. This will clearly make the  growth of expenditures snowball. The budget committee is not  inclined to support this amendment. On 8 June, during the  second reading of the budget, this will be a priority item on  the Duma's agenda.</p>

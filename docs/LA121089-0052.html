			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> JAPANESE MANAGEMENT: GOOD OR BAD?;  </P> <P> MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT JAPANESE MANAGEMENT AND WORKPLACE PRACTICES. BUT WHAT  IS IT REALLY LIKE TO WORK FOR JAPAN INC.? HAS THE COUNTRY'S SUCCESS BEEN  ACHIEVED AT A COST TO ITS WORKERS? GARY J. KATZENSTEIN AND RICHARD O'NEILL  RECENTLY SPENT MONTHS WORKING ON FELLOWSHIPS AT SONY CORP. IN JAPAN. THE TWO  CAME AWAY WITH VASTLY DIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS.;  </P> <P> ENCOURAGED: O'NEILL COMPARES JAPANESE MANAGEMENT STYLE TO THAT PRACTICED BY  AMERICAN FIRMS IN THE 1950S. HE BELIEVES ATTITUDES ARE CHANGING, JUST AS THEY  DID HERE.  </P> <P> Unlike Gary, who went afoul of Sony's personnel department, I was specifically  assigned to work with it, and found it obliging, open and powerful. Gary got  dismissed with his impolitic behavior. I got the "open kimono" because my  agenda was to study, not stand in judgment.  </P> <P> To counterpoint Gary, I found nothing egregious about Japanese executives'  being reassigned to a new job on short notice. Japanese practices are not  unique; they simply lag behind the United States by some 20 to 30 years. I  recall very clearly a cold Midwestern night in 1959 when my father (an upwardly  mobile corporate executive) came home to say that on Monday, we could, if we  chose, get promoted to Atlanta. My mother, due in two weeks to bear her fifth  child, recognized that flexibility and sacrifice would serve her interests  well, and immediately tackled the trials ahead. We moved, and prospered.  </P> <P> The lesson is this: In the 1980s' Japan, as in the 1950s' United States, those  with drive and ambition accept relocation as a price of personal success. The  idea that Japanese executives move because they are Kafkaesque automatons  ignores the fact that people, then as today, relocate because they want and  choose to do so.  </P> <P> Gary complains that the Japanese job rotation produces generalists with "thin  knowledge bases" rather than specialists, but the clear fact is that job  rotation (the practice of cross-training talent through sales, research,  personnel, manufacturing and so on) is a superior management development  strategy. The "bench strength" of companies that practice rotation (the most  successful U.S., Japanese and European companies) is formidable, with many  seasoned managers capable of building cross-disciplinary consensus and fueling  the growth engine.  </P> <P> To be sure, at Sony Japan (and Sony U.S.) there are world-class researchers who  follow specialist career paths, but the labs are closely linked with the  factories (increasingly at Sony U.S.), so they never lose a sense of how to  build what they design.  </P> <P> And what about Japanese women? In my time at Sony (1982), the women seemed  pretty neatly constrained by what we could call "feudal" career opportunities:  teas, telephones, translation and, with luck, marriage to a promising young  engineer followed by bearing children.  </P> <P> But this is not very different from U.S. practices of three decades ago, nor  European practices today. But times are changing fast everywhere. Recently, a  key female marketing talent in a Japanese firm here in Los Angeles flatly  refused a transfer back to Osaka. The company, pragmatically (and with few  options), altered its plans and course to accommodate this needed talent.  </P> <P> My friend Peter Drucker, just back from his annual consulting tour of Japan,  told me recently about the surprisingly rapid (and recent) ascent of women into  critical management positions. The lesson here is a simple one: Japanese  business is quickly adapting to a global shortage of talent. Today, you  discriminate against women at your peril.  </P> <P> WASPish 19th-Century Wall Street once sought to keep out the Irish, Jews,  Italians and others, but when trade started to walk new streets, the old-line  financial companies adapted or perished. Women on the rise in today's Japan are  a matter of necessity, not virtue.  </P> <P> The lack of free labor market alternatives in Japan is a discredited myth;  Japanese do change companies. When I was interviewing my way through Sony  headquarters, I met a 28-year-old electronics engineer who confided that he  previously worked at a larger electronics company until recruited away by Sony.  My friends in the personnel department, confronted with this "un-Japanese"  fact, let on that, indeed, Sony would recruit from the outside the talent they  couldn't grow inside. They arranged for me to spend a day with the key managers  of Japan's top personnel placement company, which was growing at a  2,000%-a-year clip in 1982.  </P> <P> Make no mistake, "ostracism" for being "different" is still common in the  ferociously competitive internal environment of Japanese firms. The logic is  that you grab at anything to get ahead of your internal competition. A friend  of mine at Sony wore a mustache at great personal risk, and he opined that his  dream was to spend more time in the company of his wife, playing cards and  helping out with the children's education. He was clearly under pressure to  conform, but no more so than, say, the pressure that existed for wearing a  non-white shirt at 1960 IBM.  </P> <P> Even today, IBMers get ahead by conforming to the competitive rules of internal  culture. But should we criticize IBM for lacking "humanistic values?" No. We  should praise IBM for creating jobs and providing leadership. By definition,  the individual within a corporation makes sacrifices for the common good.  Corporations survive because of it. And today, frankly, the under-30 cohort at  Sony will talk openly of jumping ship, seeing that the organizational pyramid  has flattened across the globe. They are beginning to focus their formidable  talent and energy on entrepreneurial opportunities.  </P> <P> So the lesson and challenge to enterprises is that you "ostracize"  non-traditional behaviors only if you can afford to lose talent to the growing  opportunities outside the company.  </P> <P> Sony was not a worker's paradise, but the net effects of the Sony system are  worth studying and understanding. For example, Sony had a fairly far-reaching  "welfare" function within its personnel department. Sony employees got  allowances for housing, food, transportation, having children and other needs,  as well as health care, retirement funds and an aggressive continuing education  program.  </P> <P> Where did the money come from to pay for these? From the sacrifices of the  individuals to a pool of collective capital, such that the company also had the  financial strength to withstand cyclic downturns, design failures, supplier or  customer collapses. Sony worldwide takes great financial hits to avoid laying  off people by moving, reassigning, retraining. Nobody mandated or legislated  these policies; the company built them on the collective assent and sacrifices  of its people.  </P> <P> I take exception to Gary's conclusion that if you're not Japanese, you're out.  Certainly the "glass ceiling" for non-Japanese has existed in Japanese  companies as it existed for non-Americans in U.S. companies 30 years ago, but  as in the United States, it's proving fast to be a short-sighted policy.  </P> <P> Sony has taken more risks in the United States and Europe than any Japanese  company at bringing non-Japanese into key positions. The recent acquisitions of  CBS Records and Columbia Pictures were the results of Americans with long  tenure and unimpeachable position in Sony America. They earned both real power  and real enemies within Sony headquarters in Japan.  </P> <P> Other Japanese companies that take fewer risks look enviously to Sony's  successes (and failures) at localizing their top management. Globally, the  caldron of change and power transfer is churning rapidly, such that those who  will not adapt are in for trouble, whereas the flexible adaptive enterprise --  of whatever nation of origin -- will inherit the future.  </P></p>

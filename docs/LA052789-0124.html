			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG AT HEART;  </P> <P> FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD LITTLE LEAGUER WITH CEREBRAL PALSY REINSTATED AFTER OUTCRY  </P> <P> A 15-year-old Little League baseball player with cerebral palsy, who had been  kicked off the team for violating an age rule, was reinstated Friday after the  organization's national office intervened.  </P> <P> "I think Little League baseball's for kids, and these adults just have to ruin  the fun of it," said Judi Church, before it was decided that her son, Tucker,  would be allowed to play in the Sharpstown Little League Pirates' last game of  the season.  </P> <P> Tucker, who weighs just 56 pounds, was kicked off the team and his coach was  forced to resign this week when another team competing for the same playoff  spot complained about the player's presence on a team for 9- to 12-year-olds.  </P> <P> Coach Scott Davis said when he saw the 4-foot-9 youngster try out for the 13-  to 15-year-old team, he knew he would not be able to make the cut. So Davis put  him on the Pirates, a team composed of 9 to 12-year-olds.  </P> <P> "I knew the age rule, but in my heart I just couldn't see this kid not playing  baseball," Davis said. "He loves it so much."  </P> <P> After league officials forced Tucker and Davis off the team, the Little League  national office in Williamsport, Pa., was flooded with calls about the matter  Friday. Officials there ruled Tucker could play if he presented a doctor's note  that said he would be safer playing on the team of younger boys.  </P> <P> Tucker had such a letter but did not want to play because Davis was not going  to be allowed to coach. Then, Sharpstown Little League president Lercy  Simoneaux reinstated Davis.  </P> <P> In the third inning, Tucker entered the lineup and struck out on five pitches.  </P> <P> "I swung as hard as I could," Tucker said. who hits .167 and falls often. "I  don't know what he threw me. I'm not sure I saw it."  </P> <P> Tucker's team lost, 13-4. His teammates carried him off the field.  </P> <P> "They wanted to know what we were doing to this poor kid, so I called the Texas  state office and said we have to make this right," said Joe Losch, assistant to  the president of Little League baseball.  </P> <P> Little League district administrator Paul Goolsby received a complaint from  another team competing for the same playoff spot and on Wednesday night threw  Tucker off the team for violating the age rule. He also asked for Davis to  resign as coach and indicated he wanted Davis banned from further coaching.  </P> <P> "I knowingly broke their rules so I resigned right away," Davis said Thursday.  "But what this is really about is adults who cared too much about winning."  </P></p>

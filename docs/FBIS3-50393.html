			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The political department of the Defense Ministry of  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna has issued a statement in  response to a letter to UN Security Council Chairman Karel  Kovanda by Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, in which he  accused the Republic of Croatia of allegedly sending its regular  units to take part in military actions in the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Silajdzic's letter is completely unfounded,  and it is yet another attempt to turn the attention of the  international public away from the true problem, which is the  Muslim army's continued aggression against the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims' persistence in continuing  the war. This is the gist of the statement.    We declare that there are no regular units of the Croatian  Army in the territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and  that the political leadership of Herceg-Bosna has never asked  the Croatian Army and leaders to send Croatian Army units to  Herceg-Bosna.    It is true that the authorities of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna have sent a call-up to all able-bodied citizens of  Bosnia-Herzegovina of Croat nationality -- including members of  the Croatian Army born in Bosnia-Herzegovina who volunteered for  the Croatian Army at the beginning of the aggression against  Croatia -- to join HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units in the  defense of their people and their historic areas. Before  joining HVO units, all volunteers from the Croatian Army born in  Bosnia-Herzegovina were demobilized from the Croatian Army; that  is, they left its ranks. The truth is only that HVO units are  much better manned due to a good turnout of citizens of  Bosnia-Herzegovina of Croat nationality who stayed in Croatia,  the statement says.</p>

			<p>SOCIAL           PROBLEMS, NO. 3      This is the third in a series of media notes based on the SALAM  newspaper column "Hello, SALAM," which explores further the social  problems perceived to be facing the Iranian public.  Some of the  issues and complaints discussed, purportedly called in by individual  Iranian citizens and often drawing comments by the paper, are:  unemployment, differences between the Majles and the Voice and  Vision, the disparity between social classes, the rising dollar,  late payment of salaries, the high cost of living, medications  shortages, high taxes and lawyers' fees.  The samples of the column  published below are translated in full.      On Unemployment      Caller:  I am a veteran who spent 15 months at the front.  I have  been unemployed since 1988.  Wherever I go, the answer is negative.  I even referred to the President's office.  They told me:  "If there  is work and a job is not given to you, we will investigate, but if  there is no work, it is the problem of society."  Who is supposed to  solve this problem?  What are we supposed to do if unemployed youths  find themselves dragged into illicit activities.?     SALAM:   This is the second time we have published this message.  This caller should send his resume in to us because a benefactor  plans to assist him.  (SALAM, 23 Nov)      On Poverty      Caller:  A few days ago, at a traffic light on a crowded Tehran  street, two grown girls along with their mother were asking with  great insistance for money from passing drivers.  I spoke with one  of the girls.  She said she was twelve and that one hour earlier a  passenger in a car had called her an obscene name.  When she  protested, the driver got out of his  car, grabbed her hand and  tried to force her into his car to take her to the police station.  Finally, with a great deal of difficulty, the mother, the girl, and  other people succeeded in freeing her.  When I spoke to the mother,  she told me that her husband had been bedridden for the last two  years.  First, herself, and later, one by one, her daughters have  been forced into begging to fight the ever increasing cost of  living.  (SALAM, 23 Nov)      On Prisoners' Access to Press      Caller:  Now that Mr. 'Abdi's (SALAM's arrested editor-in chief)  trial is to convene, after his being in detention for 90 days, has  he been kept informed of news?  For example, does he receive SALAM  and is he aware of everyday happenings?     SALAM:   It is highly unlikely that he has had access to radio or  press, but it appears that he has access to books.  (SALAM, 24 Nov)      On Differences Between Majles and Voice and Vision     Caller:  I am very sorry about the differences that have come  about between the Majles and the Voice and Vision because this will  strike a blow to Islam and the well-being of the system.  This will  cause the enemies of Islam to take advantage of this situation and  create division.     SALAM:   Not all disagreements are bad.  Inquiries and  investigations are among the rights of the Majles.  If we were to  adopt the logic of this caller, then we would have to say that the  Majles should not perform inquiries and investigations because of  the potential for causing divisions.  Answering inquiries and doing  investigations are also within the rights of the Voice and Vision,  but not the way it proceeded.  The platform it assumed was improper.  Voice and Vision had to answer queries either to the Majles or the  judiciary.  (SALAM, 25 Nov)      On Restraining Anti-American Demonstrations      Caller:  Interior Minister Besharati promised to list the reasons  for preventing anti American demonstrations by students.  He seems  to have forgotten his promise; and you don't pursue it anymore  either.     SALAM:   The Rasht deputy questioned him regarding this matter,  which will be discussed and addressed soon in the Majles.  Will it  be answered satisfactorily?  We'll have to wait and see.  (SALAM, 27  Nov)      On Disparity Between Social Classes      Caller:  I am a student in the north of the city.  Our house is  in the city's south.  When I return from the university, see the  poverty of the people and compare it to the wealth in the north  where people travel in cars, millions of them, I lose heart.  When I  hear my classmate say that his uncle owns several factories, that he  earns several million tomans a month and that he has capital  amounting to several billion tomans, my heart bleeds.  And, now even  the dollar is worth 200 tomans.  Isn't there anyone who can get to  the root of this inflation and fix it.  (SALAM, 27 Nov)      On the Rising Dollar      Caller:  Regarding the rise of the dollar and the falling rial, I  want to know what the banks are doing about fixed investments, which  lose their rial value every day.  Do the banks guarantee the value  of these deposits or not?  With the steady increase in the value of  the dollar and the sharp fall of the rial, will depositors be given  worthless paper at maturity or some money?  (SALAM, 27 Nov)      On Late Salaries      Caller:  I work for the metro system.  Every month our salaries  are late by 10-15 days.  Please have the (authorities) look into  this.  We are renters and have children in school.  They should at  least let us know that they will be paying us every two months, so  we can plan.  (SALAM, 30 Nov.)      On the High Cost of Living      Caller:  I  recently bought two packages of meat from the Molla  Sadra (Meatpackers) Organization.  They weighed about 2.800 grams.  Each package had about 700-800 grams of pure fat and the meat was  not good quality either.  I figured that this meat, which should  have sold for 440 tomans, in reality cost 600 tomans.  Are the  officials in charge of the Neat Organization aware of the situation?  I'm curious if this is the result of actions by the employees or of  the government's policy.      SALAM:   This type of thing is not related to government policy.  However, it might be that the Meat Organization will have to  supervise the packaging process.  (SALAM 27 Nov)      Caller:  I am calling from Khorramabad and work in the office of  communication.  On Wednesday one of our customers came to complain  about his bill.  We verified it and told him that the bill was  correct and he should pay it.  When he was leaving, he asked:  "What  am I supposed to do, now?"  We told him to pay it.  "He said that my  problem is something else.  I am a civil servant and earn 15,000  tomans.  The telephone bill is 4,800,  the water bill is 6,000 and  the electric bill is 2,800 for a total of 13,600.  Only 1,400 tomans  are left.  I have three children and rent to pay.  Why don't you  budget your charges so that I can know how to continue my life."  would like you to publish this so that the public will become more  sensitive to our problems.  (SALAM, 2 Dec.)      On Shortage of Medications      Caller:  One cannot find any aspirin in this country.  How does  the Health Minister justify this?     SALAM:   The aspirin shortage is real.  Officials admit to its  shortage and that of many other medications.  These shortages are  simply the effect.  The real cause is the financial difficulties  that have prevented pharmaceutical companies from producing  medicines.  The president declared in recent weeks that these  companies will receive financial assistance.  We have no information  about how this promise will be kept, but many commonly needed  medications are available.  (SALAM, 28 Nov)      On Taxes      Caller:  Aren't taxes collected by the government to provide  comfort and service to the public?  What is the reason for the  excessive increase in taxes, such as the ones on water and  electricity.  The taxes are far greater than what we can pay.  And,  has the government provided any services in exchange for collecting  these huge taxes to satisfy the nation?  Furthermore, are these  taxes collected only to solve the government's problems or should  they also solve the nation's?  (SALAM, 5 Dec.)      On Exorbitant Lawyers' Fees      Caller:  I have a question from the Judicial Branch.  Hasn't the  Judicial Branch set the fees that lawyers charge their clients?  If  the Judicial Branch has set these fees, why are they so high?  And,  if it has not, why don't they control them.  They are exorbitant.  Lawyers should be fair.  I hope that the Judicial Branch will set  its own equitable rate so that everyone who needs a lawyer can hire  one.  (There were two complaints  of this type.)  (SALAM, 5 Dec.)      (QUESTION AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, PERSIAN GULF/  SOUTH ASIA BRANCH AT (703) 733-6518)   ENEAG/07 Feb/POLCHF/ECONF/NEASA Division/SDJ 07/1933Z FEB</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (21): Rush to pass the parcel - 'Reverse deliveries' directive / The pressure is on the distribution industry to help solve the problems of packaging waste management The European Commission's plans to reduce waste are going to have a wide-ranging impact on transport and packaging companies in all member countries, and as a result on exporters. In a proposed directive earlier this year on packaging and packaging waste, the Commission said it would like 90 per cent of packaging removed from the waste stream, and of that 90 per cent, 60 per cent to be recycled, 30 per cent to be incinerated and 10 per cent to be used for landfill. At its simplest, the directive aims to reduce the amount of waste packaging disposed of, by requiring member-states to implement national schemes to achieve specified recycling and recovery targets. The four principal provisions of the directive are: Member-states will have to establish return and management systems for waste packaging disposed of by a consumer or final user. Adoption of a marking and coding system to be displayed on packaging signifying its acceptability for recovery, re-use and recycling. Harmonisation of standards for the design and construction of packaging intended to be recycled or recovered. (Various national standards will be considered equivalent initially, but, eventually, a series of European standards will be devised by the Commission). Member-states will have to set up harmonised national databases of packaging data for the monitoring of targets, and the reporting of progress towards their achievement. The precise terms of the directive will not be known until later this autumn. The European Parliament disagreed with some of the proposals and called for a number of amendments which the Commission has refused to accept. Because of this deadlock a conciliation committee was asked to advise on possible amendments before the directive went to the Council of Ministers. Some concern is being expressed, however, over where responsibility will lie and what the ramifications might be, not just for the transport and packaging industries but for the retail trade as a whole. Ultimately, the directive is likely to bring the costs of packaging, recycling and recovery within the overall costs of distribution. This, in turn, will prompt users to review the type and quantity of packaging being used so as to minimise those costs. Already distributors of retail goods are exploring ways of substituting intermediate levels of packaging with re-usable display pallets and are assessing the suitability of standard outer packaging for transport. According to Andy Robson, director of the UK Institute of Grocery Distribution, the big retailers have been recycling secondary packaging for many years - 'most have it taken to central warehouses, from where it is removed on a contract basis. The new directive will simply be an extension of that movement.' However, at this stage, the Freight Transport Association would like to see clarification of who is going to be responsible for the handling of waste packaging. 'Experience from the functioning of the German packaging regulations (widely known as the Green Dot system because of the mark put on packaging to show it is recyclable) suggests that road transport operators delivering goods to commercial or private customers may be burdened with the task of removing packaging waste and transporting it to a suitable recycling point.' This practice is commonly known as reverse deliveries or, reverse logistics, and, for carriers, it is at the heart of the matter. Brian Bolam, managing director of TNT Contract Logistics (Europe) is quite clear about the onus of responsibility. 'The burden is on the originator,' he says. Transport companies' main concern, however, is that some of their clients might make the placing of their business dependent on the carrier's agreeing to handle waste, thus reducing the carriers' profitability. The Freight Transport Association is also worried about the market for recovered packaging, which it claims could seriously affect the viability of the UK national recycling scheme unless genuine demand for recovered materials can be found. 'This needs to be resolved so that transport operators delivering goods are not left holding the baby due to the collapse of suitable outlets,' says the FTA. A similar point is made by Michael Brown, professor of transport at the University of Westminster, in London. He says the German legislation led to mountains of material for recycling. A similar Europe-wide scheme could affect the entire packaging market, he believes. It is not just that demand for new packaging would decline and plenty of recycled packaging become available, but that industry's aim would be to use less packaging as a whole. There would also be technical challenges. While steel, aluminium, paper and glass are technically easy to recycle, plastics pose difficulties. Prof Brown says some see the nub of the problem simply as the fact that there is just too much packaging. Others argue that, if packaging is minimised, products might suffer - food could be tainted or products break in transit. The questions surrounding the directive may, however, be more fundamental. Dr David Guest, operations director at UK-based PIRA, an independent technology organisation for the packaging, paper, printing and publishing industries, says the key question is whether the directive will it be implemented. He sees two main problems. Firstly, some EU members, principally Germany and Belgium, do not consider the directive's proposals to be as strong as their own national legislation. Secondly, some other countries are concerned about the costs involved.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Press Review SAUDI ARABIA If Saudi newspapers reflect official policy, Israel would be wise not to begin counting its diplomatic and economic chickens in the Middle East before the outline peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation is well and truly hatched. Whatever progress Israel may have made on softening a formerly hostile media in other parts of the world, for journalists in Saudi Arabia it remains a subject ripe for plucking. The visit to Washington last week by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was a chance not to be missed. 'Peace dividends or fruits of aggression?' was the rhetorical question posed on the opinion page of the daily Arab News. 'Jewish leaders are making use of the (PLO) agreement to rob the world powers and force them to respond blindly to their demands', it maintained of Mr Rabin's talks with President Bill Clinton. Elsewhere editorial writers contrasted what they saw as the urgent need for financial help in the Palestinian territories, with 'American taxpayers' money showering down on Israel with hardly any restraint.' They professed amazement 'at how far the US is bending over backwards to try to please the Israelis'. Why they should be amazed is more difficult to guage when Saturday's leader column in the Saudi Gazette explained that the US is prone to 'occasional fits of madness'. It mattered not to the writer that the US galloped to the rescue when Iraq invaded Kuwait, presumably in one of its saner moments. What so upset him was the US and the UN 'tightening the noose of sanctions around Libya's neck' and trying to impose some sort of 'biblical justice' on an Arab people at a time when genocide was continuing against the Moslems of Bosnia. For the record: Saudi Arabia officially supports the Israeli-PLO peace process and is closely allied to the US; it is disgusted with the response of the US and the Europeans to events in former Yugoslavia; and local newspapers do not get much opportunity for expressing strong opinions on events closer to home. NIGERIA General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's new military leader, can expect a rough ride from the local press, even though his first action was to allow some national dailies banned since last July back on the streets. If the state of a country's press were the only yardstick, democracy would seem to be flourishing in Nigeria. Few countries in Africa can boast such an array of newspapers - over a dozen on sale each day in Lagos, and at least a dozen more available in the rest of the country. It takes more than a coup to inhibit editors who have had to work under military governments for more than 20 of the 30 years since independence. Not surprisingly, Gen Abacha's removal of Chief Ernest Shonekan, civilian head of a military-backed government, pushed the clamour against a seven-fold increase in fuel prices off the front pages. 'Shonekan resigns, Abacha takes over government' ran the Guardian's headline on Thursday, before the full impact of the action by the military to oust Mr Shonekan had become clear. By Saturday the impact of Gen Abacha's abolition of all elected civilian bodies was sinking in. The Guardian, the most respected independent daily in Nigeria, also reported the first foreign reaction. Under the heading 'Britain deplores change', it quoted foreign secretary Douglas Hurd's condemnation of military rule. ITALY With such headlines as 'The War of the Mayors' and 'Mayors of the new Italy', the outcome of municipal elections dominated the Italian press last week, pushing aside the endless flow of corruption revelations. La Repubblica summed up the political battle by saying: 'Occhetto versus Bossi and Fini, Martinazzoli risks his job.' Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the formerly communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) is attempting to demonstrate that the Italian left at last is a credible contender for national government. To do this, the PDS no longer has to beat its historic rival, the Christian Democrats, but rather the protest vote on the right of Mr Umberto Bossi's populist northern League and the neo-fascist MSI of Mr Gianfranco Fini. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, according to Le Repubblica, risks losing the leadership of the Christian Democrats if the party performs poorly - as all the papers predict. Corriere della Serra yesterday observed that the Christian Democrats were relying on the 'Truman effect' - a reference to the US president's surprise victory in 1948. Corriere's chief cartoonist sets the scene with the unseasonal cold weather. Headlined 'The forecast', the cartoon shows Mr Bossi pushing a snowball down from the icy north towards central Italy which in turn is receiving the cold wind of the right (a reference to the strong right-wing protest vote expected in Rome), and Mr Martinazzoli under an umbrella in the south. The one piece of good news agreed by all was Italy's success in securing a place in the World Cup. IRELAND It was soccer too which drew the biggest headlines in the Irish Republic's press, overshadowing London's and Dublin's latest peace efforts for Northern Ireland. The World Cup qualifying round between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland last Wednesday was played at Belfast's Windsor Park in front of an almost exclusively, and very hostile, Protestant crowd. The one-all draw was sufficient for the Republic to qualify, but more important for the political columnists, the match provided a handy juxtaposition for them to score their own points. As one in the Irish Times wrote, the match 'may have done more than acres of print and yards of film to give outsiders a whiff of the poisoned gas of communal conflict'. More sportingly, Fintan O'Toole, also of the Irish Times, who described how out of consideration for his physical integrity he spent the match pretending he was a Protestant, had an upbeat view of the result. It produced, he said, 'something it's hard to see in Belfast - triumph without victory, joy for one side without defeat for the other, pride at nobody's expense, a game in which everybody has won'. The Irish government must have thought it had scored an own goal last Friday, when it discovered its negotiating position revealed in full detail in the Irish Press daily paper. Who leaked the story? Some papers pointed to an emerging conflict within the Labour-Fianna Fail coalition. Expectations are high for a positive outcome to the political final - the Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin next month, but the commentators are preparing their readers for what might be an inconclusive draw on home ground.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone advances Mobile telecoms group Vodafone was the best performing stock in the sector as it revealed new connections for July and also announced a new overseas venture. The shares jumped 14 to 485p in good turnover of 5.3m. Market whispers that the group was being eyed by AT&amp;T, the US company, were dismissed by analysts. Last week, similar gossip had earmarked Cable and Wireless for the same treatment. C&amp;W shares climbed 5 to 816p. Vodafone said gross new connections for July totalled 31,724, taking the overall total to neary 1m users. The company also said it had set up a joint venture with Fiji Posts and Telecoms, the state-owned operator, to build and operate a cellular telephone network. A further slide in the price of Brent crude held back some oil stocks, with Enterprise slipping 4 to 450p and Lasmo softening 2 to 134p. The fallout in Lloyds Bank shares continued yesterday as a number of analysts lowered forecasts following a disappointing meeting with the company. Credit Lyonnais Laing cut its 1994 forecast by 20 per cent to Pounds 1bn and NatWest Securities pared its more gloomy estimate of Pounds 960m to Pounds 900m. NatWest also cut its figure for the year to 1995 by Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn. Lloyds fell 11 1/2 to 539p xd. The prospect of further stimulus to any consumer recovery saw food retail and stores sectors record two of the best performances of the session. Among food retailers, Argyll rose 9 to 328p, Iceland Group 4 to 220p, Kwik Save 18 to 683p, J. Sainsbury 12 to 487p and Tesco 6 to 213 1/2 p. Food manufacturing stocks also caught the positive mood, among which Unigate put on 6 at 370p, United Biscuits 6 at 380p and Booker 10 at 411p. In stores, Boots moved forward 8 to 457p, GUS 'A' 18 to 2000p and Next 5 1/2 to 191 1/2 p. An initial strong burst in the leisure sector on interest rate hopes faded late in the day, but most stocks stayed in positive territory. Main beneficiaries were the tour operators, where Airtours rose 12 to 376p and Owners Abroad 5 to 67p. Forte lost 2 to 214p as dealers spoke of a line of stock overhanging, while a big buyer helped Friendly Hotels appreciate 8 to 210p. There was no further news over the identity of potential suitors for Spring Ram, the troubled bathroom products group, but the weekend speculation, confirmed by the company yesterday, sent the shares shooting forward. They closed 15 ahead at 69p. The company emphasised that negotiations were of a 'preliminary nature'. Yield considerations continued to buoy selected electricity and water issues. Among the Recs, Eastern moved ahead 15 to 516p, Manweb 9 to 557p and Southern 14 to 524p. In waters, Anglian was 8 dearer at 502p and South West finished 14 stronger at 530p. Motor group BBA rose 9 to 176p in spite of a cautious annual statement as the market concentrated on a jump in profits to Pounds 50.3m. Under the limelight in the textile sector was William Baird, which registered an advance of 7 to 255p on news of the disposal of part of its engineering business. The group's refocus on its core businesses has led BZW to change its recommendation on the stock from hold to buy. According to Ms Julia Blake at BZW, the shares have been oversold and are still undervalued. Another active stock was Coats Viyella, a main supplier of fabrics and soft furnishings to Marks and Spencer. Its shares touched 245p before settling 5 up at 244p after volume of 2.8m. Courtaulds Textiles advanced 13 to 558p on a strong recovery after a period of weakness, while shares in clothing manufacturer SR Gent were pushed up 8 to 68p by overseas investors. Ms Blake said the market was short of stock and that buying interest had built up after some weeks of market depression. In the publishing sector, United Newspapers, which has a high yield of more than 5 per cent, gained 12 at 544p on market expectations of overall interest rate cuts throughout Europe, where half of the group's advertising revenue is generated. Regional press group Home Counties Newspapers bounced 15 to 119p following recent weakness. Property shares were perky, with good gains being seen across the board. British Land climbed 9 to 360p and Land Securities 6 to 634p, with Smith New Court said to be recommending the stocks. Great Portland Estates firmed 5 1/2 to 193p and Hammerson 'A' 4 to 331p.</p>

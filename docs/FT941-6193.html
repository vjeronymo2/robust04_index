			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Bosnian accord could destroy itself Never before has one agreement, for one part of Bosnia, held out so much hope for extending peace throughout the republic. But never before has such an agreement contained the seeds of its own destruction. Such is the nature of the complex accord forged by Washington and signed on Tuesday between Bosnia's Croats, Bosnia's Moslems and the Croatian government. The preliminary agreement, which envisages the creation of cantons carved out of territories held by the Bosnian Croat and Bosnian government forces, is divided into two parts: the establishment of a federation in one part of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and the creation of a confederation between the republic of Croatia and that federation. The federation, which still requires agreement on the maps for the size and distribution of the cantons, comprises: a central government underpinned by a bi-cameral legislature. The house of representatives would be democratically elected on a proportional basis; the house of peoples would have an equal number of Croats and Bosnians. a legislature which would elect the president and vice-president, each of whom would come from separate communities and serve for alternate one-year terms over a four-year period. a government in which no deputy minister could belong to the same ethic background as the minister. As part of the agreement, all refugees will have the right to return freely and will be compensated for any damaged property. The more sensitive part of the agreements rests in the relationship between the federation and the confederation with Croatia. In principle, Croatia is not supposed to change its borders, thus preventing it from annexing territories gained during the war. Instead, the confederation and the federation will establish a common market for the free movement of goods, a customs union, a monetary union and defence arrangements. These will be agreed by a confederative council formed of equal numbers of Bosnian Croats, Moslems and Croats. UN and US officials yesterday said President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, still hankering after a Greater Croatia, will be put under pressure to accept the plan through threats of sanctions and promises of economic assistance. Lord Owen, who heads the Geneva peace negotiations, insisted the agreement was not aimed at isolating Serbia. 'A final accord will always need agreement between the three parties.' However, US officials, playing a pivotal role in the peace process, like the Russians, realise Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, will be loath to join the central federal government of Bosnian Croats and Moslems. 'Karadzic should not take the view that his self-styled Serb autonomous republics will be recognised by the outside world, or indeed join with Serbia proper. These territories will remain in limbo unless Belgrade is prepared to negotiate an overall settlement for Bosnia - and for Croatia,' a US diplomat said. Herein lies the self-destructive element of yesterday's accord. Any lasting peace in Bosnia will require the Bosnian Serbs to give up the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia, or else cede other territory to the Moslems in order to hold on to eastern Bosnia. But the Moslems, now supported by the US, might use the federal plan to secure peace in western Bosnia, and then launch a spring offensive to regain their territories in the east. That would tear Tuesday's accord to shreds. More crucially, the success of the accord rests on Croatia and Serbia reaching agreement over Serb-held territories, particularly around Knin, south-west Croatia, and in the Baranja, eastern Croatia. 'There will be no lasting peace until Zagreb and Belgrade make their own peace,' a senior UN official involved in the Geneva negotiations said. With the US putting pressure on Croatia and the Moslems, the ball is in Mr Milosevic's court, and Russia's too.</p>

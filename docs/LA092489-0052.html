			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TASTE OF TRAVEL: SAMPLING THE LITTLE JOYS OF AUSTRIAN HOME WINES  </P> <P> "This is a two-girl wine," the mayor of Gumpoldskirchen, Austria, was saying,  as we sipped a crisp little Gruner Veltliner.  </P> <P> What the mayor meant was that the wine we were sampling was so exceptional that  it would attract two girls, rather than just the usual allotment of one. No  doubt about it, the two-girl wine was a wine of distinction.  </P> <P> But this was a drink for a moderately serious occasion, as the wine tasting the  mayor was hosting had turned out to be. Under ordinary circumstances, the  entertainment would have seemed extraordinary, but the October day was  beckoning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clean, Herbed Air  </P> <P> And we were missing the best reason for wandering the vineyards: to smell the  clean, herbed air; to see the countryside dappled with the weakening fall sun  and to sip the spritzy, raw new wine of the harvest while laughing with friends  and snacking at a table littered with cold roast goose, smoked ham, salami,  cheese, freshly baked bread and salad.  </P> <P> As the day slipped into late afternoon and the sun struggled for survival, we  tasted the fruit and the joys of the earth.  </P> <P> And they were excellent.  </P> <P> We had been lured to this heurigen, a private wine tavern standing guard over  vineyards, by a leafy garland hanging above the door. At harvest time, usually  for a few weeks in October, the green boughs signal the arrival of the new  wine. The adjective heurig means, literally, "of this year."  </P> <P> Similar to the celebrated fall arrival of Nouveau Boujolais, enjoying the new  Austrian wine has more to do with participation in an event than with exquisite  flavor. It is a tradition begun in 1784 when Emperor Joseph II ruled that  vintners in suburban Vienna could sell their own wine on their doorsteps.  </P> <P> The rustic taverns are furnished with wooden benches and long tables. Often  there is a fireplace and a garden in which to spend a sunny day. Sometimes  there are a few musicians playing the accordion, the violin, the guitar, the  zither. Sometimes there is singing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blend of Countries  </P> <P> The self-service buffet food is simple and delightful, a blend of the  countries, such as Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia and parts of  northern Italy that were once united under the Austrio-Hungarian Empire and  contribute to Austrian cuisine. The wine is usually drunk courageously from  quarter liter mugs.  </P> <P> In the evenings the taverns fill with Viennese searching for a spot free of  tourists in which to sample a light evening supper. This light refreshment  follows a day of as many as six meals and snacks, including a large midday meal  and some of the best pastry in the world. The Viennese like to eat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Complex Menus  </P> <P> In the city of Vienna, modern heurigen look-alikes are open year round and some  offer complex menus. But by law, the traditional heurigen has a limited menu.  It is open only for a few short weeks in the fall until the wine fermented from  the previous harvest runs out.  </P> <P> The traditional taverns lie on the outskirts of Vienna in the vineyards that  surround the city. By rental car, a 30-minute drive south will take you to  Gumpoldskirchen in Lower Austria. A few tours also visit the wine regions.  </P> <P> For details, call or visit the Vienna Tourist Board next to the State Opera,  Karntner Strasse 38, 43-59-74 (or from the United States, precede the number  with 011-43-1). Some tours also may be booked out of major hotels.  </P> <P> You need only drop by for a snack. Or you can spend the afternoon basking in  the sun and conversation.  </P> <P> Recreating the heurigen experience at home is not easy, because the wine and  Austrian location are essential. But to duplicate a sense of the event, set up  a picnic serving any new white wine or sparkling apple juice with assorted cold  cuts and cheese, fresh rye bread with caraway seed and an assortment of cold  salads such as the one that follows. It's perhaps best if you can take your  picnic to Austria. But should that prove difficult, a back-yard picnic table is  a reasonable substitute. Just don't forget to serve the wine in mugs.  </P> <P> COLD RED CABBAGE WITH APPLE  </P> <P> 1 large, tart apple, peeled and shredded  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/2 head red cabbage, shredded  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar  </P> <P> 4 tablespoons frozen apple juice concentrate, defrosted  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> In medium bowl, combine shredded apple with lemon juice and toss. Add cabbage.  In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, apple juice concentrate, oil and caraway  seed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss with cabbage. Makes about 6  servings.  </P></p>

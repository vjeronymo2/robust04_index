			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Misys advances 19% to Pounds 8m A continued advance of software sales and recurring revenues helped Misys, the computer services group, lift interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.76m to Pounds 8.01m. The 19 per cent improvement for the six months to November 30 was achieved on turnover which grew to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 41.1m) helped by a Pounds 407,000 contribution from acquisitions. The modest increase in turnover disguised the beneficial change in the mix of sales with the growth of software sales and recurring revenues more than offsetting the decline in lower-margin hardware sales. Earnings per share increased by 20 per cent to 14.3p (11.9p) and the interim dividend is lifted by 15 per cent to 3p (2.61p). Although the results were broadly in line with market expectations, the shares closed 11p lower at 537p. At the operating level the improved mix of revenues coupled with the benefits of the reorganisation put in place at the end of the last financial year resulted in a 23 per cent increase in profits before group charges. The advance was underpinned by the expanded financial services division which now contributes over 50 per cent of group operating profits. The Countrywide businesses acquired in mid-1992 performed particularly well assisted by pressure for the consolidation of business within the independent insurance broking sector. Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, said that Misys' financial services division continued to increase its market share in the life insurance sector. Overall, the division lifted its profits to Pounds 4.79m (Pounds 4.03m) on turnover of Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 11.2m) despite higher research and development expenditure. Within the systems division Mr Lomax said the computer services operations continued to make a valuable, but slightly reduced, contribution to group profits. COMMENT The chairman's comments about the lack of clear signs of a sustained upturn in capital spending may have contributed to the share price slippage yesterday. But even allowing for the cautious outlook, Misys looks like an undervalued high quality technology stock with a solid balance sheet, good management and an up-to-date product portfolio. Pre-tax profits should reach at least Pounds 18.6m this year producing earnings of 32.3p. On that basis the shares are trading on a relatively modest prospective p/e of 16.6.</p>

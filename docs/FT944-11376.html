			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Agencies set up travel brand More than 600 independent travel agents are today adopting a common brand, making them the UK's biggest grouping of travel retailers after Lunn Poly. The retailers, all members of the National Association of Independent Travel Agents, will display the brand Advantage Travel Centres alongside their existing names. The move follows concern among smaller companies about the growth of big travel retailers and their links with leading tour operators. The two biggest travel retailers, Lunn Poly and Going Places, are owned by the two leading tour operators, Thomson and Airtours respectively. Lunn Poly has 742 shops and Going Places has 562. The Office of Fair Trading said in August that the links between big tour operators and travel agents did not restrict consumer choice or prevent smaller companies from selling holidays. But small travel agency companies have continued to argue that it is difficult for them to match the advertising budgets of big companies. They have also said big tour operators have supported their affiliated travel agents during discount campaigns, when retailers forfeit their commission. Independents have found it difficult to match these discounts.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Disappointment with Bundesbank erodes European gains THE BUNDESBANK yesterday disappointed investors hoping for an early cut in German money market interest rates, in the process erasing some of the gains recorded by most European bond markets on Monday. After weekend comments interpreted as signalling a rate cut this week, investors had been looking for a significant reduction in the German repurchase agreement (or repo) rate. However, the Bundesbank returned to a fixed-rate offer yesterday, from the variable rate tenders it has held for most of this year, fixing the rate at 8.49 per cent. This was just one basis point below the last variable rate repo, falling far short of market hopes of a 10 or even 20 basis point cut. German bonds retraced some of their gains of recent days, with the yield on 10-year bunds rising to 6.68 per cent. This was seen as a minor set-back given the strength of the market's rally, however. The outcome of the repo tender was taken as a sign that the Bundesbank would not lower its official interest rates at its council meeting this week, though most commentators still expect such cuts in the near future, once the terms of the solidarity pact with the eastern German regions has been completed. WHILE most European markets followed Germany down, French bonds remained firm yesterday. This was despite confirmation of this week's 10-year year bond auction, and the looming French elections. Ten-year OATs rose on the day, closing the yield spread over German bunds to around 80 basis points, sharply lower than the 90 basis points on Monday. 'It certainly looks unsustainable at that level,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, an analyst at Warburg Securities in London. UK government bonds remained flat yesterday in lacklustre trade. The tap stock announced on Monday hung over longer-dated bonds, putting a ceiling on any price rises, while short-dated paper was subdued after comments from the Governor of the Bank of England dampening hopes of an interest rate cut. US TREASURY prices were virtually unchanged in the wake of mixed economic data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 103 19/32 , yielding 6.836 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.841 per cent. Prices were firmer overnight on foreign markets, especially along the middle of the yield curve, but slipped back from their highs when trading in New York opened. Traders blamed the modest selling on the news that US leading economic indicators gained 0.1 per cent in January. Analysts had been expecting the indicators to register a small decline. Sentiment and prices, however, were buoyed by a sharp drop in January new home sales, which plunged 13.8 per cent during the month, although the housing figures were offset later in the day by news of strong late January store sales from the Johnson Redbook service.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> 11 Innocent Plea in Alleged Fraud Scheme: Eleven people, including two Orange  County residents, pleaded not guilty in Seattle federal court Friday in  connection with an alleged $25-million fraud against the nation's banks and  thrifts operated out of a San Clemente office building. The scheme's alleged  mastermind -- Capistrano Beach resident Douglas P. Blankenship -- is in the  process of being extradited to Seattle and is expected to be arraigned next  week. The case is being prosecuted in Washington state because the scheme's  largest victim -- Puget Sound National Bank -- is headquartered there.  </P></p>

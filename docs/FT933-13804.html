			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Chancellor warns Tory sceptics on cliffhanger treaty vote THE CABINET yesterday raised the temperature in its battle with Conservative Euro-sceptics over the Maastricht treaty, with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, delivering a sharp rebuke to anyone threatening to vote with the opposition in next week's crucial House of Commons vote on the social chapter. As Lord Rees-Mogg announced he would seek to open another front against ratification of the treaty by seeking a judicial review in the High Court, Mr John Major, the prime minister, again expressed confidence that the government would win the vote on Thursday. He insisted that any question of his resignation was 'merely hypothetical'. An attempt to point the way beyond Maastricht wrangling came from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who set out the positive vision through which the Conservatives could win back people's confidence once the treaty had been ratified. He said that some of the party's problems had been caused by the 'absence of enemies', such as the Soviet Union and powerful trade union bosses, leaving no option but positive campaigning on issues such as deregulation, improving public services and sustaining economic recovery. Mr Clarke did little to disguise ministers' anger over the behaviour of the sceptics, as he admitted Thursday's vote would be a 'cliffhanger'. The chancellor, who warned that Britain's prospects would look 'very bad' if it failed to ratify the treaty, said Tory sceptics would be 'standing on their heads' if they sought to wreck the treaty by voting against a UK opt-out on the social chapter. Further evidence of the tough line being taken by the Tory establishment came from Sir Peter Hordern, chairman of the Tory backbench European affairs committee. He hinted that if the government were defeated on Thursday, a further debate, to enable ratification to go ahead, could be held in August. With Mr Major's authority at stake in the vote, Mr Clarke said he expected the number of Tory MPs willing to vote against the government would be fewer than generally expected. More than a dozen - enough to overturn Mr Major's majority  - have expressed willingness to defy the cabinet. But Mr Clarke's words signalled the start of five days of intense arm-twisting aimed at bringing them into line. The Euro-sceptics' application for a judicial review is further evidence that some remain defiant. The government is already working on the basis of not proceeding to ratification until the issue has been resolved. Lord Rees-Mogg said Sir James Goldsmith, the financier, was among those meeting the 'substantial' costs of the action. Tories stress independence in Euro poll, Page 6</p>

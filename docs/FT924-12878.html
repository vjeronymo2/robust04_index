			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Al-Sabah family keeps grip on Kuwait cabinet KUWAIT'S opposition politicians yesterday welcomed the appointment of six deputies to the cabinet, but complained that the ruling al-Sabah family had kept its grip on the most powerful ministries. An unprecedented six deputies from the new 50-seat National Assembly were awarded seats in the 16-member cabinet, most notably Mr Ali al-Baghli, a Shia-backed independent candidate during the recent elections, who replaces Mr Homoud al-Rqobah as oil minister. The ministries of labour and social affairs, Islamic affairs, commerce and industry, justice and education also went to deputies who ran broadly anti-government campaigns during Kuwait's October 5 poll. Opposition candidates won more than 30 of the 50 seats. However, members of the al-Sabah family keep hold of the interior, foreign affairs, defence and information ministries in the cabinet.</p>

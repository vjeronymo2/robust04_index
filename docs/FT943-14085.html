			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / SPD, Greens agree risky coalition deal The Social Democratic party (SPD) yesterday agreed a minority coalition with the left-wing Green party in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt, a risky venture whose survival depends on the support of the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the East German Communist party. The coalition has been seized on by the SPD as a chance to prove that it is serious about government. It also provides further evidence that the SPD may agree to work with the Green party to secure a majority after the October federal parliamentary elections. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, has denied all such suggestions, but leading members of his party have argued that a pre-election commitment to a so-called red-green coalition will secure a larger majority for the two parties. Meanwhile the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its more right-wing Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have been falling over themselves to present the arrangement with the former communists in Saxony-Anhalt as ultimate treachery. The SPD have fired back, pointing out that the CDU has agreed countless coalitions with the PDS at local council level in eastern Germany and is hypocritical to suggest that arrangements at state level are any different. The two would-be coalition partners yesterday presented a 70-page document, negotiated over the last 10 days, which outlines the coalition agreement. The SPD will have six ministers, the Greens will take over the Environment Ministry, and independent technocrats are being sought for the three remaining posts. 'The longest road starts with the first step,' was the cautious verdict with which Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the SPD state premier designate, greeted the landmark decision. He is likely to be elected premier on July 21. Only days before the election on June 26, Mr Hoppner said he would not consider any deals with the PDS, preferring instead a so-called grand coalition with the CDU, which has 36 seats in the state parliament, one more than the SPD. However, a day after the election victory the SPD leadership in Bonn were able to convince Mr Hoppner that a coalition with the Greens, who have five seats, and horse-trading with the 21-seat PDS, however risky, was the only chance the SPD had of proving that it was determined to win the October elections. Recent opinion polls have seen the SPD lose its earlier lead over the CDU and many observers suggest the party will be hard pushed to recover lost ground before the October elections. The PDS has achieved impressive returns in state and communal elections in eastern Germany, backed by voters angry about economic reforms, and it is likely to manage to get back into the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, in the October elections. Leading politicians in Thuringia, which neighbours Saxony-Anhalt to the south and is still a bastion of CDU support, sought to play down the spill-over effect of the red-green coalition. They argued that the differing economic and political development of the five eastern states meant it was unlikely the Saxony-Anhalt coalition would be duplicated.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (5): Plan for a high-tech future - Education and manpower training AT the beginning of this century, the region was called the 'Red Ruhr' - feared by the authorities as a dangerous hot-bed for socialist ideals. To keep the Ruhr under control, Kaiser Wilhem II pledged then there would be 'no students and no soldiers' in the region. In 1993, the Ruhr is still ruled by the political left, personified by Mr Johannes Rau, the state's popular, grey-haired prime minister. But now, far from having 'no students,' North Rhine-Westphalia claims to have more universities and centres of higher education per head than any other area in the European Community. Higher education and vocational training are two important trump cards which local politicians display when asked about the region's attractions. A walk through the depressed city of Rheinhausen, where the steelmaker Krupp closed a plant last August, vividly illustrates why manpower training schemes are politically crucial to employment in the Ruhr. The hope is to foster more high-technology companies which brought prosperity to the southern states of Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria. Two key ingredients are essential: a diversified, export-driven industrial base and a highly trained workforce. Heavy industry has made great efforts to diversify. The Mannesmann group is an example - it once mined coal for factories which manufactured seamless metal tubes. Today, it has diversified into electronics, hydraulic systems, plant construction and engineering. To offer industry a better-qualified workforce and to attract new businesses to the region, state officials have funded an array of higher education facilities. North Rhine-Westphalia now has 50 universities and vocational training centres, most of them located around the urban centres of the Ruhr. Moreover, there are 10 branches of the famous Max Planck Research Institute, five branches from the similar Fraunhofer Society and 24 technology-transfer offices regrouped in three state-run research centres. State officials view this educational framework as vital support for the region's industrial diversification. In the city of Dortmund alone, the eight-year-old technology transfer institute is believed to have created more than 1,000 jobs for the town in the last three years. The aim is to provide job opportunities as much for today as for the years ahead - 'there is a generation problem,' explains Ms Anke Brunn, state minister for science and research. 'We don't expect miners to start manufacturing computer chips. But their sons and daughters - they are studying in preparation for new technologies. That is a crucialstep for a properous future.' To qualify for state funds, universities have to offer programmes specifically geared for new regional industries. For example, the vocational training centre which opened last year in Gelsenkirchen offers teaching in waste management and in engineering - two important growth areas in the Ruhr. The Fachhochschule-Gelsenkirchen, which is the latest (and 50th) centre to open in the Ruhr, now trains 2,000 students and hopes to increase this number to 3,000 next year - 'we teach engineers how to sell engineering products because this will be as important in the future as manufacturing itself,' explains Mr Peter Schulte, the rector. The centre is also geared toward training people to be active on an international level. It is, for example, holding talks with Britain's Hallam University in Sheffield about a student exchange programme. Mr Schulte admits, however, that much remains to be done to have education meet the needs of the industries in the Ruhr. Critics claim that vocational training is often removed from the realities of the workplace, not least because some professors, who are civil servants enjoying lifetime employment with little incentive to reform the curriculum. Moreover, few educational centres offer flexible programme schedules for workers needing mid-career retraining - 'most people who want to change their professions or who need to increase their qualifications must leave their jobs in order to attend a university,' explains Mr Schulte. For Ms Brunn, the minister, education has to become more of a partnership between private and public sectors. Companies must increasingly focus on ways to increase staff training to meet technological change, she says. 'We need to introduce greater flexibility in work schedules to allow people to take evening classes and to retrain while they are working.' Some convenient courses have started. For example, at Bochum University, built, symbolically perhaps, above an old, abandoned coal mine, strong emphasis has been put on Russian and Japanese language courses, scheduled at convenient hours for working people. But such examples remain all too rare, officials admit. These facilities can serve as models for other areas of the country. This autumn there will be fresh discussions at government level on ways to improve links between educational establishments and the labour market.</p>

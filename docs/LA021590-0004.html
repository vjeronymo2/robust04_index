			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> JUDGE TO RESIGN, SUPERVISE TRUST  </P> <P> Presiding Justice Harmon G. Scoville of the Santa Ana division of the state's  4th District Court of Appeal announced his retirement to accept the job of  special master of the Buck Trust in Marin County. Scoville, 67, was appointed  to the special master position by former Santa Clara County Judge Homer B.  Thompson, who was placed in charge of the trust by the California Supreme Court  more than a year ago.  </P> <P> The trust, worth more than $250 million, was left by the late Beryl Buck for  the care of the needy and other charities in Marin County. When the San  Francisco Foundation, which controlled the trust, tried to modify the terms to  allow distribution of its funds to other counties, Marin County officials  challenged it in court. Thompson presided over the trial in 1986 and ruled that  the trust's funds must remain in Marin County.  </P></p>

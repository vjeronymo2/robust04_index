He said both countries were agreed that the issue of  overlapping claims on the Islands off Sabah and northeast  Kalimantan could be settled through negotiations.    Whatever new documents and ideas can be presented for study  before the third round of talks in Jakarta in May, he told  reporters after the presentation of Japanese Government cultural  aid to Malaysia at the Foreign Ministry here.    He was confident that the two sides could reach a concrete  consensus at the talks although the issue was complicated.    Malaysia and Indonesia had studied all the documents and  maps  that were presented at the second round of talks here last week,  he said.    He said both sides shared the view that all international  legal aspects be resorted to if necessary to resolve the issue.    Both parties were confident that the issue would not spark  off something that is to be regretted in the future.</p>

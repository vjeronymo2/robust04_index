After they were administered first aid, six  people were immediately transferred to the City Hospital, and  others received medical treatment and were then hospitalized in  Dobrinja Hospital. The first results of the expert military  teams in Dobrinja say that three shells were fired. Two of them  were certainly of 120-mm caliber and the third is assumed to be  of 82 mm. As the first results of the investigation show, the  bombs were fired from Lukavica, that is, the Chetnik lair of the  Slobodan Princip-Seljo Barracks. I hope we shall be able to  provide even more precise information in our next newscast.</p>

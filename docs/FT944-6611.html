			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Italian borsino planned Plans announced last week to launch a pan-European stock market for entrepreneurial companies have struck a chord in Italy, where banks, business federations and the stock exchange authorities are encouraging the birth of a baby stock market, or 'borsino'. The plan ought to stand a good chance of success. Italy's innovative small and medium-sized companies, particularly those in the north of the country, are recognised as the backbone of the Italian economy, and many are enthusiastic exporters bent on expansion. But management consultants say their development is being hampered by their inability or unwillingness to take on more bank debt, making stock market flotation a tempting alternative. Consob, Italy's stock exchange watchdog, has invited consortia to submit offers to set up a second market, which would trade ordinary shares as well as bonds and warrants. Promoters would have to guarantee the presence of at least 50 companies with an overall market capitalisation of more than L500bn (Pounds 198m) and the involvement of an adequate number of intermediaries to guarantee liquidity. The main problem, however, will be persuading growing Italian businesses - many of them family-owned - that they need to list their shares, after decades of relative prosperity as unquoted companies. To encourage entrepreneurs on to the second market, the government is offering fiscal incentives to small companies which decide to float their shares, and to investors who want to buy them. A further snag is that even the main equity market, in Milan, is relatively underdeveloped. As for the European second market, advocates of an Italian version are sceptical about the willingness of investors in Rochdale wanting to buy shares in a Rimini-based company. Although the second Italian market will be national, the emphasis is at first likely to be on local savers investing in local companies.</p>

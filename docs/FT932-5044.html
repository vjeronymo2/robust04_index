			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Man with a plan tries to make sense of London: Jimmy Burns joins a tour with the mayor of Barcelona PASQUAL Maragall, the elected mayor of Barcelona since 1982, presides over a city that has come to be seen widely as a model of well structured urban planning, bold architecture and leadership. At 52, he can look back over two and half terms in office during which Barcelona has undergone one of the most ambitious urban renewals of any European city. The process culminated in the creation of an Olympic village on what was a polluted wasteland on the banks of the Mediterranean. The FT brought Maragall to London, a city despised by so many of its inhabitants because it lacks the very qualities which Barceloneses claim as their trademark. Is Barcelona as good as people make out? Is London as bad? What too, could we learn from Maragall, the 'urban socialist' who claims to know what makes urban dwellers happy. We flew him to Heathrow and took him round the city for a day. This is a diary of his hectic progress through the British capital. 11.30 am There are no traffic jams on the M4 as we drive into London from Heathrow. 'The last time I took a taxi into London, the traffic was so bad I abandoned ship and took a subway instead,' says the mayor. He has to admit that traffic in Barcelona is also pretty horrible. The western outskirts of London unfold. No Mediterranean sun or coastline here, no Olympian village. Just a landscape of cricket fields, warehouses, office blocks, and terraced houses. Maragall looks bored. 'I have to agree with the Prince of Wales, there is a sound basis to dislike much of what has been built in London. Look at all this. I am unable to understand what is going on about me. For a citizen of a city, that is the most damaging of sensations. Being lost in a landscape you cannot understand. There doesn't seem to be a cohesive urban development plan.' Barcelona has the strictest historical preservation code of any European city. A property developer who wants to demolish a building has to prove to the mayor's officethat it is not of historical significance. 12.00 am The terraced houses give way to the Imperial grandeur of museums and parks. 'The British Empire was very clever. It made sure that if you wanted to find out about the world you had to come to London. Even Marx had to come to the British Museum.' Barcelona boasts more art nouveau buildings that any other city and more than 50 permanent exhibitions, but the emphasis is on the modern. The taxi slows and Maragall joins the tourists watching the changing of the guard. The Royal parks and Buckingham Palace are illuminated by a spring sun. 'Now all this is the result of history and a time when there was 'sound planning'. When I see all this, I think, God it's beautiful. It is the summit of humanity, but I also think, how unfair. Why is it that it is always capital cities that have the wealth of the nations to spend on themselves? What will happen to London when it is not the capital of a sovereign state when the real nation is Europe?' Whitehall, he muses, as we leave Big Ben behind, has too much concentration of power; the City is too exclusive in its emphasis on business, the way it functions only by day and closes for the night. 'Cities are not islands, nor should they have islands in them because if they do cities disappear . . . you deny citizenship . . . The City is dead at night. I don't see why it should be. All you need is to mix residences with shops.' So what can Barcelona offer by day and night? I ask . . . 'A surprise: a city that is alive. People strolling down the Ramblas . . . people talking to each other . . . a city made up of equally important parts,' Maragall answers. 12.30 Maragall alights from the taxi at the corner of Broad Street and Bishopsgate in the midst of buildings wrecked by the IRA bomb blast. Looking up at the shattered Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, he seems not so much shocked as unimpressed. 'This building is not a Norman Foster. It's not very beautiful.' (Foster is one of Britain's exports to Barcelona. He designed a telecommunications tower described by Catalans as poetry in architecture). 'This kind of thing can happen in any city. It's very difficult to stop terrorists as organised as the IRA. We couldn't' Maragall says a city that concentrates its financial activities in one area is more vulnerable. 1.00 To the FT for lunch with Sir Peter Bowness, Tory leader of Croydon Council; Tony Travers, from the London government unit at the LSE; Margaret Hodge, former Labour leader of Islington Council and Stephen O'Brien, chief Executive of London First and London Forum, the business-led body which has the government's backing to promote London. Sir Peter defends his patch. 'When one talks of London,' he says, 'one can only consider its different constituents which in themselves are very different from each other.' Travers says London is 'a whole collection of villages' defined by history and justified by it. Hodge insists that a city like London needs a voice. Maragall knows Hodge as an ally. 'London to an outsider presents a curious face. It seems a city that is being subtlety subjected to a very centralised government which ignores the wishes of the citizen.' O'Brien suggests that perhaps the mayor does not really know what makes London tick. 'There is a definite move against centralised government bureaucracy . . . greater co-operation between business and public sector to put pressure on government . . . It is not an attempt to present a new vision in London, it is an attempt to make things happen in London . . . ' And certainly not with an elected mayor, adds Sir Peter. 'There is not the same loyalty in the populace to the concept of municipality as there is in other parts of Europe. It simply wouldn't happen. There is no groundswell of public opinion. Quite apart from the objections at local level, MPs instinctively don't like competition.' Hodge disagrees.' That's not what the surveys in the Evening Standard tell us.' The dialogue shifts to culture and design. Maragall says: 'If Barcelona has one asset it is the gift of design. You cannot show a design that is not the best otherwise you lose your trademark. Barcelona wanted to be a capital and never was . . . it is always trying to go beyond itself and we had a lot to catch up after 40 years of dictatorship . . . ' The gathered Anglo-Saxons look bemused. 2.45 pm The Docklands Light Railway. It is running on time, uncrowded, its passengers are mainly businessman. 'In Barcelona not only do we not have half as many underground lines as you have here . . . but no one apart from the working class uses them.' But Londoners think their public transport is crowded, unsafe, dirty. Maragall shrugs this off as unjustified moaning. 'I've spent two years living in New York, this is paradise by comparison,' he says. Docklands give him the cue to talk about his own achievements. 'We redesigned whole urban areas which didn't seem to belong anywhere any more. We gave symbols of power to the periphery in the form of statues. We gave people the idea that we care about them . . . we built new low cost housing and squares where brothels had been.' Even an elected mayor cannot get everything he wants in a chain of government that runs upwards to the regional authority and then to Madrid. Maragall looks at the DLR with regret. 'This was the kind of train system I wanted in Barcelona but I didn't get the money for it from the regionalist government.' 3.00 pm Canary Wharf has some of the same architects as Barcelona. It has bold designs. But Maragall finds it too empty and silent. 'Where are the people?' he asks. From the 34th floor of Canary Wharf tower Maragall looks across Docklands. 'I like this more than La Defence in Paris. The architecture is more human. It's the scale that obviously is too big. This is going to take years to occupy fully and someone will have to pay for that. This was the product of a government that believed the free market was everything. This is a capital sin. Sheer arrogance.' However, Barcelona's equivalent docklands development, the Olympic village built by a mix of private and public capital and socialist government intervention, is also partly unoccupied. 4.45 pm The mayor goes upstream in a Riverbus. He says that while Barcelona had rediscovered the sea, London has obscured its river. Watching the rush hour stampede across London Bridge, he says: 'It would be very difficult for Latins to cross a bridge . . . they don't like having their cars more than about 200 metres away from their work . . . That's why the traffic is so bad in Barcelona.' 5.15 pm Stepping ashore at Festival Pier, Maragall says of the South Bank: 'It's horrible. You should knock it down but only gradually . . . I remember when Franco died the architects wanted to knock everything down . . . we restrained them so something was left.' The Mayor insists on diverting to the Hayward Gallery where there is an exhibition by James Turrel, a Californian, and one of hundreds of artists who Maragall has brought on to the streets of Barcelona to be viewed free-of-charge by the public. 5.30 The delegation makes its way across cardboard city. London's homeless loiter among excrement and empty beer cans. 'This is no worse than Barcelona. This is a worldwide phenomenon. These people will always seek shelter underground.' 5.45 The Mayor is given a private preview of the new international terminal at Waterloo station. Gazing at Grimshaw's bold design, listening to the men from Bovis and British Rail talk about the wonders of Europe and getting to Paris in three hours, Maragall thinks he has found the link he has been looking for. 'It's airy it's wide . . . it's beautiful . . . .It's EUROPE . . . This is going to change London's history.' Unfortunately the terminal is not the international link he imagines. BR has abandoned its southern route extension to the Channel tunnel and the fast European trains will run on a northern route from St Pancras, leaving Waterloo redundant. It is an example not of European vision but of the unco-ordinated government that bedevils London. At day's end, Maragall had been seduced by a white elephant.</p>

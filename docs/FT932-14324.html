			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Finnish economy 'over the worst' FINLAND IS over the worst of its economic problems, Mr Esko Aho, the country's prime minister, said yesterday. He cited a 24 per cent increase in exports in February and a 4 per cent rise in industrial production since the beginning of the year as evidence that recovery had begun. Finland has been in deep recession since 1990, with gross domestic product falling by 10 per cent last year and the year before. 'We are on the way up,' claimed Mr Aho, who viewed the 5 per cent rise in the value of the markka since Easter as a clear indication of improving sentiment. Finland has benefited from a surge in exports after a 40 per cent currency depreciation since November 1991. Recovery has also been helped by a halving of interest rates to from 17 per cent last autumn. Mr Aho added that 'on the basis of current trends, the balance of payments should be back in equilibrium next year'. But, on a gloomier note, he predicted that Finnish unemployment, which currently stands at 18 per cent, would continue at a high level.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Industrial Growth Hits 17 Percent While </F> Inflation Lingers"]    [Text] China's economy continued its double-digit growth  last month despite lingering inflation.    Industrial output hit 17.3 per cent in May the State  Statistics Bureau announced yesterday.    The growth in production is due to the easing of credit  controls by the government, which in turn has led to a rise in  capital investment, said the bureau's economists.    And, Xinhua News Agency quoted an official from the State  Economic and Trade Commission as saying that the GDP is expected  to grow by about 12 per cent in the first half of this year,  making it easier for the country to achieve the 9-10 GDP per  cent growth in 1994. [sentence as published]    The fixed assets invested by work units hit 67.6 billion  yuan  ($7.8 billion) in May, up nearly 28 per cent from the same month  last year, the statistics bureau reported.    During the first five months of this year, State units  invested 204.4 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) in the country's  fixed assets sector, representing a rise of 34.2 percent over  the same period a year ago the bureau said.    Of this, money used for construction accounted for 114.1  billion yuan ($13.1 billion), up 35.1 percent over the same  period last year.    Inflation also continued its double-digit growth this year,  the bureau said.    In May, the cost of living index in the country was 21.3 per  cent, higher than the same time of last year. But this was 0.4  per cent lower than the growth of 21.7 per cent reported a month  earlier.    The bureau's economists said living costs have been  persistently high in the country's big cities, partly because of  random price hikes of food and catering services.    The inflation in the country's 35 large and medium cities  saw  a growth of 23.2 per cent in April. And in May, the prices  continued to grow at the same level.    Government departments should maintain strict control over  the prices in a bid to meet this year's inflation target of 10  per cent nationwide and 15 percent in major cities, as  designated by the central government, said the economists.    They noted that efforts to increase bank savings and issuing  treasury bonds are helping to curb inflation.    Banks and credit companies saw their individual and  institutional savings increase by 113.4 billion yuan ($13  billion) last month. The figure was 79.4 billion yuan ($9.1  billion) higher than the same period last year, the bureau said.    And by the end of May, the State had sold more than 68.1  billion yuan ($7.8billion) worth of treasury bonds.    It included the sale of two-year bonds valued at 24.8  billion  yuan ($2.8 billion), more than meeting the planned target, the  bureau said.    A growth of bank savings and the brisk sale of State  treasury  bonds lead to a 33.7 percent growth in State revenue in May.    The success of financial reforms also helped to stimulate  industrial growth in the already buoyant domestic market.    In May, the country's retail sales totalled 121.4 billion  yuan ($14 billion), up 6.1 percent over the same period of last  year.</p>

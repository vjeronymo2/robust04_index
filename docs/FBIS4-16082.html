			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva April 13 TASS -- U.N. and Russian experts  reconvened in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss military aspects of  a possible peace-keeping operation in the zone of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    The talks attended by representatives of Georgia, Abkhazia,  Russia and the United Nations focused on determining the areas  for deploying U.N. peace-keepers.    U.N. secretary-general special envoy Edouard Brunner told  ITAR- TASS that the U.N. and Russian diplomats are studying  proposals made by the Georgian and Abkhazian delegations on  Tuesday.    Georgia suggests deploying peace-keepers along the entire  perimeter of the war zone, including along the Psou and Inguri  rivers, at mountain summits, along the sea coast and at Sukhumi  and Bombara airports, as well as in places of location of  Russian border troops carrying out radar control of the sea.    It stressed that U.N. troops' aim will be to prevent  possible  resumption of hostilities and check arms shipments and personnel  reinforcements to the war zone.    However, Abkhazia believes that U.N. forces should be placed  along the Inguri river dividing the warring sides to disengage  them and prevent penetration of troops into the 6-10 kilometer  wide demilitarised zone on both sides of the river.    Georgian Interior Ministry Commander Vladimir Chikovani told  ITAR-TASS that his delegation disagrees with Abkhazia's  proposals. He noted that the deployment of U.N. peace-keepers  along the Inguri river will not ensure safe return of refugees  because after passing the "corridor" they will find themselves  in Abkhazian-controlled territory. In his view, arms supply  routes can be blocked only if U.N. troops are placed along the  whole perimeter of the war zone.    The talks continue and may take a day longer than was  planned. Much will depend on the conclusions and proposals of  U.N. and Russian experts. The group has no power to make  decisions on deployment of U.N. peace-keeping forces. However,  its suggestions will be conveyed to U.N. secretary-general who  will then present them to the U.N. Security Council.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [kReport by Dmitriy Lukashov under the "Tataria" rubric: </F> "Tatar Nationalists Unite in the Face of Common Danger"]    [Text] A plenum of the "moderate" wing of the Pan-Tatar  Public Center [PTPC] was held in Kazan on 2 April.    The "moderates" and "Radicals" from Tataria's biggest  national organization now sit separately while it is still not  clear which of them after all has the more right to be called  the PTPC. Judging from the moods in the plenum, the positions  of former comrades-in-arms have again begun to converge on the  basis of an extremely negative attitude to the treaty between  Russia and Tataria signed in February. Even the "moderate" PTPC  has altered its critical stance, to one of direct confrontation  with the republic's leadership.    The plenum expressed a vote of no confidence in the  republic's leadership, which "has betrayed the Tatar people's  interests," and stated that the PTPC demands early elections for  president, Supreme Soviet, and heads of administrations.    In the opinion of local observers, the Tatar  national-patriots now have a chance to have a new leader capable  of uniting the different trends. Rafael Khakimov, adviser to  the Republic of Tatarstan president and a former PTPC  ideologist, may become one such leader. The address at the  plenum made it clear that he, too, has come to oppose the  leadership and is likely to hand in his resignation soon.    Should Mr. Khakimov really come to lead the national  movement, the other leaders would have only a union to support  because there now exist no differences between them save  personal ones.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Johannesburg was easier with investors reluctant to enter the market in the absence of an overnight Wall Street lead. The overall index lost 34.9 to 5,831.4, for a 93-point decline on the week, industrials were 20.7 down at 6,929.2 and golds were 21.3 lower at 2,045.7. De Beers ended R1.75 down at R94, continuing its recent poor showing amid concern that its control of the diamond market was slipping. Anglos were R3 weaker at R231.</p>

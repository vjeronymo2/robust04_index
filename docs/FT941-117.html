			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Observer: Passing by Go on, say something nasty about Credit Lyonnais. Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, resisted the temptation to score points at the expense of his larger but more troubled rival at an analysts' presentation in London yesterday. All he would say is: 'Never shoot at an ambulance.' Sensible man, Vienot. One never knows when one might need an ambulance oneself.</p>

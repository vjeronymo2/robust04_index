			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Hopes for ship data recorder BROADGATE, the Bristol-based electronics subsidiary of P&amp;O which has developed a 'black box' for ships, expects voyage data recording equipment to be made compulsory by the International Maritime Organisation within two years. Mr Chris Winkley, managing director of Broadgate, denied that the Voyage Event Recorder (VER) was not technically advanced enough to be widely adopted in the shipping industry. Although the industry seemed more preoccupied with stress-and-strain monitoring of ships, the recorder would prove invaluable to marine accident investigators and shipping companies in helping to identify the cause of incidents on voyages, Mr Winkley said. The recorder, which costs about Pounds 55,000, provides a continuously updated record of the last 24 hours of a voyage. It is designed to monitor sound on the bridge and in the wheelhouse and engine control room, and to record the course and speed of the ship and information from two radar channels. The recorder contains a beacon which can be picked up by satellite or air-sea rescue, helping to pinpoint a vessel's last position. The recorder was developed at P&amp;O's request from an aircraft flight data recorder. It has been in use on 10 P&amp;O vessels including a cruise ship, cross-Channel ferries, a bulk carrier and a container ship for the past year. Mr Winkley said no other shipping company had bought the equipment, but several companies had expressed an interest in the recorder, including a Scandinavian ferry operator. The International Chamber of Shipping, an offshoot of the General Council of British Shipping, said it was unlikely that such recorders would be widely used until the technology was more sophisticated, and there was international agreement on the information to be monitored.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China's 78 major  auto factories last year produced a total of 1.18 million  vehicles of all kinds, 100,000 more than in 1992.    According to latest statistics from the China National  Automotive Industry Corporation (CNAIC), the total sales last  year were 1.17 million units. Of the total output, 225,000 were  sedan cars, with sales of 223,000.    A CNAIC official estimated that China's actual auto output  last year must have exceeded 1.25 million, if the products of  small auto factories are counted.    China's auto industry developed at a fairly high speed for  32  successive months until last June, when it was hit by a slump  market, with both output and sales falling abruptly. Yet it  still fulfilled the target of producing 1.1 million vehicles set  at the beginning of the year.    To reinforce the development of the industry, the government  decided last year to set up an auto department in the Ministry  of Machinery Industry, and put the administration of the auto  industry under the ministry. Formerly the CNAIC was responsible  for administering the country's auto production.    A few weeks ago the Ministry of Machinery Industry  publicized  its 1994 plan for the auto industry, saying 1.3 million  automobiles will be produced, of which 350,000 will be sedan  cars, and the growth rate of the industry will be maintained at  about 10 percent.</p>

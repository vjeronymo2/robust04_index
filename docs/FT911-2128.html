			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Chamber Orchestra of Europe - Barbican Hall A mostly Mozart programme brought to a close the 10th birthday series of concerts given by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, sponsored by The BOC Group. That attendences have been so good throughout is hopefully due in no little measure to the presence of a healthy number of FT readers, attracted by a special ticket promotion. After ten years it is possible to take stock. Although the COE players still only come together for five or six months a year, their playing never lets on. This is one of the finest chamber orchestras of today, less sumptuous perhaps in tone than the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, but more flexible than the conductorless Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, among its immediate rivals. And that second comparison points to the COE's special character. For this young orchestra has built close relationships with some of the world's leading conductors: Abbado, Solti, Harnoncourt (unforgettably at this same hall two weeks ago). And, for this concert, the eminent Mozartian, Sandor Vegh. Of all of them, he trusts most to the musicians' instincts and does no more than necessary, though there were a few moments on Monday when the players looked as though they would have liked a clear lead and did not get it. Vegh came to conducting with fine credentials as a player of chamber music and it was that spirit of give-and-take, of music being made on an intimate scale, that gave this evening its own flavour. The opening of Mozart's Symphony No 29 suggested indeed that the conductor might be about to cosset the music all too lovingly. But the performance had just enough spirit and Vegh is always specific, not generalised, in what he wants to say. A group of five Mozart Contredanses and Wolf's Italian Serenade, genially smiling, opened to view intimate corners of expression. The best, though, was Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, K. 297b, in which four wind soloists from the orchestra (especially the clarinet, Richard Hosford) distinguished themselves in the solo parts. It is that strength of solo performers that has given the COE its enviable reputation in only a decade.</p>

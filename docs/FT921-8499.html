			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): ILO is criticised for being 'moribund' THE WORK of the International Labour Organisation, founded in 1919 to establish an international code of workers rights, 'looks positively moribund' compared with the European Community's Social Charter, according to an analysis published today. Professor Keith Ewing, professor of public law at King's College, University of London, says in the new London-based magazine International Union Rights, that the ILO's attempts to create an international code of rights 'have to some extent run into the sands'. He says: 'Although worldwide labour is on the defensive, very few really significant conventions (ILO rulings) emerged in the 1980s to add to the code.' He adds that many of the most significant conventions have never been ratified by some countries. The US, for example, has never ratified conventions 87 on freedom of association and 98 on the right to organise and collective bargaining. But even where conventions have been ratified, the ILO has no way of forcing governments to comply with their terms. 'The problems here have become acute as more countries have chosen to deregulate labour law as a means of helping to prevent further economic decline.' The UK government has been repeatedly found in breach of convention 87 over the banning of unions from the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). 'It has refused to comply and there is nothing that can be done to compel it to do so,' says Prof Ewing. According to the Trades Union Congress the British government will this year receive the worst possible reprimand the ILO can deliver, a special mention at the organisation's annual conference for 'grave and persistent' violation of conventions. Prof Ewing believes that the ILO should not be written off, adding that, while the ILO condemned banning unions at GCHQ, the European Commission on Human Rights did not. He also says that the ILO was an inspiration for those drafting the EC Social Charter. But he concludes that a 'stronger organisation is required with a greater influence on the nations throughout the world'.</p>

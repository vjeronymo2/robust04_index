			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Acorn aims new range at parents ACORN, the Cambridge-based personal computer manufacturer which dominates the UK schools market, is attempting to break out of its educational niche with a swathe of products aimed at the home and professionals. Acorn says its computers are used by 90 per cent of schoolchildren. It now hopes to persuade parents that they should use the same make of computer as their children use at school. A television advertising campaign will suggest the systems are equally well suited for work and play. Acorn, in which Olivetti of Italy has a majority stake, has had some difficult years because of the recession and changes in schools' purchasing policies. It hopes customers will be attracted by the power of its ARM microprocessor, a version of which is to be used by Apple Computers of the US in a revolutionary pocket computer called Newton. Acorn's product list includes a home computer for Pounds 499, a 'home office' system for Pounds 999 plus VAT, and a Pounds 250 electronic notebook which is the first product of Acorn's collaboration with Psion, the UK portable computer manufacturer. The notebook is essentially Psion's Series 3 pocket computer with software modified to suit it to the computing needs of secondary-school children. Last year Acorn recovered from a poor first half to record pre-tax profits of Pounds 274,000, against Pounds 1.58m the year before. The company's position in the school market seems secure but the consumer and professional personal market is experiencing weak demand and intense price cutting.</p>

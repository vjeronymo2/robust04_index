			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Increase in rights abuses says Amnesty International An Indonesian campaign against prostitutes, beggars and suspected criminals in Jakarta ahead of November's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit has led to increased human rights abuses, Amnesty International said yesterday, Victor Mallet writes from Bangkok. The government had put in 15,000 military and police officers 'to clear the streets of political and criminal 'undesirables',' Mr Pierre Sane, secretary-general of the London-based human rights group, said in Bangkok. Excessive force had been used in breaking up peaceful demonstrations, with scores of alleged criminals shot dead, Amnesty said. Jakarta residents could not confirm how many extra troops had been sent to the capital, but said government forces had been seen clearing beggars off the streets to improve Indonesia's image for the summit meeting, to be attended by President Clinton. Amnesty, which yesterday launched a report* on Indonesia's human rights record, wants rights and labour issues raised during the summit. *Indonesia and East Timor - Power and Impunity: Human rights under the New Order.</p>

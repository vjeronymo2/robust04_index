			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRBORNE HOMAGE;  </P> <P> PILOT TO RE-CREATE OPEN-COCKPIT FLIGHT OF 1929 WOMEN'S AIR DERBY CHAMPION  </P> <P> In 1929, an air derby featuring 20 women pilots hopscotching across the country  in their open-cockpit planes was a big enough deal to draw thousands of  cheering people to airstrips from Santa Monica to Cleveland.  </P> <P> The issue was whether women could be aviators. The answer was yes, as amply  demonstrated by such pioneering pilots as Amelia Earhart and First Women's Air  Derby victor Louise Thaden.  </P> <P> On Friday, a 1980s pilot, who happens to be a woman, will pay homage to Thaden  and her cadre of trailblazers when she takes off from Santa Monica Airport to  re-create the race on its 60th anniversary.  </P> <P> Susan Dusenbury, 40, a commercial pilot for Airborne Express, will be behind  the controls of the restored Travel Air D4000 in which Thaden won her historic  victory.  </P> <P> She will be dressed in authentic 1920s aviator equipment, complete with goggles  and hat that are essential in an open-air cockpit. There is no radar, radio or  other communication device in the plane, Dusenbury said in a telephone  interview from her home in North Carolina.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Stops  </P> <P> Dusenbury will find her way with a magnetic compass and by "winging it," that  is, navigating by visual landmarks. The plane holds enough fuel for 3 1/2  hours, so frequent stops are built into the trip. In Texas alone, she will  touch ground at five different airports.  </P> <P> A licensed airplane mechanic who has restored antique planes, Dusenbury said  she flies her own plane to lunch every Saturday, meeting 20 to 70 fellow flying  enthusiasts in Madison, N.C..  </P> <P> She has already delivered the Travel Air to California, where it is undergoing  last-minute fine-tuning for takeoff tomorrow. Dusenbury said she is excited  about honoring Thaden, a "great person and aviatrix" whose motto was "Take care  of your engine and your engine will take care of you."  </P> <P> "This derby symbolizes the dramatic achievement that women have made in  aviation," Dusenbury said. "Louise Thaden was more than just a winner of this  race. She represents the spirit of all women aviators, of their abilities and  their courage."  </P> <P> In the first derby, one of the pilots died en route and another landed in a  field, put out a cockpit fire and took off again. According to Dusenbury, they  ranged from socialites to country-bred, but shared the trait of independence.  "I think you sort of had to have a mind of your own," she said.  </P> <P> Dusenbury said media interest in the 1929 race was fueled by its timing -- it  had not been that long since women gained the right to vote. The race, later  dubbed the "Powder Puff Derby," overshadowed a men's race that was taking place  at the same time.  </P> <P> Thaden was involved in another first seven years later when she became the  first woman to enter a race with men. Race sponsors offered one cash prize for  the first-place winner and another for the woman who came in first. Thaden won  the race and all of the money in an old worn-out plane.  </P> <P> "She knew how to get speed," Dusenbury said.  </P></p>

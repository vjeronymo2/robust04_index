			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOM FOOD;  </P> <P> REMEMBERING THE WOMEN WHO SHAPED OUR TASTES. THE RECIPES ARE THE LEAST OF IT.;  </P> <P> WE REMEMBER MAMA;  </P> <P> HOW WE SURVIVED THE EGGPLANT  </P> <P> During World War II, my mother planted a Victory Garden in the back yard and  found, as all California gardeners do, that eggplant and zucchini grow like mad  in our climate. In fact, you can't kill them with a stick -- for years after  the war those two, and the Swiss chard, reseeded themselves all over the place.  </P> <P> A native Southern Californian and unquestioning believer in vegetables, she  dutifully served us eggplant when it was in season. Unfortunately, the only way  she knew to cook it was frying, and she was not aware that eggplant has to be  salted first to remove the bitterness. It pained her affectionate and  vegetable-trusting heart to see we didn't like the stuff.  </P> <P> But there were all those eggplants! Something had to be done with them. I can  remember my father drop-kicking a spare one over the back fence while we  cheered.  </P> <P> Finally she came upon a recipe for a Provencal dish where eggplant was stewed  with other vegetables, and magically, you couldn't taste the bitterness. (And  hey, it was also a way to use up some of those millions of zucchini at the same  time!) We went for it, and she served us ratatouille all summer long from then  on.  </P> <P> MARY PERRY'S RATATOUILLE  </P> <P> 1 medium eggplant, about 1 1/2 pounds  </P> <P> 1 small zucchini, about 1/2 pound  </P> <P> 1/4 cup oil  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 large green or red pepper, sliced  </P> <P> 4 medium tomatoes, quartered  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1 heaping teaspoon coriander seeds  </P> <P> 1 lemon, quartered, optional  </P> <P> Wash eggplant and cut into 1-inch cubes. Wash zucchini, trim off ends and cut  in 1/2-inch slices.  </P> <P> Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until tender. Add  eggplant, zucchini, green pepper, tomatoes, garlic, salt, pepper and coriander  seeds. Cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  </P> <P> Cover and cook 10 minutes longer, or until vegetables are tender. Serve hot or  cold (squeeze lemon over if served cold). Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane  </P></p>

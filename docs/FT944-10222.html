			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: VSEL chairman urges quick OFT bid decision Lord Chalfont, chairman of VSEL, the submarine maker coveted by BAe and GEC, yesterday urged the government to make a quick decision on whether to allow the takeovers to proceed. Bids from both companies are currently being examined by the Office of Fair Trading to determine whether they raise competition worries. Lord Chalfont has written to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, asking them to make their recommendations to the OFT quickly so that shareholders and employees can be clear where they stand. The government said a decision would be reached as soon as possible. The impatience at VSEL came as the OFT indicated that it would not now rule on BAe's bid by November 16, but had extended the deadline to December 7. A decision on whether or not to refer either bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is now expected in the first week of December. About 150 shareholders attended an extraordinary meeting at 7pm on Wednesday evening at the Vickers sports and social club in Barrow. The meeting voted to amend VSEL's articles to allow BAe to buy more than 15 per cent of the shares. An EGM to approve a similar waiver for GEC is to be held on November 24. VSEL workers are concerned about the prospect of being taken over by either company. The few worker-shareholders who remain, however, are keen to see the takeover race proceed rapidly to secure the highest price possible for their shares. While the amendment to the articles will allow either company to take over VSEL, neither BAe nor GEC can buy more than 15 per cent of its shares in the market until they have an acceptance of their bid by a majority of shareholders. GEC already owns 15 per cent and therefore cannot increase its stake until it has acceptances from another 35 per cent of VSEL's shareholders. BAe has no VSEL shares and cannot currently buy in the market as VSEL's shares are well above the cash alternative to its all-share offer.</p>

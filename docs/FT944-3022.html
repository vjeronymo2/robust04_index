			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (10): Irish precedent casts a shadow - Many charity leaders fear the effects of the National Lottery The National Lottery was launched last month amid criticism that charities are unlikely to receive any allocation of the proceeds until late next year. Leaders of many charities, however, remain more worried about the lottery's possible effect on the voluntary sector's overall long-term finances than delays in the distribution of funds. Charities will gain an estimated Pounds 100m share of the first year's lottery proceeds. Mr David Sieff, chairman of the National Lottery Charities Board, has pointed out that a distribution of this size would make the board bigger than any existing UK grant-making foundation. Yet the voluntary sector is not rejoicing. There are fears that many people will come to regard lottery tickets as their standard form of charitable support, and will be less inclined to respond to other fundraising appeals - even though charities will receive only a small share of total lottery revenue. To compensate for this, many voluntary-sector leaders believe charities should get a greater proportion of the overall lottery distribution. Such feelings were intensified by the reduction in pools betting duty in last month's Budget. This will produce a gain for sport and the arts  - which will both share in the lottery - of an estimated Pounds 100m a year. But there was no response in the Budget to the voluntary sector's lobbying for improved tax reliefs to encourage charitable giving, or help with the annual Pounds 330m bill for unrecoverable VAT paid by charities. The Irish voluntary sector had similar concerns to those being expressed in the UK when a state lottery was introduced in 1987. Research on the lottery's impact during its seven years of operation in the republic remains open to varying interpretations. An assessment commissioned by the Irish national lottery organisers in 1992 concluded that, while the lottery's absence would increase the potential fundraising base for voluntary organisations, it was not clear that their actual income would go up once the loss of lottery disbursements was taken into account. However, a survey of a sample of Irish charities last year found that 87 per cent of those that had been affected by the lottery regarded its impact as negative. Whatever effect the UK's lottery subsequently has on charities' own fundraising efforts, there will be no shortage of applications for a share of the proceeds. The National Lottery Charities Board will handle funding requests from both registered charities and other organisations set up for charitable, benevolent and philanthropic causes. This means that about 700,000 organisations, from national charities to small local groups, could all apply for funds. The board is working on estimates of 150,000-250,000 applications a year. Separate committees of the board will be set up for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with allocation of funds based on population weighted to take account of levels of deprivation. Consultations are under way to establish local advisory panels, which will respond to variations between the English regions, and devise methods of funding UK-wide organisations. ***** The National Lottery revenue is divided roughly as follows: prize money (50 per cent), beneficiaries (28), tax (12), retailers' commission (5), operating costs and profit (5). Groups of beneficiaries designated by the government to receive equal shares of funds are: the arts councils and sports councils of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the National Lottery Charities Board, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and the Millenium Fund.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 19 (AFP)--Northern forces of  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih tried to lay siege to this key  port-city on Thursday [19 May], as the United Nations prepared  to send vital aid to trapped Somali refugees.    Artillery battles were raging a few dozens kilometers  (miles)  of Aden, bastion of southern leader Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, an AFP correspondent said.    Salih, quoted Thursday by the northern-run agency SABA',  said  his forces had scored "one victory after another against the  separatist forces," in a reference to the southerners.    Aden, a port-city of half a million, was "almost surrounded"  following two weeks of civil war, a northern spokesman in the  capital Sanaa earlier told AFP.    But he said the objective was not to enter the city, so as  "to avoid war on the streets, but to put it under blockade, to  bomb military targets," in order to force al-Bid and his aides  "to surrender or quit the country."    Southerners have insisted Aden was well defended and they  can  keep the northerners at bay. Fighting was still going on for  control of the key air base of al-'Anad, north of here.    Meanwhile, the United Nations said it was to send a food  convoy to a camp in southern Yemen where thousands of Somali  refugees who fled their own civil war are trapped in crossfire.    Rolf Guldberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees  representative in Sanaa, told AFP the Somalis were in an "active  war zone" and the convoy could only leave once fighting subsided.    The refugees were either still in the al-Qud camp on a beach  near Zinjibar, 50 kilometers (32 miles) northeast of Aden, or  were sheltering at a nearby village, he said.    The region has been the scene of fierce fighting and  hundreds  of the Somalis have reportedly been killed in crossfire, while  the plight of the remainder was grim.    The current republic of Yemen was created on May 22, 1990,  with the merger of the former conservative North and Marxist  South states.    Al-Bid on Wednesday hinted for the first time that the  two-week old war could cause the south to break away.    "After all these massacres and these sacrifices, I don't  know  how we are going to live together again," al-Bid told the  London-based Saudi Middle East Broadcasting Television.    "I don't know what direction we will finally take but I can  tell you that it was 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who has proclaimed  secession in declaring war."    Neither side nor the International Committee of the Red  Cross  have so far issued a casualty toll.    But ICRC official in Sanaa Arnold Luethold told AFP his  organisation had counted a large number of POWs on both sides.</p>

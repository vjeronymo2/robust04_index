			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Records at Upjohn despite Halcion row UPJOHN, the US pharmaceutical company whose best-selling Halcion sleeping pill has stirred up an international debate over the drug's safety, yesterday reported record sales and earnings for 1991. Sales of Halcion, banned in the UK in the autumn on concern about drug's side-effects, dropped 23 per cent in the quarter and 1 per cent in the year. Before the controversy, Halcion, Upjohn's second best selling product, had estimated annual sales of Dollars 240m. Upjohn's fourth-quarter net income rose 13 per cent to Dollars 136.4m, or 73 cents a share, from Dollars 121m, or 64 cents, a year ago. Sales rose 14 per cent to Dollars 911.4m from Dollars 798.7m. For the year, net earnings advanced 18 per cent to Dollars 537.4m, or Dollars 2.87 a share, on sales up 13 per cent at Dollars 3.4bn. On Wall Street, shares in Upjohn added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 42 3/4 in fairly heavy trading. The stock was bolstered by positive comments from analysts about preliminary studies on the company's lazaroid drug. There remains concern, however, about declining Halcion sales and the lack of new drugs in Upjohn's pipeline. Many of Upjohn's most important drugs will lose their patents by the end of 1994. 'They have a difficult time in front of them unless they can get some new products,' said Mr Sam Isaly, an analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly.</p>

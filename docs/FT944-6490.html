			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Moore transforms its approach - New chief executive is spearheading shake-up The occupants of Moore Corporation's executive suite atop one of Toronto's tallest office towers would have felt quite out of place little more than a year ago. The 116-year old company was coasting on its long record as the world's biggest supplier of paper forms used by almost every business. A balance sheet with virtually no debt and a steady flow of revenues from products as varied as credit-card slips, cash-register receipts and train tickets had lulled Moore into a complacency not uncommon among well-entrenched market leaders. This month it reported nine-month net profits of USDollars 82.2m, or 83 cents a share, up from Dollars 60.6m, or 61 cents. In spite of being one of Canada's biggest companies, with 22,000 employees and annual revenues of Dollars 2.3bn, Moore saw no need for a public relations department. Staff turnover was exceptionally low. The chief executive had been with the company for 34 years and the chief financial officer for 43. However, the leisurely atmosphere has evaporated since Mr Reto Braun took over as chief executive in September 1993. 'This year, more things are happening than in the past 20,' says Swiss-born Mr Braun, who spearheaded a top-to-toe shake-up at Unisys, the US computer and defence electronics company. He has hired a new chief financial officer from Northern Telecom, the Canadian telephone equipment maker. The new head of the business systems division is a former McKinsey &amp; Co consultant who also worked for Mitel, another Canadian phone equipment supplier. Recruits from the computer and telecommunications industry give a clue to an even bigger change. While paper will continue to play a role in business records and transactions for the foreseeable future, many traditional business forms now comprise words and lines on a computer screen. The speed and accessibility of electronic data allow companies to use the information on these forms for an increasing number of purposes. Labels, another Moore staple, are being transformed by bar-codes into part of elaborate data management systems. Companies are also demanding a wider range of services from suppliers. 'The customer doesn't just want a product any more,' Mr Braun says. 'He wants a solution to his problem.' Mr Braun's credo is that if a chief executive needs to inflict pain, it should be done quickly, but fairly. In the 14 months since he took over, Moore has chopped about 2,000 jobs and closed six plants. A Dollars 229m restructuring charge, taken at the end of 1993, drained away 14 per cent of the company's equity. The long-term aim is to transform Moore from a supplier of business forms into a provider of a much wider range of information-handling products and services. It will concentrate on three businesses: forms and form-management systems; labelling systems, including bar-codes; and customer communications, such as direct mail. In each case, Mr Braun is targeting only a handful of sectors. For instance, the customer communications division will aim primarily at publishers and retailers. The labels business will be directed mainly at manufacturers, the transport sector and retailers. 'We have to sell earlier and higher in the sales cycle,' Mr Braun says. Instead of dealing with purchasing managers, he wants the company to do more of its business with chief financial officers and marketing executives. For example, Moore has helped SNCF, the French railway group, design a new reservations system with a magnetic-strip ticket. In addition to being a travel voucher, each ticket provides real-time information on a passenger's movements. SNCF uses this data to adjust routes, trains, seats and fares. On the customer-communications side, Moore has won a contract from a US hotel chain to produce a colour brochure, with a common theme but a different version for each hotel. Mr Braun aims to expand revenues by 10 per cent a year for the next five years, with more than half the growth coming from alliances and acquisitions which broaden Moore's horizons. Such expansion is typified by Moore's recent purchase of a 20 per cent stake in JetForm Corporation, an Ottawa-based specialist in electronic forms technology. formed an alliance with Datamax of Orlando, Florida, to develop a thermal bar-code printer for liner-less labels. Another sign of the 'new' Moore is a Dollars 1bn two-way deal with EDS, the US computer-services and management consultancy. EDS is designing, and will later operate, Moore's internal data-processing system. For its part, Moore will manage EDS's own printing and other information handling requirements. The risk, however, is that some products and services may be ahead of their time. One Moore executive says that 'a lot of customers know they want it, but they're not certain how they're going to use it'. But people no longer hang such epithets as 'stodgy' or 'venerable' on Moore these days. The transformation is set to advance further. Moore plans to raise Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m in debt, lifting its debt-to-equity ratio from an ultra-conservative 6 per cent to about 25 per cent. It is preparing a public offering of shares in Toppan Moore, the big Japanese forms company which Moore owns jointly with Toppan Printing. Mr Braun took another step this month which would have been unthinkable under the old guard. He hired Moore's first vice-president of communications to help get the message across that a leopard can change its spots.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States are still willing to suspend this year's joint  military exercise "Team Spirit" if North Korea allow  satisfactory nuclear inspections, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu  said Wednesday.    "Whether Team Spirit will resume this year depends entirely  upon North Korea," he told a press conference with foreign  correspondents, "whether North Korea allows necessary  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or  not."    The remarks came immediately after defense ministers of the  two countries agreed to go ahead with the annual maneuver in  November if the inspection issue is not settled by then.    Seoul and Washington had announced last month Team Spirit  suspension for 1994 on condition that the IAEA inspection on  North Korea concludes in satisfaction. But IAEA inspectors  reported they were hindered from full monitoring activities and  were denied access to critical sites necessary in guaranteeing  nuclear safeguards.    Han held Pyongyang responsible for the delayed North  Korea-U.S. high-level talks, blaming the Stalinist state for not  keeping its end of the bargain.    "The meeting with the United States on North Korea's part is  not simply a right it has but a favor U.S. can give," said Han,  "IAEA inspection obligation is a basic obligation."    Pyongyang cannot expect the favor without fulfilling this  basic obligation, he told the correspondents.    There are two types of necessary inspections, one necessary  for maintaining the monitoring equipment such as cameras in  operation, and the other for guaranteeing continuity in  safeguards, the part that was left incomplete in March.    "One of the key conditions not met for the 3rd round (of  North Korea-U.S.Talks) is the completion of the March inspection  necessary for continuity of safeguards," he said.    "Inspection itself or promise of inspection will have to  take  place before any discussion between United States and North  Korea." But despite all the frustrations, the international  community still insists on diplomatic settlement of the crisis,  he noted.    "...Despite our frustration caused by Pyongyang's  intransigence, we must continue our on-going efforts to settle  the issue through dialogue," said Han.    Asked about any guarantee of China's consent when the matter  is referred to strong action by the U.N. Security Council, the  foreign minister emphasized that the North Korean ally has  played a positive role in the past through the process of  diplomatic efforts.    "If such efforts all fail, then China will cooperate with  the  rest of the international community in trying to pursue whatever  means possible to make North Korea comply," he said.</p>

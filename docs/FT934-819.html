			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (5): Gulf memories run deep - The foreign policy agenda has changed The 1990-1991 Gulf crisis has proved a defining episode in the evolution of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy. Until Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, senior Saudi officials acknowledge that their attitude to the region and to the wider world was set primarily by the experience of others and by the assertion that the Arabs shared a common heritage. The shock of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, and, as importantly, the reaction of other Arab states and organisations to it, taught the kingdom a lesson which it is still digesting. The first and most important result is that Saudi Arabia now insists, above all, that it must have a foreign policy which rests primarily on an assessment of its own national self-interest. Senior officials argue that before the invasion of Kuwait, the kingdom was susceptible to a foreign policy agenda based on the colonial and post-colonial experiences of other Arab countries. In the three decades from 1960 to 1990 this manifested itself in pan-Arabism, Arab socialism and the belief that the solution to the region's problems lay essentially in ever-closer Arab co-operation. The hollowness of those slogans was brought home to Riyadh by the actions of President Saddam Hussein. 'If the Arab League had been responsible for resolving that crisis, then Iraqi troops would still be in Kuwait today,' comments a Saudi official. Many Saudis remain disgusted by the attitudes adopted by some fellow members of the Arab League, particularly Jordan, Yemen and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. 'We cannot forget, and we cannot forgive,' says another official. 'But there are two things in this life that you cannot escape - families and neighbours.' Accordingly, Saudi Arabia would not rule out an improvement in relations with the PLO, Jordan and Yemen, but it would have to be based on their acceptance of the damage they had done. Equally, there would have to be a fundamental review of both the organisation and the policies of the Arab League before the Saudis could feel confident again of its value as a regional organisation. 'The future effectiveness of the Arab League depends on its ability to articulate a shared and common purpose,' says a Saudi official. 'It is weakened and divided. Basic reforms have to be carried out. Above all, this means that it must give supremacy to international legality.' The Gulf crisis brought home to Saudi Arabia that there was no other path to follow. It now emphatically rejects the concept of a separate 'Arab legality'. The rules of international law have to be applied as much to Arab nations as they are to the rest of the world. The concept that there is a different set of rules for Arabs has been finally buried, along with the former assumption that the main threat to Middle East stability comes from outside the region. 'It did not come from the industrialised world, nor did it come from the ideological confrontation between east and west. It came from within: from the war between Iran and Iraq and then from Iraq alone,' says an official. This, in turn, has led Saudi Arabia to review its attitude towards the provision of aid, or as it was put officially, 'from our policy of acting as the treasury for other people's expenses'. Nothing is more irksome for Saudis than the knowledge that its heavy financial commitment to Iraq during the eight-year conflict with Iran helped President Saddam to acquire the military muscle to invade Kuwait. It will think long and hard before helping any neighbouring country to develop its military establishment, but remains willing to provide assistance 'which could help other countries to build a better economic and political future'. It is an indication of how much Saudi attitudes have evolved that 'a better political future' is also deemed to include greater political pluralism which, had it been practised in Iraq, might have prevented the invasion of Kuwait, or at least led to a military pull-out in the face of western threats. This does not mean that Saudi Arabia is anywhere near advocating for the region the democratic processes of the western world, but officials are keen to stress how much they share the western view of international legality. Suggestions that the kingdom might have become more dependent on the US in particular as a result of the Gulf crisis are rejected, but it is now more openly accepted that a greater commonality of interest has developed between Washington and Riyadh. It applies, with qualifications, to the US 'dual containment' policy towards Iraq and Iran. Insofar as that policy articulates the need for both Baghdad and Tehran to abide by international resolutions, it enjoys Saudi support, but there would be less enthusiasm in Riyadh for any attempt to isolate the two countries. However, the depth of suspicion in Saudi Arabia about Iran's intentions continues, despite cosmetic signs of an improvement in diplomatic relations. Saudi Arabia suspects that the Shah of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini and President Rafsanjani all shared a common desire to be the dominant political and economic force in the Gulf, a view reinforced by Iran's recent unilateral actions in asserting sovereignty over Abu Musa, and the Greater and Lesser Tumbs islands, near the Strait of Hormuz. Saudi Arabia has also welcomed officially the declaration of principles signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington on September 13, but wants to see far more progress towards a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement before it is willing to speculate about any wider implications. In particular, officials are totally dismissive of suggestions by Israel that Saudi Arabia could be one of the next Arab countries to establish formal diplomatic relations. 'They are just dreaming', says a senior official. He is also sceptical about the possibility on an early end to the primary Arab boycott of Israel, while pointing out that Saudi Arabia has already taken steps to phase out the application of the secondary boycott, which discriminates against international companies which do business with Israel. Riyadh is also being cautious over the extent of its financial commitment to the Palestinian interim self-governing authority which will take over administrative functions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in the wake of the Israeli withdrawal or redeployment of its forces. The Saudi Fund for Devel- opment will channel the kingdom's initial first-year pledge of Dollars 100m, designed to improve basic infrastructure such as roads, schools and housing. The fund has also agreed to provide further funds during the five-year transitional phase, but will wait to see the progress that is made in disbursing the initial tranche before announcing the size of further financial support. Officials emphasise that there is no question of the funds being directed to Tunis, the present headquarters of the PLO, another reminder of how deep the Gulf war memories run.</p>

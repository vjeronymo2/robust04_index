			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / US health task force comes under fire: Proposed radical shift in responsibility for medical malpractice is criticised US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's health care task force has come under fire from several directions over its proposal for a radical shift in the burden of responsibility for medical malpractice. The proposal would transfer the burden of liability away from individual doctors and on to the hospitals, insurers or health plans they work with. Doctors have long complained that the threat of malpractice lawsuits drives up their costs and forces them to prescribe unnecessary defensive medical procedures, but the move to 'enterprise liability' proposed by the White House task force, chaired by the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has failed to satisfy them. Insurance companies complained that the shift would not address the underlying problems of escalating jury awards of damages for medical malpractice, and might make the situation worse. 'It just shifts the liability,' said Mr Tom O'Day, associate vice-president for government affairs at the Alliance of American Insurers, a grouping of insurance companies. Consumer advocates are critical of the enterprise liability proposal, fearing it may mean inadequate discipline is applied to incompetent doctors. The shift to enterprise liability rests on the assumption that most people will, after the Clinton reforms, be covered by a health plan grouping particular doctors and hospitals who have agreed to a certain scale of fees, instead of by a general insurance policy that allows them to visit any doctor. A patient would then sue the health plan, rather than the individual doctor. Doctors in the US are estimated to pay about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) a year in liability premiums to cover themselves against the cost of malpractice lawsuits. In addition, some studies have estimated that Dollars 20bn to Dollars 30bn a year of unnecessary medical tests and procedures are prescribed by doctors to guard against any accusation of negligence. Other analysts, however, say that many of these tests would be performed anyway, and that the threat of malpractice suits may have led to better medical care. Critics of the current system say the most severe costs may be invisible: many newly qualified doctors steer clear of specialities such as anaesthesiology and obstetrics because of the prevalence of lawsuits and the higher liability insurance rates. Many communities have to travel far afield to obtain care as a result. Whether the impact of liability suits is exaggerated, public perception is that they are a big factor in rising health care costs.</p>

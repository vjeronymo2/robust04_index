Schneider said the sale was part of its programme to shed non-strategic assets and reduce debt. Simel produces equipment for transmission and electrical distribution networks, and operates in more than 60 countries. The company, which posted 1993 sales of FFr440m (Dollars 81.5m), employs 490 people. AMP, meanwhile, posted 1993 sales of FFr3.5bn and has 29,000 employees.

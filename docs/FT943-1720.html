			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: FT-Actuaries World Indices At its last quarterly meeting, the FT-Actuaries World Index Policy Committee noted the growing number of companies choosing to separate their registration, tax domicile, share pricing, business and stock market listing into different countries. If a sufficient number of large companies can be found that individually satisfy the FT-AWI eligibility criteria, the Committee may consider establishing an International index, allowing such companies to be included in the World Index, although not in any of the existing country indices. The Committee would welcome comments. The Committee ratified its previously announced clarification of the guidelines regarding treatment of certain government holdings in companies. This will be applied with effect from October 1. A change has been proposed (subject to confirmation) in the procedures governing the FT-AWI Large and Medium-Small Cap Indices. Currently new constituents are ranked as Large or Medium-Small on the date that they are added to the Index. This makes it impossible to preannounce Large and Medium-Small Cap Indices changes when this is done for the main FT-AWI series. In order to give users of the Large and Medium-Small Cap Indices the same notice as users of the other FT-AWI indices, the following amendments are proposed: 1. Rank stocks before their effective addition date. These rankings would be 'official' and would not change, regardLess of changes in market capitalisation between the ranking date and the addition date. 2. We currently use a 15-day notice period for the semi-annual re-balancing. However, the changes are implemented 15 days after the beginning of the quarter (January 15 and July 15), leaving no way to preannounce the rankings for the regular quarterly changes. 3. To address this issue, the semi-annual re-balancings for the Large and Medium-Small Cap Indices will be moved from January and July to March and September, with the changes effective from April 1 and October 1. This will enable us to preannounce the constituent changes to the Large and Medium-Small Cap Indices. Other constituent changes in the main series of indices will carry an indication of Large or Medium-Small Cap classification. If implemented, the effect of the change would be to omit the January re-balancing for 1995 and to carry out the first semi-annual re-balance on the new basis in March 1995. The following constituent changes to the Indices were agreed following full market reviews, to take effect on October 3 1994: France. Additions: Credit Local de France; Christian Dior; Poliet; Lagardere Group; Castorama DuBois; Cap Gemini Sogeti; Sidel. Deletions: Elf-Aquitaine (certs.); Salins du Midi; Radiotechnique. Netherlands. Deletions: AMEV; New Rothmans Units; Central Suiker (CSM); Gist-Brocades; Nutricia; Nedlloyd Group; Pakhoed Holding; Fokker. New Zealand. Additions: Fernz; Ceramco; Progressive Enterprises; Skellerup Group. Deletions: DB Group; Tasman Properties; Wilson Neil; Corporate Investments. Spain. Addition: Fomento de Construc y Contra. Deletions: Duro Felguero; Agroman; General de Aguas de Barcelona; Union y Fenix; Esp. a. Tudor. Change to capitalisation weighting: Banco Exterior 100 per cent (from 49 per cent). The Committee confirmed that Thailand and Brazil will be added to the World Indices with effect from November 1 1994, along with a new Americas Index. The World Ex-South Africa Index will be discontinued from the same date, but in response to the wishes of many users of the Indices, the current North America Index will be maintained. All enquiries should be made to Symon Bradford, NatWest Securities Limited, on 031-243-4258 or to Barbara Mueller, Goldman, Sachs Co, on 0101-212-902-6777.</p>

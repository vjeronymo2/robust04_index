The Administration for Native Americans expects an application from a consortium to have goals and objectives that will create positive impacts and outcomes in the communities of its members. In situations where both consortia of tribes and individual consortia tribal members receive ANA funding, ANA expects that consortia groups will not seek funding that duplicates what their member tribes are doing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Projects which should be supported by other Federal funding sources that are appropriate, and available, for the proposed activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Projects that will not be completed, self-sustaining, or supported by other than ANA funds, at the end of the project period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The purchase of real estate (see 45 CFR 1336.50 (e)) or construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Projects originated and designed by consultants who provide a major role for themselves in the proposed project and are not members of the applicant organization, tribe or village.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration for Native Americans will critically evaluate applications in which the acquisition of major capital equipment is a major component of the Federal share of the budget. During negotiation, such expenditures may be deleted from the budget of an otherwise approvable application, if not fully justified by the applicant and not deemed appropriate to the needs of the project by ANA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> K.

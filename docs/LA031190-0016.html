			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> TREKS;  </P> <P> DESERT FLOWER BESIDE THE SEA  </P> <P> AS SAN DIEGO'S largest wildflower puts on a spectacular show this month, it  delivers a message that global warming is nothing new. From late March into  May, the Mojave yucca blooms in Torrey Pines State Reserve amid other plants  from the dry inland desert -- a magical sight to behold in the seaside  Mediterranean climate.  </P> <P> You can spot the Mojave yucca by its sword-shape leaves edged by curling  fibers. In spring, it thrusts out an intricate maroon bud spike that swells  into a luxuriant stalk of creamy, bell-shape blossoms.  </P> <P> Like many a city resident, this yucca is an in-migrant. We know from the fossil  record that it came from afar to join the rare Torrey pine. Both are residents  of the reserve because plants move -- that is, their range expands or shrinks  as climate changes. The pines remain from the last ice age, until perhaps  10,000 years ago, a cool, moist era when forests blanketed the California coast  and its offshore islands. The Mojave yucca remains from the next climatic  episode, a worldwide warming from about 8,000 to 3,000 years ago, at which time  hot winds decimated coastal forests in all but a few spots like San Diego,  which were kept mild by the sea. Wind-borne seeds impelled desert plants to the  future site of San Diego. Six species remain today, with the yucca the star of  the group. Will these survivors have new meaning if another global warming is  indeed on the way? WALTER HOUK  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Observer: On the market The chairmanship of the Securities and Investments Board is proving a bit like the job of secretary of state for trade and industry. It is hard for the incumbent to prove that he has done a good job; it is therefore difficult to recruit the very best talent and then keep it. Sir David Walker, who has decided not to seek a second term, was the establishment figure supposed to correct the errors of Sir Kenneth Berrill's first term. He has simplified the structure and sharpened the focus. But he has not been an unqualified success and several of his reforms have got bogged down. That said, much the most interesting aspect is what Sir David is going to do next. He has just turned 52, he is not ill, nor is he a rich man. He won't be able to survive on the Pounds 500 a year the Bank of England pays non-executive directors. Pen Kent has filled his old job at the Bank and there are no obvious vacancies for a man of his seniority. He might be a long-odds candidate for the governorship but the choice is not going to be made until after the election. A highly-paid private sector job perhaps? Lloyds Bank, for example, needs a successor to Sir Jeremy Morse as chairman. Or perhaps he might want to play a bigger role at that other Lloyd's?</p>

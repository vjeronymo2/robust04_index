			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> CITICORP ISSUE TAKES ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN  </P> <P> Remember the part of the movie "Fantasia" where Mickey Mouse, the Sorcerer's  Apprentice, uses magic to get a broom to carry water for him but then can't get  it to stop? Put yourself in Mickey's shoes, and you understand how John Reed,  chairman of Citicorp, must feel when he contemplates Citicorp's auction-rate  preferred stock.  </P> <P> This is a sophisticated security bought by corporations. Its dividend rises and  falls every 49 days or less at so-called investor auctions. It was a great idea  once, but now it's become an expensive menace -- and as Mickey discovered, it's  not so easy to turn off once you start it up.  </P> <P> When Citicorp, the country's biggest bank company, first peddled auction-rate  preferred five years ago, the stock was as magical as Mickey's broom. Thanks to  a loophole in the tax code, the preferred gave Citicorp very cheap money while  giving the stock's owners a very high return. It was so popular that Citi  peddled 10 different issues totaling $950 million.  </P> <P> But those glory days are gone, with Citicorp in financial trouble and investors  demanding and getting junk-like 13% dividends to buy the preferred. Not only is  the preferred costing Citicorp money that it can ill afford, but it has also  begun generating dangerous publicity, which it also can't afford. Every time an  auction is held and Citi has to pay a usurious rate, it produces more bad press  on investors' doubts about Citicorp.  </P> <P> So why doesn't Citicorp just buy back the preferred stock with the billions of  dollars of credit that it says it has available? Money that would cost less  than 13%?  </P> <P> The official answer is that Citicorp doesn't want to be driven out of any  market for capital. The real answer, I think, is that preferred stock counts as  capital under bank holding company rules, but borrowed money doesn't, and  Citicorp doesn't want to lose any capital, no matter how expensive.  </P> <P> Capital is the money banks must keep on hand to cushion themselves against hard  times; you compute the ratio of capital to assets to determine whether the bank  is sound. Replacing $950 million of preferred with $950 million of borrowed  money would reduce that ratio, which wouldn't exactly thrill Citicorp's  regulators.  </P> <P> How does money costing 13% get to be considered capital? The answer, to  oversimplify, is that Citicorp issued this stuff with a promise to pay  dividends at the going rate, which is determined at an auction every seven  weeks or so. Unlike a bond or note, however, this security has no due date;  it's called a perpetual issue. That means you can't demand your money back from  Citicorp (and which is why the company can count the stock as capital). If  you're holding the stuff and want to get rid of it, you have to hope someone  buys it from you at one of these auctions.  </P> <P> The short-term risk is that if there are no buyers, your short-term investment  could turn into a long-term one. The long-term risk is that regulators will  strip Citibank from Citicorp, making it difficult if not impossible for the  holding company to pay its bills, including the dividend on your preferred  stock. In that case, your short-term investment would turn into a long-term  disaster.  </P> <P> Before we go any further, you need to remember that Citicorp isn't Citibank,  and it's important not to confuse the two. Citicorp, which is the issuer of the  auction-rate preferred stock, is a bank holding company. Citibank, the nation's  largest bank, is Citicorp's main subsidiary.  </P> <P> Even though I think Citicorp could some day stiff some or all of its creditors,  I don't think that Citibank will stiff depositors, even those whose accounts  aren't fully covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The reason: the  FDIC's too-big-to-fail doctrine, under which the FDIC protects all of a giant  bank's depositors, including those with accounts greater than the $100,000  maximum that the FDIC insures. The reasoning is that an uncontrolled collapse  of a giant bank could ruin the nation's economy, if not the entire world.  </P> <P> But too-big-to-fail, as FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said in an interview,  covers banks, not the holding companies that own the banks. The difference is  crucial. Three times now -- when it put big, busted Texas institutions to sleep  -- the FDIC has tried to strip holding companies of their banks, so that the  depositors are protected and holding company stockholders and creditors get  wiped.  </P> <P> Which brings us back to Citicorp and its run-amok preferred. The stock owes its  very existence to a loophole in the federal tax code. Corporations that collect  dividends can exclude 70% of them from federal tax under most circumstances.  Interest, by contrast, is fully taxable. Do the math, and you see that to a  corporation, a 10% preferred stock is as good as a 13.5% bond.  </P> <P> In this case, Citicorp's 13% dividend gives a corporate owner the equivalent of  an 18.5% bond. Which is why corporate treasurers keep buying this stuff even  though it's risky.  </P> <P> The risk of getting stuck is more than theoretical. After Shearson Lehman Bros.  bought some MCorp auction preferred to keep the auction illusion alive,  Shearson got stuck holding paper of a bankrupt company. Holders of Lomas &amp;  Nettleton auction-type notes were similarly burned.  </P> <P> Some other bank companies that, like Citicorp, are in not-such-wonderful shape  have redeemed their auction-rate preferred. These include the parent companies  of Manufacturers Hanover, Mellon Bank and First Interstate.  </P> <P> Citicorp wants people to think that it will call in the preferred soon if rates  on it don't drop. We'll see. But if all else fails, John Reed can try to do  what Mickey did in "Fantasia." Which is to scream loud enough to buy enough  time for a wizard to bail him out.  </P></p>

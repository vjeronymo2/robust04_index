			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METHODIST PANEL ON HOMOSEXUALITY CONCERNED ON HOW WORK IS VIEWED  </P> <P> Members of a committee studying homosexuality for the United Methodist Church  over the next three years are concerned about how their work is being viewed in  the denomination, as well as what their report will say.  </P> <P> This concern was expressed repeatedly during the committee's recent meeting  here.  </P> <P> Committee members "have a real understanding that the issue is difficult and  sensitive," said C. David Lundquist, a committee member and top staff person of  the church's General Council on Ministries.  </P> <P> Some church members who believe that the Bible is clearly against homosexuality  have complained that there is no need to study the issue. Committee members  referred several times to "angry letters" they have received from members of  the church.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Quite Unrealistic'  </P> <P> "To dwell on Scripture alone . . . is quite unrealistic," said committee member  James C. Logan, professor of systematic theology at Wesley Theological Seminary  in Washington.  </P> <P> The committee was created last year by the denomination to study homosexuality  from theological, ethical and scientific perspectives. The committee's report  is due in 1992 to the next General Conference.  </P> <P> The church's official position says the practice of homosexuality "is  incompatible with Christian teaching." The church bans the ordination of  "self-avowed practicing homosexuals."  </P> <P> The committee heard preliminary reports on medical, psychological, sociological  and theological aspects of the issue they will be studying throughout the  three-year period. Leaders from a Denver group, Where Grace Abounds, which  helps persons who are dissatisfied with their homosexuality, addressed the  committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open Minds Urged  </P> <P> Logan and others insisted that it is important for committee members to show  that they are willing to consider many viewpoints.  </P> <P> Several members said they will present the group with information contrary to  the anti-homosexual beliefs of many church members.  </P> <P> In one presentation, a New Testament professor, Victor Paul Furnish of Perkins  School of Theology in Dallas, told committee colleagues that the Bible says  nothing about homosexuality. Biblical references often associated with  homosexuality refer to some homosexual practices rather than a life style, he  explained.  </P> <P> The term "homosexuality" was first used in 1869, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traditional Values  </P> <P> Other committee members criticized some contemporary Christian leaders who they  say promote traditional family values that denigrate single persons and gay  couples.  </P> <P> In response, committee member J. Philip Wogaman, ethics professor at Wesley  Theological Seminary, said the committee does not want its work "perceived as  adversarial to the family."  </P></p>

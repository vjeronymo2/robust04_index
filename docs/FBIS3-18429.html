Mario De Scalzi reports:    [De Scalzi] The Italian Republican Party [PRI] is expelling  part of its history, and the expeller is party secretary Giorgio  La Malfa, who still remains secretary despite his problems over  alleged illegal funding to his party. La Malfa is proposing the  expulsion of the venerable Bruno Visentini, the former president  of the party, Giorgio Bogi, the present deputy secretary of the  party, and Libero Gualtieri. Visentini, Bogi, and Gualtieri  are, according to the party secretary, nothing less than  heretics. Their sin was to choose to ally themselves with the  progressives of the Democratic Alliance, rather than the center  led by Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular  Party]. This comes about despite the fact that La Malfa warned  that this would happen at the last party conference.    The polemic-laden winds that are blowing through Italian  politics and which have divided Socialists, Christian Democrats,  Communists, and many others, have not spared the small party.  However, it is unimaginable to think of a PRI without either  the aristocratic aloofness of Visentini or the English pomp of  Giorgio Bogi.</p>

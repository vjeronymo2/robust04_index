			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WITT CAUTIONS AGAINST CUTTING FRAUD UNIT  </P> <P> The case of the foot doctor who wasn't and offered bogus cures is just one  investigation Bill Newsome recalls. The phony podiatrist ended up in jail.  </P> <P> Newsome, in his more than five years as head of the city attorney's Consumer  Fraud Unit, has seen everything from street scams to fraudulent packaging plans  by Fortune 500 companies.  </P> <P> The unit, formed in 1973 to address citizens' complaints and those from  regulatory agencies, receives 2,000 to 2,400 calls a month. It also faces the  prospect of elimination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Officers Sought  </P> <P> The spending plan for fiscal year 1990, proposed last week by City Manager John  Lockwood, does not include the $535,000 annual budget for the fraud unit.  </P> <P> The cuts, which are intended to allow the city to hire an additional 140 police  officers, would cut $21.8 million from an array of programs over the next two  fiscal years, including $7.5 million in fiscal 1990. Lockwood, who has proposed  a spending plan of $930 million for the fiscal year, could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> If the City Council approves eliminating the fraud unit, the city attorney's  office would still handle consumer complaints, City Atty. John Witt said. But  it "would not be in a position to commit the resources" to consumer affairs the  way the unit does, he said.  </P> <P> "If choosing between a drunk-driving case and a consumer complaint, the  drunk-driving case would receive priority," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposes Across-the-Board Cuts  </P> <P> Witt said he is opposed to across-the-board cuts in his department because it  might affect resources for prosecuting violent crimes. If cutbacks in the city  attorney's office are necessary, Witt said, he would prefer that individual  programs be cut.  </P> <P> "I've always felt (the Consumer Fraud Unit) was a valuable program -- it keeps  the marketplace free. But, while consumer protection is an important aspect,  when you get down to making a judgment call, you have to go with crimes of  violence," Witt said.  </P> <P> The consumer protection unit also investigates unlicensed contractors and  medical services, and violations of the sanitary code. The three attorneys and  three investigators assigned to the unit would likely be absorbed elsewhere in  the department, Witt said.  </P> <P> The unit currently handles civil and criminal consumer fraud cases. If it is  eliminated, the city attorney's office would probably pursue only criminal  cases.  </P> <P> In civil matters, the consumer would be "left to his own devices," Witt said,  even though a civil matter is "usually not feasible for most people."  </P> <P> The loss of the unit, combined with the low priority that would likely be  assigned to consumer complaints, leaves one message if the cuts are approved,  Witt said: "Buyer beware."  </P> <P> In some cases, that might not be enough, said Newsome. Statements on packages  that list weight, volume or unit count are sometimes false, intentionally or  otherwise.  </P> <P> "Some of these packages are shipped all over the United States, and the  consumer is not getting what he pays for," Newsome said. "The only way to find  out is to bring a scale in there. You don't carry a scale with you when you go  to the grocery store. The courts have ruled that consumers should not be  required to bring in scales."  </P> <P> The stiff penalties that the unit can impose on violators are also a source of  revenue for city coffers, Newsome said. About 50 to 100 cases annually result  in settlements. In 1988, about $420,000 in fines and penalties were assessed,  not including restitution paid to consumers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Come a Long Way  </P> <P> "We literally put the money back in their pocket," Newsome said. "We also  monitor people to make sure the money is paid back. I've got cases 10 years old  that are still getting money back" to the consumer.  </P> <P> The unit has come a long way since its inception in 1973. In those days, it  consisted of one attorney equipped with a telephone. Today the unit's  investigators do their own police work and go undercover to corroborate  consumer complaints.  </P> <P> As the number of commercial enterprises and the area's population have  increased, so has the caseload, Newsome said, who also stressed the deterrent  value of the program.  </P> <P> "Word will get out in the industries that a case has been prosecuted. The  deterrent value is immeasurable. Within certain industries, there is an  impact."  </P> <P> In one recent suit, three grocery chains settled false-advertising cases  brought jointly by the San Diego Consumer Fraud Unit and the Los Angeles County  district attorney's office for ads offering "unlimited double coupons." The  settlement June 9 stipulated that the stores -- Ralphs Grocery Company, Alpha  Beta Company and Safeway Stores -- without admitting wrongdoing, are  permanently barred from using the word unlimited in advertisements when the  service is actually limited. The stores paid fines of about $32,000 apiece.  </P> <P> Newsome said the program is also a benefit to legitimate businesses because it  prevents unfair competition.  </P> <P> City Councilman Ed Struiksma said he hopes the council will recognize the value  of the program to the public and not make an issue of whether or not it  generates revenue.  </P> <P> "I feel that it provides people the last line of support against unscrupulous  business practices," Struiksma said. "I'm hopeful that the council doesn't cut  it, period."  </P> <P> The council will hear budget arguments Thursday.  </P></p>

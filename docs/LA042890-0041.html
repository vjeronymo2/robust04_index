			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS, BLYLEVEN COULD GET BURNED  </P> <P> Around the world, children are taught that playing with fire is dangerous.  </P> <P> But in the Southland, the Angels and Bert Blyleven are showing that playing  with fire is funny.  </P> <P> I have seen three times the Angels' TV ad showing Wally Joyner talking about  the Angels' exciting team for 1990. Soon, Joyner is clouded in smoke. The  camera drops to show actual flames licking away at Joyner's shoe, and there is  Blyleven, Mr. Hot Shoe, laughing at his handiwork.  </P> <P> I can just see the smoke pouring out of Little League dugouts this summer.  </P> <P> DAVID A.

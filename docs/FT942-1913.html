			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Birmingham M-way toll inquiry begins The public inquiry which may settle the fate of the first toll motorway proposed in the UK opened yesterday in Walsall, West Midlands, amid expectations that it will hear evidence for between six and nine months. Sir John Fitzpatrick, the government-appointed inspector, heard the opening statement of the Department of Transport, which wants to build the Birmingham Northern Relief Road around the northern and eastern sides of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation to relieve the M6. The new road would run through the green belt from the M6 west of Cannock to Coleshill, east of Birmingham and close to the junction of the M6 with the M42. It would cost about Pounds 500m and involve the purchase of about 1,500 acres of private land. The proposal, which was first made in 1980, has prompted objections from more than 7,000 people. They include representatives of environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth; villagers fearing disturbance and representatives of special-interest lobbies such as the British Motorcyclists Federation. The weight of objections will ensure that - as Mr Gwyn Drake, West Midlands projects director of the Highways Agency, - said: this will be 'one of the largest public inquiries for years'. It will rival in scale the inquiries into the M40, the M1-A1 link road and the East London River Crossing. The inquiry is the second into the relief road. Since the first in 1988, the government has changed its proposals to bring in private-sector finance. It has given a 53-year concession to build and operate the road to a joint venture of Trafalgar House, the UK engineering and construction group, and Iritecna, the Italian toll motorway operator. They modified the route slightly from the transport department proposals of the 1980s. The argument about the need for the road centres on congestion on the M6. Mr Michael Fitzgerald QC, for the transport department, told the inquiry that without the new road 'the conditions which are worst on Fridays will become the norm'. Friends of the Earth, which claims to have gathered 'the most comprehensive alliance against any road in this country', will argue that the road would generate more traffic. It said: 'It's very important that a message goes to the government that they can't build motorways through the countryside any more.'</p>

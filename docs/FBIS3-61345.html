			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Korchynskyy, deputy commander, UNSO, </F> by Oleh Yeltsov, journalist: "Dmytro Korchynskyy: `It's No  Problem for Us To "Put Down" a Certain Number of Persons'"]    [Text] At the end of 1993--by a vote of 294 "for" and  23 "against"--our parliament added three amendments to the  Criminal Code. These amendments provide for criminal liability  for mercenary service, participation in armed conflicts on the  territory of other states, and illegal activity by citizens'  associations. To be sure, everyone understood that these  amendments had been prepared--first and foremost--bearing the  UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces] in mind. The  journalist Oleh Yeltsov addressed some questions to Dmytro  Korchynskyy, deputy commander of UNSO, on this score. Their  discussion is printed below.    [Korchynskyy] The enactment of these amendments can be  regarded from the following two points of view: political and  legalistic.    In our opinion, from the legalistic point of view, these  amendments are inconsistent with--or even  contradict--international norms, the Ukrainian Constitution,  and...common sense. Thus, the law in question provides criminal  liability for participation in international armed conflicts  without the objective of receiving remuneration. Moreover, such  persons are really not mercenaries, but rather so-called  combatants; and they are protected by various international  conventions. Byron, Hemingway, and Che Guevara were combatants.  If they were living in Ukraine right now, they would be put  behind bars for five years. And, in fact, Hemingway would be  sentenced to 12 years because he received payment for his  activity.    A great deal of interest has also been aroused by the  definition of a "militarized formation or unit": It is motivated  by the military principle, which includes authority,  subordination, and discipline; for how else can a troop  formation or sports training be conducted? And so now people  will be condemned for discipline and military training. These  amendments likewise provide for criminal liability for  participating in informal associations. Not even the Bolsheviks  attempted to do this when they were in power. From now on, the  amateur members of a choral group will be taking a chance if  they have failed to register themselves. But it is understood,  of course, that the singers will go on singing, while this law  will be applied to us--the foes of the present regime.    [Yeltsov] Nevertheless, no matter what kind of a thing his  new law may be, it has been put into effect. What moves do you  intend to make in order to cope with it?    [Korchynskyy] I'd like to ask you the following questions:  Who will be the judges? In accordance with what kind of legality  will they proceed when the state itself is utterly criminal in  nature?    [Yeltsov] Critical observations and remarks have been  directed at the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly]-UNSO for quite  some time now. How do you explain the fact that these "criminal"  amendments were enacted precisely at this time?    [Korchynskyy] Everything that is occurring in the state now  must be perceived within the following overall context:  ruination of the credit, financing, and banking system, the  actions of the government directed at incapacitating any kind of  economic life at all.... That is to say, those very same persons  who are attacking the foundations of economic life are also  attacking us. And they certainly do sense the threat--or at  least the genuine inconvenience--which is personified by our  organization. They are moved by a trend to step up the  persecutions of our self-defense forces and the UNA structures  with strikes and free trade unions. The regime has begun to be  agitated by the fact that the working people's actions are  assuming more organized features. An increasingly greater number  of workers are coming to the conclusion that the path of strikes  and trade-union methods alone will not correct the situation.  And--here and there in the localities--a genuine threat is  already being posed to this government.    [Yeltsov] In such cases, what will be your specific actions  in the situation which has evolved?    [Korchynskyy] We are being provoked to take revenge. And,  indeed, it's no problem for us to beat up this or that  bureaucrat, or to "put down" a certain number of persons.  Believe me, we have gained enough combat experience for this  purpose at various points of military confrontation. However, it  is not revenge that we need, but rather victory. We will not  fall into the trap of yielding to such a provocation. If we were  to set for ourselves the mission of overthrowing and ruining  this state, then it would not be hard to accomplish that. We  have experience in acting under the conditions of destruction.    [Yeltsov] Then what is it that you are striving for?    [Korchynskyy] We are for order and a strong state.    [Yeltsov] What kind of a path do you see in order to attain  such goals?    [Korchynskyy] Cooperation and consolidation among the UNSO,  the political power of the UNA, the officer corps, the national  capital, and the independent unions. If such a constructive  force were to be finally and definitively formed, the  present-day regime would be toppled without any bloodshed and  with the maximum legitimacy.    [Yeltsov] But let's turn from the political program to your  orientation with regard to today's legislative space. As of now,  UNSO activity has already been designated or categorized as  illegal. Will your actions be aimed at going underground or at  endeavoring to become legalized?    [Korchynskyy] First of all, we will be utilizing the  possibilities of legal activity. We will try to register our  units in the localities.    [Yeltsov] But if your attempts to become included within the  power structure prove vain and useless, what kinds of actions  will you take then?    [Korchynskyy] It is undoubtedly the case that the potentials  of the MVS [expansion not given] are incomparably greater than  those of the UNSO. I have only a few thousand comrades-in-arms.  But all of them have been tried and tested in combat actions;  they have gathered together and are bonded by their own blood.  In our organization we do not betray each other. That is to say,  we jusge a person by his healthy, human instincts.    But a situation could evolve whereby our organization  couldbe  deprived of its leadership--a leadership which has made no  effort to hide itself from the present-day authorities. And then  uncontrolled actions by our fellows could not be ruled out.    [Yeltsov] But against whom would they take action: against  the government, the parliament...?    [Korchynskyy] On that score I'm sure that it would be an  unmotivated kind of terror. And history has emphasized that  unmotivated terror is the most effective.    [Yeltsov] A great many rumors continue to abound concerning  the existence of reserve supplies of firearms in the possession  of the UNSO.    [Korchynskyy] It would be simply senseless for us to  stockpile such weapons. Practical experience in military  conflicts on the territory of the CIS has attested that arms  should not be gathered in such stockpiles. They will appear as  soon as the need for them arises. We do not need to seek out  weapons--they are all around us.    [Yeltsov] Rumors are also spreading about the existence of a  ruthlessly severe security service in your organization...    [Korchynskyy] The best security system is a sure system of  relations in the midst of the organization itself. And in  connection with underground activity, centralization is even  detrimental.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The National Resistance Army, NRM [as heard], has  announced that it will undertake the second phase of  demobilizing soldiers tomorrow, in accordance with the  resolution of the army council of 26 May 1992 to reduce the army  to an economically manageable size.    In the second phase, 10,000 soldiers are to be demobilized  to  join the 20,000 discharged in phase one, which ended in August  1993. This would bring the total of soldiers who would have been  demobilized under the program by the end of May 1994 to 30,000.  [passage omitted]</p>

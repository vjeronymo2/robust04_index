			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Newcomers take key posts in Lebanese cabinet MR Rashid Solh, the new Lebanese premier, announced his cabinet at the weekend, 10 days after the previous government resigned because of economic unrest. Although two-thirds of the ministers in the 24-member, half-Christian, half-Moslem cabinet served in the previous government, the key posts of economy and finance were given to newcomers. Mr Samir Makdisi, minister for economy and commerce, holds a doctorate in economics from Columbia University and worked for the International Monetary Fund for 10 years before returning to a professorship at the American University of Beirut in 1972. Mr Assad Diab was named minister of finance despite attempts by Mr Nabih Berri, the Shia Moslem militia leader, to secure the post for himself. Mr Diab, an examining magistrate, has little financial experience but his appointment was greeted with relief by Lebanese who admire his record for fairness. The leader of the Phalangist militia, Dr Samir Geagea, was named a minister without portfolio but resigned hours later, saying the government was 'basically the same as the outgoing one'. Although Dr Geagea expressed pessimism about the ability of the new government to reverse Lebanon's economic crisis, he praised the appointments of Mr Makdisi and Mr Diab.</p>

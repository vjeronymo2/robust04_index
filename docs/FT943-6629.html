			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / How To Spend It: Designs for the garden Since I last wrote about Frolics of Winchester, a small company with an individual approach to designing everything the well-dressed garden needs, it has expanded its range. Its chief claim to our attention was its use of a material called Medex, made from a strong and versatile mix of 85 per cent wood fibre and 15 per cent resin. Because Medex lends itself to easy cutting, Frolics developed a series of interesting garden benches and trellising. There is now a much fatter catalogue, a larger range of garden seating (simple and straight, curved, circular for going round a tree, and a corner seat) and tables (round, octagonal refectory and with a variety of bases) as well as bed headboards and decorative facades for window-boxes, both photographed here. The headboards can be custom-made and designed for adults or children. Prices range from Pounds 170-Pounds 280 (excluding VAT and delivery). Frolics sells both the window-box (Pounds 40) and the decorative facade photographed here in dark green, grey green, dark blue or white (Pounds 45, 3-4ft long), or any other colour for an extra Pounds 7. Finally, not photographed, but very dramatic are Frolics' perspective arches they make a striking focal point, particularly suited for small walled town gardens (Pounds 56-Pounds 120).

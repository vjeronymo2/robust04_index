			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luiz Augusto Mendonca from Planalto Palace] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco may sign tonight the  antitrust law, which was passed this afternoon by the Senate.    Shortly after the approval of the law, Senate President  Humberto Lucena and Deputy Fabio Feldmann -- who was the  rapporteur of the bill in the Chamber of Deputies -- came to  Planalto Palace to meet with President Itamar Franco and with  the justice and finance ministers. The meeting has not yet  concluded.    Because the new law establishes that directors and members  of  the board of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense  (CADE) must be appointed by the president of the Republic and  confirmed by a majority vote of the national Congress, President  Franco may issue tonight a provisional measure confirming  incumbent CADE officials so that they may start implementing the  new law tomorrow.    In case of price abuses, the law provides for fines of up to  30 percent of the gross annual sales of large enterprises and  preventive imprisonment for their directors and owners. A large  enterprise is a group that controls 30 percent of the market.</p>

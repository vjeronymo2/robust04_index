The agreement, according to the Russian prime minister,  provides for switching to world prices in trade between the two  countries.    Chernomyrdin noted that in 1994 Russia will be using world  prices in trading with all former Soviet republics, although he  recalled that energy prices for CIS states were differentiated  last year.    The Russian prime minister pointed out that Russia and  Moldova have a good trade balance. Moldova has almost fully  paid for the Russian commodities. It owes only for the energy.    Sangheli added that Moldova is planning to pay its energy  arrears within the next 30 to 45 days.    Chernomyrdin told journalists that Russia is planning to buy  maize, seeds and non-ferrous metals from Moldova and added that  specific trade figures are yet to be determined.</p>

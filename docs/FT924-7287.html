			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM to develop zinc/lead/silver mine MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced plans to develop its MacArthur River zinc/lead/silver project in the Gulf of Carpentaria region of the Northern Territory. MIM said that the ADollars 250m (Pounds 112m) project had been approved following a two-year feasibility study carried out on behalf of the company and a group of four Japanese joint-venturers which collectively own 28 per cent of the project. Mr Norm Fussell, MIM managing director, said the group expected to extract about 1.5m tonnes of ore a year from an underground mine at MacArthur River, producing about 350,000 tonnes of mixed concentrate. The concentrate is expected to contain about 160,000 tonnes of zinc, 45,000 tonnes of lead and 1.6m ounces of silver. Design work is to begin immediately and construction is expected to start early in 1993. Mr Fussell said the feasibility study suggested that world demand for zinc would increase through the 1990s, and that MacArthur would be profitable during cyclical downturns. The McArthur River deposit was discovered by MIM geologists in 1955, but development was regarded as uncommercial until the costs of extraction were significantly reduced as a result of recent technological advances. Mr Fussell said the Japanese joint venturers 'share our confidence not only in McArthur River and Australia, but also in the strategy of investing in high quality zinc mining and processing'. The joint venturers are Nippon Mining (15 per cent), Mitsui (5 per cent), Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (5 per cent) and Marubeni (3 per cent). The project will be managed by MIM.</p>

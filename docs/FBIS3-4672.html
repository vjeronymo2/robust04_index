			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bandar Lampung, Feb 26 (ANTARA) -- The government  has assigned PT [Private Limited] Duma Na Napu in cooperation  with Southern Electric International to construct the 200  megawatts steam-power plant (PLTU) worth U.S.$300 million in  southern Lampung. President/Director of PT Duma Na Napu Soy  Martua Pardede said Friday his company is currently preparing  the proposal to be handed over to the Ministry of Mines and  Energy director-general for electricity. Pardede, after his  meeting with Lampung's deputy-governor Man Hasan, said here  Friday that the proposal is expected to be submitted in May.    The steam-power plant will be built on a 50-hectare site, a  land that has been relinquished by the state-owned electricity  firm PLN [National Electricity Board]. "We are obliged to pay  PLN for compensations only," Pardede said.    In constructing the steam-combined-cycle-power plant, PT  Duma  Na Napu will also cooperate with local contractors such as  Bakrie Brothers and the Wirataman consultants, a consultancy  firm also hired by the Paiton PLTU in east Java.    The Southern Electric International is a giant American  company and manages a number of electricity-generating projects  with a combined capacity of 36 million megawatts, Pardede said.  This capacity is three times the size of PLN's electrical  capacity, he added.    The Lampung project construction will begin late 1995 and is  expected to be operational in 1998. The power-plant will get  its coal supply from Bukit Asam, a coal mining area in the same  province. The location of the plant is adjacent to the Bandar  Lampung Tarahan coal port that has so far served as terminal for  coals being transported to Suralaya's PLTU in west Java. The  Tarahan coal port is able to accommodate 10 million tons of coal  annually, and will be expanded to accommodate at least 12.5  million tons yearly. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans defend EU banana regime against US criticism Caribbean banana producers have told the US trade representative that there is no merit in claims from US producers that the European Union's banana import regime discriminates against US companies and represents unfair trade practices. Responding to charges from Chiquita Brands International, which produces banana in Latin America, and the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association, the Caribbean producers said that, contrary to the claims, shipments by Latin American countries and US companies in that region had been increasing. The charge of discrimination was filed under Section 301 of the US trade act, and was supported by claims that the EU's import regime, implemented in July 1993, discriminated against fruit from Latin America. The import regime gives special access to exporters in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group, comprising about 70 former European colonies, which has a trade treaty with the EU. 'The message we are sending to the US trade representative in reply to its request for a response to the charges, is that there is no merit in the claims made by the US-owned banana companies,' said Mr Owen Arthur, prime minister of Barbados, and chairman of the Caribbean Community (Caricom). In what officials described as a 'detailed' reply to the request of the US Trade Representative, Caricom dismissed the claims of the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association, saying the Hawaiians did not produce enough bananas to satisfy their own market, and did not export any fruit. The community said also that Chiquita Brands and other producers in Latin America had been enjoying growth in the volume of their exports over the past two years, and were unaffected by the EU regime. 'We have only to look at the situation in Ecuador, which will this year export over 3m tonnes of bananas - a record for this country,' said a St Lucian government official. The intervention of the US trade representative in the banana dispute follows months of almost unrelenting attacks on the EU regime by several Latin American governments and by Germany. Caribbean banana exporters claim that a loss of preferences will destroy many island economies, mainly those in the four Windward islands - Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent. 'The Caribbean producers supply 5 per cent of the world banana market and for this the US government risks destroying the democracies of small Caribbean states,' said Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary general of Caricom. Chiquita's sales in 1992 were two and a half times the cumulative gross domestic product of the four Windward Islands, reported another Caricom official.</p>

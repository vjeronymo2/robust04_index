			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar stocks lead advance in shares DEMAND FOR dollar stocks ahead of the outcome of the US presidential election took the London stock market yesterday to around one percentage point under the all-time closing high reached just after the re-election of Mr John Major's Conservative government. Paradoxically, domestic shares remained less confident, overshadowed by the uncertain prospects for tonight's parliamentary debate on the Maastricht proposals. The London market brushed aside the weakness in the US dollar itself, taking its cue from Wall Street's overnight gain and from perceptions that Governor Clinton, leading the opinion polls as voting in the presidential election commenced, would, if elected, act to stimulate the US economy. Share prices opened smartly higher in London on the back of the US buying seen at the close of the previous day. The day's peak of 2,713.4 on the FT-SE Index was reached very early, however, and the gain was cut back at midsession as the dollar turned easier. London resumed its upward trend when Wall Street, after initial uncertainty, edged higher in early trading in its new session. At the close, the FT-SE Index stood at 2,705.6 for a gain of 17.8 on the day. The Footsie reached its closing peak of 2,737.8 on May 11 this year but has not been able to hold above the 2,700 mark since then. The trend was set for the equity market by widespread gains in US-orientated stocks, ranging from ICI and Cable and Wireless to Rank Organisation. Pharmaceuticals, which had been restrained by concern that a new US president might restructure healthcare charges, joined in the advance. Trading volume was boosted by the focus on the big international stocks. The day's Seaq total rose to 586.6m shares, compared with 519.3m on the previous day. Monday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.1bn, maintaining the improved business levels of recent weeks and helping to restore the financial health of the London-based securities industry. However, hints of further staff cutbacks in UK stock market trading firms have continued to circulate in the City this week. The electricity power generating stocks responded to reports that the deal with the coal supply contracts may be signed shortly. But the broader range of UK manufacturing and retail sectors remained under the shadow of the economic recession, reinforced yesterday by the disclosure that the fall in domestic house prices accelerated last month. Firmness in sterling and in government bond prices, reflected in easier rates in London money markets, gave some encouragement to hopes for another cut in UK base rates in the near future. But the stock market has assumed that such hopes must now await the outcome of the Maastricht debate in parliament and could, in any event, be postponed until the government makes its autumn economic statement at the end of next week. While traders were cautious of over-enthusiasm yesterday, pointing out that share gains had been extended in early trading by a squeeze on trading positions at marketmaking firms still bent on keeping tight books, the mood appeared optimistic. However, the fear of a political crisis should Mr Major's government fail to secure support for its Maastricht policies acted as a restraining factor.</p>

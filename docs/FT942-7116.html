			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Rights groups warn on Hong Kong refugees: Tension worsens as the time approaches for Vietnamese repatriation talks Children of Vietnamese asylum seekers held in detention centres in Hong Kong may know little of life beyond the heavy iron gates, but in recent weeks they have seen some horrific things around them: adults tearing open their own flesh with sharpened spears of bamboo and knives, self-immolation and the emaciated figures of hunger strikers. In the past week 65 cases of self-wounding have been reported at the detention centres, and emotions are set to escalate before a key meeting next week in Bangkok to discuss strategies for resettlement and repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers remaining in Asia. Pressure groups are urging the Hong Kong government to move fast to defuse a potentially explosive situation. The government's recent track record is not encouraging. Last month, the Correctional Services Department despatched 1,200 officers in riot gear to move 1,500 Vietnamese from Whitehead Detention Centre, in Hong Kong's New Territories, to High Island Camp, half an hour's bus ride away. The storming of Whitehead was crude, violent and excessive, according to lawyers and rights groups. Buddhist shrines were torn down, women and children kicked and punched, mace sprayed in detainees' faces and teargas fired liberally, they say. These claims, and others, are being investigated by an independent inquiry set up by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor. Human rights groups say at least 270 people were treated by doctors after the storming during which, they say, 557 teargas shells were fired, along with a pepper-fog teargas machine. The government at first admitted to 250 rounds of teargas and 30 casualties. Just over half the 52,000 Vietnamese refugees in camps throughout Asia are held in Hong Kong detention centres. Hong Kong itself already has one of the world's highest population densities at 5,390 people a sq km, and the 1992 agreement struck with Hanoi to repatriate non-refugees seemed a fair solution. However, repatriation is proving a double-edged sword: government figures show it has brought the annual flood of asylum seekers down to a trickle, but the plight of men and women being forcibly returned to a country where they say they would be at risk has provoked indignation in the US and elsewhere. There is little local sympathy. In an economy where the onus for welfare has traditionally been put upon the family, it goes against the grain to see the governments of Hong Kong and Britain together with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees shell out funds on the Vietnamese' upkeep (the total bill for the current financial year is expected to be HKDollars 998m (USDollars 129m). When one youngster, en route to the US after a last-minute reprieve, said he never wanted to see Hong Kong again, an outraged reader wrote to the local daily, the South China Morning Post: 'His remark instils a feeling of guilt among the people of Hong Kong who have been doing more than any other people in the world for the Vietnamese refugees. As for this young man, we provided food, shelter and, not least, the opportunity to seek a new home elsewhere.' Most of those awaiting screening will be rejected as lacking a well-founded fear of persecution in Vietnam: of the 58,491 people already screened, 89 per cent were screened out. Government officials refer to them as 'economic refugees,' despite the fact that Hong Kong is full of maids from the Philippines, sandwich boys from the UK, MBAs from the US and barmaids from Australia. Most of the asylum seekers are packed within the confines of rude bunkers in Whitehead Detention Centre, whose walls are topped with massive loops of barbed wire. In summer the huts are sweltering, in winter freezing. Whitehead faces the sea, but affords no more of a view than Alcatraz. 'They are isolated and insulated,' says Ms Pam Baker, a lawyer who chairs Refugee Concern. 'No independent body goes in there. The UNHCR and the Hong Kong government are in cahoots and have the whole thing tied up. It is pretty claustrophobic, and they don't really know what's going on in there so they make up rumours which go around and spread like wildfire.' Mr Jahanshah Assadi, the Hong Kong chief of mission at the UNHCR, says the recent spate of self-mutilation in the camps is 'quite regrettable.' But what more can he do, he asks. What the UNHCR does is provide counselling. This, it believes, is sufficient and has quashed certain requests by Refugee Concern for lawyers' visits on these grounds alone. Refugee Concern wants it to grant access to concerned individuals, non-governmental organisations and lawyers. It could also sanction the installation of payphones, and it could allow a free flow of information, it says. In short, it says, it could provide some of the amenities already offered to inmates at Hong Kong's Victoria Prison.</p>

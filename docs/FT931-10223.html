			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / SFO loses test case on right to silence THE POWERS of the Serious Fraud Office to compel suspects to answer questions were undermined yesterday after Mr Larry Trachtenberg, one of four men charged over the Maxwell scandal, won the first round of a test case against the SFO. A charge brought by the SFO that Mr Trachtenberg had broken the law by refusing to answer questions during a 'Section Two' interview - during which people lose their right to silence - was dismissed yesterday by Clerkenwell Magistrates' Court. The stipendiary magistrate Mr Christopher Bourke, ruled that because he had already been charged, the former adviser to the late Mr Robert Maxwell had, as the law provides, a 'reasonable excuse' for refusing to answer the SFO's questions. The verdict could significantly hamper a number of the 60 investigations currently being carried out by the SFO. Anyone charged by the SFO could use the same argument as Mr Trachtenberg to avoid answering the SFO's questions under Section Two. While the SFO is not completely bound by yesterday's decision, and any future cases will have to be decided on their individual merits, the ruling leaves the SFO with far less room for manoeuvre in trying to make defendants answer questions once charges have been brought against them. The SFO said only that it was considering the implications of the court ruling. However, it is thought certain that it will appeal against the decision and that the issue will have to go to the House of Lords for a final resolution. During the hearing, Mr Trachtenberg, who was arrested in June last year, argued that he had a reasonable excuse not to answer questions under compulsion since he had already been charged with theft and fraud. Agreeing with Mr Trachtenberg, the magistrate said: 'The accused, knowing he was charged but not what grounds, was demanded on pain of imprisonment to give up his whole case to the prosecutor. 'The Crown, thus provided, and employing the accused himself to their advantage, would furnish their case and proceed to fashion it against him. They thus abandon their burden of proof.' Mr Trachtenberg, who had faced a prison sentence of up to six months, made no comment after the hearing. His solicitor, Mr Rod Fletcher of Russell Jones Walker, said his client's actions in refusing to answer the SFO's questions had been 'fully vindicated'.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Crest Homes bullish about house sales There was some good news for the property market yesterday with the announcement from Crest Homes, the housebuilding arm of Crest Nicholson, that house sales were showing a 10 per cent improvement on the previous year. The increase was offset by the news that house prices were depressed on last year, although Mr Nigel Davies, marketing director, said they had stabilised since the beginning of 1992. Mr John Calcutt, chairman, said at the announcement of the group's results in February that Crest had cut house prices last year to increase sales. Mr Davies said the group had sold 200 homes, which could not be occupied until June. This was higher than the level of the previous year, he said. Crest, which operates in the south Midlands, the south-west and the south, said sales were higher in all regions. The bulk of homes were sold at the bottom to middle price range, between Pounds 55,000 and Pounds 75,000. The company said it expected to complete about 1,500 new homes this year.</p>

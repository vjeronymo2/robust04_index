			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: TI sells non-core activities for Pounds 38m TI GROUP, the aerospace, seals and tubes group, has sold most of the capital goods division of its specialist Thermal Technology business for Pounds 38m to a wholly owned subsidiary of Ruhrgas of Germany. TI expects to receive an additional Pounds 4m for changes in the net assets of the business since last December. The sale will involve a net loss of Pounds 10m after goodwill written off on acquisition is written back through the profit and loss account in line with the new accounting treatment. Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, said the sale was consistent with the group's strategy of concentrating on the three core businesses - Bundy tubes, Crane seals and Dowty aerospace. The Thermal Technology division makes vacuum and other tightly temperature-controlled furnaces for the aerospace and automotive industries. Mr Richard Cropper, commercial director of Dowty Group, which is now part of TI, said Thermal Technology had been considered a core business but the idea has since been discarded. TI started to build the division in 1981 and expanded through the 1986 acquisition of Ipsen.</p>

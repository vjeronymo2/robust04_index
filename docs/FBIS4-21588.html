			<p>BFN     [Text] The Defence Ministry has launched an investigation  into an aborted attempt by two unidentified armed men to steal  sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles from a military airbase and  munitions depot, near Patrai.    Taking advantage of a defective ground lighting system which  had left half the base in darkness, the two men scaled a  chain-link fence surrounding the Araxos military base around  4am, entering undetected. After breaking into a munitions  warehouse, they grabbed a box of what they believed to contain  anti-aircraft missile shells and made for the camp perimeter.    But their escape was foiled by a guard, who shouted for them  to stop. Opening fire on the guard, the two men raced across  the compound and escaped over the fence. With army guards still  in pursuit, they dropped the box in a nearby ditch. It was  later found to be full of empty 20mm Rheinmetall RH202 shells.  Military police launched a manhunt in the surrounding area  while anti-terrorism experts and a forensics team were ordered  to Araxos to aid in the manhunt.    The Defence Ministry has also ordered an internal inquiry  amid questions about possible security breaches at the base,  which includes an airfield for fighter craft, a communications  center and munitions stores.    Ministry sources said preliminary evidence suggested the  botched operation was a sophisticated operation planned by  professionals. News reports highlighted similarities to a  December 1989 rocket snatch from a Larissa base by the November  17 urban guerrilla group but officials did not rule out the  possibility of a simple arms heist.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / A further step towards separatism: The Minsk meeting on the future of the CIS was disunity disguised as co-operation On Saturday, the day after the meeting in Minsk of the heads of state of the Commonwealth of Independent States - a meeting described by the presidents who gave public statements afterwards as 'taking co-operation to a higher level' - Russian news agencies reported that 'patriotic forces' had met in the city of Nizhny Novgorod to establish a Russian-only organisation to 'defend the Russian people'. They also reported that other organisations had met in the same city to hear Mr Gavril Popov, mayor of Moscow, say that the Commonwealth had no future; that the commander of a battalion in Sevastopol was removed from his post by the commander of the Black Sea Fleet for taking an oath of allegiance to Ukraine; that the fighting between Armenians and Azeris in Nagorno Karabakh grew fiercer; and that the president of Azerbaijan, Mr Ayaz Mutalibov - who had left the 'constructive' meeting in Minsk early because of the worsening situation in the region  - was appointed leader of the self-defence forces in Karabakh. The facts of daily life in the CIS render hollow the declarations of Minsk, as they have all other declarations of the two-and-half-months-old body. And though Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the chairman of the Belarus parliament and the host at the Minsk summit last Friday, bravely tried on Saturday to persuade the public that 'the CIS is the structure without which we will never survive', the fact is that soon it will be the survival of the structure itself which will be at stake. All judgments on the proceedings of the CIS should be preceded by the warning: 'as far as can be told'. That is because the information put out after the meetings is confused, rhetorical, accompanied by no written declaration or summary of the agreements reached, and with no explanation of what the aims of the meeting were, and how far they were realised. Within these strict limitations, what seems to have happened at Minsk last Friday was this. All 11 members of the CIS (the three Baltic states and Georgia - in Minsk as an observer - are not members), from the former Union's 15 states agreed to remain under a unified strategic nuclear command. Three of the 11 - Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine - have ceased to pretend that they will take part in a unified CIS army, and will continue to form their own armies. Two states - Belarus and Uzbekistan  - will get out of the CIS united forces as soon as they can. Those left in the unified command for a 'transitional period' of two years are Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan. The last five are very poor, and getting poorer. They are desperate to hang on to what Russia can offer them in the way of cheaper resources and (especially in the case of Armenia) protection. The rest was window dressing or technical. There were some 20 agreements on issues such as economics, energy and transportation links and on the army being able to draw its supplies from all participating republics. Officers are to be given guarantees about their ranks within national or unified forces and assurances about housing and wages. Both what has and what has not been agreed leave vast questions which go to the very root of the Commonwealth - and, more important, to the nature of the independent states themselves. The problems which have arisen from the collapse of the Soviet Union, many of world importance, are so vast and require such courageous and consistent work on their solution that it is no wonder that leaders shrink from them, sign agreements which cannot be honoured and put off until the next meeting (as they have done at every meeting so far) issues which they cannot face resolving. According to those present, the proceedings in Minsk lacked structure and preparation and documents which were barely understood were nonetheless signed. Foremost among the outstanding questions, certainly as far as the world at large is concerned, is the nuclear issue. Though the states have preserved a common line, it remains unclear what their new strategic doctrine is; or, rather, it is clear that such a doctrine does not yet exist. Any doctrine which did emerge would have to make clear whether the nuclear force protected only the four states which hold the strategic weapons or the entire Commonwealth. Since the weapons are no longer to be targeted on the Nato countries - as Mr Yeltsin has said - new priorities would need to be set. (This is also a matter which, in reverse, the west must resolve for its own nuclear forces.) It is by no means certain that the member states of the CIS nuclear alliance will always have the same defence interests, particularly now that the Central Asian states are developing links with countries such as Iran, which may not in future be allies of Russia. By the end of two years, if the statements of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine are carried through, only Russia will possess nuclear arms of any kind. Any state renouncing weapons would have to be very sure that a nuclear neighbour on its border would not one day dispute it. More immediately urgent are the effects of the Minsk settlement in the sphere of conventional weapons. Before Mr Yeltsin apparently agreed to form a common defence force with the five other republics, opinion among Russia's parliamentarians, and many of its senior military people, was that Russia must form its own army in order to stop the breakdown in morale and coherence with which the 'united' force is now faced. Mr Yeltsin was said to be ready to sign a decree on the creation of a separate army; is he now to back away? After all, what has been agreed is that there should be unity for a two-year period of transition, presumably leading to separate armies. It is difficult to see how and why the instruments for a united force should be forged in a short period during which, simultaneously, the member states will also wish to make preparations for individual forces. Even if such a united force can be maintained, there now must be a negotiation (put off to the next CIS summit meeting in Kiev on March 20) on the division of army property to allow those who are leaving to have a basis for their separate forces. This will be highly contentious, especially since Ukraine has a disproportionately large share of tanks and advanced weaponry  -a legacy of its forward position in the defence of the former union. The question of the Black Sea Fleet remains to be settled, largely between Russia and the Ukraine, but necessarily within the context of the Commonwealth since the fleet is formally Commonwealth property. Remarkably, though this has been the main point at issue between Russia and Ukraine for over a month, neither of their presidents - according to Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president - raised it. The underlying question is the crudest: can they trust each other? Territorial questions are everywhere being raised, and are paraded in the national legislatures, much of whose rhetoric is increasingly bellicose, as the old pretences of comradeship are stripped away. Economic crisis envelopes them all, with no relief in sight. It would be strange if populism and chauvinism did not take root and grow. Mr Shushkevich was right to say in Minsk on Saturday that the states had better hang together than hang apart, for they are all in desperate straits. Some of the agreements, on the joint maintenance of transportation and energy links are encouraging. But a further protocol agreed to divide the assets of the former state bank, Gosbank, between them - assets which were in part its republican branches and which have anyway already become the central banks of the new states. Russia monopolises the supply of money and credit, and has laid claim to the gold. What was needed to continue the operation of a common currency zone was a banking union - but it seems this is no longer even to be attempted. Minsk, in short, was a further step towards separatism: disintegration badly dressed up to look like co-operation. The Commonwealth has no independent existence or authority. It has only a tiny secretariat and is able to do nothing between brief and ill-prepared meetings. It may be that the former Soviet states will realise that they must co-operate and create a vehicle for doing so. But that moment has not yet come, and is not in view.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'HAIR' AT FULLERTON OFFERS RETURN TRIP TO AGE OF AQUARIUS  </P> <P> Director Gary Gardner presents Fullerton College's "Hair" as something of a  history lesson, almost a seminar on the Age of Aquarius augmented by a cast of  dozens.  </P> <P> The college's Campus Theatre has been turned into the expected psychedelic  menagerie, brimming with peace symbols, protest signs and longhaired,  bead-swinging kids, all moving to Galt McDermott's rockish score. But Gardner,  with help from Jay Shelp and set designer Bob Jensen, also has a giant  projection screen looming in the background.  </P> <P> The musical begins with images of JFK and LBJ, giving way to love-ins and  demonstrations. Slides of Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Beatles and others flash  in a steady stream. And as the show progresses, we see photos designed to  underscore the action and make it more relevant.  </P> <P> It's not a bad idea. For one thing, it shows Gardner's respectful attitude  toward Gerome Ragni and James Rado's 1967 Broadway hit. "Hair," after all, was  once hailed as a signpost of the times, and was perhaps the first musical to  use rock as the primary impetus for its music.  </P> <P> Beyond that, Gardner is committed to reminding his audience, a large percentage  being Fullerton College students, that the '60s were important and  extraordinary, and that a generation of young people was in large part  responsible. He makes the point too obviously, but there is inspiration at  work.  </P> <P> As a musical experience, however, this "Hair" has too many ragged edges.  </P> <P> The textures are basically right -- the costumes (uncredited) are  bell-bottomed, tie-dyed and sloppy cool, and Jensen's sprawling set, though  messy, incorporates symbols of the times. He's even put a vintage VW bus on  stage.  </P> <P> Gardner falters, though, in the tempo he generates. In most numbers, he opts  for spirited renditions, which make for a generally correct handling of this  antic musical. But just about every scene is offered as a celebratory  freak-out, with the entire cast getting in on it, and that leads to redundancy  and predictability.  </P> <P> As for his performers, Gardner has a spunky group with some decent voices,  although many are still "in training." Jeff Weeks' Berger, the hippy leader, is  sassy and egotistical, just the guy to turn on the chicks and impress the  dudes. In the more important role of Claude, whose being drafted and having to  fight in Vietnam is central to the play, Keith Henderson gives us a glimmer of  the inner conflict he's battling.  </P> <P> 'HAIR'  </P> <P> A Fullerton College production of the Jerome Ragni/James Rado/Galt McDermott  musical.

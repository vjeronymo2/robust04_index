			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Somalia warlords sign pact Somalia's feuding factions signed a pact yesterday to disarm their unruly militias and end the fighting which led to the deaths by starvation of more than 300,000 people, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa. The country's rival warlords, Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Mohamed Farah Aideed, signed the agreement with their allies after more than a week of talks. But few Western diplomats, UN officials or Somalis believe that Somali militias or freelance gunmen will easily surrender the weapons which give them power. Aideed brought the talks to the brink of collapse several times by refusing to attend a national reconciliation conference in March on an equal footing with his rivals. He wants a special status to reflect the major role his militias played in ousting Siad Barre in January 1991, the event that turned an impoverished nation into a patchwork of clan fiefdoms as the warlords battled to succeed him. Eleven rival factions, aligned with Ali Mahdi, agreed this week to sign the ceasefire and pledge to disarm their militias. But adoption of the pact was held up by haggling over who should attend the March talks. The issue was passed to a committee to make recommendations to the UN organisers of the March talks, which are supposed to set up a transitional government, the first national authority Somalia will have had since Siad Barre's overthrow.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Locomotives. Today's proposal has three parts: a program for freshly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured locomotives which will be implemented nationwide; a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for remanufactured locomotives which could be implemented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide or in California only; and a South Coast program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reductions from new and remanufactured locomotives should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievable without causing economic damage to the railroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry or causing a shift of the freight carrying business to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> truck-based forms of transportation. At the same time, it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extend the burden of clean air attainment in California to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locomotive sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will propose a national regulation that will apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> freshly manufactured locomotive engines beginning in 2000, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may also apply to the remanufacture of engines which were made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since approximately 1973. Locomotives may operate for many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decades and be remanufactured many times before they are retired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Extending the application of standards to remanufactured engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will accelerate and extend the overall emission reductions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimates that a national program for freshly manufactured and remanufactured engines would reduce locomotive emissions in the South Coast by approximately 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2010. As the total NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction from all sources required in the South Coast is approximately 70 percent, EPA would like to achieve comparable reductions in this category. The FIP proposes that average engine NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from locomotives and sources directly associated with locomotives be lowered to the new engine levels through use of clean engines, electric power, and other means. California would retain the right to regulate operational changes in railroads, including time spent idling, rail lubrication, operating times, etc. The overall average would allow companies the maximum flexibility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the additional emission reduction target.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Commercial Aviation. Commercial airports become increasingly important in the attainment effort as time goes by. In the South Coast Air Basin, there are five commercial airports which will contribute nearly 9 percent of a 2010 allowable attainment inventory of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 6 percent of VOC if left uncontrolled. The emissions contributions in Sacramento and Ventura are smaller than in the South Coast. Airport mobile sources include aircraft; ground service equipment such as baggage carts; and ground access vehicles such as passenger cars, taxis, shuttle buses, etc. Aircraft are the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dominant source. The percentage contribution and absolute amount of emissions from ground access vehicles in the future decrease substantially as other FIP measures take effect; ground service equipment emits a smaller fraction of the airport total.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FIP proposes an airline emissions bubble comprising mobile emission sources under the control of the airlines. These include aircraft, aircraft auxiliary power units, ground service equipment, captive vehicle fleets, and any other airline-operated mobile source. The FIP proposes declining targets for emissions for all commercial airline operations in the Sacramento area,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura, and the South Coast Air Basin during the ozone season beginning in 2001. The emission reduction requirements are consistent with those proposed for stationary sources under the emission cap program. This level of allowable emissions would translate into an environmental performance factor, applicable to each airline, expressed as an allowable pounds of pollutant per passenger equivalent unit. Airlines which exceed the limit would pay a fee based on the amount of excess emissions generated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a number of ways that an airline could reduce emissions under its control to avoid compliance fees. Higher plane load factors (fewer empty seats), electrifying ground service equipment, towing airplanes to the runway, increased use of single engine taxiing, and bringing the cleanest planes to the California airports all contribute to emission reductions under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP concept. The Agency is proposing that each airline be allowed to average the emissions from its operations at all airports within a FIP area. Such intra-airline averaging could provide airlines with additional flexibility in demonstrating compliance with the emissions target. EPA is also requesting comments on establishing an inter-airline credit and trading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to further enhance compliance opportunities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) General Aviation. General aviation is comprised of a wide variety of aircraft types with significantly different engines: piston, turboprop,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and turbine. Much of the general aviation fleet is old, and there appear to be few, if any, significant technological improvements in emission performance which could be obtained without a large investment in research and development. Currently the general aviation manufacturing industry is also in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a precarious economic state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to achieve emission reduction targets for general aviation which are consistent with the emission cap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for many stationary sources in the FIP areas. EPA is proposing two fee system options in the alternative for achieving the reductions in general aviation. In the first option, aircraft owners/operators would be charged a fee for each takeoff from an airport in the FIP areas. The fee would be set high enough to discourage use without making general aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flying prohibitively expensive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second option is identical to the first, but incorporates an exemption for engines that are certified to ``clean'' emission levels. It is possible that an engine manufacturer may find a differential fee system sufficient incentive to begin producing cleaner aircraft for certification and use in California. The proposal also requests comment on differentiating fees for specific airports based on the implementation of other emission reduction measures by the airport proprietors such as refueling vapor recovery where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Military Installations. Military installations can include a significant amount of mobile source activity. The FIP proposes, with certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions, a military installation bubble in each FIP area encompassing mobile emission sources under the control of the Department of Defense (DOD). This includes auxiliary power units, ground service equipment, captive vehicle fleets, privately owned vehicles, and any other mobile source operated within the boundaries of the installation. A declining cap will be applied which corresponds to the cap imposed on stationary sources within each FIP area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Ships and Ports. Marine vessels are the largest uncontrolled source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and sulfur oxides (SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in California. According to a study prepared for CARB, marine vessels account for approximately 40 percent of all SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 12 percent of all NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from both mobile and stationary sources statewide. While most emissions associated with marine vessels occur at sea, a great deal is emitted while the vessel is in port, during maneuvering and hotelling activities. Both are of concern in the South Coast area, since emissions from vessels at sea are transported onshore by the prevailing winds and can affect air quality, and because there are large ports and significant shipping activity in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not believe that it is practical to pursue a conventional regulatory strategy for marine vessels in the FIP for a number of reasons. Not all ships are equally high emitting, and not all ships spend a lot of time in California ports. An expensive retrofit requirement may serve only to drive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping traffic to competing port facilities where this special technology would not be required. Also, regulation of ocean-going vessels, especially foreign-registered vessels, is traditionally undertaken by international organizations like the International Maritime Organization (IMO). A unilateral action by EPA to require such technology on all ocean-going ships that enter California's ports may be considered inappropriate by the international organizations that oversee such vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

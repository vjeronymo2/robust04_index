			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.V. Medvedev, A.V. Grinkevich, M.I. Gundyak, </F> and V.V. Nikoshin, Optics-Mechanical Manufacturing Plant,  Rostov; UDC 681.75.015.2]    [Abstract] A new telescope has been developed for night  observations at 3-5 mlx background illuminance without  brightening. The objective of this NZT-3 telescope consists of  seven successively smaller lenses on the main optical axis:  convexo-plane first lens; double-convex second lens and  double-concave third lens forming a compound pair;  double-concave fourth lens; convexo-concave fifth lens and sixth  lens; concavo-plane seventh lens. The objective is followed by  an electron image converter tube on the same optical axis and  the latter by an image erector consisting of four compound  lenses on a common optical axis perpendicular to the main one:  plano-concave lens and double-convex lens forming first pair;  plano-convex lens and double-convex lens forming second pair;  convexo-concave lens and double-convex lens forming third pair;  double-convex lens and concavo-convex lens forming fourth pair.  A rotating plane mirror mounted at a 45 angle to each of  the two mutually perpendicular optical axes reflects light  emerging from the image converter into the image erector. A  second such mirror parallel to the first one reflects light  emerging from the image erector into an ocular consisting of six  lenses on a common optical axis perpendicular to the image  erector axis and thus parallel to the main one: plano-concave  first lens; double-concave second lens and double-convex third  lens forming a compound pair; double-convex fourth lens and  concavo-convex fifth lens forming a compound pair; convexo-plane  sixth lens. The light source enclosed with the telescope is a  type-A laser and a beam-forming objective consisting of three  lenses of the same size: plane-convex first and third lenses;  double-convex second lens touching first lens on the optical  axis. The telescope characteristics include a magnification of  at least 5.4, a field of vision angle of at least 5, and a  focusing power within (+/-)4 diopters. The telescope has  successfully passed all tests, including illumination  measurements. It operates with an internal or external 13.5 V  electric power supply and weighs 4.5 kg.

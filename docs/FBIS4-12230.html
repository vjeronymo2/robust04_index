			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 29 Mar (INA)--Ibrahim Ahmad 'Umar,  Sudanese minister of education and scientific research, has  saluted the Iraqi people's militant stand and high resolve under  the leadership of President Saddam Husayn in confronting the  forces of evil and aggression.    During a meeting with Dr. Humam 'Abd-al-Khaliq, Iraqi higher  education and scientific research minister, here today, 'Umar  added that both the aggression on Iraq and the continued  blockade on its people are aimed at stopping scientific,  technical, and military progress and obstructing Iraq's  effective role in defending the Arab nation's interests.    'Umar reaffirmed that the Sudanese people stand alongside  the  Iraqi people in confronting and foiling the aggressive schemes  and conspiracies concocted by the imperialist, colonialist, and  Zionist circles.    The Iraqi minister appreciated the positions of Sudan's  leadership and people alongside Iraq in the battle it is waging  against the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy. He asserted that  the Iraqi people will not forget this stand despite the  pressures and threats that Sudan is facing, which have not  dissuaded Sudan from its genuine pan-Arab positions.    The two ministers discussed issues of joint cooperation in  the field of higher education and scientific research in  accordance with both the cultural agreement signed in 1974 and  the subsequent executive programs. Talks also dealt with the  possibility of reviewing the agreements signed between the Iraqi  and Sudanese universities.</p>

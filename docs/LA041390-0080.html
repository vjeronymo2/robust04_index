			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PUTS A KOREAN DISTRICT OFF LIMITS TO STEM VIOLENCE  </P> <P> U.S. officials put a popular entertainment and disco district in Seoul off  limits to American personnel Thursday in an attempt to stem anti-American  violence and protect U.S. soldiers.  </P> <P> A statement by the U.S. 8th Army for the 43,800 U.S. troops, thousands of  civilian employees and their dependents in South Korea said the Itaewon  entertainment district would be off limits from midnight until 5 a.m.,  effective today.  </P> <P> Itaewon is a shopping and entertainment area several city blocks long near the  8th Army headquarters. Foreign tourists, shoppers and U.S. military personnel  shop there by day, and at night its neon-lit bars and discos draw hundreds of  young Koreans as well.  </P> <P> The announcement apparently was a move to avoid clashes between South Korean  civilians and American soldiers who frequent late-night bars and entertainment  establishments.  </P> <P> Anti-American feeling is strong here, especially among radicals and dissidents  who have demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops, contending that their presence  hinders unification of South Korea with Communist North Korea.  </P></p>

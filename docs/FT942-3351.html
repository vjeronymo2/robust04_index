			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television A varied and enticing night. BBC2's computer series, The Net, investigates the panic about 'computer porn' and its supposed easy access to children and asks whether this reflects reality or adult techno-fear (8.00). Also on BBC2 the 'Screen Two' drama In The Cold Light Of Day has a most impressive cast including Stephanie Cole, Bernard Hepton, Ronald Pickup and Frances Barber. The story sounds attractively weird: switching from the 1930s and the erection of a pylon in a suburban garden in northern England to the 1980s and the revelation of a 'a love that dared not speak its name ..' (9.00). Prior to returning to his native New Zealand, Bryan Gould who may (or may not) be kicking himself for quitting British politics just before the Labour party needed a new leader, appears in Frontline to offer his thoughts on British politics (9.00 C4). Inside Story does not go all the way and question the legitimacy of what Sir Peter Medawar called 'one of the most stupendous confidence tricks of the century' (psychoanalysis) but it does look into false memory syndrome (9.30 BBC1).</p>

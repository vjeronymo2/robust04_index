			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Slimming down to fit a new niche - ICI's exit from polypropylene into BASF acrylics IMPERIAL Chemical Industries just keeps on shrinking. In 1989 Britain's biggest manufacturer had sales of Pounds 13.1bn. By 1991 they were Pounds 12.4bn. Last year analysts estimated that they were Pounds 11.6bn. Yesterday, ICI continued its slimming programme when it exchanged its polypropylene business, with turnover of Pounds 135m, for BASF of Germany's Pounds 60m acrylics operations. For ICI, the long-awaited exit from polypropylene makes sense. The move is part of a wider strategy of focusing on businesses in which the group can compete in Europe, Asia and the US. The polypropylene business, apart from a small Australian plant which ICI is retaining, was purely European. And with only 5 per cent of the European polypropylene market, it was a small fish in a big pond, explains Mr Chris Hampson, board director and chairman of ICI's chemicals and polymers division. An added incentive for ICI is the dire state of the European polypropylene market. 'This deal gets us out of a business in which we have no future and which is in a serious loss position,' says Mr Hampson. Prices for premium injection moulding grades have dropped from DM1,235 (Pounds 508) per tonne in September to DM850 last month. Mr Paul Ray, at London-based Trichem Consultants, says that for bottom grades, such as raffia, prices have reached levels which manufacturers find no longer cover fixed costs, only raw material and variable costs. The industry is struggling with a massive imbalance between supply and demand. Companies saw historic demand for polypropylene growing at 6 per cent a year and started building additional capacity during the late 1980s. 'The market peaked in 1988 when companies could make a decent return,' says Mr Ray. 'Since then it has been bloody awful.' The situation is set to deteriorate. Exxon of the US, and the third largest polypropylene group in Europe, is in the process of bringing on a further 140,000 tonnes in France. Solvay of Belgium is adding 80,000 tonnes, and Montedisson's subsidiary Himont is expected to add 180,000 tonnes in Italy this year. Trichem Consultants expects capacity to increase from 5.31m tonnes last year to 5.5m this year. European domestic demand last year was only 4.2m tonnes. BASF concedes that growth in European demand is likely to slow as the German economy decelerates. Europe cannot export its way out of trouble. Indeed, European exports are falling as new capacity comes on stream in Asia. Exxon reckons that European exports fell by 30 per cent last year, and will fall from 220,000 tonnes a year in 1990 to zero by 1994. Mr Bryan Rigby, managing director of BASF north Europe, justifies buying at such a bleak moment by arguing that strategy cannot give way to short-term considerations. The deal will give the group critical mass, making it the second largest polypropylene manufacturer in Europe, with annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes. 'Polypropylene is not an industry for the faint-hearted,' admits Mr Rigby. 'But it is an interesting material, with a wide range of applications. Its medium-term prospects are bright. The sector has a better than average future and we will have a better than average position within it. If we can't make a success of that then we don't deserve to be paid.' BASF's acquisition is part of a wider restructuring of the market. Last year Shell and Himont, Europe's leading manufacturer, announced a strategic alliance in polypropylene. Austria's PCD and Germany's Huls are in joint-venture negotiations for all their polymer operations. Consultants believe such mergers will only be effective if capacity is shut down. However, Mr Rigby says the German group will keep all of its new capacity. Meanwhile, ICI is building up its acrylics interests, having picked up Du Pont's US acrylics operations in a fibres swap last year. Mr Hampson explains that ICI's acrylics' operations were previously weak on the continent. Although the company was strong in acrylic monomer (the raw material for textiles and plastics) it was weak in downstream derivatives. The acquisition of BASF's two businesses adds such activities. The acrylics market is growing at between 3 per cent and 5 per cent a year - more slowly than polypropylene. However, the market is considerably more fragmented, especially in derivatives. BASF justifies its exit by explaining that the industry was clearly consolidating. For example, France's Elf Atochem recently formed a joint-venture with Rohm and Haas of the US. Mr Rigby believes BASF's operations were too small to compete in the long term. Mr Hampson at ICI reckons both companies believe they have concluded a good exchange. That, he says, is how the best deals are done. Only time will tell if ICI's diet makes it fitter for the future.</p>

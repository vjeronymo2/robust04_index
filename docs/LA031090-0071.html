			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW U.S. SURGEON GENERAL SWORN IN AT WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> Dr. Antonia Novello was sworn in Friday as the nation's surgeon general, and  President Bush made it clear that he expects no letup in the anti-smoking and  anti-drug abuse crusades of her predecessors.  </P> <P> In a brief White House ceremony, Bush saluted the new appointee and Health and  Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, himself a fervent critic of tobacco  use.  </P> <P> "My respect and appreciation of my good friend Lou Sullivan grows every day as  he fights for the good health of our people," Bush said. "In the few minutes  we've been here, 11 people have died from smoking, 390,000 people each year."  </P> <P> Novello said her motto would be "good science and good sense," and she thanked  Bush for an appointment she said should be an inspiration to women and  minorities.  </P> <P> "The American dream is well and alive," said Novello, the first woman and first  Latino to serve as surgeon general. "Once a dream, it is now my pledge: to be a  good doctor for all who live in this great country."  </P> <P> Novello, 44, is a native of Puerto Rico. On hand for the ceremony was the  governor of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernandez Colon, who told Bush: "I'm here  representing the pride of all the people of Puerto Rico at this moment."  </P> <P> Novello, who succeeds C. Everett Koop, is a pediatrician who has specialized in  AIDS and kidney disease in children.  </P> <P> The surgeon general officially is the leader of the 6,500-member Public Health  Service, but Koop and others before him used the post as a bully pulpit to  influence government policy on smoking, AIDS and other health-related issues.  </P> <P> Bush mentioned drug and alcohol abuse and AIDS as among the challenges facing  Novello. "The tasks ahead are difficult," he said. "Because so many of these  problems begin with our children, it is only right that we ask a pediatrician  to help."  </P></p>

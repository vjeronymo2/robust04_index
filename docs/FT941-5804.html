			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Winning streak comes to an abrupt finish: Tracy Corrigan, John Gapper and Sara Webb explain the risks taken by banks and securities houses in proprietary trading While hedge funds have been the scapegoats for recent heavy falls in the world's bond markets, they are not the only market participants to have laid and lost big directional bets. Many banks and securities houses had backed their views on the bond markets with their own capital. This practice, known as proprietary trading, has become much more common in the past few years. Proprietary trading helped boost the 1993 profits of many banks and securities houses, particularly on Wall Street, to record levels. Unless recent losses on European bond markets are recouped, the story could be rather different this year. 'Last year the market was a one-way bet. Banks decided that since they were so good at it, they should put up some more capital this year,' said one trader. The vogue for proprietary trading took off because banks saw the effect on profits of successful dealing at Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs. With bank boards focusing on efficient use of capital, proprietary trading became increasingly attractive - especially as it required only a handful of dealers and few support staff. Nomura International in London, for instance, has started to use its Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) capital for proprietary trading in the same way as the US banks do. 'Using our strong capital is something that we forgot about for a long time,' said Mr Koichi Kane, chairman of Nomura International. 'Now we are putting a lot of emphasis on enhancing our returns on capital. Fixed income trading has been one area that we have been adding to our capability.' One propietary trader said that while his bank aims for a return on capital of about 20 per cent for its ordinary trading activities, it can achieve a 50-100 per cent return on capital used for proprietary trading. For successful traders, the business has proved rewarding. Last year Salomon made Dollars 416m in proprietary trading, compared with Dollars 1.15bn in client business. That was in a relatively poor year, because of a big hit in the US operation. The previous year, which an official described as more representative, the profit was Dollars 1.4bn. One large player, Tokai Bank's London-based operation, has capital of around Pounds 250m mostly used for proprietary trading. 'Our return on capital last year was over 100 per cent and that's because we have a diversified portfolio of trades such as yield curve trades, basis trades and so on,' according to Mr John Clark, at Tokai Capital Markets. However, proprietary trading does have drawbacks: stock market analysts do not like the earnings volatility. Salomon decided to publish its propietary trading results separately because it felt its share price was suffering as a result of uncertainty about that business. Firms such as Salomon and Goldman Sachs emphasise that client business is still their core activity. 'Proprietory trading can play a role in profitability, but it is icing on the cake,' says Mr Fredric Garonzik, managing director for fixed income at Goldman Sachs in London. However, it is acknowledged in the markets that a proprietary trading team can benefit considerably from access to information about what big clients are doing. The extent to which the proprietary trading and ordinary trading businesses are kept apart varies from bank to bank. One proprietary trader at a UK bank said: 'We do not hear about the customer business.' But other houses point out that in a rumour-driven business, it is quite likely that the proprietary trading desk would know and be able to act upon client flows. 'What the bank wants is a combination of the economic view, the smart trader and the comfort of a flow of information from customers,' said one trader. Despite widespread rumours on losses incurred, it is difficult to gauge the overall amount of banks' exposure through proprietary trading. First, no one knows exactly how much money is involved. The very largest players are believed to have as much as Dollars 2bn deployed. In any case, proprietary trading covers two different approaches. One type of trading, known as arbitrage trading, involves taking advantage of anomalies between different markets, and is generally viewed as less risky. But most proprietary traders also use capital to take straightforward punts on the direction of the market. What is clear from the surge in activity in recent weeks is that the consensus in the market was that European bond markets would rally further, based on economic fundamentals. The market was positioned accordingly - but the market was wrong. Some banks also had US yield curve plays, expecting the curve to flatten in the wake of last month's interest rate hike: it steepened instead. Many traders were also involved in convergence plays - based on the expectation that high-yielding European markets would outperform the core markets such as Germany: wrong again. These losses have to be seen in context. Two months into the year, it is too early to predict half-year trading losses. 'I think the losses that have been sustained in February in 'bond land' have been nasty. But they are not so bad against the gains made in 1993 or over the last five years,' said one trader.</p>

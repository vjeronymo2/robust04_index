			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Figures show US inflation in check THE yield on the 30-year benchmark US Treasury bond fell to a 16-year low of 5.85 per cent yesterday following reassuring news on inflation. The Labour Department said producer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and only 0.5 per cent in the year to September. Excluding the volatile food and energy elements, the 'core' producer price index was flat last month. Analysts had expected an increase in core producer prices of as much as 0.3 per cent. The figures indicate the modest pace of economic growth is keeping inflationary pressures well in check. Separate data yesterday on retail sales were also encouraging. The overall increase last month was 0.1 per cent, but the gain in the year to September was 6.1 per cent. The figures are not adjusted for inflation. Sluggish 'headline' sales last month reflected a sharp drop in car sales after strong earlier gains. Excluding cars, sales were up 0.6 per cent. Sales of furniture and clothing rose 1.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively last month. Officials also revised up estimates of retail sales in July and August. Overall, the figures suggest real consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4 per cent or more in the third quarter. 'The economy is looking very good indeed,' said Mr Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, the financial services group. The underlying rate of economic growth was about 3 per cent and there was a 'complete absence of inflation pressure.' However, he warned that fluctuations in corporate inventories, partly reflecting the impact of flooding in the Midwest, would distort growth figures in the second half. Figures for third-quarter growth to be published next week were likely to show expansion at an annual rate of 2 per cent. But fourth-quarter growth was likely to be above the trend at about 4 per cent.</p>

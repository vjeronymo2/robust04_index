			<p>BFN     [Text] What are often emotional, negative statements by  Estonian journalists and politicians about the Russian military  will be a thing of the past after Russia has withdrawn its  troops from Estonia and it will be possible to develop  cooperation with the "eastern neighbor's" armed forces,  Estonia's commander-in-chief said.    "We are neighbors and must live together in peace instead of  threatening each other with our fists all the time,"  Major-General Aleksander Einseln said to Interfax before his  departure for Moscow on Wednesday. At the same time, Russian  military bases and any other form of Russian military presence  in Estonia are "out of the question," he said.    Einseln said one of the main purposes of his trip to Moscow,  where he had been invited by the Russian Defense Ministry, was  to ensure concrete cooperation at the final stage of Russian  troop withdrawal from Estonia. Russia earlier offered to pull  out all its troops by August 31 but linked this to the provision  of residence permits and social security measures for retired  Russian military officers living in Estonia.    Einseln plans to propose setting up a bilateral military  commission to quickly and efficiently deal with any troop  withdrawal problems.    He said he was on "civil" terms with the command of the  Russian forces remaining in Estonia.</p>

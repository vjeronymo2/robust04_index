Figures released by the Trade and Development Board  yesterday  led private sector economists to concede that non-oil domestic  exports in the fourth quarter will be stronger than they had  originally expected.    This is particularly true in the light of official gross  domestic product growth forecast of 9.8 percent for 1993, which  means a 12 percent GDP growth in the fourth quarter.    While the financial services sector is likely to account for  a large part of GDP growth, economists believe the export and  manufacturing sectors must also have done well in the fourth  quarter.    In the beginning of last year, many of them said non-oil  domestic exports would moderate from the second half of the year  due to the high base in the same period of 1992. However, that  did not materialize.    Except for October, non-oil domestic exports continued to  show double-digit growth well into 1993.    Non-oil domestic exports are the most watched export  indicator for Singapore because they point to the health of the  local manufacturing sector.    Economists told BT [Business Times] that the recovery in the  OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)  countries, particularly the U.S., had underpinned the strength  of Singapore's manufactured exports, and growth this year will  continue to be U.S.-led.    Nevertheless, non-oil domestic exports to the U.S. in  November came against the high base the year before, and grew by  only 1.6 percent.    Similarly, exports to the EC, which led the export boom in  late 1992, contracted by 0.1 percent in November.    Ray Farris, economist with Crosby Securities, cautioned  against intrepeting the U.S. and EC markets as being "dead".  "Part of the OECD restructuring has led to the relocation of a  lot of industries. So Singapore may be supplying disk drives,  semiconductors and peripherals to Hong Kong and Taiwan, which  are then ultimately used in the U.S. and EC," he said.    In November, exports to Hong Kong and Taiwan grew by 20.7  percent and 30.3 percent in volume terms respectively. Non-oil  domestic exports to these second-tier markets have had some of  the best showings last year.    Overall, non-oil domestic exports grew in November due to  the  increased demand for integrated circuits, disk drives,  microcomputers, printers, computer parts and peripherals as well  as picture tubes for colour TVs.    On the other trade fronts, the volume of domestic oil  exports  rose by 19.3 percent, but falling prices kept the rise in the  value of oil exports at just 2.4 percent.    Total trade volume rose by 11.4 percent, while the value of  total trade grew by 11.2 percent to $22 billion [Singapore  currency]. The trade deficit narrowed to $1.1 billion.</p>

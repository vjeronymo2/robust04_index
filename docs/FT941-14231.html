			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Car output rises to 20-year peak UK car production rose 6.5 per cent last year to the highest level since 1974 with the help of growing output by the Japanese carmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda. Nissan is expected to emerge as the leading British car exporter for last year ahead of Rover, Vauxhall and Ford. The increase in UK car output to 1,375,523 from 1,291,880 in 1992 was in sharp contrast to steep declines in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Production is forecast to rise further this year in spite of weak demand in export markets. The increase last year was supported by recovery in new-car demand in the domestic market, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Production for the UK market rose 19.9 per cent to 842,647. Output for export declined 9.6 per cent to 532,876, accounting for 38.7 per cent of total UK car output last year compared with 45.6 per cent in 1992 and 48.9 per cent in 1991. Car production in December alone fell 8.8 per cent to 86,928 from 95,301 in the same month a year before, as several producers imposed short-time working to cope with weak demand in continental European markets. 'The slow move out of recession by the UK economy does not compensate for a dearth of orders from the rest of Europe,' said Mr Roger King, SMMT director of public affairs. 'There is little sign of this situation improving in the near future.' UK car production is forecast to rise steadily through the mid-1990s as output grows at the new Japanese car plants in Britain. The Toyota and Honda plants have just completed their first year of production, and output is expected to rise sharply again this year. Nissan said yesterday that its output had risen by 37.6 per cent to 246,278 from 179,000 in 1992. Nissan has been forced to abandon the second shift and reduce the workforce at its Sunderland plant since early November in response to weak sales in continental Europe. The company said yesterday that it expected to resume working three of its normal four night shifts a week from the beginning of March. Output this year is expected to fall to between 200,000 and 240,000. The company said yesterday that the workforce at its car plant had been cut to 4,250 at the end of December from 4,600 at the end of October. The plant is expected to lose 550 to 600 jobs - about 12 per cent of the workforce - through a voluntary separation package begun in November. UK commercial vehicle output fell sharply last year by 22.2 per cent to 193,414 from 248,453 a year earlier, the SMMT said yesterday. December production fell by 25.4 per cent year-on-year to 11,243.</p>

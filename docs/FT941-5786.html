			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gecas chief resigns to form new company Mr Colm Barrington, president and managing director of GE Capital Aviation Services, has announced his resignation from the company to form his own Dublin-based aircraft management company. Mr Barrington said that he plans to merge his new company 'with a major international investment company' which will provide the finance for a new fleet of aircraft, which will then be leased. He said that he had been considering his move for some time, and had an agreement with Gecas that he would review his position after four months. Mr Herb Depp was recently appointed worldwide chief executive of Gecas. Gecas was set up in November last year as a wholly owned subsidiary of GE Capital Services, following the restructuring of GPA, the Shannon-based aircraft leasing company. GPA had run into serious financial difficulties following its aborted 1992 flotation. Under the restructuring deal, Gecas acquired 44 aircraft from GPA for Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 920m), while the remaining 420 aircraft in the GPA fleet - still owned by GPA - came under Gecas management. GPA yesterday announced a third-quarter loss of Dollars 18.2m, making total losses of Dollars 48.6m for the nine months to December 31. The company reported outstanding debts of Dollars 5.8bn and a net worth of Dollars 195m. Mr Barrington joined GPA in 1981 and had been a key figure in arranging the finance for the fleet during its rapid expansion. He also developed GPA's aircraft securitisation programmes which contributed Dollars 1.5bn in revenues to GPA. In 1992 he was also appointed GPA's chief operations officer.</p>

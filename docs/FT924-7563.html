			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Heavy-handed Ida - Opera The new Gilbert and Sullivan offering at the Coliseum, a heedlessly energetic blending of the crass, the coarse and the witless, sets the seal on a discreditable era of operetta performance at the English National Opera. At this season's end the company's artistic triumvirate of Peter Jonas, David Pountney and Mark Elder, 10 years old, will be folded up; and no doubt many eulogies on the theme of Ten Glorious Years are already planned to accompany their departure. Most of these will be richly deserved; but this lamentable Princess Ida affords the opportunity - irresistible to any critic worth his salt - of getting in early with a discordant note. For, following on Orpheus in the Underworld, The Mikado and last season's Fledermaus, it cruelly confirms the judgment (in Opera magazine) of the theatre critic Michael Billington: 'ENO, brilliant at cracking the tough nuts of the operatic repertory, (has been) fatally heavy-handed with the lighter stuff.' It is as though the desire to do these works - and, no doubt, to squeeze badly-needed box-office juice from them - has clashed somewhere with the strain of almost puritanical didacticism that has informed many of the company's 'tough nut' successes over the last decade. All the above-mentioned productions - even The Mikado, lightest-fingered of them - have relied on elaborate feats of design as a method of satirical point-making. The tradition that in operetta the comic powers of the leading players serve best as articulators of entertainment has very largely been abandoned. And with it have been sacrificed the fizz, the glow of pleasure, above all the edge of satire which these shows have been so cumbersomely constructed to hone. Princess Ida, perhaps the most lumpish of the lot, is Ken Russell's first production in a British opera-house. (The celebrated film director has already gained a reputation for creating opera 'controversies' on the Continent.) The style is McGill postcard crossed with Carry On carry-on. The time is 2002, the location a Buckingham Palace reduced to a theme-park called Buck'n'Yen (geddit?). King Hildebrand is a Charles look-alike with big ears (the theme-park logo); Gama and his three sons are Japanese, with jokes to match; his daughter Ida is mysteriously Occidental in appearance, and her Castle Adamant adherents variously don boots, leather and lace. (The strict logic of farce is not something Russell and his designer James Merifield seem to have bothered about overmuch.) I laughed three times in Act 1 - at the camp antics of Hilarion's companions Cyril and Florian, at the waterslide out of the palace, and at Richard Van Allan's nicely observed Hildebrand-as-Charles body-language. Thereafter I slumped in disbelief, and tedium, ever greater, at the sheer incompetence of the stagecraft - the bad blocking, the messy finale line-ups, the placing of key singers so far upstage that their dialogue needs amplification, the weakly distracting routines during arias, the air of provincial panto that takes over the end. The whole thing seems to have been got up as a New Look at a work - since Gilbert's 'Respectful Perversion' of Tennyson's The Princess has developed a reputation for unacceptable anti-feminism, apparently such a thing is required. Yet, reading the libretto earlier in the day, I was struck by just how newly topical its struggle of the sexes could prove to be, in a production more alert to wit, more concerned with comic character, less lame-brained in its knockabout. At least the finesse, elegance and charm of the music - this is one of the richest Sullivan theatre scores - are conveyed; we owe this demi-miracle to Jane Glover in the pit, and to her knack of keeping the rhythms and textures fleetly flowing in defiance of all the production clunking. One performer, Geoffrey Dolton as Florian, lights up the stage with his zest and sparkle. It is sad that so many others of ripe and proven talents are shown off so disadvantageously: the bright-toned young soprano Rosemary Joshua in the title role, Mark Curtis (Hilarion), Anne Collins (Lady Blanche), Anne-Marie Owens (Lady Psyche), and, as the Sushi-King Gama, a distressingly unfunny Nickolas Grace. Princess Ida, Coliseum, WC2; in repertory until January 21</p>

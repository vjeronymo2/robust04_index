			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Bus group to run passenger service on BR trains STAGECOACH, Britain's biggest private bus operator, is to become the first company to operate a regular passenger service on British Rail. It will charter two carriages from InterCity on overnight trains between Scotland and London. The Perth-based company aims to develop a market among people who would not normally travel by InterCity trains. It will promote the service in Scotland and charge fares below InterCity's standard single and return rates. The service starts with the introduction of British Rail's summer timetable on May 10. The two carriages, containing 115 seats and decorated in the company's livery of white with blue, yellow and red stripes, will be attached to a regular night train which travels from Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh to London. Stagecoach will operate a free coach service taking passengers from Inverness, Aviemore and Perth to join the train at Edinburgh. InterCity says it will receive a guaranteed income from Stagecoach. The deal means that seated accommodation on the night train from Aberdeen to London will be retained. It was to have been dropped with the introduction of the new timetable on May 10, leaving only sleeper accom-modation. Stagecoach staff will travel on the trains and will serve hot meals. Tickets for the Stagecoach service will be available from British Rail, bus stations and travel agents. Mr Brian Souter, chairman of Stagecoach, has said he would like to run his own trains on InterCity tracks, although this is prohibited by existing legislation. He said yesterday this idea was 'still a possibility for the future'. Stagecoach dropped its coach service between Scotland and London 2 1/2 years ago because its reliability was impaired by traffic congestion on the English motorways. Mr Chris Green, managing director of InterCity, said that the deal was 'a classic case of a joint venture between InterCity and the private sector'. British Rail says it is the first time a private company has operated passenger train services on a regular basis, although BR frequently charters trains to outside organisations on a one-off basis. Stagecoach is the most aggressive and successful of the private bus companies which have sprung up since the bus industry was deregulated in the 1980s. It operates in many parts of Scotland and owns bus companies in Hampshire and the north of England. It is involved in running bus services in Malawi, Kenya and Canada, and has a stake in a joint venture in Hong Kong for leasing buses to China. It had sales of about Pounds 100m in 1990.

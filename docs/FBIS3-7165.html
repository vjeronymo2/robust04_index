At a hearing of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs  Subcommittee under the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Lord  said, "Frankly, we were surprised at the reaction. We are sorry  about it. We think it was exaggerated beyond its significance."    U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asian and  Pacific Affairs Thomas Hubbard made a speech at American  University on Feb. 25 in which he stated that the United States  advocated the repeal of South Korea's National Security Law,  which prohibits any unauthorized contact with North Korea and  any public statements or acts sympathetic to the North Korean  regime.    The remarks came under immediate fire as unwelcome  interference in Seoul's internal affairs. Hubbard drew even  more criticism because he was chief U.S. working-level delegate  to nuclear negotiations with North Korea.    Lord said, "Mr. Hubbard's speech at the time was  overwhelmingly pointing to the good relations with South Korea,  the positive steps they have been taking, including in democracy  and human rights. And he in the course of that stated we  believe that it would be better if the National Security Law  were repealed.    "He had no desire to interfere in South Korea's domestic  affairs. He is a very good friend of South Korea and he  believes, as we all do, they have made tremendous progress, and  it's symbolized by President Kim, a 30-year dissident, being  president."    Lord said he did not want to exaggerate the issue's  importance again.    "I really would like to make the point that the South  Koreans  should be praised for their advances toward democracy and human  rights. And this should not obscure that."    He added, "I do note that I believe that since the speech,  the South Koreans are now considering repealing the provision."</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early loss recovered in modest trading volume - Market Report A good recovery was made by UK stocks from early falls which reflected concern over both the setback in Tokyo equities and also the disclosure last weekend of the impending tax burden due to fall on UK shareholders in April when the November Budget measures take effect. Shares were helped by a favourable response to the latest industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The rally, which reduced the fall in the FT-SE 100 Index from nearly 22 points to only 2.8, followed a similar recovery in other European stock markets. The UK insurance sector provided a lead for London following reports that Union des Assurances de Paris said it was seeking to increase business in Britain, which was translated by UK investors as suggesting bid moves. Overall, the stock market lacked conviction. After opening steadily, in spite of Tokyo's 4.9 per cent fall, the Footsie edged ahead 3.2 points. But 3,478.4 proved to be the top of the day and equities turned down as stock index futures reacted to the initial weakness in Germany. But London responded readily when the German bond market rallied and, heartened by a firm opening on Wall Street, which in early dealings appeared set to maintain its recent strength, the fall in the Footsie was largely eliminated. The final reading showed the index at 3,481.4, only just under Friday's all-time closing peak. Seaq volume slipped to 800.2m shares from Friday's 979.7m, and traders said that the market was unexciting yesterday. However, Friday's Pounds 2bn total of retail, or customer, business confirmed that underlying business in equities remains high. Retail turnover for last week totalled Pounds 10.9bn, the best weekly figure for several months. High levels of retail volume have provided the confidence which has enabled the market to extend its gains since the beginning of the month. The second line issues represented by the FT-SE Mid 250 Index had another calmer session, following the hectic activity seen in the middle of last week. At 4,100.9, the Mid 250 Index was 4.9 off at the close. Renewed strength in sterling encouraged those investors looking for an early cut in domestic base rates, and in turn counterbalanced the effects of the April tax increases which prompted a political squabble at the weekend. The final picture in the UK market was somewhat mixed, with a handful of blue chip names buoying a market which appeared very uncertain. Tax increases are regarded as a serious threat to an economic recovery which still seems sluggish. This week brings further trading news from leading retail stores for the all-important Christmas season. Good results yesterday from John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based newsagent and stationer, acted as a curtain raiser for the sector, but were not seen as a guide to such specialised clothing retailers as Next and Burton, which also report on trading this week. Most of the financial sectors continued to make progress but there were signs of profit-taking among the utilities, which have been advancing on dividend hopes. Consumer shares were mostly lower as investors weighed the implications of the April tax moves. Food retailers, unsettled afresh by reports of profit margin pressures, saw some selected selling.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dragoljub Stankic] </F>   [Text] Following NATO's threat to the Serbs in Bosnia, the  General Staff of the Yugoslav Army today organized a news  conference. Colonel Dragan Vuksic, deputy head of the  Department for Cooperation with International Organizations,  commented on NATO's ultimatum and decision to carry out air  strikes. Dragoljub Stankic reports:    [Stankic] NATO's decision is not a surprise and is in line  with the decisions made by that organization at its sessions of  2 and 9 February. This was stated by Colonel Dragan Vuksic. In  his view, the decision is controversial in both the language in  which it was written and the content itself. However, the most  important thing is that if the decision were to be carried out  in the way envisaged, all peace efforts would be annulled and we  would enter a new dangerous stage with unforeseeable  consequences, Colonel Vuksic stressed.    [Begin Vuksic recording] NATO's decision, if it is indeed  that, represents a precedent in international relations and is  virtually making NATO equal or superior to the world  organization. As far as we know, on the basis of the agreements,  consultations, and mandates given to NATO hitherto, this  organization does not have the right to make decisions on air  strikes, preventive air strikes, and on punishing, carrying out  reprisals against the warring sides, unless it was given a clear  task by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] as to what side is  violating what has been agreed, and how it is doing it, how it  is not implementing what has been agreed on.    This was not done in this case, and NATO, with its decision,  is threatening to disturb the system of relations, the current  system of relations in the world organization, and to abuse, use  the world organization in order to implement or carry out acts  that would mean not only the end of peace operations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the escalation of the war conflict  on the territory of that former Yugoslav republic, the Balkans,  and perhaps further afield. [end recording]    [Stankic] Colonel Vuksic stressed that he did not know what  the real aim of the decision was, but that it represented a  dangerous precedent, and that he hoped that such a decision  would not be carried out after all.    In reply to correspondents' question whether the Yugoslav  Army would respond if air strikes did take place, Colonel Vuksic  said:    [Begin Vuksic recording] The Yugoslav Army has its tasks and  it must follow the situation and react to the events in the  surrounding. I would like to remind you of the principled stand  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that we will not obstruct  in any way peace activities of the United Nations and other  members of the international community involved in the  settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. Such an act would certainly  not constitute a peace effort, and, as I said, it would  contradict everything that has been done and achieved so far.  The behavior of the Yugoslav Army, of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, and other international and other interested parties  would primarily depend on the behavior by the side that would  take such an action.

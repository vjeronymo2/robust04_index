			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Altus maintains stance on Costain purchase ALTUS FINANCE, the French bank, yesterday said it wanted to continue with its Dollars 245m (Pounds 172.5m) purchase of the Australian mining interests of Costain, the UK construction group, in the hope of a successful appeal against a court injunction blocking the deal. Costain agreed to sell the mine last year to Altus, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank. However, the transaction hit trouble when Peabody, the US coal subsidiary of Hanson, obtained an injunction against the sale on grounds that Costain had allegedly agreed to sell its Australian mines to Peabody for Dollars 200m, much less than Altus is prepared to pay. An Altus director said the French group had a binding contract for the purchase, with agreements from both sets of shareholders and the Australian authorities. Costain has appealed against the injunction, granted by a US court last month. Altus is waiting for the result of Costain's appeal, likely by the end of March, before deciding on the next step. 'We are awaiting the result and do not wish to interfere in a matter in which we have no say. This is between Costain and the judge. It is a complex issue,' the company said.</p>

If defendants have not accomplished the divestiture required by section IV of the Final Judgment by April 29, 1994, defendants shall notify plaintiff of that fact. Within ten (10) days of that date, or twenty (20) days prior to the expiration of any extension granted pursuant to Section IV(B), whichever is later, plaintiff shall provide defendants with written notice of the names and qualifications of not more than two (2) nominees for the position of trustee for the required divestiture. Defendants shall notify plaintiff within ten (10) days thereafter whether either or both of such nominees are acceptable. If either or both of such nominees are acceptable to defendants, plaintiff shall notify the Court of the person upon whom the parties have agreed and the Court shall appoint that person as the trustee. If neither of such nominees is acceptable to defendants, they shall furnish to plaintiff, within ten (10) days after plaintiff provides the names of its nominees, written notice of the names and qualifications of not more than two (2) nominees for the position of trustee for the required divestiture. If either or both of such nominees are acceptable to plaintiff, plaintiff shall notify the Court of the person upon whom the parties have agreed and the Court shall appoint that person as the trustee. If neither of such nominees is acceptable to plaintiff, it shall furnish the Court the names and qualifications of its proposed nominees and the names and qualifications of the nominees proposed by defendants. The Court may hear the parties as to the qualifications of the nominees and shall appoint one of the nominees as the trustee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. If defendants have not accomplished the divestiture required by section IV of this Final Judgment at the expiration of the time period specified in section IV(A) and IV(B) of this Final Judgment, as applicable, the appointment by the Court of the trustee shall become effective. The trustee shall then take steps to effect divestiture of the drilling fluid business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. After the trustee's appointment has become effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the drilling fluid business. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to a purchaser acceptable to plaintiff at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of section VIII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court shall deem appropriate. Defendants shall not object to a sale of the drilling fluids business by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objection by defendants must be conveyed in writing to plaintiff and the trustee within fifteen (15) days after the trustee has notified defendants of the proposed sale in accordance with section VIII of this Final Judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendants, shall receive compensation based on a fee arrangement providing an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, and shall serve on such other terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe; provided, however, that the trustee shall receive no compensation, no incur any costs or expenses, prior to the effective date of his or her appointment. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from a sale of the drilling fluid business and all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services, all remaining monies shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture of the drilling fluid business and shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the drilling fluid business, and defendants shall develop such financial or other information relevant to the drilling fluid business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

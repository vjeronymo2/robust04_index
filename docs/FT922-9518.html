			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / OFT blow for Lloyds' plan to buy Midland THE OFFICE of Fair Trading plans to recommend that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission examine Lloyds Bank's proposal to buy Midland. It does not, however, believe the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation bid for Midland raises competition issues worthy of extended investigation. The disclosure of the OFT's view by a senior government official will come as a blow to Lloyds. It has been hoping that both its plan and Hongkong Bank's bid would be examined by the MMC. Lloyds has said it would only convert its takeover plan into a fully fledged bid if the MMC looked at the takeover approaches of both banks. The official stressed that the OFT had not made a final decision. By the end of the week it should have submissions from all three banks on the competitive issues raised by the takeover proposals. It will review these documents next week and make a recommendation to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. However, OFT officials have had meetings with executives of all three banks and they have already assessed the effect on banking markets of both takeover proposals. The OFT believes that the Lloyds' approach may have a detrimental effect on competition in small business loans. The OFT decision on Lloyds and Hongkong Bank will be the last one taken by the director-general, Sir Gordon Borrie, who retires in June. Mr Heseltine has not instructed Sir Gordon to review the takeover by any other criteria than those he has been using for the past eight years which give the highest priority to competitive issues. In the Hongkong Bank case, the OFT believes it will not have the leading role in making a recommendation on whether there is a threat to competition. It has been told by DG4, the European Community's competition authority, that jurisdiction over the Hongkong Bank takeover offer is likely to rest with DG4. A decision is expected in the coming week. The government official said the question of which body has jurisdiction on the competition question may be less important than Lloyds believes. If the OFT were to have jurisdiction, the official said, it would not recommend that the Hongkong Bank bid was scrutinised by the MMC. Mr Heseltine does not have to follow the recommendation of the OFT. But in the past 16 years, Mr Heseltine's predecessors have done the opposite of what the OFT has recommended on only 14 occasions. On just two occasions have they ordered an MMC inquiry when the OFT recommended against one. Mr Heseltine could ask the MMC to investigate whether a Hongkong Bank takeover of Midland would be against the public interest for reasons other than competitive ones. But this would not be easy for him. If the EC decides it has jurisdiction on the competitive aspect of the Hongkong Bank bid, Mr Heseltine could ask for a separate UK review of whether the takeover was a threat to Midland's depositors. However, he would have difficulty making such a request, because the Bank of England has already said it does not believe Hongkong Bank's bid would put Midland's depositors at risk. Mr Heseltine could also argue, under Article 9, that the Hongkong Bank bid raises general issues of national concern and should therefore be reviewed in the UK. However, the European Commission has to date been reluctant to comply with requests for national reviews of takeovers under Article 9. Lloyds is putting pressure on Mr Heseltine not to deprive Midland shareholders of its takeover proposal by making a reference. However, the government official hinted this argument was unlikely to influence the government. Lloyds' condition that the bid will only be made if there is no MMC reference is self-imposed, he pointed out, and can therefore be dropped.</p>

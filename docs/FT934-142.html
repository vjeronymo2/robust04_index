			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dutch stocks flat A flat market in a flat country held back two Dutch-related stocks. In the two and a half trading days that the London market was closed the Amsterdam CBS Tendency Index was held back by options related business and German selling. As a result, magazine publisher Reed International, the UK-quoted element of Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier fell 13 to 894p. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food group, fell 2 to 1213p. However, Shell Transport, the UK component of Royal Dutch Shell, rose 5 to 723p. She is seen as the safe haven in a perilous sector dogged by falling oil prices and the obvious choice for fund managers needing to maintain a sector weighting. US investors remained unmoved by prospects that Reuters Holdings, the news and electronic information group, might buy the Globex share dealing system and continued to sell the stock. Overseas selling meant that by the start of trading in London yesterday, US-traded American Depositary Receipts were priced at the equivalent of 1837p. The UK shares were marked down accordingly and were virtually flat until the late afternoon when further US selling drove them down again to end the day a net 36 lower at 1828p. Banks stocks were driven sharply higher by a combination of a squeeze on marketmakers' short positions, increasing hopes of another reduction in UK interest rates and optimism over an improvement in the UK housing market. The latter was emphasised by a report from the Halifax building society which forecast a five per cent rise in house prices in the UK next year. The steep rise in the Hong Kong market over the Christmas period was said to have propelled HSBC shares 36 to 946p and helped push Standard Chartered 16 firmer to 1247p. Lloyds Bank was the pick of the other bank stocks, closing 26 better at 684p, closely followed by Abbey National, 22 to the good at 518p, NatWest which settled 20 1/2 up at 628p and Barclays rose 12 to 645p. TSB was a lone weak spot in the sector, closing 2 easier at 244p as recent buyers of the shares, primarily on hopes of early news of asset sales and on growing optimism about the bank's January 13 preliminary figures, switched into other banks. Insurance stocks were left behind by the market's upsurge. Euro Disney shares, savaged on the Paris Bourse during London's closure, plummeted to a record low of 328p before stabilising and closing 15 off at 358p; turnover in London was a paltry 78,000 shares. Dealers said the stock price had been mauled by suggestions that banks were being offered Euro Disney debt at a substantial discount and by rumours that the group's parent company, Walt Disney, was beginning to distance itself from Euro Disney's financial problems. Attempts to drive the share prices of many of the FT - SE 100 constituents higher to help activities in the derivatives areas of the market were said to have involved Allied Lyons, which shot up 28 to a peak 693p on turnover of 2.5m. News that Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, will hold on to its 40 per cent stake in Wellcome for the time being added to general enthusiasm for the internationally traded stock which closed 16 higher at 667p. There had been worries of a glut of stock coming into the market and depressing the share price. Fisons, which recently sacked its chief executive and announced closures and redundancies to restore shareholder confidence, bounced 15 to 128p following an end of year newspaper recommendation. Demand for British Steel sent the shares up 4 1/2 to 127p on economic recovery hopes. Pulp and newsprint group Bowater fell 14 to 469p on continued profit-taking. An announcement that the British and French governments had agreed to extend their concession on the Channel Tunnel to Eurotunnel, the operator, came after the market closed but the shares had already lifted 23 to 563p. In spite of their yield attractions, shares in international conglomerate Hanson managed failed to participate in London's stock market surge and rose only a penny to 273 1/2 p.</p>

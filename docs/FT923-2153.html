			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: Time to remove UK monetary policy from political arena Sir, I am the managing director of an engineering company producing machinery for the plastic industry. We export about 80 per cent of our output all over the world. I feel the time has come for somebody in industry to speak up and stop the meddling of politicians with exchange rates, interest rates etc. To put UK manufacturing companies on an equal basis with our competition in the European Community, the sensible thing to do is to establish one rate of interest for all countries in the Community and one monetary unit (be it an Ecu or any other denomination). If this is achieved it will stop the foreign exchange speculators making huge profits, as they do at the moment with the present system. It will also stop a country in the Community devaluing its currency, which obviously gives it an immediate advantage over its competitors in other countries. F Marshall, Speedex (Engineering), Hodgson Lane, Drighlington/Bradford, West Yorkshire, BD11 1JS</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Outlay on British Library to drop after 1996 - Department of National Heritage Planned spending by the Department of National Heritage will drop between 1995-96 and 1996-97 because of a projected reduction in spending on the British Library's new building at St Pancras. In a statement the government said spending for 1994-95 would be Pounds 976m, Pounds 998m in 1995-96, dropping to Pounds 971m in 1996-97. The Arts Council grant will increase plans by Pounds 800,000 in 1994-95, and by Pounds 1.6m in 1995-96, giving a grant of Pounds 186.9m. This level of grant will be maintained in 1996-97. The Crafts Council grant will increase by Pounds 100,000 over current plans each year, rising to Pounds 3.2m in 1994-95 and Pounds 3.3m in 1995-96 and 1996-97. Annual expenditure on the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme (BSlS) will rise over this year's figures by Pounds 300,000 in each of the next three years. Since 1984, Pounds 23.7m of government investment will, by the end of the current financial year, have produced Pounds 48.3m in new sponsorship for the arts. The department directly finances 17 institutions including the Museums and Galleries Commission. The department has made its allocations to individual institutions so that over the planning period no individual institution experiences a cut in its provision and some see substantial increases. As a result, work can begin on a number of key areas - on the replacement of the Natural History Museum's Spirit Building and of the Motive Power Depot at the National Railway Museum in York, and on the redevelopment of the south hall of the Horniman Museum. In addition, in recognition of success in attracting money from the private sector, the Tate Gallery will receive more than Pounds 2m over three years to help with the relocation of their stores, and with the development of the north-west quadrant at Millbank, the National Gallery will receive Pounds 1m in 1996-97 towards the cost of redeveloping their North Extension, the British Museum will receive Pounds 1m in the final year for the development at Bloomsbury, and the Imperial War Museum will receive a total of Pounds 600,000 in the first two years for conservation. Provision for the St Pancras project readjusts spending plans within total planned expenditure of Pounds 450m. Provision has been made in the library's grant-in-aid for 1996-97 to ease the financial pressure caused by the move from Bloomsbury. The grant for English Heritage for 1994-95 remains at the increased level which was agreed last year. The settlement allows work to start on the Albert Memorial in 1994-95. This is the result of an offer by English Heritage to make available up to Pounds 1m next year fiom savings achieved through their forward strategy. That strategy will permit further funds to be transferred fiom overheads to direct spending on the heritage. Over the three-year period a total of Pounds 15m will be available for fire prevention measures in the Historic Royal Palaces, following up the recommendations in Sir Alan Bailey's report. The baseline for the Royal Household is restored to the levels planned before the 1992 public expenditure survey. This will cover the government's share of the cost of restoring Windsor Castle. It will also allow the Royal Household to continue speedily with its Pounds 15m programme to implement the Bailey recommendations on the occupied Royal Palaces. Work on the joint venture project for a new Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds is about to start. For 1994-95 Pounds 3m will be allocated rising to Pounds 6m in 1995-96 and 1996-97. The funds will be provided fiom the Historic Royal Palaces Agency baseline. An additional Pounds 2.5m over the next two years has been made available for the tourist boards in recognition of tourism's importance to the economy. The budget for the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme for sport is to be increased by 10 per cent from Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.3m. This recognises how successful the Sportsmatch scheme has been in attracting private sector sponsorship for grassroots sport during its first year of operation. The new budget continues in 1995-96 and 1996-97 and should generate matching funding from the private sector. The Sports Council's grant-in-aid for 1994-95 will be slightly less in cash terms than this year's allocation. However, the decision not to proceed with the previously announced restructuring of sports administration gives the council greater flexibility in allocating its resources and we would not expect there to be any significant adverse effect on the work of the council. Moreover, the paymaster-general announced on July 22 that a VAT exemption for the supply of certain sporting services by non-profit making organisations was under consideration. This should be of significant benefit for voluntary sports organisations and further details will be available in the New Year. The grant to the British Film Institute, as already announced, shows a substantial increase in 1994-95 when Pounds 2m more than in 1993-94 will be provided. That figure continues in the following two years. This will focus on enhancement of the rate of duplicating decaying nitrate film, some re-equipment and an expansion of the off-air television recording programme. The European Co-Production Fund was set up for a three-year period in 1991. Over that period it received Pounds 5m. The government has announced that the fund will be extended for a new three-year period and will receive a total grant of Pounds 6m. This will give the fund an opportunity to develop and build on its successes in supporting co-productions between European partners.</p>

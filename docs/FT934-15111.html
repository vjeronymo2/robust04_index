			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Brierley investment vehicle bids for brewer GUINNESS Peat Group, the UK-based investment vehicle for Sir Ron Brierley which is now listed in Australia, yesterday launched an ADollars 18m (USDollars 12m) bid for a Queensland-based beer company, Power Brewing - saying that its ultimate plan was to wind up the company. Under the offer terms, GPG proposes to pay 44 cents a share for half of each investor's shareholding in Power. GPG has been building a stake in Power, which is currently 8.3 per cent. Full acceptance of the offer would take GPG's interest to 52 per cent. If it wins control, GPG plans to negotiate the end of a joint venture between Power and Carlton and United Breweries, and then liquidate Power or 'otherwise return funds to shareholders'. Sir Ron claimed yesterday that the business was 'essentially uneconomic', and that the offer would give shareholders an immediate premium for part of their holdings, and then participation in 'an orderly phasing out of unprofitable trading operations'. Power Brewing urged shareholders not to sell until the company had considered the offer further, and described the bid price as 'seriously inadequate'. Power's shares closed up 3 cents at 45 cents.</p>

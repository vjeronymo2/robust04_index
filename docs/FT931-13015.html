			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US and EC negotiators make a date WITH A key deadline for the conclusion of the Uruguay Round fast approaching, the new top trade officials of the US and EC have set February 11 as the date for their first meeting. Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic affairs commissioner, had hoped to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, this week. He is keen to maintain whatever momentum has been achieved before a March 2 deadline by which President Bill Clinton would have to inform the Congress a deal has been done to get congressional approval without amendment. Sir Leon's spokesman yesterday said the meeting had been delayed to allow Mr Kantor to assemble his new team. In the US, Sir Leon's haste is seen as a pressure tactic designed either to push a new official before he gets his 'sea legs', or as an attempt to shift the blame for the Round's failure to the US. Sir Leon is accused of 'overstating the areas of agreement'. Miss Barbara North, director of the coalition formed by business groups to lobby for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said Mr Kantor had had 'absolutely no time' to put his staff together and study his options.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Observer: Inside job Expect musical chairs at Pechiney, the French state-owned aluminium and packaging group, where chairman Jean Gandois is rebuilding his recently depleted executive team. The top slots in French business and politics are becoming almost as peppered with ex-Pechiney executives as with alumni of Saint Gobain, the glass and pipes group, long regarded as the training ground for France's industrial elite. Last week Jean-Louis Vinciguerra quit as finance director to become a managing partner of the Paris arm of the Rothschild banking empire. He is just the latest in a distinguished list of Pechiney defectors. Martine Aubry, daughter of Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, left as Pechiney's social affairs director last year to become labour minister, while the year before that saw the departure of former managing director Jean-Martin Folz to become general manager of Eridiana Beghin-Say, the Franco-Italian food group. And don't forget that other old Pechiney hand, Bernard Pache - the new boss of Bull, the state-owned computer maker. So the new faces on Pechiney's executive committee will be worth watching in the years ahead. No clues yet as to who they will be, though the word is that they will be insiders.</p>

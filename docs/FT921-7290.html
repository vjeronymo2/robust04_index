			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds sets the pace 1.1) It would be easy to jump to the conclusion from Lloyds' results that its days of outperformance against the bank sector are numbered. Bad debt provisions at 2.3 per cent of loans were somewhat worse than the market expected, which bodes ill for Midland's results next week. Lloyds' loan book has shrunk by nearly 10 per cent, admittedly because of exchange rate effects and disposals as well as sliding UK credit demand. The main force driving up operating profits thus remains the remorseless squeeze on costs. Consider the looming competition in life insurance from Abbey National and National Westminster, and one might think the best news is already in the price. That could yet be rash. Even though provisions will be steep again this year, costs will remain under pressure: more jobs are to go and the savings from last year's cut of 8,500 staff will be felt for the full year. The shrinking loan book has boosted Lloyds' capital ratios substantially. If National Westminster's experience has been similar, that could lift some of the rights issue and dividend worries surrounding its shares. But Lloyds itself stands to benefit whatever happens to the economy. It has room both to expand in a recovery and to maintain or even increase its dividend if one does not materialise - especially given the reserve of untapped profits from its over-generous developing-country debt provisions. Assuming that low inflation holds down loan growth, Lloyds might sooner or later find itself in the unusual position of having a chronic surplus of capital. The question, then, is whether even its disciplined management would be tempted down a ruinous acquisition trail, though at some stage a few extra outlets for the insurance products would doubtless come in handy.</p>

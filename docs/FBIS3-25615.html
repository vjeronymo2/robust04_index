Over the last 24 hours the  Rwandan capital, Kigali, has been the scene of street clashes,  and in political terms things are not going well; the  transitional parliament and government have not yet been  installed.

Willy  Claes's remarks are targeted equally at the forces of President  Habyarimana and the opposition. Last weekend Willy Claes was in  Kigali and he sent a very firm message to the Rwandan  politicians by threatening the suspension of western aid.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lower new vehicle sales cut Frank Gates to Pounds 1.32m FRANK G GATES, the east London-based Ford dealer, yesterday announced a 45 per cent drop in 1991 pre-tax profit, from Pounds 2.39m to Pounds 1.32m, and a dividend cut. The share price shed 8p to close at 71p. Turnover fell from Pounds 70m to Pounds 56.3m. The company said about half of this was caused by the fall in new vehicle sales, with the rest split between used cars and the effect of selling most of the contract hire business in 1990. Car sales had suffered mainly from the shrinking of the new car market, with a little extra disadvantage from Ford's declining share. Trading profit fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 1.34m, mainly because of the slump in new cars. Profits from used cars and parts and servicing were similar to 1990. As the group had rid itself of Pounds 6m borrowings linked to contract hire, interest costs plummeted from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 163,000. This meant that the profit figure was about Pounds 140,000 up before exceptional gains. In 1990 these amounted to Pounds 1.37m because of the disposal. By the year-end, net debt had grown to Pounds 3.5m, about 15 per cent gearing, following investment in a large site at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. The group only pays a final dividend and this was cut by 18 per cent to 2.25p, in line with the fall in after-tax profit. The Gates family, other directors and connections own about 56 per cent of the equity. On a lower tax rate, earnings per share were 4.87p (6.51p).</p>

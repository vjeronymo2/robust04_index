			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Costain Costain's record in recent years is an unmitigated catalogue of woe. From the disastrous foray into UK housing to the unfortunate double-sale of the company's Australian coal interests, the management's decision making has proved poor. Shareholder value has all but evaporated and net assets have fallen from Pounds 422m in 1988 to Pounds 72m at the last year-end. Even that was after a Pounds 77m rights issue in 1991 and presupposes that the Spitalfields site can bear the weight of its own valuation in Costain's books. Investors saddled with this history will still probably opt for the Hobson's choice of throwing good money after bad in the vague hope of recovery. The alternative is watching their existing investment suffer slow strangulation by its debts. At least the last rights issue was accompanied by a fat yield which has since gone the way of all flesh. Any dividends now seem a long way off. Considering the violence that has been done to shareholders' funds, it is surprising that Mr Peter Costain, the chief executive, apparently still carries favour with the investing institutions - and all the more so since the recovery tale lacks conviction. The construction business remains the company's base, though in very competitive markets. Yet the recovery must come in North American coal, where Costain is up against very formidable competition from the likes of Peabody. Other chief executives have paid the ultimate price with better records. Yesterday's five-for-four issue might have been more palatable had Mr Costain announced that he was seeking a successor.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: Why quality still counts - What makes the 90s house special IN THE field of interior design things have been stirring. As we move deeper into the 1990s all those totems of the eighties-style interior, the chintz, the flounces, the bibelots, the general air of luxe, are now seriously demode. Nineties houses are airier, fresher, simpler. Quality, not quantity, is what really counts. All this, of course, is hard on those who managed to scrape together enough to pay for the last lot of chintz just in time to learn that it was - hey-ho  -out of favour. The good news, though, is that the currently fashionable interior, with its emphasis on simpler, fewer things of genuine quality, is not only likely to give more lasting aesthetic pleasure but also to be, in the end, cheaper on the pocket. Do not, though, mistake simplicity for conformity. Simplicity, in decorland, has various moods. In its most urban, most sophisticated and most extreme form it leads to the bleakness of the minimalist interior, almost impossibly bereft of the sort of visual comforts that most of us have become accustomed to. No room there for the funny little vase your child made at pottery classes, the strange glass tree the lady-what-does produced at Christmas or the slightly naff ornaments that your in-laws are so fond of giving you. Simple also means ethnic - not the old rough and ready ethnic of the macrame plant-holders and the crudely woven baskets, but the sort of sophisticated ethnic exemplified by Global Village's products and about which I wrote last October. Tables from Rajasthan, forged iron and antiqued rattan chairs from Asia, painted furniture from New Mexico. Nearer home simple also comes in classical mood, all calm and light, softened by flowing fabrics and natural or gently painted woods. New England-style, too, with its dislike of ostentation, its emphasis on fresh cottons and solid wood, on wrought-iron and folk-art is right in tune with the current mood. Most sensitive designers have already responded to the new feeling in the domestic interior - Tricia Guild of Designers' Guild, for instance, has just brought out a collection of sofas, chairs and ottomans which she shows almost entirely upholstered in plain stripes and ginghams. From a designer who originally made her name with a collection of some of the most ravishingly pretty florals ever seen outside a garden this speaks volumes. Photographed here below are just some of the ingredients that go to make up the new 1990s-style interior.</p>

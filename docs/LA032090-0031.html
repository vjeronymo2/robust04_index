			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REFINERY, SEWAGE PLANT FUMES DRAW  COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> Separate releases of strong fumes drew complaints in El Segundo Monday from  residents and office workers near the Chevron Oil refinery and the city of Los  Angeles' Hyperion sewage treatment plant.  </P> <P> Near the Hyperion plant, residents complained in the morning of respiratory  troubles and eye irritation.  </P> <P> One woman was treated at a Hawthorne medical center.  </P> <P> A plant inspection revealed that a scrubbing device used to remove hydrogen  sulfide gases had malfunctioned, said Don Goodroe, Hyperion's superintendent of  operations. But the source of the fumes could not be pinpointed because the  odor that residents said they smelled had dissipated by the time fire and air  quality personnel had arrived, authorities said.  </P> <P> At the Chevron refinery, a leak of liquid containing foul-smelling sulfur  compounds drew numerous complaints about 1:30 p.m. from residents and office  employees up to a quarter-mile downwind, an El Segundo Fire Department official  said. No medical help was sought.  </P></p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (24): Group E - Italy Italy's manager, Arrigo Sacchi, is spoilt for choice. And if he carries on as he did in the qualifying tournament the very richness of his squad may prove Italy's undoing. In his first two-and-a-half years in charge Sacchi picked more than 70 players. Entering the World Cup it is still not clear what he thinks his best team is. Will he play Roberto Baggio in midfield or in attack? Even though Robberto Mancini (Sampdoria) has dropped out, Sacchi still has attacking decisions to make. Will he pick goalscorer Giuseppe Signori (Lazio) - small, quick, skilful, ferocious shot - or Daniele Massaro (Milan)  -small, quick, skilful, ferocious shot - or both? Or will he opt for the height of goal-shy Pierluigi Casiraghi (Lazio) or the creative talents of Gianfranco Zola (Parma)? The permutations are endless and Sacchi seems to have been trying to run through them all. - Sacchi revolutionised Italian football when he managed AC Milan. His team combined traditional Italian skills with an up-tempo, pressing approach. Under his coaching the team won the Italian league and two European Cups. Now he wants the national team to play his system. There is little doubt that this works. But, as he says, if he can persuade 22 players to fit into one system it will be an Italian record'. Sacchi is astute enough to know that if Italy are to fulfil their potential and challenge for the World Cup he will need to find a settled team with settled nerves.</p>

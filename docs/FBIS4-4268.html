			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Guangheng (1728 1639 5899) and Li Minghuan </F> (2621 2494 3562): "The Necessity and Possibility of Establishing  Sino-Russian Transnational Economic Cooperation Zones"]    [Text] Regionalization of the national economy and  internationalization of the regional economy are the two  important characteristics of the current economic development of  the world, which run parallel and supplement each other. In the  process of its economic development, China has failed to take  these two essential elements into account for a long period,  making many regional issues related to national economic  development unable to proceed and issues related to  transnational regional cooperation still difficult to be truly  resolved.    Transnational economic cooperation zones are the product  which has emerged in the long development process of the world's  economic special zones following the continuous strengthening of  the tendencies of transnationalizing and diversifying the major  participators of the activities. Building transnational  economic special zones by two countries and even three countries  together can be deemed as a new trend in the current development  of the economic special zones of the world. During the post-war  development of the world economy and international economy,  regional conglomeration of the economy is the major form of  international organizations that suits the internationalization  of economic activities. It is usually reflected in four  development layers, namely tariff union, common market, alliance  in economy and currency, and economic integration, which is also  called "economic community" or "economic ring." However,  regional conglomeration of the economy faces great limitations.  Contrary to this, transnational economic cooperation zones have  many characteristics and advantages that the regional  conglomeration cannot compare with. Judging from the current  conditions, they may be regarded as the best choice of the  organizations suitable to regional economy. First, the form of  transnational economic cooperation zones is not limited by the  difference in the economic development levels of the various  sides concerned because, due to their different economic  development levels, they can learn from each other's advantages  to make up their deficiencies and supplement each other to  achieve common development. Second, transnational economic  cooperation zones are free zones opened to the whole world,  which, instead of being exclusive, welcome and actively draw in  the countries and regions other than those in the regional  conglomeration to participate and invest in building plants and  to conduct international trade and other forms of economic  cooperation to promote economic development. Third,  transnational economic cooperation zones reflect the relations  between the local interests of a country and the interests of  other countries. Through the transfer of some rights and  interests, they enable some localities of a country to achieve  economic development and also promote the economic development  of the entire country. Transnational economic cooperation zones  are easier to establish because they do not influence the nature  and the overall situation of the countries which build the zones  and are restricted less by political and other noneconomic  factors. This has also been proven by history.    Theoretically speaking, transnational economic cooperation  zones are very feasible. Heilongjiang's transnational economic  cooperation zones, which are being planned, have been provided  with some necessary and also basic conditions.    1. The superior geographical condition. Heilongjiang and  Russia share a border as long as 3,026 km and have groups of  ports that have convenient transport facilities and  corresponding counterpart ports in each other's side. Among  them, the pair of Heihe and Blagoveshchensk cities and the pair  of Suifenhe city and Pogranichnyy possess the best conditions  and strength and can exert the widest influence. They are  regarded as the ideal places to build transnational economic  cooperation zones.    2. China and Russia strongly need each other economically.  This is reflected in the complementation of their industrial  compositions and structures of essential elements. Such a high  degree of complementation and mutual need are bound to lead to  the large-scale circulation of the manpower and material  resources and even funds of both sides. The emergence of  transnational economic cooperation zones, which epitomize such  circulation, then becomes natural and necessary.    3. With border trade as the channel, the economic ties  between some localities of China and Russia have become  increasingly closer, and border trade has tremendously  influenced and even promoted the economic development of both  sides. Such increasingly closer economic ties have laid a  foundation for the localities of China and Russia to establish  certain types of economic associations and transnational  economic cooperation zones.    4. Heilongjiang and the Far East Region of Russia constitute  an important component of the northeast Asian economic region.  Not only are they famous for their abundant resources and  tremendous economic development potential, but also they possess  the geographical advantages as areas in the development region  and areas linking with international transportation lines.  Building transnational economic cooperation zones in  Heilongjiang and Russia will draw the great interest and active  participation of northeast Asian countries and other relevant  countries and regions.    5. A most direct effect of transnational economic  cooperation  zones is that they help bring in international advanced  technology, managerial expertise, funds, and trained personnel.  The very purpose of building Sino-Russian transnational  economic cooperation zones is to bring the largest possible  number of commodities, equipment, raw materials, technology, and  trained personnel of China, Russia, and other countries into the  zones by creating a more relaxed, stable, and advantageous  regional and international market, so that the zones will become  the centers and hot spots of northeast Asian international  economic cooperation, more effectively realize the large-scale  circulation and overall coordination of the essential elements  of production, and then promote the development of Sino-Russian  economic and trade relations to a still higher level and sphere.    Based on the above-mentioned analysis, we maintain that it  is  not only necessary but also possible to set aside certain areas  in Heilongjiang's Heihe and Suifenhe cities and Russia's  Blagoveshchensk and Pogranichnyy for the establishment of  transnational economic cooperation zones. The tentative pattern  of the development of the zones may be as follows. Starting  with the areas set aside, developed, and managed by China and  Russia independently, China and Russia, aimed at their common  prosperity, based on their natural economic ties, and backed by  the active participation and support of the international  community, gradually build relatively independent, complete, and  integrated markets in these areas, establish joint organizations  and managerial institutions in the process of developing  infrastructural facilities, establish a coordinated system for  division of work and cooperation based on commodity trade, and  enable the areas to establish natural economic ties through  division of work and cooperation, so that the economy of the  areas set aside by both sides will be integrated, and the areas  will ultimately become unified and complete transnational  economic cooperation zones in the true sense.</p>

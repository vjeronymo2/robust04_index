			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> VOTERS TO GET $400,000 IN O.C. POLL-GUARD SUIT;  </P> <P> ELECTION: LATINOS REVEAL DOCUMENTS THEY SAY PROVE THAT REPUBLICANS INTENDED TO  INTIMIDATE THEIR ETHNIC GROUP. GOP SAYS INSURANCE CONCERNS FORCED DEAL.  </P> <P> Five Latino voters announced Wednesday they have accepted $400,000 to settle  their lawsuit against Republican officials who posted uniformed guards at  polling places last year, and they revealed documents that they said prove that  the Republicans had intended to intimidate Latino voters.  </P> <P> The evidence released at a morning press conference included a deposition from  Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), who told attorneys he once joked with  county Republican chairman Thomas A. Fuentes and the county GOP's executive  director Greg Haskin about the possibility of driving green vans around polling  places to give the impression that Immigration and Naturalization Service  agents were lurking in the area. That idea was not pursued.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the five voters said they believe that the evidence would have  clinched a victory in the case, in which Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden  Grove) and the county Republican Party were accused of conspiring to violate  voting rights in Pringle's race for the 72nd Assembly District seat.  </P> <P> But the plaintiffs said at the press conference that they decided to settle  because the money was adequate and the suit had succeeded in highlighting the  issue and forcing changes, such as a new state law barring use of uniformed  guards at polling places.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs also decided to contribute $150,000 of the settlement to  nonprofit, nonpartisan groups working for voter education and registration in  Latino areas of Pringle's district.  </P> <P> Attorney Joseph Remcho, representing the plaintiffs, said Pringle and the  Republican officials "may have succeeded in buying this election with security  guards," but the settlement satisfies the five voters because it marks the  highest sum ever paid in a voting-rights case.  </P> <P> "This clearly will send a message nationally that you just can't do this,"  Remcho said. "Goons in polling places will not be tolerated."  </P> <P> Most of the Republican officials involved in the case failed to return calls  Wednesday seeking comment on the settlement and the documents that were  released. Others declined to discuss the settlement or could not be reached.  Their lawyers said last week that they admitted no wrongdoing by settling the  case.  </P> <P> The GOP's Haskin declined to comment on Wednesday's developments and instead  referred a reporter to a prepared statement issued by the Republican Party's  defense attorneys last week. In the statement, the defendants said the five  voters had "struck out" in their bids to overturn the election results and to  prove any wrongdoing by Republicans.  </P> <P> Attorney Darryl R. Wold, who represented the county Republican Party, said the  plaintiffs were on "a flight of fancy" in thinking they could have won the  lawsuit.  </P> <P> Wednesday's announcement marks the end of the federal lawsuit, which was  scheduled for trial Jan. 16 in Santa Ana. The defendants disclosed the  settlement on Friday, but it was not final until the plaintiffs signed it  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Flanked by four of the five plaintiffs, Remcho presented documents that he said  made his case a "sure-fire winner."  </P> <P> In addition to the Lewis deposition, the evidence included notes scribbled by  political strategist Michael R. Williams after a meeting with another Pringle  consultant, Carlos Rodriguez. Williams wrote in a corner of his calendar on  Oct. 17, 1988, the words Carlos and goons and, in another corner, the names of  security guard companies.  </P> <P> Also noted in the margin are the numbers of Republicans and Democrats  registered in the area and Lewis' name, which Remcho said indicates that the  Orange assemblyman had been involved in the decision.  </P> <P> An Oct. 19, 1988, memo from Williams to Rodriguez outlines the security guard  program, noting that the 20 guards would be in uniform and that "voters will be  challenged."  </P> <P> Wold, the county GOP's attorney, said that the 20 guards did nothing wrong,  that in final instructions the guards had been told not to challenge or stop  voters and that Williams' "goons" notation referred to Democrats who were  allegedly registering voters illegally.  </P> <P> Other evidence presented included a map of the 72nd Assembly District, on which  an employee of Rodriguez indicated to a sign-making company where they should  post signs for the Pringle campaign, Remcho said.  </P> <P> The map showed plans to put signs reading "Thank You Curt Pringle" in  predominantly Caucasian areas and signs -- in Spanish and English -- that said  "Non Citizens Can't Vote" in largely Latino areas.  </P> <P> One of the plaintiffs at the press conference, Jose Diaz Vargas, 53, a Santa  Ana police officer, said he was on his way to vote on Nov. 8, 1988, when he  heard that uniformed guards were patrolling the polling areas. He went home but  later changed his mind in anger and went back to vote.  </P> <P> "I was very upset," he said. "This kind of conduct, I did not expect this to  happen in the United States. Maybe in some other countries, but not in the  United States. . . . I went back to the voting place, but how many other people  didn't go back?"  </P> <P> The five plaintiffs will keep $17,000 each, Remcho said. They are Vargas; Rudy  Rios, 39, a business agent for a local labor union; Helen Canales, 60, and her  husband, Tommy Canales, 68, who are both retired, and Jane Fantauzzi, 74, a  retiree who has since moved to Fontana.  </P> <P> Earlier settlements of $20,000 from the county registrar of voters and $60,000  from the firm that employed the security guards bring the total settlement to  $480,000.  </P> <P> A sixth plaintiff, Rumaldo Madrid, got $2,000 from earlier settlement proceeds  before he was dropped from the suit last month. Madrid, the only voter who  contended that the guards actually dissuaded him from voting, was dismissed  because he was not sure whether the guards who harassed him were the same ones  hired by the Republicans. Republican officials cited that to bolster their  contention that the guards did not keep anyone from voting.  </P> <P> The largest chunk of settlement money, $243,000, will go toward attorney's fees  and costs, which exceeded $400,000, Remcho said. Some of the legal debt will be  eased with $100,000 raised by Democrats, Remcho said, including $50,000 in  campaign money from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, $35,000 from other  Democratic legislators and $15,000 from private citizens.  </P> <P> The settlement encompasses all the remaining defendants: Pringle; the county  Republican Central Committee and two of its officials, executive director  Haskin and chairman Fuentes; Lewis; Pringle's campaign manager, Marsha  Gilchrist; political consultants Williams and Rodriguez, and attorney William  P. Godfrey.  </P> <P> Remcho said the plaintiffs had no interest in using the lawsuit as a political  weapon to damage Pringle's image in 1990, when he can run for reelection. They  said it is more important to funnel $150,000 into Latino voter registration and  education projects.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a partisan thing," Rios said. "These were my civil rights."  </P> <P> Defense attorneys said the defendants did not want to settle, but their  insurance companies insisted "for purely economic reasons."  </P> <P> If the defendants had chosen to go to trial anyway, they would have given up  their right to insurance coverage for their legal fees, the attorneys said. The  insurance firms will pay the $400,000.  </P> <P> County Republican Party officials contend that they did nothing wrong by  posting the guards at polling places in predominantly Latino areas of Santa  Ana. They said the guards were there only to monitor possible election fraud,  in response to a rumor that Pringle's Democratic opponent, Christian (Rick)  Thierbach, planned to bring in illegal voters to tip the contest in his favor.  </P> <P> But Democrats and Latinos said that the guards, who carried signs in English  and Spanish warning that non-citizens cannot vote, were trying to scare Latinos  away from voting booths.  </P> <P> Local and federal agencies are still investigating to see whether criminal  charges should be filed over the posting of the guards.  </P> <P> Thierbach, who lost the 72nd Assembly District seat to Pringle by 867 votes,  said it is a shame that "the insurmountable evidence of illegal activity" by  the Republicans will not be revealed in a trial.  </P></p>

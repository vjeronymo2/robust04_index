Kooijmans reported his government has an ambitious  development assistance programme in place for its former colony  which includes assistance with the rehabilitation of the  country's infrastructure and strengthening of state institutions.    Kooijmans met Wednesday [5 January] with Secretary General  of  the Organization of American States (OAS) Baena Soares at OAS  headquarters in Washington, D.C.    "We came to the conclusion that democracy seems to be  re-established in Suriname but that the economic situation calls  for strong measures on the part of the government," he said.    He reported that his government's economic development  programme with Suriname was already being implemented "with  particular emphasis being put on the rehabilitation of  infrastructure and the strengthening of state institutions such  as the judiciary and the police."    There were problems, he admitted, with the provision of  balance of payments support to Suriname because there was no  monitoring of the economy by international institution such as  the International Monetary Fund (IMF).    "The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has to  make  sure that the support which we give is effective and we are now  discussing with the Government of Suriname a way acceptable to  both of us to ensure that such support is effective," the  foreign minister remarked.    He said he hoped the discussions would result "very soon" in  the resumption of balance of payments support to Suriname.    Turning to the Netherlands Antilles, Dr Kooijmans said he  briefed the OAS secretary general on recent developments there,  including the results of a referendum in Curacao where the  people voted in favour of the maintenance of the Antilles as a  unit of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.    "This led to the resignation of the government and so there  should be new elections in the Netherlands Antilles in  February," the foreign minister said in an interview.    On the situation in Haiti, Dr Kooijmans said what was most  important "is that democracy be restored."</p>

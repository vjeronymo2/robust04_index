			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, Tribes will be subject to the sanctions provisions of section 502(i) (1)&hyph;(4) in the same manner as States. Section 502(i) provides for the discretionary and mandatory imposition of section 179 sanctions when EPA determines that a permitting authority is not adequately administering and enforcing an operating permit program, or a portion thereof. Thus, once a Tribe submits an operating permit program and EPA approves that program, Tribes will be subject to the sanction provisions of section 502(i)(1)&hyph;(4) in the same way that States are. In addition, Tribes will be treated in the same manner as States with respect to EPA's discretionary authority to impose sanctions under section 502(d)(2)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the interim approval provisions in section 502(g) of the Act. Those provisions authorize EPA to temporarily grant approval to a program that in substantial part meets the requirements of the Act, but that is not fully approvable. An interim approval under these provisions expires on a date established by EPA but not later than two years after the approval. Section 502(g) provides that the Title V sanctions provisions and obligations of the Administrator to promulgate a Federal operating permit program are suspended during this interim period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim approval provisions allow EPA to grant States submitting a substantially satisfactory permit program up to two additional years to submit a fully approvable program without risk of sanctions and Federal implementation. These provisions are an adjunct of the statutory deadline requiring the submittal of State Title V operating permit programs by November 15, 1993. If States were not in the first instance required to submit operating permit programs by that date certain, the relief of additional time to submit an approvable program without the risk of Federal penalties would be unnecessary. As stated previously, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for Title V program submittal deadlines. Accordingly, EPA is also not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for this related interim approval authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the general modular approach proposed with respect to Tribal programs (discussed below), EPA intends to allow Tribes some additional flexibility in implementing Title V programs. For example, EPA may allow Tribes to extend the period for permitting affected Title V sources over as long as five years from program approval. Accordingly, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for those provisions of section 503(c) of the Act that direct permitting authorities to establish a phased schedule for acting on permit applications submitted within the first full year after the effective date of a permit program (or a partial or interim program). Section 503(c) provides that the phased schedule shall assure that at least one-third of such permit applications will be acted on by the permitting authority over a period of not to exceed three years after the effective date. EPA is not proposing to subject Tribes to these provisions. While it is possible that EPA may require some Tribes to permit affected sources within three years, EPA nevertheless wants to retain the discretion to allow Tribes up to five years to permit affected Title V sources after the date of program approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further discussion of Title V requirements is set out below under the portion of this notice titled ``Revisions to CAA Implementing Regulations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Small business assistance program submittal deadline and compliance advisory panel requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the provisions of section 507(a) specifying a deadline for the submittal of plans for establishing a small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program. EPA also is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States under section 507(e) which directs States to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel. Both of these provisions are inconsistent with section 301(d), which authorizes but does not require Tribes to develop and submit Clean Air Act programs to EPA for approval. However, if a Tribe elects to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel under section 507(e), the membership specified in section 507(e)(2) shall be selected by the Tribal leader, legislative bodies and Tribal agencies that correspond with those identified for States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the preceding discussion identifies those provisions of the CAA for which EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States. EPA is proposing that Tribes be treated in the same manner as States for all other provisions of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Stringency of Tribal Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Clean Air Act, States generally retain legal authority to impose requirements that are more stringent that Federal standards. Section 116 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7416, expressly reserves States' authority to impose air pollution control requirements that are more stringent than those specified under the Act. This State discretion is retained except where the Act explicitly preempts or precludes the establishment of stricter State standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In certain instances under the Act uniformity is necessary to avoid an undue burden on the interstate sale of goods. In such instances, Congress has expressly prevented States from imposing stricter State standards and, therefore, the Federal requirements under the Act represent both the nationwide floor and ceiling. For example, section 209 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. section 7543, limits States' authority to adopt and enforce emission standards for new motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

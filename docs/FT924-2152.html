			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / French inflation at six-year low FRANCE'S annual inflation rate eased from 2.4 per cent in October to 2.1 per cent last month, the lowest for six years, according to provisional figures by Insee, the state statistics body. Month on month, prices were stable in November, after rising 0.3 per cent in the previous month. This brings price rises since the start of the year to 2 per cent and puts France on track to undershoot Insee's most recent forecast of 2.5 per cent inflation for 1992 overall. Food prices fell last month and there was a small rise in the prices of oil products, pushed up by the dollar's recovery against the franc, according to the ministry of finance. Prices of manufactured products were unchanged in November. The reduction leaves France's annual inflation 1.6 percentage points below that in western Germany, its main trading partner, continuing the improvement in price competitiveness since French inflation dropped below Germany's in June 1991. Annualised French inflation last month was also 1.3 per cent below the average level for its nine main trading partners, a small improvement from the 1.2 per cent gap in October.</p>

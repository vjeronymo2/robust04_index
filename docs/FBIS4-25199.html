Macao Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira made these  remarks when met a visiting Portuguese delegation of  entrepreneurs here today.    He said, "our strategy is a long-term strategy, not only to  1999, but we must invest in the future of Macao after 1999",  adding that the Macao Government is supporting contacts and  links with China.    Chairman of the Industrial Association of Portugal Angelo  Ludgero Marques, who led the delegation, told the governor that  after their recent visit to Guangdong Province, south China,  they have found big opportunities to invest and set up joint  ventures in south China. He said, "this is not only a  challenge, it has become a reality." the chairman said, next  month his association would open an office in Guangzhou and  would send another delegation to Macao for business and to  support those in China's mainland.    It is learned that in 1993, Portugal exported 230 million  Hong Kong dollars (28.8 million U.S. dollars) worth of goods to  China, and China's exports to Portugal reached 1.33 billion Hong  Kong dollars (about 1.66 billion U.S. dollars) in value.

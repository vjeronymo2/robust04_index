			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Germans warn over far-right party ban MAINSTREAM German politicians cautioned yesterday against banning the far-right Republican party, under investigation on suspicion of being anti-democratic, Reuter reports from Bonn. Several state interior ministers said they hoped the investigation announced by the government would help major parties win a public opinion battle with the Republicans, the strongest of several small rightist parties. But they warned an outright ban, like ones Bonn imposed recently on two smaller rightist groups, would only drive members underground or into other far-right organisations. 'The issue is simply that we confront the Republicans, democratically for now, and make clear to many citizens what forces are at our work within the Republicans,' said Mr Friedel Lapple, interior minister of tiny Saarland state.' That does not mean I think the party should be suppressed.' In 1989, the Republicans won a surprise 11 per cent in April state elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and 8.3 per cent in Berlin borough council polls in May. The party is more established than two other groups banned by Bonn in a crackdown on rightist violence since a firebombing killed three Turks in Molln in November. Germany unveiled a new computer system yesterday to help accommodate the huge influx of refugees from eastern Europe and the Third World. The DM2m system, in operation on April 1, is designed to distribute asylum-seekers more quickly between crowded refugee hostels.</p>

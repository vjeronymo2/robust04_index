			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not fair on efficiency Sir, With reference to your article, 'Ofwat outlines flow of price increases' (May 20), I do not accept your comment 'unimpressive performance on efficiency' so far as Thames Water is concerned. Statistics produced by Ofwat on cost per unit of service provided to customers confirm Thames Water as the best of the big 10 water and sewerage companies. It is total costs that matter since this is what concerns customers, that is the bill that they receive. This point has been confirmed to Thames Water on several occasions by Ofwat. Drawing conclusions on company efficiency from an analysis of operating costs only is positively misleading. I am proud that in 1994, yet again, Thames Water customers have the lowest combined water and sewerage bill. M R Hoffman, deputy chairman and group chief executive, Thames Water, 14 Cavendish Place, London W1M 9DJ</p>

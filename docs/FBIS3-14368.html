			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo--The Arab League Council has resumed meetings  at the Arab League General Secretariat's headquarters at the  foreign ministers' level with the participation of [Syrian]  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.    The Council held a morning session and an evening session  yesterday, and addressed several topics on the agenda, led by  the situation in the occupied Syrian Golan. The Council also  discussed a draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan  stressing the Council's rejection of all measures that the  Israeli occupation authorities have taken and are taking with  the aim of changing the legal, natural, and demographic  situation of the occupied Syrian Golan.    The draft resolution reaffirms that the Israeli measures  extending sovereignty to the Golan are illegal, null, and void,  and that they violate both the international agreements and the  UN Charter and resolutions, which emphasize that Israel's  decision on 14 December 1981 to annex the occupied Syrian Golan  is illegal, null, and void. The Knesset's decision, made on 11  November 1991, in this regard, is also null and void and has no  legal force.    In the draft resolution, the Council demands that the  Security Council assume its responsibilities toward Israel's  compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy.  These resolutions provide for both full withdrawal from the  Syrian Golan and for supporting the Syrian Government in its  efforts to implement these resolutions.    The draft resolution also calls on the international  community, particularly the United States, to force Israel to  comply with the UN and other international resolutions  pertaining to full withdrawal from both the Golan and other  occupied Arab territories. It stresses support for the  steadfastness of the Syrian Arab citizens in the Golan in their  confrontation of both the Israeli occupation and its repressive  practices, and also for their insistence on adhering to both  their territory and their Syrian Arab identity.    The draft resolution stresses the need to implement the  Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 for the Syrian citizens in the  occupied Golan. It renews the Arab states' emphasis of their  firm support for Syria's just demands and right to regain the  entire occupied Syrian Golan based on the peace process and the  resolutions of international legitimacy, particularly Security  Council Resolutions 242 and 338.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON ASKS ANNUAL PACIFIC RIM SUMMITS  </P> <P> Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston on Monday proposed annual summits at which  President Bush would discuss economics and regional security with leaders of  Japan, China and other nations on the Pacific Rim, including the Soviet Union  when it would be appropriate.  </P> <P> Cranston's plan for a yearly "Pacific Basin Forum" was contained in a letter to  the President released on the eve of Senate hearings on East Asian and Pacific  affairs that California's senior senator has scheduled in Los Angeles on  Wednesday and San Francisco on Thursday.  </P> <P> "Imaginative, energetic diplomacy can help us build new relationships with  former adversaries while reducing inevitable irritants in our relationships  with allies," Cranston wrote.  </P> <P> "I recommend that the United States lead in the establishment of a Pacific  Basin Forum to pursue discussions of regional economic and security concerns,"  Cranston added. "These summits should include China, Japan, South Korea,  Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and  other key nations in the region.  </P> <P> "The new forum should also make a deliberate effort to involve the Soviets, as  appropriate, as well as their allies, North Korea and Vietnam, in a dialogue  about such common concerns as free trade, economic development and  environmental protection."  </P> <P> Cranston said he will be working with others to introduce legislation  encouraging such an approach and authorizing U.S. participation. On a related  issue, the California lawmaker said that the United States should negotiate  with the Philippines for at least a 10-year lease on U.S. military  installations -- Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base. Both leases expire in  1991. Relocation of the facilities, he said, would cost $10 billion and sharply  reduce traditional ties between Washington and Manila.  </P> <P> In addition, Cranston said that the United States should ask Japan to shoulder  more of the costs now paid by the United States to keep its military forces in  Japan.  </P> <P> Wednesday's hearings begin at 10 a.m. at the James West Center at UCLA.  Thursday's hearings begin at 9:30 a.m. at the World Affairs Council, 312 Sutter  St., in San Francisco.  </P></p>

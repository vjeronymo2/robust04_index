			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD drifted lower on the London bullion market, but dealers said that it had survived several tests of support at Dollars 372 a troy ounce. There was a lot of nervousness around the morning fix after Friday's 40-minute fix when the price jumped Dollars 3-Dollars 4. 'Nobody really wanted to buy this morning and the price just came right off,' one dealer said. The market found little encouragement from New York, which opened weaker. London's robusta COFFEE closed just above the day's lows, but dealers noted some early signs that the downward move might be running out of steam. The market continued to be driven by technical factors in New York, where the breach of support at 60 cents a lb for the July contract late last week put it on the defensive. New York raw SUGAR prices were easier at midday as the market continued to absorb Cuba's declaration of a 45-day force majeure last week. Analysts said that uncertainty over whether Russia and China would look for alternative supplies inspired nervousness. COPPER appeared to be consolidating on the LME after Friday's volatile trading, with three-month metal settling into a range between Dollars 1,820 and Dollars 1,850. Compiled from Reuters</p>

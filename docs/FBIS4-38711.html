			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Viktor Dmitriyev] </F>   [Text] Caracas, 1 Jun -- The processes of democratization  and economic change which Russia and Venezuela are going through  are in many ways alike and we are hoping to develop relations  between our countries further. Russian President Boris Yeltsin  said this in a message to President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela,  which was conveyed to him on 31 May by Vladimir Shumeyko,  chairman of the Federation Council, who is on a visit here.  Shumeyko is leading a delegation from the Russian parliament on  an official tour of a number of Latin American countries. The  delegation has already been to Chile, Argentina, and Brazil.    The head of the delegation told an ITAR-TASS correspondent  that he had given R. Caldera a draft treaty on the bases of  relations between the two countries. According to V. Shumeyko,  a similar document was given to Venezuela last year, but  consideration of it was put off because of political problems  being experienced at that time by both countries. "The time has  now come to go back to it, and the president of Venezuela and  the foreign minister fully agree with me on this," the head of  delegation said.    On the same day the chairman of the Federation Council  addressed the Senate of the National Congress of Venezuela. "We  are firmly convinced that the Latin American states, including  Venezuela, are potentially important partners for us in the  realm of political, commercial, and economic relations," V.  Shumeyko said. "Our task is to maintain and increase as far as  we are able our presence in the region and continue mutually  advantageous relations with the countries of Latin America, on  the basis of a realistic vision of our common interests and  capacities and rejecting ideology-based approaches and  stereotypes." The head of the Russian delegation expressed an  interest in setting up contacts with leading regional  organizations like the OAS and the Rio de Janeiro Group.    Speaking about ties with individual countries in Latin  America, V. Shumeyko stated the Russian leadership's intention  to continue cooperation on many levels with Cuba. He said this  cooperation "after certain difficulties is once again becoming  active and is founded on a fundamentally new, mutually  beneficial basis."    V. Shumeyko stressed the importance of developing  interparliamentary ties with the countries of Latin America.  Having pointed out that the Russian parliament has a colossal  job of work to do to bring outdated legislation into line with  the stipulations of the new Constitution, the head of the  Federation Council stressed that Russia's parliament is very  much in need of foreign experience, including that of the Latin  American countries.    During meetings with representatives of the government,  members of parliament, and journalists, V. Shumeyko several  times mentioned economic cooperation between Russia and  Venezuela. According to him, there are now favorable conditions  for the development of these ties. He said that the extraction,  processing, and distribution of oil is one of the main areas.  The chairman of the Federation Council stated the desire of  Russia's leadership to resume the practice current up to 1991 of  supplying Russian oil to Venezuela's partners in Western Europe  in exchange for equivalent supplies of oil from Venezuela to  Russia's partners in the Western hemisphere. Another important  aspect is the construction of assembly lines producing Russian  VAZ and KamAZ motor vehicles, which have a good reputation on  Venezuela's roads. V. Shumeyko also noted highly promising  prospects for cooperation in mining and advanced technology.</p>

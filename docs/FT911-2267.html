			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Letter: Law to involve employees Sir, Your leader 'Listening to employees' (April 23), cites the Involvement and Participation Association/Institute of Personnel Management code of practice on employee involvement and says Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, 'should consider endorsing it'. This association welcomes Mr Howard's initiative, but you should be aware that the code was endorsed by the then employment secretary, Tom King, at the time of its publication in 1983. We feel that something more than endorsement is needed and would like to see the code underpinned by statute. This would set clear minimum standards for employee involvement. Such a development would be infinitely preferable to the present Brussels proposals on employee involvement, would cause no problem to those companies which have already made progress in this direction, and could have a real impact on improving employee involvement. We are currently collecting examples of where employee involvement has made a direct impact on business performance. BC Stevens, director, Involvement &amp; Participation Association, 87-95 Tooley Street, SE1</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION TO ALLOW LOGGING IN OWL COUNTRY  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's decision to delay a ban on logging in the Northwest  is incredibly shortsighted. Those who, unlike President Bush, really know the  environmental score are painfully aware that the issue is not just an owl vs.  some logging jobs.  </P> <P> The issue is 10% of remaining old-growth forests vs. human overpopulation and  overuse of natural resources.  </P> <P> My family drove and camped through Oregon and Washington in the 1960s. Some  clear-cutting was visible. The "campground" had been turned into a mesa of huge  stumps. But many mountain ranges were still forested.  </P> <P> Twenty-five years later, in 1988, we drove through many of the same places. We  were appalled. Logging trucks roared past continually, each carrying 3-4 giant  logs obviously 100 years or more old. Most of the slopes had been clear-cut,  even on the famous Olympic Peninsula. Mile upon mile seemed to have been hit  with a nuclear bomb: heaps of huge tree roots, broken soil, brush piles. No  living thing. I don't want to think what happened to the streams and wildlife.  </P> <P> Of course, the timber workers must live too. But why can't they be hired to  restore the land, to improve recreation facilities, to entice visitors and  their dollars back again?  </P> <P> The spotted owl controversy is telling us time is short -- the future is upon  us -- we must choose -- and we must support politicians who will make the right  choices.  </P> <P> ANNE G.

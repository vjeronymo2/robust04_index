			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 12 May (Fides News Agency) -- Bolivia will  participate in a meeting with the Consultative Group [not  further specified] during the first week of November. Bolivia  will participate in a meeting with the Paris Club in October to  reschedule the bilateral foreign debt.    The dates were confirmed by Finance Minister Fernando  Cossio,  who also confirmed a meeting with the IMF for late May to reach  a new agreement on structural adjustment.    Bolivia seeks financing from the Consultative Group. In  1993, Bolivia received commitments for more than $1 billion over  a four-year period. This year, Bolivia will go to this  international forum to renew this financial support.    Cossio said the government's economic team is preparing a  strategy to negotiate with the IMF. The new agreement with the  IMF will be in effect for three years and include the main  structural reform programs the current administration has in  mind.    The finance minister mentioned that basically the  capitalization's and the popular participation's impact on the  fiscal program would be included in the agreement.    The minister said it is too early to discuss the amount that  might be agreed upon with the IMF. He added that the amount  required by our national economy would be negotiated with the  IMF.    Nevertheless, it is necessary to emphasize that this  involves  a grants-in-aid program, including a 10-year repayment period, a  10-year grace period, and a 0.5 percent interest rate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the last poll by IBOPE [Brazilian  Public Opinion and Statistics Institute], PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] presidential candidate Fernando Henrique  Cardoso has lost his second place to PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] Senator for Amapa Jose Sarney. The poll, the  results of which were released yesterday, shows that PT [Workers  Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's popularity has  grown in all simulated elections, and he firmly holds the  leading position.    Cardoso's popularity has dropped in three simulated  elections: one in which the PMDB candidate is Jose Sarney;  another in which the PMDB candidate is former Sao Paulo Governor  Orestes Quercia; and a third in which former Parana Governor  Roberto Requiao is a contender. The percentage of undecided has  remained stable at around 30 percent.    In the simulated election in which Sarney is the PMDB  candidate, Cardoso's popularity dropped from 16 percent in the  last IBOPE poll to 13 percent, while Sarney scored 15 percent.  With Quercia, Cardoso remained second, but with a lower  percentage. While in the last IBOPE poll released on 17 April  he had 17 percent, he now scored 15 percent. With Requiao,  Cardoso's popularity drop has been smaller: He dropped from 17  to 16 percent. In the simulated election with the participation  of Quercia, Lula rose from 33 percent previously to 36 percent;  with Sarney from 30 to 32 percent; and with Requiao from 34 to  36 percent.  <H5>  Brizola </H5>   Quercia's popularity, which stood at 5 percent, is, like  that  of Requiao, 4 percent, meaningless. Former Rio de Janeiro  Governor Leonel Brizola's candidacy remained at 8 percent when  confronted with Sarney and Quercia, and at 9 percent with  Requiao. Lula continues to beat all contenders in simulated  runoff elections. With Fernando Henrique Cardoso, he won by 48  to 29 percent, and with Sarney by 44 to 33 percent.    According to IBOPE experts, it is still too early to  attribute Cardoso's dropping popularity to the formalization of  the alliance between the PSDB and the Liberal Front Party. They  admit, however, that there is such a possibility, as the drop  coincides with the problems that Cardoso has confronted within  his own party, in which some sectors have rejected the alliance  and have even threatened to sponsor a new ticket at the PSDB  convention on 14 May in Contagem (Minas Gerais), with Deputy for  Bahia Waldir Pires being kind of an anti-candidate.    Progressive Renewal Party Senator for Santa Catarina  Esperidiao Amin's popularity remains at 3 percent for all  simulated elections. Liberal Party Deputy for Rio de Janeiro  Flavio Rocha scored 2 percent in all cases.</p>

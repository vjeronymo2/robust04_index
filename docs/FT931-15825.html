			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Training initiative faces cash crisis AN inner-city educational project that has successfully motivated young black people to study and obtain qualifications is fighting for survival because of financial problems. A total of 300 pupils aged between eight and 18 are studying voluntarily during evenings, weekends and holidays at the Chapeltown and Harehills Assisted Learning Computer School in Leeds, and a further 400 are waiting for a place. The school, set up in 1987 by Mr Brainard Braimah, a Ghanaian teacher, to tackle low educational achievement among local black children, has seen four of its former students go to university and dozens obtain GCSEs. The winding-up last year of the Leeds Task Force, a government inner-city initiative, cost the school its main source of funding. A final grant of Pounds 25,000 - matched by equal sums from Leeds City Action Team and the city's Training and Enterprise Council - was expected to last until March 31, but will be used up by next month, leaving the school in urgent need of Pounds 7,000 to survive until April and uncertain of its funding next year. Mr Braimah last week held discussions with the City Action Team, which co-ordinates government departments' inner-city efforts in Leeds and Bradford, and later this month will meet the Tec. But he is not hopeful they will be able to fill the gap in funding left by the Task Force.</p>

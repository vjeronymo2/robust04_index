			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin under the rubric "Smolensk </F> Square": "Russian Germans: Moscow Asks Bonn Not To Get Upset:  And Advocates a Stage-by-Stage Solution to the Problem"]    [Text] The problem of ethnic Germans on the territory of  the Russian Federation is becoming one of the most important  aspects of Russian-German relations. For official Bonn this  issue is a unique indicator which determines the degree of our  interaction. Moscow has an understanding attitude toward the  position of the FRG leaders since a large proportion of the 2  million population of Germans of the former USSR are living in  Russia.    This is why the new democratic Russia has taken a number of  steps to rectify the mistakes of the past. The Edict of the  President of Russia "On Immediate Measures for Rehabilitation of  Russian Germans," was adopted in February 1992. The Protocol on  Cooperation Between the Governments of Russia and the FRG took  effect in March 1993 with the objective of stage-by-stage  restoration of the state affiliation of Russian Germans. This  situation was also registered in a joint statement from  President of Russia Boris Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut  Kohl of 21 November 1991. The implementation of practical  measures in this area, including preservation of cultural  uniqueness and vital rights of the aforementioned category of  citizens are being handled by the intergovernmental commission  of the Russian Federation and the FRG on problems of Russian  Germans. Four meetings have already been held in a businesslike  and constructive atmosphere.    Bonn is scrupulously and promptly fulfilling the commitments  it has made in keeping with the agreements. Last year the FRG  Government allotted more than 120 million marks for improving  living conditions for Russian Germans in densely populated  areas. So far only 70 million marks has actually been spent.  Programs for the development of education, culture, and study of  the German language are being actively supported.    At the same time Germany has been reproaching Moscow more  and  more recently for the fact that it is not keeping its own  promises for creating a Republic of Germans of the Volga Area  and building up national regions for Russian Germans. It would  seem that the time for this was not chosen randomly. In March  there will be another meeting of the Intergovernmental  Commission of the Russian Federation and the FRG on Ethnic  Germans. Is this not an attempt to exert pressure on the  partners and thus force the process?    As far as we know, official circles of the FRG up to this  point have accepted in a positive spirit Moscow's initiatives  for solving problems of Russian Germans. And in principle a good  deal has been done here. The Intergovernmental Commission has  coordinated about 60 joint projects for economic and cultural  development. Some 5.4 billion rubles [R] has been received from  the state budget for these purposes, including for the needs of  culture and education. Considerable funds have also been  allotted by the Russian regions. A large share of the projects  are being implemented with assistance from the Ministry of  Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy of Russia in German  regions of Omsk Oblast, Altay Kray, and the Volga area. The  administration of St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast and the  government of the Land of Baden-Wuerttenberg have approved the  project for creating farmer settlements of Russian Germans in  the village of Nazie in Kirovskiy Rayon in Leningrad Oblast. In  the first stage 25 of these facilities and 15 handicraft  enterprises will be constructed. A large-scale project for  resettlement of Russian Germans in Pskov Oblast is being  developed with the participation of the Russian side.  Additionally, there is a directive from the president of the  Russian Federation to establish a Russian-German university.    Because of the efforts that have been made we have managed  to  influence to a certain degree the emigration attitudes among  this part of the Russian population. Thus the number of  applications to go to Germany submitted from ethnic Germans from  the republics of the former USSR in 1993 (according to German  figures) has decreased by 150,000 as compared to 1992. Last year  about 200,000 Germans left for Germany from Russia and the CIS  countries and another 200,000 have exit documents in their hands  but have not yet used them. For the FRG the retardation of the  rates of repatriation of compatriots should signify a  considerable plus on the economic plane.    Of course, the reproaches against the Russian side heard in  the mass media in the FRG are sometimes not unfounded. Things  are not moving as rapidly as they would like. And the main  reason is our economic difficulties. They make it impossible for  Russian authorities to begin to implement the earmarked projects  in full measure. Last year we failed to allot our 5.4 billion  from the budget for improving living conditions for Russian  Germans. And German representatives working directly in the  regions where ethnic Germans live are well aware of this. The  Russian mass media are always writing about this as well. So is  there any point in inflaming passions any more? It would seem  that a position of calm and complete mutual understanding  regarding this issue would make it possible to resolve in stages  the problem of creating a German autonomous entity and improving  living conditions in national regions for Russian Germans.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is speeding  up the installation of a total quality control system in  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises.    This is part of the efforts to beef up the competitiveness  of  the city's industries in the market.    Some 5,000 managers, chief accountants and chief engineers  from 2,000 state enterprises are attending training seminars by  the Shanghai Quality Control Association (SQCA), and waiting for  their enterprises to be officially attested.    The national "gb/t1900-iso9000 quality control and quality  criteria" system was issued in 1992, in line with the standard  series of iso9000 system promulgated by the international  standardization organization in 1977.    "The qc system and its attestation is fundamental for  shanghai's industries to be able to compete in the world market  in a coherent framework with the developed economies in regard  to producing quality products," said Xu Zhiyi, director of the  Shanghai economic committee, a renowned qc expert in China.    Thirty state-owned enterprises are expected to be approved  this year, he said, adding that another 400 key enterprises with  annual sales up to 500 million yuan (56.82 million U.S. dollars)  are preparing to be attested.    Some foreign-funded companies--among them Shanghai Foxboro  Ltd, Shanghai AT and T, and Shanghai Belling Micro-Electronics  Co.--have already passed the official attestation. And more  companies of this kind are undergoing such attestation  procedures.    Hundreds of enterprises and managers in Shanghai have been  sent to the United States, Britain, Japan, Singapore and other  countries to receive training in management expertise and the  latest developments of world trade.</p>

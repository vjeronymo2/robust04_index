			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Irish plan exchange rate scheme THE IRISH government has revealed details of a IPounds 1.1bn (Pounds 1.2bn) exchange rate guarantee scheme to be used to alleviate financial pressures on Irish businesses and mortgage holders hit be the recent currency turmoil. The scheme will consist of two packages, one of IPounds 500m for the manufacturing, food-processing and tourism industries to reduce their borrowing costs, and another of IPounds 600m for building societies to avert a threatened 3 percentage point increase in mortgage rates. The commercial banks will borrow the funds in D-Marks and then lend them on to eligible companies at a maximum interest rate of 13.5 per cent. The building societies will apparently be able to deposit their funds back into the interbank market at commercial rates, to bring down the average cost of their borrowings, forced up sharply by the currency crisis. Some market analysts have expressed doubts about the scheme, which is expected to be functioning early next week, especially about the ability of the authorities to 'ring-fence' the funds within the marketplace and prevent them from being used to fuel a new speculative run on the punt. The Finance Ministry said yesterday: 'The government will be quite insistent that there will be very close monitoring of how the funds are used.' The overall operation of the scheme will be reviewed in three months.</p>

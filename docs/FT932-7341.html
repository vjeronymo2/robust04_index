			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / French loan to boost recovery MR Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, is to launch a FFr40bn (Pounds 4.73bn) bond issue to finance job-creation measures and speed up public works to help revive the economy and cut France's 10.7 per cent unemployment rate. After talks with employers and unions in recent days, the prime minister has decided to use the parliamentary debate on the budget today to announce the 'acceleration' of measures to raise employment, which he had intended to leave until the autumn. The measures could include an extra FFr2bn to keep young people in work experience schemes, in addition to the FFr7bn payroll tax cuts in the May 10 budget and accelerated spending of FFr1.3bn already pledged for public works. According to French television, the bond will be convertible into shares in newly privatised companies. The privatisation plan is scheduled to be discussed at a cabinet meeting tomorrow and sent to parliament in the autumn. Mr Philippe Auberger, the parliamentary budget rapporteur, welcomed the government's intention to fund a job-creating initiative through a special bond issue. The government could thereby take advantage of the fall in the cost of money - which continued its decline yesterday when the Bank of France cut its intervention rate from 7.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent and the five-to-10-day lending facility from 8.75 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Mr Auberger said investors might hurry to subscribe to a new loan before rates fell any further. Economists are now waiting to see whether the commercial banks will follow the Bank of France's lead by cutting base rates as they did two weeks ago - from 9.25 per cent to 9 per cent - following the last cut in official interest rates. Yesterday's cut means that the cost of France's official short-term facility has fallen from 12 per cent to 8.5 per cent under the new government. So far, lower interest rates have had little impact on the economy, which is plagued by sluggish consumer spending and industrial investment. Norway's central bank yesterday announced a cut in the key overnight lending rate to 7.50 per cent from 7.75, the 12th cut this year.</p>

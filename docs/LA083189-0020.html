			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL COLOMBIA STAND UP TO PARAMILITARY?  </P> <P> The assassination of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan hit a nerve in Colombian society,  and the courageous response of the people and the government deserves applause.  For it is political will, not military might, that ultimately will determine  whether Colombia will rid itself of the cocaine cartel.  </P> <P> Since the murder of Galan, one of the country's most outspoken anti-drug  politicians, the government has made thousands of arrests and expropriated  millions in drug-financed property. But the Colombian security forces have yet  to confront the military arm of the traffickers, the paramilitary structure  that sustains the political and drug-related violence in the country.  </P> <P> According to the government, there are more than 140 paramilitary  organizations, most of which are organized and financed by traffickers.  Operating like death squads but with the weaponry of mini-armies, they defend  the drug lords' interests. These extend beyond narcotics to politics.  </P> <P> Rabid anti-communists, the traffickers have united with landowners and other  traditional elites to protect their common economic interests against guerrilla  groups and the growing demands for political and economic reforms by poorer  sectors of the population. Supporting the alliance are members of the Colombian  security forces who resort to paramilitary activity for profit or out of  frustration with the inability to win the 30-year battle against guerrilla  insurgencies. The net result is a "marriage of convenience" in certain areas of  the country between the traffickers and other landowners and members of the  military and police forces, all of whom are bent on eliminating "subversive  elements."  </P> <P> The paramilitary activity stemming from this "marriage" has displaced  guerrillas from areas where they have enjoyed substantial popular support, such  as the middle Magdalena agricultural region. However, more often than not, the  targets of violence are Colombia's growing non-violent progressive forces, such  as civic movements, peasant and labor unions and a newly formed political  party, the Patriotic Union. Last year there were 2,738 political  assassinations, including 82 massacres (killings in groups of four or more  civilians), the vast majority of which were carried out by death squads or "hit  men" trained by them. The murder of Sen. Galan was just one of more than 1,000  political killings this year.  </P> <P> Colombian government investigators and human-rights activists have compiled  significant evidence implicating members of the military and police in  paramilitary activity. One of the most highly publicized cases occurred in  March, 1988, when gunmen raided two banana farms in the Uraba region, killing  22 union leaders. The investigation by the Colombian equivalent of the FBI led  to the indictment last September of two well-known drug traffickers, three  military officials, a police lieutenant, a mayor and others. After presenting  her report on the massacre, the judge presiding over the case fled the country  because of death threats. Her father was recently killed, apparently in  retribution for her brave actions.  </P> <P> Perhaps evidence such as this provides a clue as to why the Colombian security  forces have yet to raid the paramilitary organizations' geographical base,  Puerto Boyaca in the middle Magdalena region. Since Galan's death, there has  not been one direct confrontation between the military and a paramilitary group  anywhere in the country, nor have there been any attempts to raid the highly  publicized paramilitary training schools. In fact, within the range of measures  being implemented, the paramilitary issue is conspicuously absent. Until the  paramilitary groups are confronted directly, drug traffickers will continue to  wage their "total war" on the Colombian government and society.  </P> <P> While the Colombian government's recent efforts to curb drug trafficking must  be taken in good faith, the Colombian military has yet to show the political  will to engage in battle with the traffickers' paramilitary arm. The U.S.  government, having declared a "war on drugs," has steadily militarized its  anti-narcotics programs overseas and is already providing Colombia with  significant levels of military assistance under the anti-narcotics rubric. Now  it is sending $65 million more, along with U.S. military advisers to provide  "technical assistance." Yet until the Colombian military proves its willingness  to clean up its own house and to rid the nation of paramilitary violence, such  aid will only serve to exacerbate domestic political conflict. Ironically, in  the end it may aid the very forces we are trying to combat.  </P></p>

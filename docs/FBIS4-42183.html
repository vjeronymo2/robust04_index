			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cossiga Angry With Interior </F> Minister, Talks to Letta"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 24 -- Former Head of State  Francesco Cossiga spoke today with Cabinet Undersecretary Gianni  Letta about what he said were the "irresponsible words" of  Interior Minister Roberto Maroni on a query filed by Cossiga and  told reporters he had chosen to confer with Letta and not  Premier Berlusconi because Berlusconi is "also chairman of  Fininvest."    "I delivered a letter to Letta for the premier on Maroni's  irresponsible words. I chose to talk to Letta and not with  Berlusconi because he is too high up for me, he's the premier  and also the chairman of Fininvest," said the outspoken  ex-president with reference to Berlusconi's business empire  based on publishing and commercial television. "I'm not so  presumptuous as to ask or demand to be received by the person  who is also chairman of Fininvest," he emphasized.    The minister's "irresponsible words" were spoken in response  to a question on the query in which Cossiga, now a life senator,  claimed he has been placed under investigation by Sisde, the  domestic intelligence agency, and asked the premier for an  explanation of this step.    Maroni was quoted as saying, "Evidently Senator Cossiga has  a  solution in mind for Sisde, one which works through the  destabilization of the structure. But the government and I do  not intend to submit to any type of pressure."    Cossiga, in his letter to Berlusconi and in remarks today,  also challenged the minister's statement that he would not  consider replacing the national police chief, Prefect Vincenzo  Parisi, "for the time being," as "an act of unpardonable  thoughtlessness...which destabilizes the head of the police and  de-legitimizes him in front of the law enforcement services of  all Italy."    The life senator, who has served in his long career as  interior minister and an undersecretary at defense in charge of  special security and internal defense areas, said later he  intended to have a talk with Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.</p>

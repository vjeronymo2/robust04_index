			<p>BFN     [Text] Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid has affirmed  that Aden will not fall to the northerners. In an exclusive  telephone interview with MBC's Tawfiq Jazulit, al-Bid did not  rule out the possibility of secession from the north, but he  left the final decision up to the competent bodies in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] and the national forces. Jazulit's asked  him:    [Begin recording] [Jazulit] Mr. Vice President, the YSP and  the Yemeni oppositionists have set up a National Salvation  Council instead of a national salvation government, as was  previously suggested. What is the significance of setting up  this council?    [Al-Bid] I believe that this is not the issue at the moment.  The issue we are dealing with now is how to ensure that there is  increasing steadfastness. We hope that by the time 'Id al-Adha  comes, the ferocity of the battles will have abated. If there  is talk about salvation, it is an issue that concerns the other  parties and political forces joining with us. We have reached  an agreement with them on the principles for national salvation.    [Jazulit] What is the truth about al-'Anad? Sanaa insists it  is in their hands, and proof of this is that it has sent some  correspondents to the region; but you deny it. What is the real  military situation in al-'Anad?    [Al-Bid] As I have repeated to you, al-'Anad is unyielding.  Al-'Anad will not fall, nor will our values, courage, and  ability to confront the aggressors. I assure you they will be  forced to retreat.    [Jazulit] The fighting continues in the absence of Arab  mediation, although there are extremely important political  developments in Aden. Does this mean that events are heading  toward secession?    [Al-Bid] I do not know what the final solution will be,  because I cannot determine this alone. But I can tell you that  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared his secession on 27 April by  declaring war. Now, after these massacres and sacrifices, I do  not know how we could patch things up or what stand we will  take. However, we will see what is best for Yemen.    [Jazulit] Will secession be one of the major alternatives of  the YSP and the opposition in light of the intensity of the  fighting?    [Al-Bid] We will do what the majority of the political  forces  and parties with whom we have reached agreements decide. We  will follow the final formula we believe will be most suitable  for running the affairs of our citizens. I tell those who are  literally pushed to the battle front--they have now moved all  the battles to the southern and eastern governorates--that the  acts that some innocent people are being forced to do against  their will is criminal, and it must stop. We call on all  Yemenis, nationalists, and honest people in Yemen and abroad to  put an end to this massacre that is taking place in the country.  [end recording]</p>

This statement by Francois Leotard upon his  arrival in Tel Aviv, where he will stay until this evening,  summarizes the purpose of this visit, the first since 1948, by a  French defense minister to Israel. This statement and wish were  reiterated as Francois Leotard's leitmotif throughout the day  yesterday. It was a particularly busy day with two major  highlights: In the morning, the meeting with Prime Minister and  Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and in the afternoon, in the  Oriental House in Jerusalem, a meeting which lasted nearly one  hour with a Palestinian delegation led by Faysal al-Husayni, the  PLO leader of the occupied territories.    To Prime Minister Rabin, Mr. Leotard restated, one month  after [Foreign Affairs Minister] Juppe's visit, France's  willingness to restore normal relations with Israel. These  relations should be at least as cordial as those France has with  most countries, also in this region, and should include  exchanges in the military sphere -- where prospects are still  modest for the time being -- and in the industrial sphere, where  things are likely to move much faster.    To the Palestinian delegation, Francois Leotard said how  deeply the French authorities had regretted the Hebron massacre.  In his opinion, "the only alternative to violence is not a  status quo, but negotiations." The defense minister again  suggested to the Palestinians that France participate, through  its gendarmerie, in the formation of a Palestinian police force.    After these meetings, the minister had the impression that  history is vacillating at this very moment. It is not  impossible that the peace process be jeopardized again, with  easily conceivable consequences for security in the entire  region. This would be a victory of extremism; it would also be  a drama for both Mr. Rabin's and Yasir 'Arafat's supporters.    It was not the minister's ambition, as he himself declared,  to "lecture anyone." It was his goal to help the two  signatories of the Washington accord surmount their common  plight. During a news conference, Francois Leotard thus  summarized his thoughts: "France should be able to play a role  in the restoration of peace, speaking from the heart as well as  the head."</p>

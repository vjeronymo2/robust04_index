			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> HOOVER ALUMNUS HILLMAN DECIDES TO TAKE BEST SHOT IN AUSTRALIAN PRO LEAGUE  </P> <P> Joe Hillman is down but not out. Down Under, that is.  </P> <P> After surviving the Utah Jazz's training camp until the final cut, Hillman has  decided to pursue a career with the Melbourne Raging Giants in an Australian  professional basketball league.  </P> <P> Glendale-area players Don Bickett of Glendale High and Kevin and Brian Goorjian  of Crescenta Valley previously played in the league. Andrew Gaze, a former  Seton Hall standout, currently plays in it.  </P> <P> Hillman, a standout in basketball and baseball at Hoover High and the  University of Indiana, previously played baseball in the Oakland Athletics'  organization but was not offered a contract this year. He took a hiatus from  baseball last summer to play with the Jazz's summer-league team at Loyola  Marymount. He had also spoken to representatives from the Cedar Rapids Bullets  of the Continental Basketball Association.  </P> <P> During his senior season at Hoover, Hillman averaged 41.3 points a game -- then  the third-best average in Southern Section history -- and finished with 2,213  points.  </P> <P> What dry is: The Crescenta Valley High gym was packed a week ago for the  Pasadena game. It was, so far, the most crucial Pacific League basketball game  of the season, pitting the first-place Bulldogs against Crescenta Valley, tied  for second with Muir.  </P> <P> The joint was rocking.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley, meanwhile, was bricking.  </P> <P> The Falcons missed 17 of their first 18 attempts from the field.  </P> <P> "They were good shots," Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo said. "They were  just rimming out, rimming out, rimming out."  </P> <P> Goffredo's team weathered the first-quarter drought and won in double overtime,  60-59.  </P> <P> New life: While the Occidental College men have struggled, other Southern  California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference basketball teams have made  positive strides. No conference member has made a more impressive turnaround  than La Verne.  </P> <P> Last season, the Leopards were 5-21, 0-10 in conference play. They have  improved to 15-5 this season and at 5-2 in the conference are a half-game  behind first-place Whittier. Coach Gary Stewart says opposing coaches are just  starting to take notice.  </P> <P> Not of the turnaround, of the school.  </P> <P> "We had coaches calling our office for directions to our place last year,"  Stewart said with a laugh. "They didn't know how to get here.  </P> <P> "We've been here for a hundred years, but it's like, 'Hey, they started a new  university out in La Verne.' "  </P></p>

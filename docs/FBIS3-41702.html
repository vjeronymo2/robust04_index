Nevinnaya: ``Typhoid Rages in Volgodonsk But </F> Specialists See No Grounds for Special Alarm'']    [Text] According to data from the State Committee on Civil  Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery From Natural  Disasters [GKChS], the number of persons hospitalized for  typhoid in Volgodonsk in the Rostov Oblast has reached 286. As  TRUD already wrote several days ago, this dangerous disease  began spreading because of trouble in the local water supply  system. As of today, the diagnosis has already been confirmed in  179 persons.    Yesterday an interdepartmental meeting on the problems of  infectious diseases and the epidemic situation in Russia  convened under the chairmanship of G. Filatov, deputy chairman  of the CKChS. Representatives of the RF State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and Ministry of Health took  part in the meeting. Increases in the frequency of cases of  typhoid, cholera, diptheria, and other dangerous infections on  Russian territory were noted. The following were cited as the  main reasons: poor-quality untreated water, contaminated  foodstuffs, and infected tourists traveling into the country.    Preventive measures and measures to eliminate those foci of  disease that have already developed, including in Volgodonsk,  were discussed. As were were informed at the GKChS press center,  however, ``the meeting participants expressed their certainty  that the current situation in Russia regarding infectious  diseases is not threat.'' Any commentary is, as they say,  unnecessary.</p>

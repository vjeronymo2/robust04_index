Imset: "Zhalah Had To Be Hit"] </F>   [Text] Ankara -- On Friday [28 January], Turkish warplanes  conducted what Prime Minister Tansu Ciller referred to as "the  most important operation of the past 10 years" and bombed a  major training camp of Kurdish separatists based on the  Iran-Iraq border.    The operation, the deepest ever into Iraqi territory, came  amid reports that the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] was  gearing up to launch a wave of attacks targeting Kurdish  civilians in the Southeast. The Zhalah camp which was bombed  and almost completely destroyed, was used by the outlawed  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) not only for training purposes  but, as Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani  also accepted, to conduct cross border operations into Turkey.    According to information the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN]  obtained during a November 1993 trip to the area, the PKK was  not only using Zhalah for shelter, but was expanding its  influence both inside Iran and in the Kurdish-controlled parts  of Iraq close to the border.    Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Mas'ud Barzani  readily accepted when interviewed by the TDN in Zakho that it  was a great mistake from the very beginning to allow the PKK to  move into the area. Talabani said at about the same time that  they had no other alternative.    The PKK's "transfer" to Zhalah came in 1992 with the October  Turkish incursion into Iraq tightening the grip on this  organization and with a makeshift surrender of the separatists  to the Iraqi Kurds.    As Turkish officials boasted back in Ankara that some 4,000  casualties were recorded in successful land and air attacks,  Iraqi Kurds were putting the number of PKK losses at about 180  at the most.    Instead of agreeing that the result of the incursion fell  short of expectation, officials had electoral priorities and  insisted that they had crushed the terrorists.    In reality, and as the TDN then reported at the cost of  angering officials, hundreds of PKK militants were placed in  trucks and buses, carried off to Kurdish-controlled Iraqi cities  and from there, transported to Zhalah.    The only practical result of the Turkish operation then was  to force the PKK more than a hundred kilometers to the south of  the Turkish border and make it more difficult for the  separatists to reach back into southern Turkey.    But, despite agreements made with the Iraqi Kurds, the PKK  was allowed to keep most of its weapons. Thus it gradually grew  and, allowed initially to live exactly on the border region,  expanded into Iran.    Soon, it even took control of the whole area to the extent  of  declaring this smugglers' route a "military zone" on behalf of  its so-called popular liberation army ARGK [People's Liberation  Army of Kurdistan]. It moved a main guards post out onto the  main road from Iran to northern Iraq and started to "tax"  smugglers using this route. Moreover, it increased its  influence among Iranian and Iraqi Kurds in the region and  started even to infiltrate the PUK.    In November, only about a kilometer away from the Iranian  border, the PKK flag could be seen across this post -- marking  the organization's territory. Even Iraqi-Kurdish peshmergas  feared to enter this zone.    "There is an army here," one PKK militant, armed with a  Kalashnikov, had explained there. Even the sight of PKK  militants forced the PUK peshmergas, highly professional  "mountain soldiers," to hide their weapons!    About 2,000 militants were initially taken down to Zhalah  which is over a hundred kilometers south of the Turkish border.  "But they never once abided by the agreement," Barzani recently  argued. "We were against the Zhalah plan from the very  beginning. Now they have Iran right behind them and we have no  control."    The PKK had turned into a big problem for the Iraqi Kurds as  well since they truly lost control over its activities. It is  still questionable, however, whether this was a mistake owed to  coincidences or was somewhat intentional.    A slip of the tongue by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in a  press  conference earlier last year somewhat answered this question:  "Thanks to them," he said with regard to the Iraqi Kurds, "we  have no problems."    Until Talabani warned him in what sounded like Kurdish  gibberish, Ocalan had already given the news that "a corridor  has been opened to us and we are free to move."    The corridor was opened on the Iranian side of the border  and  it was easy enough for a number of militants to cross Iranian  territory back into Turkey. Ocalan was blunt enough to confess  this.    "Zhalah," said Barzani in November, "was a great mistake  from the day the agreement (with the PKK) was signed."    According to this agreement, the PKK was promising to drop  its weapons, had agreed to limit its activities to political  ones and never to conduct attacks on Turkey from northern Iraq.  "Now," added Talabani, "they are crossing into Turkey from  Iran."    And either over the Iranian border, or crossing back into  Iraq and then into Turkey, the PKK was attacking.    In 1993 alone, a total of 1,249 civilians were killed in  these attacks and 1,389 civilians were wounded.    But why were the Iraqi Kurds, who have insistently stressed  their friendship with Turkey, unable to do anything about this?  Asked why they did not completely destroy the PKK but preferred  instead to accept a surrender, Talabani's response was that  "there was no other way."    What Barzani referred to as a great mistake is for Talabani  a  necessity. "We could not destroy them," he said. "When they  were in Khakurk (the area where the borders of Iran, Turkey and  Iraq meet) they had Iranian support. Iran gives them arms and  ammunition. If we had tried to destroy the PKK, it could have  fought with us for years and years."    Another reason Talabani cited was that Kurdish public  opinion  would not have accepted an outright attack on the Kurds.  Finally, he said, the PKK had the power to stop traffic --  vital aid material -- from entering northern Iraq as it did  during a self-styled embargo it imposed on this territory in the  summer of 1992.    It was evident that to reach its goals, the PKK would  refrain  from doing nothing and could even go to the extent of blocking  humanitarian aid for Kurdish civilians.    Although Talabani has argued that there were only about  1,000  militants remaining in Zhalah, PUK sources close to the camp  have told the TDN that the camp, in the main, is made out of a  total of 21 houses which contain some 120 militants at the most  on the Iraqi side of the border. The remaining militants are  normally on the move and/or in for training.    Ankara officials have frequently argued that the PKK's  ability to move out of the region and cross into Turkey --  either from Iran or Iraq -- is against the terms of Turkey's own  agreement with the Iraqi Kurds.    Despite these comments, there was no clear indication that  Zhalah would be hit by Turkey at least before next spring. Not  only is the camp over a hundred kilometers south of the border,  but it is based in a rugged, mountainous region and partially in  Iranian territory as well.    There was concern that such an attack would have to mean  striking Iran as well.    But, as Ciller said on Friday, the decision was of a  political nature. One with its consequences carefully  considered and coming after extensive talks on security with  officials from Iraq, Iran and the Iraqi Kurdish government.    Turkey had given a warning that it would do what was  necessary if others failed to do it.    Both of the Kurdish leaders in Iraq have been aware that the  Zhalah issue is increasingly harming their relationship with  Turkey, a lifeline for the Kurds of the region.    Once such an obstacle is removed, it is evident that such  relations will be smoother -- if the Kurds do not make similar  mistakes in the future.    What is not known exactly for the time being is truly how  many PKK militants were in Zhalah and whether they were all part  of the "fighting force." A number of female militants,  approximately 250, are cited among Turkey's targets. But there  are reports from the Kurdish side that there were some children  and elderly as well, relatives of militants or banished people.  Had the PKK used Zhalah in accordance with its protocol with  the Kurds and had it refrained from military training and  attacks, it would not have jeopardized these people. But, the  PKK has little consideration for such "minor factors." Neither  does it have the right to claim that innocents were killed. No,  not the PKK which itself is systematically killing women and  children!    As for the fate of the two PKK commanders in Zhalah,  (Ferhat)  Osman Ocalan and the notorious radical leader (Mahir) Numan  Ucar, these are not known yet. They may have escaped or died.  Little does it matter.    The fact is, Zhalah had to be hit and Turkey has taken care  not to harm any civilians in the area. There may have been some  casualties from out of the ranks of the smugglers and/or border  guards. But in dealing with the PKK and/or tolerating it, they  knew of the risks.    Zhalah is terminated or will be soon, depending on the  results of post-operation reconnaissance flights. This is an  important advantage for Turkey. What is more important is that  Ankara has clearly put its cards on the table and make it known  to other countries in the region that it seriously determined  this time to crush terrorism at whatever cost.    And, it has not gone unnoticed how Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan  Gures, in his morning meeting with Tansu Ciller, referred to  Zhalah. "This is even closer to Turkey than the al-Biqa'  Valley," he said.    Zhalah was bombed not because Turkey wanted this, but  because  it had turned into a serious risk for this country and those  neighboring it. Zhalah was hit, because it had to be hit.</p>

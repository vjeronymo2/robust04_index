			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: New rules on international equity offerings proposed THE International Primary Market Association has announced important changes to its recommendations for international equity and debt offerings. IPMA says the recommendations amount to a new code of conduct for international equity offerings. 'We believe we have come up with a credible code of conduct for equities to match our debt code,' said Mr Dirk Hazell, secretary-general of IPMA. Two levels of disclosure are required of the lead-manager, covering corporate and market information. One is for countries from within 'specified jurisdictions' - EC and EFTA countries, the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - and a stricter one for offerings from developing countries. The main effects for debt and equity-related debt instruments will be to increase further the transparency of the lead manager's operation of stabilisation; reduce the period within which fees are to be paid to 30 days from 45 days - where they are not payable on closing; and to abolish the grace period of 14 days for interest on late payment of fees. They apply from November 16.</p>

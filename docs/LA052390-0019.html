			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREYSTONE MANSION  </P> <P> David Ferrell's otherwise excellent piece on Beverly Hill's Greystone Mansion  (Part A, May 8) credits me with having saved the historic house from demolition  by removing a file from City Hall.  </P> <P> While the quote used was accurate, I had also explained to Ferrell that a  sympathetic staff obviously wanted me to make sure the file was misplaced so  that demolition permits would be delayed.  </P> <P> I did "rush" to City Hall a few days before the council meeting, but not  because I wanted to lose a file. I went at the request of then-Fire Chief  Charles Benford and Mayor Leroy Watson to see if there were some means of  preventing demolition. I did put the file in my brief case, but I then took it  to the city attorney's office. They simply failed to send it back immediately.  </P> <P> But the real credit for saving Greystone belongs to Benford. He took me on  first tour of the grounds and the Doheny home and pleaded with me and others in  the community to help prevent what would have been a tragic loss. All this  happened in the early 1960s and even though no permanent use has yet been  found, every City Council since then has continued the effort to prevent  demolition. The Greystone Foundation, simply by existing, has also been  responsible for preservation.  </P> <P> I needed to clear the record so that city staff doesn't hide files when I walk  in the door.  </P> <P> RUDY COLE, Vice President  </P> <P> Greystone Foundation  </P></p>

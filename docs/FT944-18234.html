			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (24): Rising imports cause anxiety - Brazil Tumbling car prices triggered by tax cuts and improved productivity are unleashing pent-up demand in Brazil, which was the fastest-growing big market for vehicles last year. Despite this good news, locally-based manufacturers are worried about the rise in imports, as well as a continuing productivity gap with foreign competitors, some of which are considering whether to move production to Brazil. After averaging 800,000-900,000 vehicles a year in the 1980s, Brazil's manufacturers churned out nearly 1.4m vehicles last year, up 30 per cent on the year before. This made the industry Latin America's biggest producer and No 10 globally. Production this year is likely to approach 1.6m vehicles. Exports within the Mercosur common market, which comes into force on January 1 and will include Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, may also increase. Last year Brazil exported 218,000 vehicles to Argentina compared with 83,000 in 1991. The Mercosur countries are negotiating a transitional agreement for the car industry, which will cover rules on regional content and a common external tariff. Companies are investing to standardise and integrate production between Brazilian and Argentine plants. However, some analysts believe that the overvaluation of Brazil's new currency, the Real, and Argentine worries about its trade deficit raise uncertainties about vehicle exports to Argentina in the future. Brazilian car executives believe the big growth potential is in the local market where there are just five cars per 100 inhabitants compared with 11 in Argentina and 30 in Europe. Domestic demand has grown as local car makers have had to compete since the economy was opened up at the beginning of the decade. This cut tariffs and imported vehicles have grown from 15,000 in 1991 to a likely 120,000 vehicles this year, forcing local manufacturers to improve productivity and quality. Productivity at Fiat, General Motors and Autolatina, the holding company for the joint operations of Ford and Volkswagen, has increased by an average 17 per cent a year this decade due to higher volumes combined with a reduced workforce and the contracting out of services. Quality has also improved, with defects falling by 50 per cent over the period, according to a report by consultants Booz-Allen earlier this year. More importantly, agreements between the government and the industry since 1992 have cut taxes and profit margins. Taxes have fallen by an average 22 per cent, leading to a dramatic fall in prices, particularly for 1,000cc cars where the reductions were concentrated. The price of VW's 1,000cc Gol car has fallen from Dollars 13,000 to just over Dollars 7,000 in the past three years, says Pierre Alain de Smedt, Autolatina chairman. But there could be problems ahead for Brazil's manufacturers. Despite the productivity gains, they are still 10 per cent less efficient than Europeans and further behind the Japanese, says Booz-Allen. Thanks to the growing local market, they face the threat that competitors who are now importing cars could start to produce in Brazil. Nissan and Toyota are thought to be planning investments. The companies are also concerned about the rise in imports and are calling for quotas to be imposed, which the government has so far refused. They argue that, despite the tax cuts, Brazilian vehicles are still overburdened compared with foreign cars.</p>

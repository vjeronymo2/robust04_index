[Words indistinct] today took up most of the time of this  second day of the tour Foreign Minister Robaina is taking in the  company of a delegation made up of diplomats accredited in Cuba.  This time, the effort being made in the area to effect the final  stage of the coffee harvest successfully focused interest on  these workers, who have today become -- as Robaina said -- true  protagonists of Cuban foreign policy.    The first spot visited on the tour of the Cienfuegos  mountain  range was the Cuatro Vientos area. [passage omitted]    The visitors saw proof of these changes at [words  indistinct], one of the 46 camps belonging to the Youth Labor  Army and the Escambray Division, which embraces the mountain  areas of Cuba's three central provinces. [passage omitted]    The last place visited was the mountain industrial complex,  where various articles are produced to meet the needs of the  inhabitants of these hills. [passage omitted]    Late yesterday evening, the fatigue from this intense work  day did not keep the diplomatic corps and the foreign minister  from meeting with some of the residents of Manicaragua  Municipality, Villa Clara Province. [passage omitted] Neither  did the Don Quixote Equine Reproduction Center, deep in the  Escambray Mountains, go unnoticed.    This work campaign through the interior of Cuba that the  Cuban Foreign Ministry has undertaken with a large group of  chiefs of diplomatic missions, a tour which has turned out to be  motivating and a source of experience, ends in Cienfuegos  Province tomorrow.

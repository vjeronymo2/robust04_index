			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Arturo Guatelli: "Rethink Brussels"] </F>   [Text] Right-wing Europe has defeated left-wing Europe,  with the sole exception of the Labour Party's success in  Britain. The winners are [German Chancellor] Kohl and [Italian  Prime Minister] Berlusconi, as well as "outsiders" Tapie [French  Radical Energy list leader] and Billiers [French "The Other  Europe" list]. [Spanish Prime Minister] Gonzalez and Rocard  [French European Solidarity list leader] have lost. Without  exception, however, all have been defeated by European  abstentionism, the worst on the market.    This result is unequivocal, and it affects almost every  country in the European Union [EU]: More or less half the  voters did not turn up at the polling stations, thus evading  their right-duty to take part in the renewal of the European  Parliament, whose legitimacy lies precisely in universal  suffrage. What are the reasons for this betrayal?    Condemning -- with no right of appeal -- those who did not  vote would denote a hypocritical and unreasonable attitude. If  the European elections have been ignored, it means the citizens  did not grasp the importance of what was at stake. The  political forces failed to apply the necessary European  pedagogy. None of them managed to explain the European  Parliament's role and potential. The quest for support -- not  only in Italy -- was mostly based on national-level messages.  In other words, Europe has been betrayed more by its political  class than by its voters.    No doubt the fact that the European Parliament has limited  powers only, and the fact that Europe's helplessness is  highlighted daily by the tragic events in the former Yugoslavia,  with the social consequences of a prolonged economic crisis, are  all eminently valid arguments to explain electoral desertion.  However, explanations do not end here. We must go deeper,  delve into psychological introspection in the attempt to  understand why Europeans are so distant from Europe, why  disillusionment is today the most widespread feeling.    During the cold war years, the need for a strong and united  West Europe was never called into question. Different  institutional models -- more or less federal in nature, more or  less intergovernmental -- may have been advanced. General de  Gaulle and Mrs. Thatcher may have had different views. But  nobody ever thought of rejecting Europe, particularly in the  knowledge that friendly relations between France and Germany --  an unquestionable peace factor -- were essentially the outcome  of the European integration process.    The first doubts were experienced in 1989. The fall of the  Berlin Wall, Germany's reunification, the end of East-West  ideological confrontation, the collapse of the Soviet empire,  did not, in the view of Europeans, highlight the need for a  united Europe or indeed the need to speed up the integration  process. On the contrary, these events released 1,000 different  poisons, not the least of which was nationalism. In today's  Europe, as [outgoing EU Commission President] Jacques Delors  correctly said, all the dangers of 1920 are present. We know  very well how that story ended.    Nationalism is a form of short-sightedness and closed  egoism.  If Europe proves unable to rid itself of this demon, it cannot  fail to arouse disappointment among its citizens. If politics  continue to be interpreted exclusively in a national key,  without the necessary openness and generosity, the little there  is today of Europe will eventually dissolve into nothing.    It is the European Parliament -- the EU's weakest  institution  -- which is now footing the bill for this situation. But the new  European deputies should not have their wings clipped simply  because the polling booths were deserted. They must continue to  fight against national governments' absolutism, against their  tendency to drift off course by marginalizing and often  criminalizing European power, whether in Brussels or Strasbourg.  A victim of disillusionment, the European Parliament can  nevertheless contribute to restoring the necessary climate of  trust to further the integration process.    In this respect, the massive abstention from the European  elections must be interpreted as a sort of last warning issued  to the political class. Politicians must understand that Europe  cannot be built amid indifference from Europeans -- no kind of  Europe, neither the continental supermarket the British want,  nor the EU advocated by Altiero Spinelli from the benches of the  European Parliament.</p>

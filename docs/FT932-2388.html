			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares easier ahead of futures expiry A CLUTCH of essentially favourable statistics on the domestic economy did little yesterday to help a UK stock market overshadowed by the prospect of the expiry this morning in several important global derivatives markets. Base rate hopes receded as the Bundesbank made no move and a further fall in UK unemployment in May appeared to reduce political pressure for a rate cut. Share prices, which had moved firmly as the financial markets awaited the economic data, refused to follow government bonds higher in the second half of the session. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which takes over as the market leader when the June contract expires this morning, dipped below 2,900 and shares began to wilt. Today also brings Triple Witching Hours, or important derivatives expiries, in US and German markets. At best, the FT-SE 100 touched 2,889.2, strengthening hopes that the market is about to break out on the upside of its present range. By the close, however, the index had turned down to register a net decline of 7.3 at 2,875.7. Strategists ascribed the market's dull close entirely to pressures linked to the impending expiry of the June contract on the Footsie. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a range of second line issues, scraped through to a new closing peak of 3,213.5, up 1.5, just under the best of the session. Trading volume was unimpressive at 555.4m shares, with the proportion of non-Footsie business, at around 59 per cent, again restrained by the futures-related activity in the blue chips. On Wednesday, Seaq volume of 607.3m shares reflected retail business worth Pounds 1.39bn, which was at the higher end of the healthy business levels of the past nine months. The largely unexpected fall to 10.4 per cent in domestic unemployment in May was regarded as good news for the UK government, as was the sustained annualised inflation rate of 1.3 per cent. In the near term, these statistics may have disappointed equity market hopes for a base rate reduction but the wider implications for the recovery in the domestic economy are likely to help the stock market. There were few features among equities yesterday and the leading securities houses were preoccupied with the futures settlement. Pharmaceutical stocks attracted support on the back of currency factors, but interest faded when Wall Street made a slow opening to the new session, shedding 2.21 Dow points in London hours. Both ICI and Zeneca were friendless. Disappointment with the 0.2 per cent fall in UK April retail sales, announced earlier this week, cast a cloud over the store and retail sector, which also reflected the waning of interest rate hopes. But brewery stocks attracted buyers. The London stock market appeared last night to have successfully survived a week featured by a series of potential pitfalls, in the shape of the important speech by the new chancellor of the exchequer in the City of London and also the list of economic data. Today also brings the latest statistics on UK money supply. Equity strategists appeared satisfied last night with forecasts that money supply M4 will continue to show a minor gain and that the rise in M4 bank lending will moderate.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Paul Marie de la Gorce, managing editor of </F> DEFENSE NATIONALE, by Omar Belhouchet; place and date not given:  "Algerian Society Has Considerable Capacity for Resistance"]    [Excerpts] Paul Marie de la Gorce, expert on Arab politics,  diplomacy, and military affairs, recently made a "working visit  to Algeria." President of the Study Committee on National  Defense and managing editor of the monthly review DEFENSE  NATIONALE, he took the opportunity of this visit to consult a  broad range of players in the current Algerian crisis. In this  interview, he explains France's position on the phenomenon of  religious fundamentalism and describes France's policy toward  the Maghreb and the Arab world in general.    [Belhouchet] The week you spent in Algiers gave you the  chance to meet many people. What is your appreciation of the  situation in Algeria?    [De la Gorce] My appreciation could be summed up in two  observations. The first bears on the indisputable capacity for  resistance of Algerian society in general, in its diverse  aspects, against what we will call for simplicity's sake "the  armed Islamist opposition." I would say very frankly that  overseas, at least when I left Paris for Algiers, the climate  was very pessimistic regarding Algerians' capacity to resist the  armed Islamist movement.    So I must say that the resistance is considerable. It is  expressed in diverse ways, of course--by the attitude of the  government, the conduct of the army, the actions of the security  forces, and also by the specific security policy pursued by the  regime in place. Let us not forget the manifest existence of  ideological political camps that are determined, as I see it, to  stoutly resist the armed Islamist opposition.    The second point I would make is that this camp comprises a  complex mix of elements, as diverse as Algerian society itself.  The political and social hierarchy in all its totality also  includes those who pour out in the streets to demonstrate  against the prospect of a religious state in Algeria. The  divisions within this camp were striking. It seems that this  camp has a great deal of difficulty uniting and focusing its  efforts.    [Belhouchet] Observers think France's policy toward Algeria  has changed In the last six years, especially since the right  came to power. What is your view?    [De la Gorce] I think the initial tone taken by French  leaders vis-a-vis Algeria was set in 1992. There were all sorts  of arguments that official policy should distance itself from  what was happening in Algeria and from the regime in place.    Following the interruption of the electoral process, it was  thought the growing power of Algeria's Islamist currents was  irreversible, so there was a great deal of concern about the  situation and a feeling that France should stay very far away  from that process. But in October 1992, a decisive turning point  was reached.    Dumas's visit to Algeria, followed by the visit of Belaid  Abdesselam and Redha Malek to Paris, resulted in large financial  commitments. This new direction was maintained by the new  government, after the 1993 legislative elections in France.    I should note that French policy is determined jointly by  the  president and the prime minister, and the two men feel the same  way about Algeria, i.e., that it is necessary now to support  Algeria in its struggle against the armed Islamist opposition.  Although that judgment is the starting point, there may be  fluctuations from time to time regarding tactics or the language  to be used. Sometimes it is stern and categorical in support of  the government in place against an opposition described as  "terrorist." At other times, one might think the most important  thing was to do something for those fighting against the armed  Islamist opposition rather than saying something that would have  no real-world impact. The general tenor of French policy is more  the former. [passage omitted]    [Belhouchet] One has the impression France is giving Algeria  a sort of wink and a nod, as if to say, "We can help you, but  make up your mind where you're going."    [De la Gorce] I do not mind at all when people say France  and  Algeria have a special relationship. But the root of the problem  lies with the Algerians: Nothing can substitute for their own  collective will. The choice of a certain type of society is one  for Algerians to make. I think that for many reasons this choice  has been delayed and fretted over, because you are looking for  the reaffirmation of a national identity in Arabization and  Islam. At the same time, some Algerians were committed to  modernity.    There was a reliance on ideological foundations that did not  prove as sound as one might have hoped and that may have  diverted Algeria from the path of modernization, from developing  the kinds of social attitudes needed to participate effectively  in the modern world.    One must never lose sight of the fact that in history, as in  life, there is no such thing as a complete break. One never  starts over from the zero point, even when leaders are replaced.  We are saddled inescapably with the consequences of cultural,  economic, and social choices made in the preceding period.    It seems to me it is not very profitable to denigrate a  regime, such as the one in power today, which is taking  important steps forward. The accord with the IMF is the largest  since 1988. It marks Algeria's decision to take a path on which  other states have already embarked.    [Belhouchet] Do you have the impression that the Islamist  movement in Algeria is completely sui generis? Why do you think  there is so much atrocity, so much hatred, when initially it was  an opposition movement that was allowed to express itself and  even enjoyed a great deal of sympathy all around the world?    [De la Gorce] Without going so far as to dispute the  uniqueness of the Algerian situation, one should not forget that  manifestations of political and religious fanaticism are  extraordinarily violent elsewhere too. The unfortunate way the  Iranian regime behaved and evolved was also extremely violent.  We see terrible violence in Egypt. I think one must consider the  logic of conflict. At first, all sides, even those trying to  seize power, are sensitive to public opinion, the need to form  alliances, to pay attention to the international context. But  the logic of conflict leads to the unleashing of violence.    We must realize that such violence feeds on itself. Thus it  does not surprise me very much that things have reached the  present juncture. This kind of thing is characteristic of  violent and armed struggles in general. So I would cautiously  suggest that we should not forget that in the history of  Algerian political movements there have been what one of your  compatriots, historian Mohamed Harbi, termed very powerful  plebeian tendencies, which continued into the period after 1945,  into what we have called the Algerian War.    [Belhouchet] Despite all the crimes it has committed, not  even sparing foreigners, the fundamentalist movement has  continued to enjoy support abroad, notably in France.    [De la Gorce] Yes, in France, we have this very strong, very  negative, irrational and absurd reaction, but it's pretty  widespread. I would like to draw your attention to the fact the  same reactions can be seen in other countries--and the example  of the United States is particularly revealing in that regard.  You published in EL WATAN an extremely revealing report of  remarks made by a U.S. State Department assistant  secretary-designate before a congressional committee, which  reflected very accurately the attitude I myself observed several  weeks ago in Washington among members of the majority  party--namely, the feeling that Algeria has been on the wrong  path since the interruption of the electoral process, that in  the last analysis the Islamist current is the one most  representative of Algerian society, that the country is sinking  into internal turmoil that will end in civil war.    I recall that two American officials were criticizing the  Algerian Government because in the face of an armed Islamist  opposition it would be incapable of moving ahead with the  monetary, financial, and economic reforms indispensable not only  for its own future but simply to restore order.    [Belhouchet] What is the main tenor of the U.S.  Administration's current thinking on Algeria?    [De la Gorce] The predominant view more or less favors a  compromise with the Islamist camp. There is a different school  of thought holding that the struggle against Islamist  fundamentalism must be pursued because it is a dangerous  phenomenon, with Iran the seat of infection and Sudan a  secondary locus of contagion.    [Belhouchet] As you leave Algeria, what feelings do you take  with you?    [De la Gorce] My feeling is that the determination of men  and  women opposed to a takeover by the armed Islamist opposition is  such that the latter will not succeed. But naturally I cannot  predict the duration of that struggle--or the forms it may  assume. I also think it is too soon to predict whether those  resolved to destroy the armed Islamist opposition will have a  quick victory, because there is more to the struggle than just  the security dimension.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Observer: A bit rich The Sunday Times still can't make its mind up whether the Queen is Britain's wealthiest person. In its latest list of Britain's 300 richest people, the Queen comes out on top with Pounds 6.5bn. But this is in her capacity as head of state which is pretty meaningless. If she is counted as a private citizen, like the rest of the bunch, she slips to number 16 in the charts, and if rival estimates in the Economist magazine are to be believed, she would only rank as the 150th richest person. It would make more sense if the Sunday Times did the same with the Queen as it has done with Michael Ashcroft and Peter de Savary and dumped her from the list to save future embarrassment. Estimates of her wealth as just as unfathomable.</p>

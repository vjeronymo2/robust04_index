			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by KONTINENT Belgrade correspondent Momchilo </F> Stoyanovich: "Why Has Yugoslavia Not Yet Recognized Macedonia?"]    [Text] With the U.S. recognition of Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Russia's decision  to send its ambassador to Skopje in early March, in practice all  the leading countries in the world have confirmed the status of  the Macedonian state. Before the beginning of 1994, Macedonia  was recognized by Germany, France, Britain, and other European  states, which hastened to take this step before Greece assumed  the EU presidency.    The Foreign Ministry in Skopje reports that so far 27 states  have established diplomatic relations with Macedonia, although  the documents and communications materials of only 11 states  officially refer to "the Republic of Macedonia." The remainder,  including the United States, use the term "The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia," under which the United Nations admitted  Macedonia as a member.    Bearing in mind that, except for Greece, Macedonia has been  recognized by all the Balkan states (including all the other  former Yugoslav republics,) the question why the FRY has still  not recognized Macedonia remains open. Little is said openly  about this issue, but the fact remains that to date no meeting  has taken place between a Macedonian and a Serb at which the  southern neighbor has failed to ask his northern brother the  reason for his continued delay in recognizing Macedonia's  independence.    Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the man with most  influence in Yugoslav politics, has not omitted to say at his  meetings with Macedonian representatives that Serbia has no  claims against its southern neighbor and that nothing prevents  Belgrade from recognizing Macedonia, and yet in practice this  does not happen.    It is natural for Yugoslavia to say that even its own status  is not yet settled, because the United Nations is keeping this  issue open. Since spring last year, Yugoslavia has not been a  full member of the United Nations; it was not expelled from the  organization, but it is not entitled to take part in meetings of  the UN General Assembly. However, the true reason relates to  Greece, which demonstrates very good friendly relations toward  the Serbs and always defends Yugoslavia's interests in the  international arena. Furthermore, as a member of the EU, Greece  has much stronger influence in Europe than Macedonia, whose  status has still not been determined. Of course, one should not  gloss over the fact that Macedonia has also failed so far to  recognize the FRY, which was formed from the two former Yugoslav  republic of Serbia and Montenegro.    It is evident that there are enough reasons for Belgrade to  delay recognizing Macedonia. Accordingly, Yugoslavia will be in  no hurry to do so, at least until there is an improvement in the  relations between Skopje and Athens.</p>

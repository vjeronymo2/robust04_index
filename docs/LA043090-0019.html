			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHIRER'S CBS RADIO SHOW  </P> <P> J.F. Beck's letter (March 19) concerning the chapters in my book, "A Native's  Return," about Edward R. Murrow and his firing me from CBS makes some  astonishing statements.  </P> <P> He speaks of my "claim to martyrdom." I never claimed it. The charge is false.  </P> <P> He asserts that when he was in the news department at the Los Angeles CBS radio  station he had to listen to "complaints from the sales department about the  declining quality of the ratings in Shirer's time period."  </P> <P> What complaints? The local Los Angeles CBS station's salesmen had nothing to do  with selling my Sunday show, the only sponsored one I had. This was handled by  the New York CBS office and a New York advertising agency which bought time for  the sponsor for a coast-to-coast hookup. There were never any "complaints" from  the sales people in New York. Why?  </P> <P> Because, I suppose, contrary to what Beck contends about declining ratings, and  to his bland assurance that I "could no longer command a broadcasting audience  large enough for the requirements of broadcast commerce," my Sunday broadcast,  according to the reports I got weekly from MCA, my agent, had the highest  rating of any daytime show on Sunday. If my ratings were slipping, as Beck  asserts, surely the sponsor, not to mention Murrow and William Paley, would  have complained. They never did.  </P> <P> Beck says that "my lack of broadcast skills, voice quality and delivery" had  made me "dull beyond survival" on the air. However, at the very moment in 1947  that the controversy erupted, I was receiving the Peabody Award, then the most  prestigious in radio, "for outstanding reporting and interpretation of the  news." And that year, too, Billboard's poll of 100 newspaper radio editors  cited me "as the most interesting news commentator on the air."  </P> <P> It is embarrassing to mention such things, but Beck's letter, full of  misrepresentations, leaves his target with no choice but to respond with the  truth.  </P> <P> WILLIAM L. SHIRER  </P> <P> Lenox, Mass.  </P></p>

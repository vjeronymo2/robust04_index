New Delhi's concern  was conveyed by the director general of BSF [Border Security  Force], Mr. Prakash Singh, at the two-day India-Bangladesh  coordination meeting which concluded in the capital yesterday.  The Bangladesh delegation was led by the director general of  Bangladesh Rifles, Mohammad Anwar Hussain. A BSF spokesman said  that India also raised the issue of support being received by  insurgent groups of the Northeast. The question of illegal  immigration from Bangladesh was also raised at the meeting with  India insisting that the 1991 agreement at the home secretary  level should be implemented to sort out the problem.    As already reported, both India and Bangladesh agreed at the  meeting to coordinate their efforts to check smuggling. The two  sides also decided to undertake delineation of 50 kms of  undemarcated border. The work on repair and maintenance of  border pillars along the international border is to be taken up  with the security forces of the two countries.    The BSF spokesman said that both India and Bangladesh have  agreed that security forces should observe utmost restraint in  the disputed Muharichar area and take demarcation of the border  in the 1.6 km stretch immediately.</p>

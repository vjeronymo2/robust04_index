			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech President Vaclav Havel by Eva Hulkova </F> at Lany presidential residence; date not given: "Conversations  at Lany" -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Hulkova] Mr. President, you have always rather  vehemently opposed a concept of "Conversations" that would have  us deal with the past week. But this week was marked by the  visit of Bill Clinton, and we simply cannot ignore this fact.    [Havel] I think we cannot. I would like to make perhaps two  or three minor observations in relation to this visit. As far  as the substance is concerned, meaning the future European  security arrangement, the political arrangement and the  Partnership for Peace plan, I would not touch on it too much  anymore. A lot was said about it. I would make only one  observation. Voices are often heard that this is not enough,  that it is only a form of pacifying us, calming us down, of  delaying NATO membership and that the right thing would be to  accept us immediately. I think these are quite short-sighted  voices because few people are aware that all this places some  demands on us. [passage omitted] For example, the Partnership  for Peace plan means that our soldiers may have to go fight  somewhere occasionally. It means that foreign troops could be  here for certain joint exercises. It is difficult to know how  the public will react to this. It will also cost some money.  It will require making certain psychological, moral, and also  material investments. It remains to be seen to what extent our  society, our public is ready for it. It seems to me that it is  a very well balanced plan, and we should not forget this side of  it. On the degree of our capability to take over this common  responsibility for Europe, that will primarily depend on how  really and fully we are going to be able to be integrated in  such structures as NATO.    [Hulkova] When I think of Bill Clinton, it seems to me that  compared with other U.S. Presidents he is playing a special and  important role. [passage omitted] What kind of man is he? What  are his qualities as a statesman? How does he measure up as the  U.S. President? After all, this is the most important  political post in the world.    [Havel] [passage omitted] My impression was that he was an  unusually responsible, sincere, direct, and open man. Although  on television, especially during the election campaign, he may  appear as a continually smiling television star aware of being  surrounded by cameras, I have arrived at the conclusion that he  is a sincere man. He is really like that. He is a very frank  man who wants to know everything. [passage omitted] He is a  very direct man who likes to meet people, and who likes to  listen to them. [passage omitted]    All this makes me like him. At the same time it does not  mean that he is not a professional. He always finds time to  read books on politics, history, the future, and other books.  In the White House he is surrounded by a large number of  intellectuals and scientists. He is a man who likes to think  and who is attempting to see matters in a long term perspective.  [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] Let's recall another aspect of Bill Clinton's  visit  to our country. It has been apparent for some time that the  Visegrad countries [Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and  Hungary] find themselves at a crossroads and that they do not  know how to continue. Have all the negotiations that took place  provided some kind of an indication of what should happen next?    [Havel] The cooperation between the four was surrounded by  an  endless number of various speculations, conjectures, and  analyses that appeared both in our and foreign press. I think  -- and I have said this on many occasions -- that we are in fact  living in a different time now, that the original purpose of the  group has been exhausted and fulfilled, as it were, and that the  era of grand joint declarations, manifestos, and summits, by  which we were demonstrating our indestructible unity, has  passed. We had to do this at the time when we were jointly  trying to extricate ourselves from Soviet hegemony. That's  clear and it has been said on a number of occasions.    I think, however, that the other half of the truth should be  voiced, too. The truth is that we will be living side by side  with our neighbors for centuries to come, and this is more  important than whether our opinions are closer to a particular  government or to a particular president of a neighboring  country. We must bear the long term perspective in mind. We  must be aware of the fact that almost 60 percent of our exports  are in fact exports to neighboring countries. [passage omitted]    What is at issue now is finding a new identity and a new  form  of this regional cooperation that will be in keeping with the  present time. The fact is that at the present time, when the  interests of individual countries are beginning to  differentiate, when differences in the historical identity of  these countries are coming to the surface, it is becoming clear  that things are slightly different in this period than they were  in the initial phase. Thus, cooperation will have to have a  different form. It will have to be less manifest. It will have  to be a specific cooperation in various spheres, in the spheres  where a common minimum of joint interests exists, as our foreign  minister puts it. I would like to add to this that we should  hold talks even in the spheres where there is a divergence of  interests or where our interests differ or where differences  exist. We should conduct a lasting political dialogue.    Certain differences between individual countries, which are  gradually beginning to emerge, are not a reason for terminating  the dialogue. On the contrary, these differences should lead to  stepping up the dialogue.    I became aware of this during a presidential dinner, when  four presidents of the countries of this group had a very  interesting, professional, and long debate. It was dominated by  a discussion between President Walesa and President Goncz, whose  views were quite different. I then realized how important this  type of discussion is. [passage omitted] This contributes to the  cleansing of regional climate, which is very important.    My impression is that this meeting, this joint meeting with  President Clinton, contributed to our more intensive thinking  about new forms, new shapes, and new identities of this regional  cooperation in Central Europe.    Voices appeared reproaching the United States for forcing us  too strongly into coordination or joint conduct and for not  paying enough attention to the fact that we are independent  states and that each of us is in a slightly different situation.  Although they may well have a point, I would also like to point  out that the United States has the experience of the  1,000-year-long hostility between France and Germany. Thousands  of disputes came to an end after World War II when West European  integration started to form itself. It was the United States  that to a considerable extent contributed to this integration  under the Marshall Plan. [passage omitted]    To a certain extent perhaps, the United States applies or  reflects this experience to Central Europe. I think that this  aspect is also noteworthy.    [Hulkova] Mr. President, perhaps it could be said that your  considerations are aimed at a meeting in Litomysl where you will  meet representatives of not only the Visegrad countries but also  representatives of Germany, Austria, and Slovenia.    [Havel] Reports about this meeting have already appeared in  newspapers. It might be appropriate for me to comment further  on this issue. Recently I, our prime minister, and our foreign  minister agreed that we felt that Austria and Slovenia were also  an integral part of Central Europe. [passage omitted]    Last year, when attending the opening of the Salzburg  Festival, we had a meeting with President Goncz, [Austrian  President Thomas] Klestil and President von Weizsaecker. The  talks we had were very interesting. There was also a big  television discussion. We agreed to meet from time to time and  also to invite those who were absent; in other words the Slovak  and Polish presidents. [passage omitted]    It was my idea that we could meet in Litomysl. It was in  Salzburg that I invited them to visit the Czech Republic. All  of them agreed. [passage omitted]    It would be an unofficial meeting. The purpose of this  meeting would not be to conclude treaties and agreements and  issue declarations. Nothing of the sort. Its purpose would be  to contribute to a good regional climate and create a  psychologically favorable atmosphere or scope that would make it  possible for our executive bodies -- the governments -- to  carry out their work.

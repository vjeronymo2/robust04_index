			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The decision on the measures to be adopted to combat  the wave of speculation resulting from value-added tax [VAT]  implementation has been postponed until tomorrow. A special  Economic Cabinet meeting will be held at 1700 on 9 January.    A special Economic Cabinet session to analyze possible  measures to stop the wave of speculation unleashed by VAT  implementation ended a few minutes ago. Rosana Ordonez, Central  Information Office director, reported the details of the  measures being analyzed:    [Begin recording] [Ordonez] There was a meeting of the  Economic Cabinet this afternoon, with the participation of  Finance Ministry officials. Again, they stated that Venezuelans  must accept VAT as a tax in order to cover the fiscal deficit.  Unless additional revenues are collected, we will be unable to  cover expenses at universities, the government payroll, and  other public expenses.    Economic experts were consulted on certain existing doubts  regarding VAT implementation due to misinformation. They said  that these doubts have existed in all countries where VAT has  been implemented but that they gradually disappear through  information campaigns through the media.    At the same time, there has been speculation that is  unrelated to VAT, because the products on which prices have been  increased are precisely those exempted from VAT, such as milk,  eggs, beef, and consumer products. Specific measures are being  analyzed to control this wave of speculation and punish those  who are abusing the people's economic possibilities.    [Unidentified reporter] Will sanctions include closing  businesses?    [Ordonez] I cannot tell you what type of sanctions will be  adopted, as they are being analyzed and will be announced  tomorrow after a Council of Ministers meeting that will take  place at 1700. What we want people to know is that the  government is concerned about the situation, which is being  analyzed. The situation is difficult and complex, and thus we  are meeting every day, including Saturday and Sunday. We are  studying options and possibilities within existing laws, so that  within the state of law citizens can feel that the government is  concerned about an unusual situation of speculation. The  current government will tend to the problems affecting  Venezuelan citizens until the next government assumes power.  [end recording]    The aim of the measures being analyzed is to inform the  public that the government definitely wants to stop the wave of  speculation for the benefit of consumers.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Bosnian Serbs warn US over planned air-drop A United Nations convoy nears the besieged town of Gorazde, taking food and medicine to 70,000 Bosnian Moslems who have received no aid since mid-January because of a blockade by Serbs. The US has told its Nato allies that it will go ahead this week with its plan to air drop supplies to the blockaded areas of eastern Bosnia. Britain welcomed the plan but said British aircraft would not take part in the operation. The deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army, General Milan Gvero, said the air-drop would lead to a massive use of force and the spread of armed conflict in Bosnia.

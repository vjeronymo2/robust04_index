			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Jane Fonda says her visit to an Aztec ruin being excavated in the city in 1979  inspired her to make "The Old Gringo," a movie about the meeting of Mexicans  and Americans during the Mexican Revolution. "I went down down into that hole,  and saw a whole other civilization beneath the surface," Fonda said. "I had a  very visceral reaction to the thought that someone from another country could  come in and think they had a better religion, a better system." Based on the  novel by Carlos Fuentes, "The Old Gringo" is a fictitious account of what  happened when the American writer Ambrose Bierce disappeared in Mexico during  the 1910-21 revolution.

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUIN-BASHERS HAVE THEIR SAY  </P> <P> For all its supposedly great recruiting and national glory, the UCLA football  program has taken a giant step backward this year. The Bruins' performance  against Arizona was not just pathetic and embarrassing. It was inexcusable.  </P> <P> To say the Bruins quit is giving them too much credit. They weren't trying to  begin with.  </P> <P> CHRIS OTT, Los Angeles  </P></p>

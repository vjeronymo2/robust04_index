			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / People: MFI builds its boardroom table MFI, the furniture retailer floated on the stock exchange two years ago, is shaking up its senior management and appointing its first female finance director. The announcement was made at yesterday's annual meeting, where MFI gave a very positive statement on current trading. It said that although sales were less buoyant in July, strong turnover in August and September meant sales for the first 19 weeks of the current year were 10 per cent ahead of last year. Derek Hunt is relinquishing the role of chief executive but remains executive chairman. He will have more time for strategy, for example, on investigating opportunities in France, where the 52nd store was opened this week. Hunt joined MFI in 1972, and in 1973, as branch operations controller, earned notoriety during the miners' strike by delivering generators to all MFI stores. He became group managing director in 1981, before moving to Asda after the merger with the supermarket group in 1985. He returned to MFI in 1987 to head the Pounds 780m management buy-out. Responsibility for day-to-day management of the business passes to John Randall (far left), promoted from finance director to group managing director. Randall is to be replaced as group finance director by Sue Murphy (left), for the past six years finance director of the retail division. Randall, 48, trained as an accountant at Spillers before joining MFI in 1978. He became finance director of the retail business in 1982, and group finance director in 1987 at the time of the management buy-out. Murphy, 37, worked previously at Rank Xerox, Overseas Containers, and IBM. She joined MFI in 1984 as a management accountant and in 1985 became chief accountant. She was appointed retail finance director in 1987.</p>

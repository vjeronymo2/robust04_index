			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some suggested that it would be more appropriate for the Secretary to rely on information such as an institution's withdrawal, completion or placement rates and pass rates on external testing and certification, in combination with the default rate, rather than to rely on the default rate alone. Another commenter recommended assessing an institution's default management activities in conjunction with its default rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters expressed concern that many poor students would be discriminated against if default rates were used as an administrative capability criterion. Some commenters noted the default rate exceptions for tribally controlled community colleges, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and Navajo community colleges and questioned why institutions other than these that serve just as many poor students should be considered poorly operated institutions as a result of a high default rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary would like to point out that the use of default rates as a determining factor in the evaluation of an institution's administrative capability is not new. Although some commenters perceived the proposed use of a 20 percent default rate to be at variance with current default practices, it should be noted that the Secretary proposed use of a 20 percent rate because that rate is currently considered as an indicator of impaired administrative capability. Furthermore, institutions with default rates of 20 percent or more are currently required to submit default management plans. However the Secretary also sees merit in using 25 percent as the criterion for addressing defaults under the FFEL programs, as an institution that has a 25 percent rate for three consecutive years is subject to termination from the FFEL programs and it is therefore consistent for the Secretary to thus provisionally certify or otherwise limit such an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Acceptance of a three year time period would also address the concern of commenters that a one-year rate may not be an accurate indicator of an institution's administrative capability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Secretary does not agree with those commenters who assert that default rates are not indicative of administrative capability, as stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary does agree that approval of an institution to participate, or to continue participation in, Title IV, HEA programs should not rest solely on the institution's having a default rate below 25 percent. Therefore, if the Secretary identifies no other serious administrative capability problems that would warrant denying participation approval to an institution with a default rate of 25 percent or more, the Secretary intends to provisionally certify the institution. As discussed above, the limitations on full certification will include, at minimum, the prohibition on participation in the FFEL programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary acknowledges that tribally controlled colleges, HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges have been treated differently, but notes that exceptions to default provisions for these institutions were mandated by Congress. The Secretary notes that the exception for these institutions will be extended to apply to this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary accepts commenters views that it is more logical to use a 25 percent default rate over a three year period and has amended &sect;668.16(m) of these final regulations accordingly. The Secretary has amended &sect;668.17(c)(6) to specify that this standard will not apply to tribally controlled colleges HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters contended that the cohort default rate used to determine an institution's administrative capability should be the same for the Federal Perkins Loan Program as it is for the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs. Two commenters contended that the cohort default rate should be set at 30 percent for the Federal Perkins Loan Program to be consistent with implementation of the new cohort default rate calculation for the Federal Perkins Loan Program. One commenter suggested that there be a ``phase-in'' of this requirement to allow institutions the opportunity to meet the lower default rate. Two commenters recommended that the Secretary provide for an appeal procedure for Federal Perkins Loan default rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Different cohort default rates apply to determining administrative capability with respect to the Federal Perkins Loan Program than apply to the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs to conform to different standards for participation in those programs and different sanctions applied for exceeding the rates in those programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the Secretary's request for comment on the development of an appropriate default rate for the FDSL Program, one commenter contended that the rate should be no lower than the cohort default rate for the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs. The commenter believed that if a student does not meet his or her repayment arrangements, the student should be placed in default. A few commenters believed that a student who is using income contingent repayment should not be considered in default and should not be removed from the cohort used to determine an institution's default rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is exploring the use of an appropriate default rate for the FDSL Program through the negotiated rulemaking process. A default rate for the FDSL Program will not be used for the evaluation of an institution's administrative capability at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary received over eighty comments on the use and computation of withdrawal rates in the determination of administrative capability. The majority of commenters had concerns about the calculation of withdrawal rates and the effect of this standard on institutions serving high-risk populations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal concern with the calculation was that a student who merely completed registration procedures but never showed up for classes would be treated as a withdrawal. The commenters believed that this would result in artificially high withdrawal rates. One commenter stated that it is not unusual to have 20 percent of the enrolled students never start classes. These commenters recommended that only students who actually begin classes be counted. Several other commenters urged that the calculation of withdrawal rate take into consideration the institution's refund policy. One of these commenters said that the State of California requires a complete refund of the registration fee up to one week after classes begin, allowing for a ``no obligation'' look. Another commenter stated that, at another institution, students are allowed a three week ``look-see'' period during which to make sure the students are satisfied with the training they are receiving and to allow institution personnel to make sure the student is motivated and capable of benefiting from the training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters expressed concern that withdrawal rates may be more indicative of the type of students being served rather than of an institution's administrative capability. Some of these commenters asserted that use of a 33 percent withdrawal rate as an absolute standard would result in discrimination against high-risk minority students, reducing opportunities available to them. Commenters also asserted that this standard would adversely affect community colleges that enroll a significantly large number of adult, nontraditional students, many of whom exit and return to the institution several times during their academic careers, or transfer to other institutions. Another commenter noted that institutions located near military bases, where transfers of personnel are routine, could experience high withdrawals of students. One commenter noted that some institutions serve vocational rehabilitation and JTPA students who are impaired to some degree, and as a result, often drop out of the programs in which they were enrolled. Most of these commenters recommended that there be some appeal provision or mitigating circumstances exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that in addition to the student population served, withdrawal rates were a function of overall institutional performance and the support services that are provided to students. Two commenters asked how institutions should determine which students will succeed and which will fail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters recommended that a rate other than 33 percent be used as an administrative standard. Many commenters noted that the proposed 33 percent rate was a stricter standard than that used by JTPA or any State, but made no mention of what rates States are using. One commenter suggested that if there were any withdrawal rate standard, it should be set at 40 percent, not 33 percent, as that rate would be consistent with JTPA standards. Other commenters said withdrawal rates would be fair only if they were based on national averages, comparing similar programs in like-type institutions or a study of some sort. Yet another commenter said there should be State-established withdrawal rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

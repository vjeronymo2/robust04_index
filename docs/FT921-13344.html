			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading as Cantors dives to Pounds 206,000 In common with many other high street retailers, Cantors, the Sheffield-based furniture group, is suffering from 'extremely difficult' trading conditions. Announcing sharply reduced profits for the six months to October 26, Mr Harold Cantor, chairman, said trading had improved during the third quarter but customers were still showing a reluctance to spend. The outcome for the full year would show a 'marked reduction' on last year's Pounds 2.53m, he added. Despite turnover ahead 22 per cent to Pounds 30.2m, the pre-tax line at the interim stage amounted to just Pounds 206,000, down from Pounds 1.45m in the corresponding half of 1990. Interest charges of Pounds 142,000 were incurred against receivable of Pounds 79,000. Earnings per share dived to 0.98p (6.89p) but the interim dividend is held at 1p.</p>

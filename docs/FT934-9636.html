			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / EU convergence guides Greece's economic path MS VASSO PAPANDREOU, one of the chief standard-bearers of the Greek Socialist party, said yesterday that 'international competition' left Greece with no choice but to improve economic convergence with the rest of the European Union. She presented the pragmatic and more market-orientated face of Greek socialism during a visit to London, saying that the new Athens government would press ahead with a modified version of the hotly disputed privatisation programme. However, Ms Papandreou, EC commissioner for social policy between 1989 and 1992, said Greece was very unlikely to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria for participation in economic and monetary union by 1999. But, she added: 'We have to converge, with or without Maastricht.' Although not in the new government of Mr Andreas Papandreou (to whom she is not related), which took office four weeks ago, she retains strong influence in the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). In the October 10 election, Ms Papandreou, running in Athens, won more votes than any other candidate for parliament. But political rivalries prevented the prime minister from offering her a cabinet post. In recent weeks, Ms Papandreou - a previous deputy technology minister and once one of the most radical of Mr Papandreou's followers - has shown more realism than other senior Socialists about Greece's budget deficit. The government borrowing requirement is forecast to reach 14.9 per cent of gross domestic product this year, against a target of 7.9 per cent. Declaring the priority was to 'stabilise the economy', Ms Papandreou said yesterday the government would take tough action to curb expenditure and raise revenues. Pasok has already abandoned its pre-election pledge of 'no new taxes'. A revenue package is under discussion in Athens, including price rises for tobacco and alcohol. The government is preparing legislation designed to reduce tax evasion, particularly by businesses and the self-employed. The average Greek doctor, lawyer and civil engineer declares an income equivalent to that of a primary school teacher. The government has formally halted the privatisation programme of the previous conservative administration. But, above all because of financial pressures, Ms Papandreou said the state would sell off stakes of 20 per cent or more in public sector telecommunications and energy companies on the Athens stock market.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GOOD SAMARITAN'S CONDITION 'STABLE' AS HIS NEIGHBORS RAISE FUNDS  </P> <P> While the man police call a good Samaritan lay in a hospital bed fighting for  his life Thursday, his wife described him as someone who often helped people in  need without fear for his own safety.  </P> <P> "He just cares about people," Sandra Smith said of her husband, Gary, a  part-time carpet layer and paralegal. "He doesn't want to see people get hurt."  </P> <P> Gary Smith was shot four times after he responded to a University City woman's  screams for help by chasing a man who had just burglarized the woman's home.  </P> <P> Gary Smith was laying carpet in a building next to the woman's home in the 7900  block of Camino Tranquilo when he heard screams and confronted a gun-wielding  man about a block away, police said.  </P> <P> Doctors at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla operated on Gary Smith several  times Thursday, treating bullet wounds in his face, stomach, left leg and left  arm, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> "He is in stable condition," hospital spokeswoman Dilene Pulsipher said late  Thursday afternoon after one of the operations.  </P> <P> Smith's encounter with the burglar wasn't his first attempt at helping a crime  victim, his wife told reporters. Last Sunday, the 35-year-old San Diegan, who  aspires to become a corporate lawyer, unsuccessfully gave chase to a purse  snatcher, she said.  </P> <P> Gary Smith never stopped to think that he might get hurt while aiding others,  his wife said. Now others in the community are taking steps to help him.  </P> <P> Members of the San Diego Police Officers Assn. announced Thursday that they  will donate blood to Smith.  </P> <P> "It's an emotional issue for us, too," said police Officer Robert Chorny, who  attended a press conference with Sandra Smith at the hospital. "We've basically  dubbed this guy 'the good Samaritan.' "  </P> <P> Residents of the neighborhood where the shooting occurred are raising funds for  Smith's medical expenses.  </P> <P> "They are going to make a private donation," Pulsipher said. "They wanted to do  it away from the media."  </P> <P> Hospital officials requested that anyone wishing to donate money to the Smiths  write to: Foundation for Gary Smith, Scripps Memorial Hospital, P.O. Box 28, La  Jolla, CA, 92038.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, police are still looking for a suspect in the case. Chorny said  investigators have several leads, including a report that someone had tried to  use one of the credit cards stolen during the burglary.  </P> <P> Witnesses described the assailant as a young white man, about 5-foot-9 and 140  pounds, with a light complexion and long, thin, brown hair. The man, described  as clean-shaven but with an unkempt appearance, was last seen wearing a gray or  blue Windbreaker and a pair of old jeans.  </P></p>

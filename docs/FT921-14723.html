			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates close level UK money rates were squeezed higher yesterday as sterling remained under pressure on the foreign exchange markets, but closed little changed from Friday, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn early in the morning, later revised up to Pounds 1.1bn. In early assistance, the Bank injected Pounds 456m funding, including a Pounds 90m repurchase agreement maturing in equal portions on January 27 and 28 at 10 7/16 per cent. In addition, the Bank purchased outright band 1 bank bills at 10 7/8 per cent, band 3 bank bills at 10 3/16 per cent and band 4 bank bills at 10 1/8 per cent. In late morning a further Pounds 122m assistance was forthcoming, comprising purchases of band 1, band 3 and band 4 bills at the same rates. An afternoon liquidity injection comprising the purchase of Pounds 179m band 1 and band 3 bills was followed by Pounds 310m late assistance. This brought total assistance for the day to Pounds 1.067bn, just short of the forecast liquidity shortage. The squeeze on liquidity during the day forced overnight unsecured money rates up to 11 per cent in the afternoon session, from 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent at the close on Friday, before falling back to close at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent. The March short sterling futures contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange finished at 89.49. In Frankfurt, call money interest rates were squeezed upwards as financial institutions moved to build reserves ahead of a deadline for taxation payments later this month. Overnight money traded at 9.45/55 per cent, from the 9.40/50 per cent level which prevailed for most of last week. Market participants commented that rates could be pushed higher still during the middle of this week, although most expect call rates to remain below the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate for financial institutions. In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan recalled Y80bn loans from financial institutions in the face of a forecast Y110bn liquidity surplus. In spite of this action, overnight money rates declined to 5 3/8 per cent, from 5 1/2 per cent on Friday. Today, market conditions should be tighter. The Bank of Japan said it will set a Y300bn auction-style repurchase pact for funds maturing on February 25.</p>

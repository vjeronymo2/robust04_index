			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Subpart B_Borrower Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B contains conditions of borrower eligibility, which are identical to the borrower eligibility provisions in the FFEL Program. The charges for which borrowers are responsible, loan limits, deferment and forbearance options, and borrower defenses to repayment are also included. The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 eliminated the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) program but increased the loan limits for the Unsubsidized Stafford Program beginning July 1, 1994. The Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 further revised the loan limits. The revised loan limits are included in this notice along with a chart (Appendix A) which illustrates the loan limits that will be applicable as of July 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Subpart C_Requirements, Standards, and Payments for Schools in the Direct Loan Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart C contains those provisions governing a school's participation in the Direct Loan Program, including disbursement procedures, entrance and exit counseling, withdrawal procedures, recordkeeping and funds control requirements. The Secretary anticipates that schools will continue with the conscientious efforts demonstrated in the FFEL Program in tailoring the counseling to the borrower's particular needs and making counseling accessible. These efforts have included, for example, sign language interpreters for hearing impaired borrowers or translations for limited English proficient borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The contents of this notice have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order, the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of the standards, criteria, and procedures in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the contents of this notice are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these standards, criteria, and procedures, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of these standards, criteria, and procedures justify the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has also determined that the contents of this notice do not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The contents of this notice are consistent with the requirements of the HEA and promote the President's priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, Public Law 103&hyph;66 requires that the Secretary publish a notice in lieu of regulations for the first year of the Direct Loan Program and exempts the contents of the notice from the rulemaking requirements of section 431 of the General Education Provisions Act. While the Secretary has consulted with members of the higher education community in the development of this notice, the statutory timeframe for the program does not permit the solicitation of further public comment. A public comment period, while helpful, would seriously delay the provision of necessary guidance for the operation of the Direct Loan Program. Therefore, the Secretary finds that solicitation of public comments would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 685  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice or procedure, Colleges and universities, Education, Loan programs-education, Student aid, Vocational education.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 84.268, Federal Direct Student Loan Program)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 27, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard W.

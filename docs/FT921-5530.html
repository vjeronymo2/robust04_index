			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Indians win a valley in Chile THE CHILEAN government has for the first time assumed the defence of Indian rights by purchasing a disputed valley in the southern Andes to save a clan of Pehuenche Indians from being evicted from their ancestral lands. The government agreed late on Monday to pay Dollars 6.15m to the landowners of the Quinquen valley. The deal was struck less than 24 hours before an eviction order against 150 Pehuenche 'illegal squatters' was due to take effect. Most of the valley will now become a protected Indian reservation - the first to be established in Chile in over a century. President Patricio Aylwin's decision to secure land for the Pehuenches is likely to set an important legal precedent. Land disputes between white settlers and Chile's 500,000 Mapuches - the tribe to which the Pehuenche clan belongs - have escalated in recent years with the growth of cattle ranching, forestry and tourism. 'There are over 600 cases of land poaching which the Mapuches have no hope of winning through the courts,' says Mr Eduardo Astorga, an Indian rights lawyer. 'The only way to settle these conflicts is for the government to rally to their defence.' Late last year, Mapuche groups staged a series of land seizures in southern Chile to draw attention to their plight. The occupations were ended with brutal efficiency by the Carabineros, Chile's paramilitary police. Mr Astorga said Indian groups would lobby Congress this year to ensure the passage of legislation to protect Indian rights. The government has submitted a draft bill to establish a 'land fund' to purchase some of the territory the Mapuches have lost this century. Chile's right-wing parties, which control the Senate, oppose the land fund. They are also against granting special recognition to Chile's native peoples, which include the Aymaras in the north, the Mapuches in the south, and the Rapa Nui on Easter Island.</p>

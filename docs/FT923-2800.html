			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Producer prices almost static CORE INFLATION, as mea-sured by the producer prices index, continued its down-ward path in the year to August as difficult domestic and overseas conditions deterred UK manufacturers from raising prices. Figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that the prices of manufactured goods leaving factories scarcely moved last month, rising just 0.1 per cent from the previous month. That gave a year-on-year increase of 3.3 per cent, the lowest annual rate of increase for more than 24 years. It compared with a rise of 3.4 per cent in the year to July. The annual rate of producer price inflation has been falling more or less continuously since April last year, when it was 6.2 per cent. Stripping out volatile food, drink and tobacco prices, the output prices index rose 2.6 per cent in the year to August, the same as the annual rate in May, which was the lowest since 1969. That compares with a high of 6.4 per cent in February last year. The data suggest many manufacturers are continuing to cut prices to maintain sales in a fragile climate of weak demand while benefiting from lower raw material and wage costs. The prices of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry fell 2.2 per cent last month, reflecting weak demand for many types of commodities. The CSO said prices paid for food manufacturing raw materials had fallen particularly sharply. The month-on-month drop compared with a fall of 0.2 per cent in July. It brought the annual rate of decline for input prices to 1.9 per cent. Seasonally adjusted, the prices of raw materials fell 1.9 per cent from the previous month, the sharpest monthly fall since 1968. The official figures underlined the favourable outlook for inflation in the UK. The Treasury said lower producer inflation would feed through to further reductions in retail price inflation.</p>

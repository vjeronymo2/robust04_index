			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (30): Understanding Hypermedia HYPERMEDIA IS the product of the collision of electronic cultures; radio, television, voice telephony and computing. It includes futuristic concepts like hypertext, a variety of automated, electronic encyclopaedia, and virtual reality, where the subject is transported into an electronic dream world via a video visor and sensory gloves. A more mundane example is the interactive video programmes extensively used in education and training. Understanding Hypermedia: From Multimedia to Virtual Reality by Bob Cotton and Richard Oliver (Phaidon Pounds 19.95, 160 pages) sets out to explain, through a kaleidoscope of text and images, how individual electronic media can be combined to yield a new and revolutionary technology which can be controlled through language and physical gestures. The authors believe it will dominate mass culture in the next century. Pioneers like Ted Nelson and Vannevar Bush have argued that the hypermedia approach to a topic is closer to the way humans think than the sequence of information presented in books or films. Aldous Huxley would have felt vindicated.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Peru lays out welcome mat: Government aims to lure wave of investors across Pacific - Sally Bowen on plans to attract immigrants with money to spend IF YOU want a new nationality, have money to invest and can put up a non-refundable cash contribution of Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 17,605), you could soon become a Peruvian. Last week, Peru waived the two-year waiting period for foreigners wishing to apply for naturalisation. The aim, according to President Alberto Fujimori and Mr Joy Way, a former industry minister, is to encourage immigration by Asian businessmen, especially from Hong Kong. The government hopes a new wave of immigrants will bring technology, expertise and cash. Mr Fujimori is predicting a 'first wave' of 10,000 immigrants, which would swell state coffers with Dollars 250m to aid emergency social programmes. 'This is not a migration policy but an investment policy,' he said at the weekend. The drive for foreign investment gained fresh impetus last week when the International Monetary Fund gave the government a long-awaited stamp of approval for its economic reform programme. Mr Fujimori plans to start travelling abroad again 'to do business'. Peruvian and Japanese businessmen have already arranged visits aimed at attracting investment to Peru. Net direct foreign investment over the past 15 years has totalled only Dollars 700m. Recent investment commitments - by Anglo American in the Quellaveco copper deposits, by the Chinese Shougang Corporation in iron producer Hierro Peru, and by Petrotech in the ex-Belco drilling operation off Peru's northern coast - will, if fulfilled, more than double that figure in the next few years. The country's fledgling privatisation programme is to be stepped up sharply with sales worth some Dollars 1.4bn scheduled for this year alone. Mr Daniel Hokama, mines and energy minister and head of the privatisation office, is repeating his predecessor's promise to 'sell everything the state owns by 1995 - at the price determined by the market'. The main items for privatisation this year are the state mining and mineral companies Centromin, Mineroperu and Tintaya, the telecommunications sector, a slice of the nation's electricity industry, fish-meal and fish-oil company Tesca Peru, two state controlled banks, and part of oil giant Petroperu. All are among Peru's top dozen companies, in turnover if not profit terms. Foreign consultants and investment banks, notably Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Morgan Grenfell and Chase Manhattan, are advising on disposal of state assets. Privately, some express reservations about the speed with which privatisation is being pushed ahead. Country risk remains a consideration and investment banks predict difficulties in finding four or five rival bidders, even for sectors with as much growth potential as telecommunications. Increasingly, foreign investment is seen as the panacea for Peru's continuing domestic economic ills. Recession stubbornly persists, with industry working at only 45 per cent capacity and gross domestic product still contracting after last year's 2.7 per cent fall. The sol remains heavily overvalued, making exports unprofitable and imports cheap. Industry has been further squeezed in the drive to raise tax revenue. The manufacturers' society SNI claims industry currently contributes 59 per cent of all fiscal income. The society's recipe for economic revival includes a cut in value added tax from 16 to 5 per cent as the tax base is widened; a hefty cut in taxes paid by industry for basic services such as electricity, communications and fuel; implementation of a tax incentive scheme for exporters; and a sharp reduction in borrowing costs for business which are around 18-20 per cent. It also favours drastic measures to halt large-scale smuggling. Industrialists estimate Peru is being flooded with illegally imported goods worth Dollars 1bn a year, a third of the value of legal imports. Austere fiscal management and a two-year squeeze on liquidity, meanwhile, has failed to eliminate inflation. Monthly price rises are still running at around 4 per cent. Mr Jorge Camet, the new economy minister, is promising 'at least' 3.5 per cent growth this year and gradual progress in reducing inflation, devaluing the sol and cutting interest rates. Opinion polls show popular approval of the economic programme at its lowest level (27 per cent) since August 1990's 'shock' price adjustments. Economists remain suspicious that, without the uncompromising (and recently sacked) Mr Carlos Bolona at the fiscal and monetary helm, Mr Fujimori may veer from economic discipline towards economic populism.</p>

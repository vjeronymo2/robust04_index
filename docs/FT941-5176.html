			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Arts: 'Pearl Fishers' revived - Opera The imperishable 'friendship' duet for the leading men in Bizet's Les Pecheurs de perles (1863), which is the one bit of the opera that everybody knows, comes early in the first act. While it got its vociferous applause at Saturday's ENO revival, somebody behind me remarked, 'Well, we can all go home now]' Not fair: amidst all the shapely, dewily original music that follows, the duet returns often enough (in frank reprise or thinly disguised) to delight its most besotted devotees. Besides, in Philip Prowse's refurbished, campily elegant staging, the opera - virtually an opera comique - offers one of the most appealing musical evenings in town. Sung here in very plain English without poetical pretensions, The Pearl Fishers is set in a never-never-land Ceylon, an exotic French-colonial dream a la Pierre Loti. There is ample excuse for mock-Eastern pomp, which might submerge the real charms of the opera altogether; instead Prowse opts for airy space and light, reserving decadent splendour for a few prominent objects like the central altar, and for some of the costumes. Beyond those there is only the wreck of a ship, and a giant awning with hanging lamps, and a large, knowingly tacky circle of light-bulbs in the sky. They serve very well - as does Prowse's extra addition to the cast-list: Imogen Claire as an omnipresent priestess (or something: maybe the High Priest's concubine), coiling and arching balletically throughout like a malign fin-de-siecle spirit, silently manipulating the action. Against that tongue-in-cheek background, the romantic triangle can stand and deliver with unaffected candour. Of the two sworn friends in love with the virgin priestess Leila, Jonathan Summers makes a vehement Zurga, the baritone loser who eventually does the decent thing, and as the luckier Nadir - tenor, of course - young John Hudson offers enough sensitive feeling to compensate for some imperfect suavity in Bizet's vocal line. Leila herself is Gillian Webster, a bright soprano: lovely liquid depths in her middle range, mature artistry in her dramatic pleas. Easier top notes, securer pitch and less of a petulant Hollywood starlet's manner would make her an ideal heroine, but she is already a vivid and fascinating one. As the high priest Nourabad, Andrew Greenan wields his doughty bass-baritone to menacing effect. The keen ENO chorus achieves an almost French crispness (better than most echt-French choruses can manage nowadays), and the Viennese conductor Alexander Sander paces the score with clean style and despatch. Bits of Wagner's Tannhauser and even Tristan surface here and there, the more disarming because Bizet adapted them so coolly to his chaste Gallic idiom. All in all, only a stony heart could fail to respond to this artful, ever-fresh music; if anything, the ridiculously dated terms of the 'drama' set it off in enhanced relief. Co-production with Opera North. In repertory at the Coliseum until April 28, with a new conductor and principal singers in the later performances</p>

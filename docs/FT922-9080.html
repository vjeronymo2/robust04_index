			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance: More bait for home buyers - First-time home buyers are getting better deals THERE was good news for would-be home buyers this week as Halifax, Abbey National, and Nationwide, the three largest UK mortgage lenders, trimmed their rates in the wake of Monday's cut in bank interest rates. Halifax cut its standard mortgage rate 0.3 percentage points to 10.65 per cent. Most other building societies will probably move rates down in line with Halifax to around 10.65 per cent or 10.7 per cent. The good news was mainly for new customers. Existing customers of most lenders will have to wait for another month or two for the new rates to apply to them. The banks and centralised lenders also face strong pressure to bring their rates down in line with the societies. With interest rates low on the commercial money markets, the centralised lenders ought to find it easier to compete with the building societies, which fund their loans mainly out of savings placed with them by their customers. UCB Home Loans, for example, cut its variable interest rate for new customers by 0.51 percentage points to 10.99 per cent. Existing customers are promised a cut before too long. But this 'new rate', it is worth noting, is only what most lenders were offering as long ago as January. Most other centralised lenders are also still lagging the societies on their variable lending rates and are trying to conceal this gap by filling their shop-window with tempting fixed rate offers. When the cuts feed through to existing borrowers, they are unlikely to make a huge difference to their personal finances. The Halifax cuts are worth, for example, between Pounds 8 and Pounds 10.50 a month on a Pounds 50,000 mortgage. The cuts should encourage the market and help housing sales revive. If house prices start to strengthen, existing mortgage customers will benefit, especially those who have postponed a move until the housing market recovers. So the lenders are trying to find ways of tempting new borrowers into the market. If you are about to take out a mortgage, you can look forward to a discount which might take your mortgage interest rate, for the first year at least, below 9 per cent. Abbey National offers a discount of up to 1.75 per cent to first-time buyers. It also charges less as the size of loans increase. Under its new rates, mortgages of up to Pounds 60,000 will be cut from 10.9 per cent to 10.7 cent; Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000 loans from 10.55 per cent to 10.2 per cent; and mortgages above that from 10.4 per cent to 9.99 cent. However, many new borrowers will be more attracted by the thought of a fixed rate mortgage. There are a number of these around offering rates of less than 9 per cent. A lot of these fixed rates are only for a year. Northern Rock has a fixed rate of 8.95 per cent until August 1993. But to take advantage of it, borrowers must have a loan to value ratio of less than 70 per cent and must take out buildings and contents insurance from the society. If you want a longer term arrangement, you will have to go above 9 per cent. Chase de Vere, the mortgage brokers, is offering a mortgage fixed for one year at 9.5 then capped at 10 per cent for the following two years. This is available for repayment, endowment, pensions, and Pep mortgages. There is an arrangement fee of Pounds 150 and three months additional interest payments for early redemption of the loan. First time buyers should bear in mind that the latest generation of fixed rate mortgages was designed in the wake of the election and since then the market has become more optimistic. The trickle of lenders offering rates under 9 per cent to new buyers could become a torrent soon.</p>

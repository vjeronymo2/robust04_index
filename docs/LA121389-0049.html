			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA LOADED WITH GIFTS FROM ORDINARY TO SUBLIME  </P> <P> Holiday shoppers with a streak of hometown pride can wrap up an array of  indigenous -- and sometimes ingenious -- presents from local artisans and  institutions.  </P> <P> The possibilities range from an $80 keg of Pasadena-brewed beer to a scented  book of Victorian poems from the Huntington Library to a $10 Tournament of  Roses T-shirt sure to please any snowbound Iowans on the gift list.  </P> <P> Here are some other possibilities:  </P> <P> The Gamble House Bookstore (4 Westmoreland Place, Pasadena; (818) 793-3334)  features books and gifts on the turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts Movement,  which has deep roots in Pasadena architecture. Luminous, richly colored glass  ornaments cost $25. A replica of a 12-lily Tiffany floor lamp that casts a  warm, golden glow sells for $5,895.  </P> <P> For those on a tighter budget, $5 will buy a coloring book ("Children's  Architecture in Pasadena"), while $6.95 will purchase "Mission Furniture: How  to Make It." The Gamble House is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Wednesday through  Sunday. It will be closed Dec. 18 to 22.  </P> <P> Another arts and crafts shop is Tom Gardner's Gardner Woodcraft (2594 E. Walnut  St., Pasadena, (818) 449-2594. Phone for appointment.) Gardner builds custom  furniture from the period, using gleaming oak and mahogany. A replica of a  dining room table designed by Frank Lloyd Wright costs about $9,000, and a  mahogany "settle," or bench-like couch, costs $2,500 to $4,000. A wall sconce  runs about $500. The pieces should be purchased only for those who are willing  to settle for a rain check under the Christmas tree, however. Work time is  about 10 weeks.  </P> <P> For outdoor Arts and Crafts-style lights, consider Bob Tatosian's Arroyo  Craftsman verdigris-and-glass lanterns. A six-inch model costs $145. The lamps  are available at Historic Lighting (421 S. Myrtle Ave., Monrovia; open 9:30  a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; (818) 303-4899.)  </P> <P> An impressive gift for a New Year's party host might be a 13 1/2-gallon keg of  beer ($80) from Crown City Brewery, (300 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena; (818)  577-5548, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily) The choices include Mt. Wilson Wheat, a  golden ale, and Father Christmas, a spiced ale.  </P> <P> One of the first things to catch the eye in the Huntington Library Bookstore  (1157 Oxford Road, San Marino; (818) 405-2141; 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through  Sunday), is a poster-sized print of John James Audubon's "Iceland Falcons,"  priced at $22. The library has also printed its own 1990 wall calendars, which  includes Audubon's "Birds of America," for $9.95.  </P> <P> Fans of the camellia, of which the Huntington has a renowned collection, might  like the set of four English-made wooden place mats decorated with brightly  colored paintings of the waxy flowers ($32). For $14.95, nature buffs can learn  more about local trees in Donald R. Hodel's "Exceptional Trees of Los Angeles,"  which includes an account of a 140-year-old grapefruit tree saved from  demolition by a group of gardeners.  </P> <P> Aficionados of women's history might enjoy "Ho for California! Women's Overland  Diaries from the Huntington Library" ($14.95), or the $1.75 pink paperback "The  Lady's Guide to Perfect Gentility," reprinted from an 1856 edition.  </P> <P> Other volumes on sale include "Henry Huntington and the Pacific Electric, An  Album," ($13.95). It recounts how Huntington, the tycoon who founded the  Huntington Library and its museum and 150 acres of gardens in 1919, built what  was billed as the world's largest streetcar system. The romantic may be tempted  by "A Victorian Posy: Penhalingon's Scented Treasury of Verse and Prose," a  sweetly perfumed book of Victorian poems and other writings ($17.95). For the  young poets, there is the classic favorite "A Child's Garden of Verse" by  Robert Louis Stevenson, with reproductions of the original 19th-Century  illustrations by Jessie Wilcox Smith ($16.95).  </P> <P> For a year's worth of pleasure, the weary shopper should consider giving a  Huntington Library membership for Christmas, which entitles the recipient to  perks like early admittance to plant sales and a 20% discount on bookstore  purchases. Cost ranges from $35 for a basic one-year membership to $1,000 for a  year as a benefactor entitled to special private receptions, tours and classes.  </P> <P> Across town is another Pasadena-area institution: the Tournament of Roses  Souvenir Shop (59 W. Del Mar Blvd., Pasadena; (818) 795-1312, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  daily). For those out-of-town relatives, there is a white cotton T-shirt with a  brightly colored rose on its front ($10), a baseball cap ($12), or "Tournament  of Roses: First 100 Years," a book chronicling the parade's history ($24.95).  Seats to the parade run $21 to $30 and are available at Sharp Seating Co. (709  E. Colorado Blvd., Suite 140, Pasadena; (818) 795-4171.)  </P> <P> For indoor entertainment, tickets are available for the Juilliard String  Quartet appearing Feb. 7 at the Ambassador Auditorium (300 W.

(39 S. El Molino Ave., Pasadena; (818) 356-PLAY.)  </P> <P> For the plant lovers on your list, try Nuccio's Nurseries, growers of rare  camellias and azaleas since 1935 (3555 Chaney Trail, Altadena; (818) 794-3383.

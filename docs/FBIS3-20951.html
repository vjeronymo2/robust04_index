Bert-Olof Svanholm, currently general director for  Sweden of the Swedish-Swiss industrial group ABB Asea Brown  Boveri, was elected chairman of the board, replacing Pehr G.  Gyllenhammar. His first task will be to determine what he  intends to retain from the partnership agreement signed with  Renault in 1990.    Mr. Svanholm, 58, was nominated in December by a group of  large Volvo shareholders, representing together about 40 percent  of the board of directors votes, to succeed Mr. Gyllenhammar who  resigned on 2 December 1993 after the failure of the planned  merger with Renault. In addition to Mr. Svanholm, six new  directors were appointed at the meeting of shareholders; one of  them is Louis Schweitzer, CEO [chief executive officer] of  Renault, the largest Volvo shareholder with nearly 10 percent of  its capital. However, Mr. Schweitzer did not attend the Goteborg  meeting.    The other directors are Per-Olof Ericsson (general director  of the Sandvik group--special steels, tools), Haakan Frisinger  (former general director of Volvo from 1983 to 1987), Tom  Hedelius (president of the Handelsbanken [Commerce Bank]),  Bjoern Svedberg (president of the S.E. Banken), and Soren Gyll,  the current Volvo general director. Three union representatives  also sit on the board.    Speaking to some 700 shareholders, Mr. Gyll declined to give  any material precision concerning Volvo's future strategy and  the future of the Renault-Volvo partnership set up in 1990 by  the two manufacturers. "The forms that the partnership or  non-partnership with Renault should take are a priority for both  Volvo and Renault," Mr. Svanholm merely stated.    The next regular general meeting of the board, scheduled for  20 April, will consider this matter, as well as that of the  Swedish group's industrial strategy.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Food: Asparagus by post SPRING flowers are in their full glory, the afternoons are longer and English asparagus is being harvested. I look forward to this as much as I do the first crop of English strawberries. Sadly the asparagus season is too short - only two months, from May 1 to Midsummer's Day - but somehow that makes it all the more delicious. Michael Paske offers us a rare treat of asparagus by mail: fresh asparagus grown in Cambridgeshire and East Anglia can be sent to you in 1 kilo (2.2 lb) boxes with a choice of jumbo or medium spears, or those very special thin, delicate ones. The boxes cost Pounds 10.50 each and this includes postage and packing. If you really want to spoil someone why not send a basket or small hamper filled with asparagus and tied with ribbons and decorations together with a message card? This will cost from Pounds 38. Do not worry about having to eat all the asparagus within a day or two of delivery because it freezes well after a quick blanch and it is such an easy option if you are entertaining. Simply steam it for five minutes and serve with lemon juice, olive oil and shavings of fresh Parmesan. It makes a delicious starter. British asparagus is thought to have the best flavour and texture in the world because the stems grow so slowly in our rather iffy climate. But if Midsummer's day passes you by, and you find that you are too late for English asparagus then Michael Paske can send you fresh asparagus from the US, Chile, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand at any other time of the year.

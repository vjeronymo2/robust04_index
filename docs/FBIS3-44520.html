			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fan Chun (5400 0689): "CPC's Next Move Toward Hong </F> Kong"]    [Text] If We Had Known It Would Come to This,  Different Actions Would Have Been Taken    The door to Sino-British talks has finally closed. What will  be the next step taken by China then, and how will Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability be maintained through "self-reliance"?  These are not only questions for which people overseas are  showing great concern, but also questions raised by many people  in China.    In Beijing, some democratic personages whom I know very well  have raised the following questions in private talks as if by  prior agreement:    "Have violent changes taken place in Hong Kong?"    "Has Chris Patten put Hong Kong in a wretched state?"    "Has the Sino-British Joint Declaration been unilaterally  abandoned by the British side?"    "If we had known it would come to this, we would have acted  differently. Since China and Britain are sharing the same bed  but dreaming different dreams, we should not have suggested  cooperation in the transitional period long ago. Could we not  see the `sequel' now?"    These people did not pay much attention to the Hong Kong  issue before, but how do they appear to be experts now? After  making inquiries, I learned that, recently, the CPC has in  various relevant units whipped up opinion about and made great  efforts to expose Britain's "schemes and intrigues" on the Hong  Kong issue. Apart from the need to speak along the same lines  externally, the practice is also aimed at unifying people's  thinking within the country.    To the executors of the CPC's policies on Hong Kong and  Macao, turning against the British is both a bad thing and a  good thing. If Hong Kong's transition is smooth and anything  unexpected happens in Hong Kong after 1997, the responsibility  will rest on the Chinese side. Now that the British side has  put forth Chris Patten's package and the Chinese side has  thoroughly criticized it, once anything bad happens in Hong Kong  in the future, the responsibility will rest on the side of the  British colonialists.  <H3>  Lu Ping: Seeds of Trouble Buried by the British Side Will  Be Intolerable </H3>   On 15 December, on behalf of the State Council, Lu Ping,  director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Jiang  Enzhu, representative of the Chinese side in the Sino-British  talks, held a special meeting in the Guangdong Hall of the Great  Hall of the People to brief the leaders of various democratic  parties and mass organizations on the situation of the  Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political system. They also  answered questions raised by the participants.    Lu Ping spoke first. He said: The British authorities have  made use of Hong Kong's transitional period and have  intentionally raised a political challenge against the Chinese  Government. Judging from its usual practice before withdrawing  from its colonies, it is by no means a new strategy. Before the  signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese  Government and relevant departments had already made certain  ideological preparations. In the spring of 1990, we made  several concrete preparations. Now, in our preparatory work, we  must grasp the work firmly and substantively on the one hand  and, on the other, pay close attention to violent changes in  Hong Kong's political and economic fields created by the British  side and the development of trends. We must be prepared to deal  with such changes. Now, work concerning arrangements for this  has already been completed. China will not allow and will not  tolerate Britain willfully creating and burying seeds of  political disturbance and economic collapse in Hong Kong during  the transitional period.  <H3>  "Six Basic Factors Concerning Britain's Challenge Against  the Chinese Government" </H3>   What are the "seeds of political disturbance and economic  collapse"? Lu Ping made a detailed analysis of this. He  believes that Britain changed its China policy and presented a  challenge to the Chinese Government for the following basic  reasons:    1. Mistakes in analyzing and assessing China's political  situation.    2. Mistakes in understanding China's resolution and  timetable for taking back Hong Kong's sovereignty and  administrative power.    3. An erroneous estimation of the ability of the Chinese  Government and Chinese people, including patriotic compatriots  in Hong Kong, to administer Hong Kong.    4. An attempt to make use of the changes in the  international political climate, the disintegration of the  Soviet Union, and the changes in eastern Europe to change its  policy and strategy on China.    5. A belief that since China and Hong Kong maintain close  economic relations at present, China will not take over Hong  Kong earlier even if Britain violates the three documents.    6. A belief that since Hong Kong's economy plays a  positive role in the Chinese economy, and the United States,  Japan, and other countries have investments in Hong Kong, China  will tolerate Britain extending its colonialist rule under the  economic card.  <H3>  Lu Ping Indirectly Admits That Sino-British Joint  Declaration Has Become Ineffective </H3>   Judging from the six factors summed up by Lu Ping, in the  eyes of the Chinese side, Britain has attempted to "go its own  way" in Hong Kong because it has made a wrong appraisal of the  situation and has thus buried "seeds of trouble" there, which  may lead to political disturbances and economic collapse. But  many participants in the meeting asked for an explanation of  these anti-British remarks. One of the questions raised by the  participants, with which people were showing the greatest  concerns for, was whether the Sino-British Joint Declaration, as  an international agreement, would continue to be effective.    Lu Ping gave the following answer to this delicate question:  As the Sino-British Joint Declaration has been repeatedly  damaged and undermined, its existence and binding force have  lost their legitimate significance and it cannot play its due  role. This is common knowledge in international relations.  Britain has brazenly gone against to the written agreement and  understandings between the two governments. This is a rare  practice in international contacts. Therefore, we will make a  resolute decision in light of the development of the trend. The  timetable is in our hands. All independent countries put their  sovereignty and overall interests of the state above everything  else.    These remarks show that Lu Ping has indirectly admitted that  the Sino-British Joint Declaration has already become  ineffective and the Chinese side, with sovereignty in its hands,  may even take preemptive measures rather than striking only  after the other side has struck.    From this, people can see that the Chinese side has made  certain tactical changes in its Hong Kong policy. It has  emphasized that "the timetable is in our hands." This is not  merely intimidation. With the breakdown of Sino-British talks  and its hypocritical face unveiled, the Chinese side can do  whatever it wants to do "with perfect assurance."  <H5>  "Correcting the Right Deviationist Policy Toward Britain" </H5>   In this stage, while China is "calmly waiting for change,"  the military is still adopting a very active attitude. In  mid-October, soon after the conclusion of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, eight generals,  including Zhang Aiping, a former defense minister and currently  a member of the Central Military Commission's consultative  committee, Xiao Ke, Hong Xuezhi, Li Desheng, Wang Ping, Yang  Dezhi, Qin Jiwei, and Zhao Nanqi stated their views to the  Central Committee and the State Council, saying "it is time to  end the colonialist rule now and to sum up and rectify the right  deviationist policy of cherishing unrealistic illusions toward  the British Government"!    This is what the servicemen of the older generation are  thinking, but they have just expressed their views with slogans.  Top military officers in charge of concrete work have even more  concrete ideas. At the beginning of December, Zhang Wannian,  chief of the general staff, Yu Yongbo, director of the General  Political Department, and Fu Quanyou, director of the General  Logistics Department, together with Defense Minister Chi  Haotian, Air Force Commander Cao Shuangming, and Navy Commander  Zhang Lianzhong, submitted a statement of their views to the CPC  Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission, entitled "We must safeguard national sovereignty and  end colonialist rule." In the statement, they put forth the  following five proposals:  <H3>  Five Proposals Made by the Military Have Strong Smell of  Gunpowder </H3>   1. The so-called dispute over the political system at  present is a favorite trick of the British colonialists before  withdrawing from their colonies and is a deliberate political  challenge after the British authorities changed their strategy  toward China. It is necessary to expose it and fight back.    2. It is necessary to make preparations for taking resolute  measures against Britain if it brings disasters in economic  affairs, supports pro-British and anti-China hostile forces in  the political field, and, internationally, creates an  international political city.    3. Since the British authorities have abandoned the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements reached  between the Chinese and British governments and have caused the  situation to deteriorate further, it is necessary to adopt  measures immediately and make a resolute decision: Take back  Hong Kong immediately and implement the policy of one country,  two systems under the leadership of the government of the PRC.    4. The Chinese Government should warn the British  authorities sternly once again through diplomatic channels that  it should immediately stop playing political tricks, rein in  from the brink of the precipice, return to the basis of carrying  out the Sino-British Joint Declaration and agreements reached  between the two governments, and stop interfering with China's  sovereignty and internal affairs, otherwise colonialist rule  will be ended immediately without hesitation and further  tolerance.    5. At the current stage, China should recall its ambassador  to Britain and terminate ministerial contacts and intercourse  with Britain.  <H3>  Liu Huaqing Predicts British Colonialism Will Be Eradicated  Very Soon </H3>   Judging from this written statement, which has a strong  smell  of gunpowder, the military has not only been well prepared all  the time to take "resolute measures," but has also asked for the  downgrading of Sino-British diplomatic relations. Such "over  reactive" remarks have never been seen before. People are  speculating that this may have something to do with  encouragement by Liu Huaqing, a member of the CPC's Political  Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission.  Talking about Hong Kong's situation during a recent meeting  with the officers in charge of military regions, Liu Huaqing  said: To resolve the Hong Kong issue is nothing complicated and  difficult. The central authorities have policies and principles  ready. We just want to see what antics the British authorities  will go on to play. How can Hong Kong's future and Hong Kong's  destiny be decided by British colonialists? We have no right to  oppose the antics they are playing, but we absolutely have the  right to end British colonialist rule and eradicate  British-style colonialism early. Judging from current  developments, this day will come very soon.    "This day will come very soon." This is an important view.  However, at present, there are no signs of disturbances in Hong  Kong's society and people are seizing the current opportunities  and making use of the limited time to make money. Just as  people are saying: "When you have money, you can do anything,  but if you have no money, you can just follow the Basic Law."  Under such a situation, how can man-made "political  disturbances" and "economic collapse" be created so that guns  can be used to take over Hong Kong ahead of time? It seems that  it will be difficult for the CPC to make its next move. "Moving  the wrong piece on the chess board may lose the whole game...."</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel slips deeper into the red BETHLEHEM Steel, the second-biggest US steel group, blamed continuing recession and intense competition for increased third-quarter losses. The company posted a net loss of Dollars 72m, or 92 cents a share, on sales which fell 9.8 per cent to Dollars 1.01bn. A year earlier, it had a deficit of Dollars 60.6m, or 88 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.12bn. Bethlehem said its wider third-quarter deficit reflected lower realised steel prices, an unfavourable change in product mix and higher employment costs. Mr Walter Williams, chairman, said: 'We expect that (the) intensely competitive market will continue over the near-term and that we will not return to profitability in the fourth quarter.' Mr Williams is retiring this week and will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive by Mr Curtis Barnette. Third-quarter results from LTV, the US steel group which has been operating for five years under the protection of bankruptcy courts, were also hurt by depressed steel prices and higher employment costs. The company turned in an underlying third-quarter net loss of Dollars 9.2m. During the quarter, LTV posted a Dollars 625m gain on the sale of its missiles and aircraft businesses to a group made up of Loral, Carlyle Group and Northrop. This helped LTV report net income of Dollars 615.8m for the three months to September 30. A year earlier, LTV had net income of Dollars 115.5m, including an income tax refund of Dollars 129.7m. Sales in the latest quarter were Dollars 944m, compared with restated sales of Dollars 940m last year.</p>

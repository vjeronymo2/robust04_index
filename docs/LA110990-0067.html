			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> Auction Falters: Willem de Kooning's Abstract Expressionist painting, "July  1956," sold for $8.8 million to New York dealer Larry Gagosian on Wednesday  night at Christie's New York. The price exceeded Christie's most optimistic  estimate of $7 million, but the De Kooning was one of the few bright spots in a  dismal auction of blue chip contemporary art. Twenty-eight of the 58 items  offered failed to find buyers, and sales totaled only $36.7 million --  considerably less than the predicted total of $41.7 million to $65.4 million.

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Generale des Eaux taps the 10-year sector for FFr1bn Issuers took advantage of the temporary recovery in European government bond markets yesterday to tap the eurobond market before renewed volatility set in. Generale des Eaux, the French industrial group which has significant media interests as well as its core construction and utility activities, raised FFr1bn through an offering of 10-year eurobonds. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate francs at an all-in cost to the borrower of 24 basis points over three-month Pibor. Lead manager BNP said most of the bonds were sold to French investors, although there was also demand from Switzerland and the Benelux region. By the end of the day, BNP had sold more than half its allocation and only had to buy back a small quantity of bonds from syndicate members. The bonds were priced to yield 38 basis points over 10-year French government bonds and when they were freed to trade, the spread widened out marginally. Several French corporates are said to be looking at the French franc sector and could tap the market if favourable swap conditions persist. Indian Development Bank raised Dollars 100m through an issue of five-year floating-rate notes which lead manager JP Morgan said was the first conventional eurobond offering by an Indian borrower since 1990. The issue, callable and puttable at par in 1997, is designed to act as a benchmark off which future offerings by other Indian issuers will be priced. The bonds were bought mainly by Middle Eastern and Asian accounts, although the 144a tranche also brought in US investors. The discounted margin on the bonds to the put was 110 basis points over three-month Libor and the bonds are expected to be freed to trade this morning. JP Morgan also put the final touches to the first global bond offering from Fannie Mae. The Dollars 1.5bn issue of 10-year bonds is expected to be formally launched and priced today. Elsewhere, the World Bank brought its widely-expected zero-coupon euroyen offering. The Y100bn issue of five-year eurobonds was targeted mainly at Japanese retail investors, who can get tax breaks on such investments. The World Bank is also believed to be considering a yen global offering. Quebec has filed a shelf offering for up to Dollars 2.2bn in debt securities and warrants with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Together with previous offerings, the Canadian province may now issue as much as Dollars 3.5bn of debt, according to the shelf registration.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (2): Guide to the networking revolution / Book review of Encyclopedia of Networking If you don't know your hub* from your router**, the LAN Times Encyclopedia of Networking could be the book for you. Managers who have struggled to come to grips with the language of computing are now faced with a whole new set of acronyms and expressions as the networking revolution gathers pace, writes Alan Cane. Because computing and telecommunications are culturally and historically quite distinct disciplines, much of networking can seem a black art even to data processing specialists. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), for example, without doubt the most important new buzzword in networking, foxes even experienced software specialists. The Encyclopedia takes eleven pages to explain ATM in depth, starting with the proposition that this data transmission technology has the potential to revolutionise the way computer networks are built. It uses the analogy of vehicles crossing a bridge. If all the vehicles are the same length and driven at the same speed, it is easy to predict when a vehicle reaches the far side of the bridge. ATM involves chopping digital information into packets or cells of similar size travelling on the network at similar speeds. This provides a speed and efficiency denied earlier technologies where packets vary in size and therefore cause delays at switching points - 'using same-size cells provides a way of predicting and guaranteeing bandwidth for applications that need it,' the Encyclopedia says. Written by Tom Sheldon, it takes an appropriately broad view of the networking world, including topics such as Arpanet, the experimental computer network which eventually gave rise to the Internet; client-server computing, the new model for data processing in the 1990s; and Lotus Notes, the emerging standard for group working. The Encyclopedia is intended as a reference work rather than a guide to networking, but any manager anxious to make sense of networking should be able to translate trade paper and journal articles with its help. *A central location for the attachment of wires from workstations. ** Intelligent links between networks.

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Letter: Withdrawal from ERM stylish and result unwittingly good, but resignations an issue On my return from holiday in Poland at the weekend, I was not surprised to find that the pound had devalued - or floated as I gather the official term is. It had, while I was away, lost significantly against the Polish zloty, a currency not known for its own strength. Something must be amiss, I thought.

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: FOR OLLIE, IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER  </P> <P> Based on information coming out of Ollie North's trial, I have been able to  piece together a scenario of events from those fateful Irangate days.  </P> <P> In the beginning, Ollie was assigned to the White House, and the CIA director,  William Casey, gave him a briefing on his new duties.  </P> <P> "Ollie, your main role is to thwart the will of Congress by any method that you  can think of, including lying, shredding documents and dealing with unsavory  characters -- the kind of people no decent Marine officer would permit himself  to be associated with. Are you up to it?"  </P> <P> "Yessir. I'm gung-ho and semper fi. I'll do any dirty job you want me to,  whether it's selling arms to Montezuma or laundering money in Tripoli."  </P> <P> "There is just one thing I must warn you about. This operation is against the  law and if it blows up, you will have to be the scapegoat."  </P> <P> "No problem, sir. Marines are taught to fall on their swords."  </P> <P> "That may be so," Casey said, "but you must realize that no president will come  to your rescue other than to call you a hero."  </P> <P> "I understand. When the time comes, you want me to walk the plank with a  blindfold over my eyes."  </P> <P> "I don't care what you wear over your eyes. It must be agreed that although you  will be flying all over Iran, visiting your bank in Switzerland and ordering  the Joint Chiefs of Staff around, you will never -- repeat, never -- divulge  who else is in on this dirty little operation."  </P> <P> "Mr. Casey, I would not snitch on my commander in chief, even if they hung me  by my thumbs from the portico of the White House. Who else shouldn't I involve  if we're caught?"  </P> <P> "Vice President Bush."  </P> <P> "Why Bush?"  </P> <P> "Because he's going to become the next President of the United States, and by  that time he will have denied having any knowledge about Irangate, or whatever  they'll be calling it when the whole thing falls apart."  </P> <P> "Since I'm taking the blame," Ollie said, "can you tell me how I am going to  become the fall guy?"  </P> <P> "Atty. Gen. Ed Meese will announce that you are the only person in this country  responsible for selling arms to Iran and diverting the money to the Contras.  That will be your signal to shred everything in your office. How you save your  own neck is none of our business, just as long as you keep the entire chain of  command out of this fiasco -- if it ever becomes one."  </P> <P> "What does the President do while I am falling on my sword?"  </P> <P> "With a perfectly straight face Ed Meese informs him about what is going on,  and the President expresses shock and anger that anyone working in the White  House would try to deceive Congress."  </P> <P> Well, the original conversation could have sounded like that.  </P> <P> If it did, then this is the second part of what I believe happened:  </P> <P> While he's twisting in the wind, Ollie is advised to get a lawyer. He ends up  with super defense counsel Brendan Sullivan.  </P> <P> "I promised everyone that if I was caught, I'd take gas," Ollie tells Sullivan  at their first meeting.  </P> <P> "No client of mine takes gas. You're going to tell your story, even if it means  sending the entire White House staff up the river."  </P> <P> "By doing that I would be implicating President Reagan and President Bush and  many of their minions."  </P> <P> "Exactly. I am not going to let you be a potted plant for the guys upstairs.  Remember, this opera isn't over until the Marine colonel sings."  </P></p>

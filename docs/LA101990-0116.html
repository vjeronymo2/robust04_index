			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AMERICAN SPLENDOR' MINES THE ORDINARY  </P> <P> If you listen to Harvey Pekar long enough, you find yourself starting to think  like him. That's why, in a strange, inexplicable way, listening to "American  Splendor," director Vince Waldron's adaptation of Pekar's writings at  Theatre/Theater, is likely to make you, if not a funnier person, a more  observant one.  </P> <P> Anyone who has read the underground comics of R. Crumb has likely read Pekar's  work, since they've been frequent collaborators since 1974. Crumb is by far the  more famous, so one would think that Pekar writes to Crumb's dead-on visuals,  full of overweight urbanites at wit's end.  </P> <P> Wrong. Crumb draws to Pekar's dialogues, as do all of Pekar's other artist  collaborators, which suggests what a crackling writer he is. What Waldron has  done is allowed the words to stand apart for themselves and has let Harvey,  played by Dan Castellaneta, speak for himself.  </P> <P> The show's title comes from the comic book Pekar puts out each May -- we even  find out why May, and not, say, June. In his introduction to an anthology of  "American Splendor," Crumb provides the show's cue: "There is drama in the most  ordinary and routine of days, but it's a subtle thing that gets lost in the  shuffle."  </P> <P> This is life from the little guy's point of view. Castellaneta's Pekar is ultra  mild-mannered, quintessentially droll, not the kind of fellow to get into  emotional highs or lows. He's kept his day job as a file clerk at the Cleveland  V.A. office all these years because it keeps him in touch with folks. Without  that, he explains, he couldn't write.  </P> <P> He's no working-class hero, though. While relating his weird fling with a phony  named Carla (Siobhan Fallon, phenomenal in this and several other roles), he  admits that all he really wanted out of her was a few good rolls in the hay.  What he can't take -- and this makes Harvey our kind of guy -- is the act she  puts on, bad British accent and all.  </P> <P> Pekar isn't that desperate for a woman, although he clearly has a hard time  dealing with them, judging by his three marriages (Fallon returns as his most  recent wife). He relates better to men: the quiet, wise Mr. Boats (Andy  Wilson); the bookish Sid (David O'Shea), who always has dinner with his mom;  the nerd Toby, and the verbosely Yiddish Emil (Richard Kuhlman, in a dazzling  switch).  </P> <P> The "driven, compulsive" Pekar of Crumb's description is nowhere to be found in  Castellaneta's charming performance. It jibes with Pekar's obvious distaste for  fame, punch lines and morals -- he's just observing. It's how he observes that  makes "American Splendor" a perfect antidote to our nasty epoch.  </P> <P>  At 1713 N. Cahuenga, Saturdays, 10:30 p.m. through Nov. 24. $10; (213)  466-1767.  </P> <P> </P></p>

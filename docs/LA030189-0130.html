			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER SIMON: THE THINGS RUNNING THROUGH HIS MIND  </P> <P>  -- You can mark the decline of America from when men stopped wearing hats.  </P> <P>  -- Is there any possibility that the Ayatollah Khomeini is really Salman  Rushdie's press agent?  </P> <P>  -- Only in Washington, D.C., could John Tower and Henry Kissinger be  considered ladies' men.  </P> <P>  -- Can't credit card companies get together and decide which copy is the  customer's copy?  </P> <P>  -- If you're going to tithe, do you do it on the net or the gross?  </P> <P>  -- If you can still get into your wedding dress, you're amazing. And a liar.  </P> <P>  -- Is throwing ice down the garbage disposal really good for the blades?  </P> <P>  -- I could watch James Woods in anything.  </P> <P>  -- Most people now driving four-wheel drives had enough trouble with two-wheel  drives.  </P> <P>  -- I don't see how anyone can stand a cuckoo clock after the first 400-500  cuckoos.  </P> <P>  -- New houses are now being built with 20x20 bathrooms? I've lived in  apartments smaller than that.  </P> <P>  -- Weathermen never look happier than when they are predicting bad weather.  </P> <P>  -- The trouble with double-breasted jackets is that they look horrible when  they're not buttoned.  </P> <P>  -- It is absolutely amazing how bad most laundries are. If I wanted to pay  $1.50 to have my buttons broken, I could do it myself for a buck.  </P> <P>  -- There is a special place in hell reserved for cabbies who say: "Mind if I  stop for gas?"  </P> <P>  -- Is it OK if we drop "kinder and gentler" from the vocabulary now? Or would  you like another year of it?  </P> <P>  -- This is just a guess, but I'm betting that avocado green and harvest gold  are never going to come back as appliance colors.  </P> <P>  -- Few people appreciate how much skill and strategy you need to play croquet.  </P> <P>  -- I can't listen to the Beatles' "Friends and Lovers" without getting choked  up.  </P> <P>  -- What makes me think that "Roseanne" will not be able to stay this funny  over the long haul?  </P> <P>  -- Confidential to "Confused in Cleveland": No, cuffs are not necessary on  your jogging pants as long as you don't plan to wear them after 5 p.m.  </P> <P>  -- You can tell a lot about a person by whether he prefers flower or vegetable  gardens.  </P> <P>  -- If you ever wondered what happens when you send a check to the IRS that you  forgot to sign, I just found out: They cash it anyway.  </P> <P>  -- Is it true that if you have pierced ears and don't wear earrings, the wind  whistles through your lobes?  </P> <P>  -- Fajitas are the fondue of the '90s.  </P></p>

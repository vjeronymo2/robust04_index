"The Romanian state  campaigns for the strict observance of the norms of  international law and of the international standards regarding  the minorities and makes every effort to secure the rights of  national minorities in Romania." Teodor Melescanu mentioned  that "as seen by the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the principle of  truthfulness and respect of the Romanians living abroad to the  states whose citizens they are make the keystone of our policy  with the communities of Romanians everywhere and the way to  follow in order to avoid any tension and disagreement in  bilateral relations with other countries".    As regards Ukraine, the Romanian chief diplomat opined that  "the emotional side and the sensitiveness of the situation of  the Romanian population in that neighbor country consequent to  the tragic events generated by the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact  (1939), necessarily require the further taking of steps apt to  secure conditions for the preservation, expression and  development of national, linguistic, cultural and religious  identity of the Romanians". In this respect, Melescanu  stressed: "We assess as necessary the improvement and  development of the tuition in Romanian existing in that country,  the provision of facilities for the training in Romania of  teaching staff and experts from among Romanian ethnics, the  granting of assistance in setting up libraries, clubs,  publishing houses, printing houses for Romanian- language  publications, the redemption of buildings that belonged to  Romanian spirituality, the securing of free flow of persons,  especially for the youth who want to learn in Romania. I cannot  watch indifferently the degradation or destruction of Romanian  vestiges and historical monuments in Ukraine's territory and the  measures that prevent the free expression of the Romanians'  opinions, as is the case of the PLAI ROMANESC [ROMANIAN LAND]  newspaper", said Teodor Melescanu. He stressed that "the  problems of the situation of Romanians in Ukraine and of  Ukrainians in Romania are a matter of official talks at the  level of the two Foreign Ministries pursuing the signing of  official documents".    The territories in today's Ukraine inhabited by Romanians  are  parts of Bessarabia and Bucovina -- ancient Romanian territories  -- annexed by the former USSR in 1940 pursuant to the  Ribbentrop- Molotov pact which has been disavowed these last few  years.</p>

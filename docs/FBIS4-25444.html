			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Mu Qing (3668 7230) and reporter Huang Wei </F> (7806 1218)]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- Beijing City has  established a network for cadres to engage in theoretic study.  The network has made it possible to organize leading cadres at  all levels to study socialist theory with Chinese  characteristics in light of realities.    In carrying out the work of organizing cadres to engage in  theoretical study, the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee has  attached great importance to the study programs for leading  Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government groups. As early  as 1992, a central study group for major leading Beijing  Municipal CPC Committee and Government cadres was set up. Such  groups are staffed with two secretaries solely responsible for  supervising and inspecting its study programs. A record of each  student's attendance and performance is kept by the study group.  Meanwhile, a theoretical study network has been formed in  Beijing, with each immediate higher-level authority supervising  the work of each lower-level authority. Priority attention has  been given to the study programs for cadres at or above the  department level.    In their theoretical study, leading cadres at all levels in  Beijing City have focused on the goal of emancipating the mind,  seeking truth from facts, and establishing a socialist market  economy. They have systematically studied the theory of  socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. To  facilitate leading cadres at or above the bureau level to  achieve a better result in their study, the city's leaders have  taken the advantages of the capital's favorable conditions by  inviting responsible comrades of various ministries and  commissions and experts in relevant fields to deliver reports on  such special topics as current financial, foreign trade, and  taxation systems reforms, as well as on the establishment of a  modern enterprising system. These reports, serving as a  supplementary to the study programs, have helped leading cadres  at or above the bureau level master the market economy theory  and relevant new knowledge, acquire a general understanding  about the establishment of a socialist market economy framework,  and enhance their policy-related theory and decision-making  level.    Leading cadres at all levels in Beijing City have integrated  their theoretical study with investigations and research. They  have tried to deepen their understanding about theoretical  problems through investigations and research and by improving  their theoretical level to find new methods to solve practical  issues. This is one of the outstanding features in their  theoretical study. Last year, Secretary Chen Xitong and Mayor Li  Qiyan of Beijing City made more than 30 trips to visit mountain  and rural areas, industrial and commercial enterprises,  construction sites, and universities and colleges. They  listened carefully to opinions expressed by the masses, solved  new problems which had cropped up during the course of reform  and opening up, and took a lead in writing theoretical articles  and investigation reports, including: "There Is No Leadership  Without Conducting Investigations and Researches" and "Work Hard  To Achieve the Goal of Leading a Fairly Comfortable Life."  Under their leadership, leading cadres at all levels in the  city have made it their practice to conduct investigations and  research in the grass-roots units. Leading cadres at or above  the district, county, and bureau levels have written more than  250 theoretical articles and investigation reports.    Party schools at all levels in Beijing City have also  sponsored rotating training classes for cadres at or above the  department level. They have sponsored more than 20 terms of  rotating training classes for cadres at or above the bureau  level, with more than 1,600 people having received the training.  They have achieved the goal put forward by Beijing City's  leaders that leading cadres at or above the bureau level should  receive such rotating training once a year. They have sponsored  more than 250 terms of rotating training classes for cadres at  or above the department level, with more than 12,000 people  having received the training. Propaganda departments at all  levels in Beijing City have conducted more than 250 report  meetings in various forms as a supplementary to the study  programs, with more than 200,000 people having attended such  report meetings.</p>

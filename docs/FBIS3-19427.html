			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Markku Salomaa: "Defense of the EU </F> Based on Nuclear Weapons"]    [Text] Finland must reevaluate the strengths and weaknesses  of its policy toward nuclear arms.    By joining the EU [European Union], Finland would enter the  era of nuclear arms strategy, but this should not be the sole  reason for voting against membership, writes Markku Salomaa.    The writer has a doctorate in political science and is a  researcher with the Academy of Finland.    With the common defense of the EU, Finland would also  receive  the protection of the nuclear umbrella of the West. But at the  same time, Finland would end up as a target for the opposing  side.    Although Finland would not have interests that would require  a nuclear deterrent, such interests would develop for Europe,  the superpower.    Should Finland become a member of the EU, its security  policy  will face greater changes than at any time since the country  became independent if the EU chooses to integrate its defense. A  common strategy will provide a strong push toward a nuclear arms  strategy.    The Union expects from its members total commitment to all  aspects of its development plans, and it will not permit  neutrality or "nonalliance," as expressed in the Commission's  Report as early as 25 May 1992. No one can enjoy the benefits of  the Union without being (totally) committed oneself.    The defense political development of the Union can only mean  the building of common security based on nuclear arms, as they  already provide the core of French and British defense.  Conventional military might only complements the nuclear  deterrents. Conventional forces could be kept fairly small -- as  long as their quality is high -- in order to be able to handle  smaller scale regional operations  <H5>  Nuclear Powers Not Content With Conventional Weapons </H5>   The current nuclear powers are not willing, under any  circumstances, to relinquish the core of their defense. They are  unwilling to take the risk of establishing nuclear-free zones  and having to rely on conventional weapons. That would become  even more expensive than nuclear weapons.    These are the realities we have to face if Finland is a  member of the Union in 1996, and a debate commences regarding  security and defense policies, as well as the decisions involved  in such. Although defense policy decisions by the Council of  Ministers would require consensus, the remaining question is,  what authority do the different bodies of the Union exert on the  use of nuclear weapons by the member countries.    Ultimately the decision to use nuclear weapons has  previously  been, and is now, made by each country's military leadership.  The French nuclear arms doctrine is based on just this tenet.  Thus the doctrine of the Union will probably resemble the one  held by NATO. Finland's options regarding nuclear arms and  foreign forces would only apply during peacetime.    In addition, the new doctrine espoused by NATO, the United  States, and also Russia, openly expresses a preparedness to use  nuclear arms for a first strike. The real nuclear strike  threshold has been high and is now even higher. The threat of a  first strike is necessary for the establishment of a nuclear  deterrent effect.    Although Russia, in its military doctrine made public last  November, expressed the commitment not to use nuclear weapons  against nations who are signatories to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and who have no nuclear arsenals of  their own, this promise also has some exceptions.    A country that has no nuclear weapons can also become a  target if it has an alliance with a nuclear power. This doctrine  would put all members of the Union in the same basket, without  any special exceptions.    The Russian doctrine lists as potential threats, which would  entitle the country to launch military operations across its  borders, the expansion of "military blocks and alliances" in a  manner that would constitute a threat to the military and  security interests of the Russian Federation. This would include  the establishment of foreign troops and weapons systems in a  neighboring country, where they have not been located before.    Among the threat scenarios is also listed "the suppression  abroad of the benefits, freedoms, and lawful rights of citizens  of the Russian Federation." This item does not only apply to the  Baltic states.    The continued uncertainty in Russia's internal affairs is  apt  to keep familiar doubts alive in all areas bordering on Russia.  The impending Russian presidential election brings its own  sources of doubts. The exceptional power wielded by the Russian  president's office may constitute a problem.  <H5>  Russia's Military Tenets Also Carried Out in Reality </H5>   For many of these reasons, NATO has maintained its basic  level of preparedness on essentially the same level as before,  and the organization has not agreed to let the United States  withdraw all its troops. Russia is also slowing down the  reductions in military personnel, and is, on the contrary,  increasing the size of its Armed Forces.    The new Russian military doctrine is not simply a piece of  paper; the country has started to implement all facets of it.    Finnish military policy decisions should be based on  strategic considerations and not imagined views. The issue is  complicated and difficult because it is so heavily charged with  emotion. Membership in the Union should not be rejected for this  reason alone, but one should be familiar with all the scenarios  involved.    One of the realities is also the fact that no sacrifices  made  by us towards conventional military forces would provide as  effective a deterrent as nuclear arms. In addition, if a  convential war were to erupt, our country would immediately be  on the frontline.    And finally, in spite of all doubts, a European nuclear  umbrella would benefit Finland. Therefore, it is time for us to  objectively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a nuclear  armament policy.</p>

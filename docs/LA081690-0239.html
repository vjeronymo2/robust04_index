			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 45,000 MARINES READIED FOR GULF, U.S. SOURCES SAY  </P> <P> Pentagon sources today disclosed plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the inflamed  Persian Gulf region to supplement the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force  troops already committed.  </P> <P> The size of the Marine deployment became known as one source said the President  had given naval commanders in the Persian Gulf permission to use "minimum  force" to halt shipments to and from Iraq in enforcement of a U.N.-backed trade  embargo.  </P> <P> At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said today that Iraq has continued to  increase its armed forces in Kuwait and that intelligence reports estimate  their number at 160,000. He said there has been no major change in the  character of the forces, which the Pentagon earlier described as having a  defensive appearance.  </P> <P> The size of the Marine deployment was disclosed by officials speaking on  condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> Gen. John Dailey, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, said the service  has sent a "substantial armada" of assault troops -- the largest since the  Vietnam War.  </P> <P> "We don't just arrive," the four-star general said in an interview. "We're  there to stay for a fairly lengthy period."  </P></p>

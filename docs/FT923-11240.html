			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: Subtle checks for artful interiors Lovers of Shaker furniture will probably like the new range of checks, plaids and stripes that Sanderson, the furnishing fabric house, has brought out to meet the new feeling for simpler, less elaborately furnished interiors. These are not crisp, innocent or sunny checks but sophisticated, subtle, subdued versions suitable for artfully simple interiors, where white walls are perfect backdrops for good pictures and fine furniture. The fabric is a tough, hard-wearing 54 per cent cotton and 46 per cent Modacrylic in a variety of colour combinations - plain cream teamed with sage green, dusty pink or dark blue or combinations of navy, beige and cream, dark green, beige and cream, dark red, dark green and cream. At Pounds 23.95 a metre simplicity does not come cheap these days. Checkmates, as the collection is called, is widely available - call 071-636-7800 for your nearest stockist.</p>

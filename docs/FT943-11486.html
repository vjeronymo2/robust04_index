			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big Gatt 'winners' on the look-out for backsliding - Having already seen some of the 1992 Blair House provisions pared back, Australian farmers fear there may be more dissipation of benefits before the Uruguay Round deal is implemented Australia's farm sector has been touted as one of the big winners from the settlement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. For many products, the country is an efficient, low-cost producer. It would, therefore, seem a natural beneficiary of freer trade. To hear local farmers talk, however, no one would believe it. They have already seen some of the 1992 Blair House provisions pared back. Now the fear is that more dissipation will follow during the long period leading up to the full implementation of the Uruguay Round settlement. Potential environmental obligations, which reflect Europe's confined habitat and are less applicable to Australia's vast expanses, or manipulation of base levels from which subsidy reductions will be calculated are just some of the issues cited. 'It's all very nice, what's happened - but now we've got to watch how it's executed,' says Mr Bob Lawrence, at the New South Wales Farmers' Association. Mr Graham Barron, a grain-farmer from Ungarie, is even blunter. 'The spirit of Gatt should be adopted immediately, yet stocks are being dumped, even now, by the US and Europe' he alleges. 'The lead-in will be bumpy and we're not going to get immediate remedies.' The much-cited headline figure for the benefit of the Gatt agreement to Australia's farm sector is a ADollars 900m-ADollars 1bn boost to annual agricultural exports. Set alongside total rural exports, excluding processed food, of ADollars 9.72bn in 1992/3, this is plainly an impressive number. It should be treated with some caution, however. The estimate comes from two separate econometric models, employed by the Australian Bureau of Resource Economics, a government forecasting agency, and by the Industry Commission, the statutory authority that advises federal government on assistance to the private sector. In both cases, the ADollars 1bn figure applies only when the provisions of the Uruguay Round are fully implemented - that is, after 2001. Moreover, while the models differ in their general scope, both look only at the 'marginal' change to exports at current farm prices. They do not attempt to estimate what the value of additional exports will be at prices ruling in the year 2002, what new competition might enter the market, and so on. These caveats aside, the models anticipate that the gains will come from three sources. First, there will be a reduction in subsidised exports from the US and European Union. Secondly, there is the promise of improved access to markets which are protected at present. Thirdly, the requirement that domestic support funds - that is, government funds which are used to subsidise farm production and incomes - be cut by a fifth should also help to address the problem of overproduction. That, at the very least, should stabilise world prices generally, and could push them higher. According to the Abare model, all sectors of the Australian farm sector stand to get some benefit. But the gains will not be spread evenly. In absolute terms, the biggest winner is the beef industry, where producers can expect to receive a ADollars 340m annual export boost by the end of the six-year implementation period. Next comes the wheat industry, which should see a further ADollars 250m-worth of exports. The dairy industry is forecast to enjoy a ADollars 125m benefit; coarse grains, ADollars 90m; sugar, ADollars 40m; rice, ADollars 25m; and sheepmeat, perhaps ADollars 20m. Not surprisingly, Australian politicians crowed when the deal was finally struck on December 15. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said his country would benefit from 'enhanced market access and more predictable market conditions'. Trade officials, meanwhile, sighed with particular relief when the European Union reaffirmed the Andriessen Assurance, an undertaking given by the former European Community agriculture commissioner, Mr Frans Andriessen, that the EC (now known as the EU) would not export subsidised beef to North Asian markets of considerable value to Australia. In large part, farmers' representatives agreed: 'Improvements in market access will deliver considerable gains to farmers,' commented Mr Graham Blight, president of the National Farmers Federation. Even on December 15, however, reaction from the farming sector was less than euphoric, with negotiators expressing concerns over some of the last-minute additions to the deal. Mr Philip Eliason, then deputy director of the National Farmers Federation and closely involved with the Gatt talks, says that haggling over the timing and starting-dates for adjustments to export subsidies, and the extension of the period during which the so-called 'peace-clause' could protect subsidisers from Gatt action, were both big negatives. 'These were elements which will set back the delivery date of benefits to the Australian farming sector,' he comments. At farm level, reaction to the Gatt deal has been even more equivocal, and varies significantly according to the type of agriculture involved. Even cattle farmers are cautious. Mr Frank Austin, a cattle-producer from Adelong, who has some 400 breeding cows on a 1,400-hectare property, acknowledges that his industry will see some real gain from the enhanced market access but thinks that Australian farmers will have their work cut out trying to maximise the opportunities. 'I see the agreement as an advantage. It's formalised the Andriessen Assurance, which was previously only a verbal agreement, and we will get increased access to the US. I guess the rationalisation of production in Europe will also reduce the pressure worldwide,' he says. 'But there still needs to be a very serious emphasis on quality in Australia, and we need to reduce processing costs. We need to address freight and non-farm costs. We need to look at the international marketplace and be aware of what we're producing and for whom. We must be far more targeted.' Already, he worries that Australian farmers are losing out to their New Zealand counterparts. For grain-farmers, like Mr Barron, the agreement is also a plus, but falls way short of aspirations. 'A few years ago, we had really low commodity prices for nearly all grains, and most farmers were in a very tight financial situation. Gatt was seen as a light at the end of the tunnel,' he says. Since the Blair House accord, however, 'the watering down and delayed start makes it a step in the right direction, but not a windfall'. Like his counterparts in the cattle sector, Mr Barron thinks that Australian farmers will need to concentrate on quality and find ways of reducing non-farm costs if they are to seize the market openings that Gatt throws up before rival producers steal a march. And in farming sectors where the promised export boost is smaller and current problems still pressing, the gains can seem even more remote. 'The average wool-grower's perception is that there's something there of value, but it will probably be dissipated before we get to it,' says Mr Charles Armstrong, a New South Wales sheep-farmer and president of the Wool Council of Australia, for example. Mr Eliason thinks that Australian farmers are probably right to be wary. 'While the Uruguay Round improves the unfair trading situation, there's still the test of fair trading,' he says, noting that countries like Hungary, East Germany or even the Ukraine could have the potential to become significant players at some stage in the future. 'Gatt's no panacea - it will just compel competitive forces even further.'</p>

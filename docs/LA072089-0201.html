			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Because of incomplete information provided to The Times, a story in Tuesday's  Calendar about architecture award winners did not include the name of Peter  Miles Landscape Architect in El Toro, which worked on the University Montessori  School of Irvine. The project was one of five presented Honor Awards on Friday  at the American Institute of Architects/Orange County Chapter's 14th annual  awards program.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Army is concerned about the situation of 11  Uruguayan officers whose lives are at risk in Rwanda. This was  confirmed by Lieutenant General Daniel Garcia, Army commander in  chief, who offered details of the Uruguayan officers' situation.    Garcia said that all military officers are free to leave the  area, which is considered a high-risk area. The commander then  explained:    [Begin Garcia recording] Our personnel, who are deployed in  the country's north and south and in the interior, have been  evacuated almost completely. They are in neighboring countries  where they are being cared for. We obtained promises of help  there. What concerns us is the situation of the personnel in  Kigali. We have two officers at the local airport and nine at  UN general headquarters, located in a soccer field in Kigali.  The field is surrounded by a UN security battalion, which is  surrounded by a battalion of government forces who will soon be  attacked by the [word indistinct] forces.    We will be in a very dangerous position if the two groups  begin fighting there. Even if the fighting is not directed  against us, our men may suffer the consequences.    We hope, however, that the situation will improve because  despite the days of killing and given the problems there, we  have not noted any attacks against our own people. Except for  the hostility against the Belgian forces, there have not been  any problems with the other forces. [end recording]</p>

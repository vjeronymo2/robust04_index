			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp - surplus in dispute Sir, Surely, the debate over whether to switch on Thorp has entered the theatre of the absurd. It is now clear that plutonium would be produced at Thorp in quantities far exceeding the capacity or the willingness of electrical utilities to consume it (Letters November 8, 11 and 15). No matter] BNFL continues to press the government for permission to operate Thorp, arguing it can make a profit by holding utilities to reprocessing contracts negotiated at a time when uranium seemed to be scarce and plutonium the only way to keep electricity-generating reactors running. Now that non-weapons-usable uranium fuel is clearly in ample supply, is there no way to avoid switching on Thorp and compounding the plutonium danger? Britain's prime minister, John Major, can still opt for prudence and sanity. Instead of turning on Thorp's plutonium spigot and hoping for the best, he can engage in some enlightened market testing. At Sellafield, there are already more than 30 tons of plutonium extracted from the spent fuel of reactors operated by British nuclear utilities. Since these reactors are not technically suited for recycling plutonium, why not offer it to BNFL's utility customers in Japan and Germany to test the true demand for plutonium before reaching a decision on Thorp? At this point, they seem to support the start-up of Thorp so long as the resulting plutonium and radioactive wastes remain in Britain. The likely result of market testing will be no demand for plutonium in commercial power reactors (they run on uranium), very little demand for plutonium in R&amp;D activities, and a very large demand (and large fees) for continued storage of spent fuel at Thorp until permanent repositories can be opened to dispose of the unreprocessed fuel in the countries of origin.

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y beats a gruelling path to Toronto court door - Bernard Simon examines the immediate prospects of restructuring the Canadian property developer After five gruelling months of negotiations and court appearances, a note of frustration is creeping into efforts to revive Olympia &amp; York, the ailing multi-national property developer. O&amp;Y, whose Canadian and UK assets have been under court protection since May, is required to file a restructuring plan for most of its CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.27bn) debt with an Ontario judge this morning. Its 25 buildings in the US remain outside court protection. In a preview of the plan, Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y president, and Mr Steve Miller, chief negotiator, disclosed yesterday that creditors are being offered up to 80 per cent of O&amp;Y's equity, including voting control. Maturity dates on most project loans as well as a Dollars 2.5bn jumbo loan would be extended. O&amp;Y's owners, the Reichmann family, are also willing to contribute their directly held 20 per cent stake in O&amp;Y's US operations to the restructured company, as well as a number of family-owned buildings in Canada. Mr Greenwald, Mr Miller and their colleagues have held about 40 meetings with various groups of creditors in the past month. They put a brave face yesterday on the progress so far, saying that agreement in principle is close with lenders to five of O&amp;Y's 11 major Canadian projects. Mr Miller said: 'The progress and the movement have been good in all cases.' The creditors however, paint a more sombre picture. 'No one is even close (to an agreement),' says one institutional lender. Noting that O&amp;Y has so far made 'a series of piecemeal offers to various creditors', a senior Toronto bankruptcy lawyer concludes: 'There must be some serious problems.' To no one's great surprise, the restructuring is proving more complex than expected. Layers of secrecy which once surrounded the Reichmann family empire have been peeled away to reveal a highly centralised management structure, but a financial structure which was just the opposite. Mr Greenwald said yesterday that negotiations are taking place with 27 separate groups of creditors. Each O&amp;Y building is a separate entity with its own financing arrangements. Some are in a healthy financial condition, providing more than adequate security for their creditors. Others have rising vacancy rates, ebbing cash flow and falling market values, with the added complication of various layers of creditors, each fighting to protect its own interests. Much of the past few months has been spent trying to reconcile competing interests. Creditors have had to be slotted into one or more of six creditor committees. Much time has been spent apportioning overheads and restructuring costs among O&amp;Y's various projects. Asset sales have slowed to a snail's pace. The latest report from Price Waterhouse, which acts as a conduit for information between O&amp;Y and its creditors, notes that, besides the disposal of a Gulfstream jet, O&amp;Y has in the past month raised a paltry CDollars 3.7m from Canadian government bonds and a vendor take-back mortgage. A deal to dispose of its interest in a 12-storey office project in Budapest has fallen through. The sale of Home Oil of Calgary, which was said to be imminent even before O&amp;Y sought court protection, has yet to be concluded. Despite these hitches, few are willing to predict where O&amp;Y is heading after today's court appearance. Some lenders are talking darkly of bankruptcy and liquidation, or of reviving efforts to 'carve out' individual buildings from the protection of the courts. Although the US operations are not in bankruptcy protection, bondholders of 55 Water Street, a mammoth New York office building, are considering proposals to replace O&amp;Y as manager and to bring in a new investor with the resources to pay for asbestos removal and other improvements. Creditors are also increasingly edgy about the spiralling costs of the restructuring effort. The Canadian operations paid CDollars 3.5m in July to investment bankers, lawyers and accountants, and expect to fork out another CDollars 4.8m this month. Price Waterhouse estimates that the costs of creditor committees are running at another CDollars 2m a month. Sensing these concerns, Mr Miller said the company plans to cut general and administrative expenses by 70 per cent. O&amp;Y is still banking that its reputation as a first-rate manager of buildings will discourage creditors from pulling the plug, especially during an un-remitting slump in the North American commercial property market. A lawyer for one bank says he senses that the lenders are 'more malleable' than they were a month ago. The scales could be tipped by the fate of the Canary Wharf development in London. Mr Paul Reichmann is negotiating to regain a foothold in the Docklands project through an investor group which includes US financiers Mr Laurence Tisch, Mr Sanford Weil and Mr Lewis Ranieri. Investors would contribute Pounds 350m (Dollars 678.65m) and O&amp;Y would continue to manage the project. Some participants in the restructuring predict that O&amp;Y's chances of keeping its creditors at bay in the US and Canada will improve significantly if the Canary Wharf lenders and administrators throw their support behind the Reichmann-led Docklands bid. Conversely, rejection of the Canary Wharf bid could weaken the confidence of lenders in North America that the rest of the Reichmann empire is worth preserving.</p>

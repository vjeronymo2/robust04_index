			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD General Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F> Ulrich Rosenbaum in Bonn; date not given: "`SPD Does Not Need a  Coalition Statement'"]    [Text] [Rosenbaum] Did the time and contents of the Free  Democratic Party of Germany's [FDP] coalition statement come as  a surprise?    [Verheugen] No. There had been signs for a couple of weeks.  The FDP was under very strong pressure. If anything did come as  a surprise it was that Mr. Kinkel has created the impression  that it is a statement without if's and but's.    [Rosenbaum] Does this mean you expect a loophole in the  final wording?    [Verheugen] It will not really be a matter of wording in the  end. I am sure that the coalition will not win a majority on 16  October and that the role that the FDP would like to play is  over. It is no longer the link between the popular parties that  it used to be. It has lost its position as third party.    [Rosenbaum] What do you think the FDP's reaction will be if  the election produces the result that you expect?    [Verheugen] If the Bundestag elections produce a result that  enables the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to form a  majority either with the Greens or the FDP, and if there is no  longer a majority between the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP, the FDP will not  turn a deaf ear to talks. It would be very unwise to do so.    [Rosenbaum] Does this mean that the SPD is counting on the  FDP to be available as a coalition partner?    [Verheugen] We are not counting on any coalition partners in  this election campaign. We are not conducting a coalition  election campaign, but we have only ruled out a grand coalition  and talks with right-wing extremists, whom we will be able to  prevent from entering the Bundestag, as well as with the Party  of Democratic Socialism. But all the others -- and this leaves  only two -- are parties that we can talk to.    [Rosenbaum] How do you see the [FDP's] statement that the  presidential election is not a preliminary decision for the  Bundestag elections?    [Verheugen] This is a piece of very interesting and  important information. I think that with this decision the FDP  has gained full freedom of action. For, it has achieved a  situation where the presidential elections need not be seen in  connection with a coalition statement. Without an FDP coalition  statement or without this particular statement, an FDP decision  in favor of Johannes Rau in the second or third vote in Berlin  would, of course, have been considered an indication of an  intended coalition change. No one can say that now.    [Rosenbaum] You are counting on the FDP to vote for Rau?    [Verheugen] This way the FDP could demonstrate its liberal  independence and show that it does not want to be completely  under the CDU's tutelage.    [Rosenbaum] Do you seriously believe that you can survive  without a clear coalition statement?    [Verheugen] A big popular party does not have to make a  coalition statement. The SPD is going into this election with  the intention of becoming the strongest party, of forming the  government. This means, providing the chancellor and  determining the guidelines of policies. And the question of a  partner, if you need one, can only be determined by evaluating  how the highest possible degree of social democratic policy can  be achieved. We do not want to be implementing another party's  policy. I cannot see the necessity or the benefit of the SPD  making a coalition statement. We will not be conducting the  election campaign as one part of a party constellation against  another party constellation. We are conducting the election  campaign to realize our objectives. All the others are fellow  candidates to whom we are not giving any presents.</p>

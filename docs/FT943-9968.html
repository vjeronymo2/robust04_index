			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Switched on to show improved profits - Philips Philips, the big Dutch-based electronics group, is expected to show a further strong improvement in performance when it unveils second-quarter figures on Thursday. Analysts are looking for a continuation of the first-quarter trend, when net profit more than doubled. Forecasts for the second quarter call for a net profit per share on normal business activities (excluding extraordinary items) of around Fl 0.80 compared with Fl 0.37 a year earlier. This would put Philips on track for substantially higher full-year results and could lead to a rise in the dividend when the payout decision is taken early in 1995. Philips paid a small dividend in 1993, its first since the payout on 1989 results. The extent of the second-quarter rise will depend crucially on the contribution made by economic recovery in Europe, the company's main market. So far in 1994, the profit increase has rested mainly on cost-cutting, debt pruning and financial charges, rather than on a change in business conditions. These factors should lead to another big increase compared with the 1993 second quarter, but a resurgence in Europe would strengthen the company's upward trend. Components, lighting and consumer electronics are expected to show good second-quarter results.</p>

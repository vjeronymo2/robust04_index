			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar awaits job news The US dollar spent much of the day trading in a narrow range against the yen and the D-Mark, as the markets awaited what are seen as crucial non-farm payroll figures today, writes Philip Coggan. Analysts said the employment data will give the markets a crucial indication as to whether the Federal Open Market Committee is likely to increase interest rates at its next meeting on August 16. Meanwhile, the Italian lira consolidated its recent gains against the D-Mark. The Italian Senate formally approved the government's financial programme for the next three years, and the lira gained from the perception that, with the holiday period about to start, political worries would subside for another month. The Bank of Portugal followed up the Bank of Spain's 15 basis-point cut in its key money market rates on Wednesday. The Portuguese lowered the regular money market rate for draining funds from 10.5 per cent to 9.75 per cent, and the emergency lending rate from 13 per cent to 12.5 per cent. The escudo firmed slightly against the D-Mark to Es101.9 from Wednesday's Es102.1. The dollar spent much of the day hovering around the Y100 mark, closing in London at Y100.2 from Y100.175 on Wednesday night. Against the D-Mark, the dollar edged up to DM1.581, from the previous London close of DM1.5792. In New York it finished at Y100.475 and DM1.5872. Trading was thin, with markets showing evidence of having entered a holiday lull. The US currency did receive a brief boost during the day, on rumours, later denied, that the superpower had invaded Haiti. Figures for jobless claims, which fell to 319,000, from 329,000 in the previous week, were largely ignored, as these numbers are seen as more erratic than today's non-farm payroll statistics. According to Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan Bank: 'Some in the market are beginning to question whether the Fed will tighten after August 16, or will wait for the following meeting in September.' The outlook for the dollar is complicated by its recent close relationship with the Treasury bond markets. Strong payroll numbers, while making a Fed tightening more likely, will hit the T-bond market. Conversely, weak payroll numbers will make the Fed's recent slowness to raise rates more credible, and will boost T-bonds. Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting a rise in the non-farm payroll of 200,000 in July, well down from the 379,000 increase seen in June, a figure boosted by the World Cup football tournament. Meanwhile, evidence of the strength of the German economy emerged yesterday with buoyant manufacturing orders and a fall in seasonally adjusted unemployment to 2.575m in July from 2.593m in June. After the Senate's passing of the finance package, the lira finished the day in London at L997.9/DM, having closed at L998.8/DM on Wednesday. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said: 'There will be a quiet period on the political front with parliament going into recess. Some of the potential negatives have been laid to rest for the time being.' According to Mr Robert Thomas, director and head of research at NatWest Capital Markets, events of the last few days mean that Mr Silvio Berlusconi (Italy's prime minister) is now going to be under less pressure. Mr Ian Gunner of Chase Manhattan thinks the lira is now likely to trade in the L990-L1,008 range for the near future. But Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in Europe, said: 'There are still question marks over the shelf life of the Berlusconi administration. The lira is by no means out of the woods.' Having traded in a narrow range around DM2.4250 during the morning, sterling regained a little more of its June losses against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4333, up from DM2.4317. Against the dollar, the pound weakened slightly to Dollars 1.5391, from Wednesday's close of Dollars 1.5399. Sterling's effective index ended at 79.3, unchanged from Wednesday's finish, but up from the opening of 79.1. However, Mr MacKinnon said he had the impression that 'most international investors still consider sterling to be in a long term downtrend'. In the money markets, the Bank of England gave an initial Pounds 900m of assistance, adding further tranches of Pounds 250m, Pounds 62m and Pounds 165m later in the day to alleviate a shortage which was gradually revised up from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 1.35bn. Overnight rates traded in the range of 5 1/4 to 4 1/4 per cent. Although expectations of an imminent base rate rise have receded this week with the publication of the Bank's quarterly inflation report, short sterling edged down a further 5 basis points yesterday, and still implies an increase to 5.75 per cent before September 21. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe, said: 'Market expectations are extremely fragile.' Last week's base rate speculation was started by a Treasury bill auction and another auction is due today.</p>

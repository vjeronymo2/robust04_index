			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: Imperative to strengthen hand of United Nations in Somalia Sir, As president of CARE International, which has great humanitarian responsibilities in Somalia, I have just returned from a fact-finding mission to this war-torn and drought-stricken country. I have never seen such depths of human suffering, against a backdrop of naked anarchy, wanton destruction and total collapse of social, economic and political structures. It is imperative that the international community strengthens the hand of the United Nations in Somalia. Aid organisations, not least CARE International, want to expand their humanitarian and rehabilitation programmes. We have brave men and women risking their lives to mitigate the suffering in the wasteland. The UN must be equipped to give these aid workers the protection that they need. Objections by factional warlords must not stop the UN from deploying peace-keeping forces. Specifically, the number of troops should be increased to about 15,000. Around 500 observers would be needed across the country. There should be greater delegation of finance and power to the secretary-general's special envoy and to the UN commander. Furthermore, the special envoy should be given greater assistance to bring about a conference as a first step towards reconciliation of factions in Somalia. Without a comprehensive package of measures, a special 100-day humanitarian programme the UN is seeking to put in place is almost certain to fail. Malcolm Fraser, president, CARE International, 44th Floor, ANZ Tower, 56 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000</p>

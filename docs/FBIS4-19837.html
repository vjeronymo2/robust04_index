			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "More Undecided Voters Than Ever"] </F>   [Text] There are now more voters who are undecided about  which party to vote for than ever before. As many as 26 percent  of voters do not know which party they will vote for on 3 May.  Even more voters (29 percent) have recently changed their minds  on how they will vote.    These are the findings of the NSS survey bureau in The  Hague.  The survey bureau attributes the high percentage of undecided  voters to great restlessness and uncertainty among voters. At  present, it is the Center Democrats (and CP86 [Central Party  86]) and the Elderly People's Party which are benefitting most  from this uncertainty. The latest opinion poll conducted by NSS  gives them respectively, six and five seats .    According to the bureau in The Hague, the main reasons why  people are switching parties are the reports and developments  regarding social security and problems concerning foreigners and  asylum-seekers.    The PvdA [Labor Party] can expect 33 seats, the CDA  [Christian Democrat Party], and the D66 [Democrats 66] 28 seats  each, while the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]  could grow to 27 representatives, the NSS poll indicates.</p>

Chinese Premier Li Peng made the remarks during a meeting  here today with former Canadian Prime Minister Martin Brian  Mulroney, and Paul Desmarais, chairman of the Power Corporation  of Canada.    Welcoming them, Li Peng expressed appreciation of Mulroney's  role, when he was the Canadian prime minister, in the  restoration of Sino-Canadian ties, and of Desmarais' longtime  efforts in promoting Sino-Canadian ties, especially economic and  trade ones.    Li noted that China and Canada are influential countries on  the Pacific Rim and share common ground in many areas.    Both have their own economic advantages and are  complementary  to each other, Li Peng said, adding that the prospects of  Sino-Canadian cooperation is great.    During the meeting, Li Peng also briefed the visitors on the  new developments of China's reform and opening-up process.    Mulroney said he was pleased to see the constant improvement  of Canada-China ties and that bilateral trade was expanding year  by year. He was optimistic about the prospects for Canada's  ties with China.    China has made progress in every field, Mulroney said,  adding  that his country admires the courage of the Chinese leaders in  carrying out reforms.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- China's "Agenda 21,"  a white paper on population, environment and development in the  21st century, was approved by the State Council today.    The agenda was discussed and adopted at the 16th Executive  Meeting of the State Council presided over by Premier Li Peng.    China is the first country to have worked out and adopted  its  own "Agenda 21," proposed by the United Nations at the Rio de  Janeiro summit meeting in June 1992.    At the summit, Premier Li Peng promised to carry out the UN  agenda and other documents adopted at the meeting.    China initiated and sponsored the ministerial meeting on  environment and development for developing countries in June  1991.    The "Agenda 21" was worked out by 52 departments under the  State Council, including the State Planning Commission and the  State Science and Technology Commission.    The "Agenda" expounds China's strategy, policy and measures  to secure harmonious and sustainable development out of the  milieu of the economy, resources, environment, population,  education and other social factors.    The "Agenda" will also be an important directory document  for  China in making its mid- and long-term economic and social  development plans. It will form an important part of the goals  and content of the Ninth Five-Year (1995-2000) and the 2010  plans.    The "Agenda" made clear the position and actual action of  the  Chinese Government in implementing the UN Agenda 21.    Today's meeting of the State Council also adopted an outline  program of state industrial policies for the 1990's.</p>

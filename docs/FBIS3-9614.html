After the air attack, members of the  so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina carried out -- from the  direction of Bugojno, or rather Mala Suljaga and Glavica -- a  powerful artillery attack. In the Prusac region, from where  artillery has been in action daily against Kupres and Srbobran,  an intensive regrouping of units of the so-called army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been observed.</p>

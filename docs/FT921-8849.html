			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading WORRIES over the economy continued to drive futures lower in spite of a squeeze seen early in the session, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,538, the March contract's rise was strengthened as independent traders, taking their cue from the good overnight performance on Wall Street, moved to fill short positions. That advance only lasted until mid-morning, when a more downbeat mood returned. The release of worse than expected UK jobless figures caused further downward pressure, as did the Wall Street early decline. March closed at 2,535, down 4 on the previous session and around 5 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Turnover, at 4,880 contracts, was again poor. The dealers reported increased activity in March in after-hours' trading as the underlying cash market recovered from earlier lows. Traded options business was dull, with turnover of 21,207 contracts enlivened by two features. There was good two-way business in Hanson, which announced reduced first-quarter profits. It traded 4,168 contracts, with the May 200 calls and May 200 puts particularly busy. BP, which also reported poor figures, traded 1,061 lots.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILBURN'S DEFENSE OF RAP -- FANS AND FOES REACT;  </P> <P> NO LACK OF ATTENTION  </P> <P> Is Hilburn living on the same planet that I am? He claims that rap music has  been relegated to "largely underground status" and receives "scant national  airplay." I pulled out my latest issue of Rolling Stone and found that several  of the top spots on the charts were held by rap groups, including M.C. Hammer  at No. 2 and Public Enemy at No. 6.  </P> <P> I hear rap music utilized constantly in commercial advertisements, public  service messages and nationally syndicated TV shows.  </P> <P> Wasn't that Run DMC running neck and neck with Woody in the "Tour de Lite" TV  commercial? How about the Lakers' "Just Say No to Drugs!" video a couple  seasons back? And who could forget that god-awful "We Are the Bears," which  showcased the rapping abilities of Jim McMahon and William (The Refrigerator)  Perry? Didn't Theo Huxtable perform a rap song on the nation's No. 1 TV show?  Heck, rap even has its own TV show, "Yo! MTV Raps!"  </P> <P> I have had the opportunity to teach both in the inner city (South-Central Los  Angeles) and a rural environment. From what I can tell, kids everywhere can't  get enough rap music. If they could memorize their times tables as well as they  memorize rap lyrics, my job would be cake.  </P> <P> Hilburn's theory that rap's message is lost on white, middle-class,  college-educated "observers" because it employs literary devices from the  inner-city culture borders on racism. Could you imagine someone getting away  with saying the reverse? That black, inner-city "observers" were confused over  the message of another musical genre because it utilized literary devices  foreign to their dialect? Come on, Robert, give us some credit.  </P> <P> Hilburn is getting farther and farther out of touch. Having him write a rap  overview is like having James Watt write the Sierra Club newsletter. I just  don't think he gets it.  </P> <P> JOSEPH P. HUBBELL  </P> <P> Grover City, Calif.  </P></p>

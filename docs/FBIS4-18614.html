			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Turkey has stated that it will continue to give  Albania all support and assistance to enable it to successfully  accomplish its democratization process and economic reforms.    Albanian President Sali Berisha left Turkey after holding  various contacts in Ankara and Istanbul. The joint  Turkish-Albanian statement regarding Berisha's visit has been  issued.    According to the information received by the Press Center of  the President's Office, the two presidents had a comprehensive  exchange of views on the regional and international issues  concerning their respective countries. According to the  statement, both presidents expressed their pleasure at the  agreement envisaging the establishment of a federation between  the Bosnians and the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The statement  further notes that discussions were held on the dangerous  situation in the Balkans spreading to Kosovo, Sandzak,  Vojvodina, and to the south.    The Turkish-Albanian statement notes that both presidents  were of a common accord that the potential to further bilateral  cooperation exists and agreed on focusing on the following  issues: To fully support and facilitate Turkish investments in  Albania; to better benefit from the joint economic commission  and activities of the business council; to cooperate closely on  the infrastructure project regarding telecommunication,  maritime, air, and railroad transportation especially where it  concerns the East-West Corridor Project which will connect  Albania's Durres port to Bulgaria's Varna and then by means of  TEM [Transit European Motorway] over Sofia to Istanbul; to  further joint tourism and cooperation regarding tourism industry  development; to open a branch of the Turkish Ziraat Bank in  Tirana; to further cooperation between Turkish and Albanian  state radio and television networks so that TRT television  programs can be viewed in Tirana.    Meanwhile, the guest minister went on a boat trip in the  Bosforus. The Albanian president also held a meeting with  Turkish businessmen. Berisha said that although relations  between Turkey and Albania accelerated considerably, Turkish  investments in Albania are still far from reaching the desired  level. Berisha called on Turkish businessmen to invest in his  country.    In a statement prior to his departure, Berisha thanked the  Turkish people and President Suleyman Demirel for their warm  welcome. State Minister Nurhan Tekinel, Governor Hayri  Kozakcioglu, Lieutenant General Selcuk Saka, and Foreign  Ministry officials saw off the Albanian President at Istanbul's  Ataturk Airport.</p>

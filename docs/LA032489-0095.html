			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILE, WORLD BANK TO COMPENSATE FOR FRUIT BAN LOSSES  </P> <P> The government of Chile and the World Bank have pledged financial backing to  compensate for losses that resulted from the Bush Administration's five-day ban  on Chilean fruit, officials representing Chilean exporters and U.S. importers  announced Thursday.  </P> <P> While details of the plan have not yet been worked out, the promise of  financial incentives will enable retailers and others in this country to  destroy fruit that accumulated during the embargo and clear the system for  incoming shipments from the South American nation, they said.  </P> <P> "The reason for removing the fruit from the system is the spoilage caused by  delays, not because the fruit is adulterated," Ronald Bown, executive director  of the Chilean Exporters' Assn., said at a press conference. "It would take too  much time, too much money and too much manpower to inspect and clear the fruit  for return to market. When Chilean fruit returns to the U.S. market, we intend  to provide only the premium quality the U.S. consumer has always demanded."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Empties Pipeline'  </P> <P> Bown estimated that economic losses for exporters and importers from the ban  last week would total about $240 million, and officials representing U.S.  importers said about 3 million cases of fruit worth as much as $75 million will  have to be destroyed.  </P> <P> They said prices for consumers may be "slightly higher for the first few days"  after Chilean fruit returns to grocery store shelves but predicted that "the  market will return to normal" once the supply reaches its usual volume.  </P> <P> "When you remove this amount of fruit, it totally empties the pipeline, so that  when you return fruit, the initial demand will be very, very strong," said  George F. Carstens, president of the American Produce Assn. "We are a supply  and demand economy, so the initial impact of the first few days may be slightly  higher in terms of prices to retailers -- which may or may not be reflected in  prices to consumers."  </P> <P> The ban was imposed by the Food and Drug Administration March 13 after two red  seedless grapes containing puncture marks and minute traces of cyanide were  discovered in a shipment that arrived in the port of Philadelphia, which  receives more than half of all Chilean fruit exports. The inspections that  found the tainted grapes were conducted after an unidentified caller telephoned  the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, threatening to poison fruit headed for the United  States.  </P> <P> The ban emptied store shelves across the nation of all fruit of Chilean origin  and threatened critical damage to the Chilean economy. The United States  purchases more than half of Chilean fruit exports.  </P> <P> Last Friday, the FDA announced that it would return Chilean grapes and other  berries to the market under a new, enhanced inspection system here, coupled  with increased security measures in Chile. However, the FDA said fruit that  already had left U.S. ports for distribution to markets before the embargo  would have to be destroyed.  </P> <P> Under the agency's new procedures, inspections have increased to 5% of fruit,  or a minimum of 15,000 cases from each vessel, whichever is larger. Earlier  this week, the FDA announced that it also would begin to permit the return of  Chilean pears and nectarines after inspection. Since the discovery of the two  cyanide-tainted grapes, no further contaminated fruit has been detected.  </P> <P> Bown said that, despite "losses in the hundreds of millions," the American  consumer "is ready to buy fresh fruit from Chile." He said importers are now  reporting back orders of between 500,000 and 1 million cases and "the orders  continue to arrive."  </P> <P> Fruit exports are the second largest source of foreign exchange for Chile. At  wholesale, Chilean fruit sold in the United States amounts to nearly $1 billion  annually, of which $500 million is returned eventually to the Chilean economy.  More than 10,000 fruit orchard owners in Chile have been affected by the FDA  ban, along with Chilean packing and shipping facilities, all employing an  estimated 250,000 workers, for at least a part of the year.  </P></p>

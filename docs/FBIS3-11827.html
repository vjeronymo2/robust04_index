			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] La Paz, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Bolivian President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada swore in his new cabinet today,  thereby ending the ministerial crisis plaguing the first eight  months of his administration. This will allow Congress to  approve several projects presented by the Executive Branch.    The president told the new members of his cabinet: "The  stage  for creativity has ended. Now another stage can begin; one of  practical and specific actions."    Sanchez de Lozada made changes in his 10-member cabinet  after  five ministers resigned. He also created a minister at large,  thereby putting an end to what he believes is the first stage of  his administration, which was inaugurated on 6 August 1993.    The Bolivian leader affirmed that this change was necessary  because it comes at a vital and significant time for the  country. Sanchez de Lozada is trying to get Congress to approve  several draft laws regarding capitalization, popular  participation, and education reform. [passage omitted]    Leaders of the four political parties that comprise the  ruling coalition were present at the ceremony. They said the  new cabinet will carry out the changes and programs set forth  over the past seven months.    Max Fernandez, a leader of the Solidarity Civic Unity, who  is said to be responsible for the cabinet crisis, said, "the  time has come for the president to receive the conditional  support of the ruling coalition to demonstrate that changes have  finally come for the Bolivian people." Fernandez demanded a  greater say within the Executive Branch in exchange for votes to  approve the laws Sanchez de Lozada has presented to Congress.</p>

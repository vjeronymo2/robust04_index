			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc share sale is over-subscribed THE French government announced last night that the sale of shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship French chemicals company, had been healthily over-subscribed. The sale, which forms part of the socialist administration's partial privatisation programme, involved the sale of 6m shares at FFr500 (Dollars 94) each. The finance ministry said last night that demand from French investors had been so strong that part of the 255,000 shares originally allocated for foreign investors would be transfered to France. Originally the French government had intended to stage the Rhone-Poulenc share sale late last year. However, the sale was postponed because of the precarious state of the Paris stock market, then very volatile in the wake of a series of money market attacks on the French franc. Rhone-Poulenc is one of a number of France's state-controlled companies to be involved in the partial privatisation programme which is expected to accelerate if, as the opinion polls suggest, the right returns to power after the French legislative elections in March.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISTRIBUTORS RAIDING RIVALS' RECORD LABELS  </P> <P> Having gobbled up most of the independent labels in sight, record companies are  now trying to increase their market share by finding more music to distribute.  </P> <P> The latest example of the stepped-up competition came this week when IRS  Records -- just 15 months after entering into a five-year domestic distribution  deal with MCA Music Group -- jumped ship and signed a long-term manufacturing  and distribution pact with Capitol Records' sales and distribution arm, CEMA  Distribution.  </P> <P> The defection occurred six months after CEMA lured another label from MCA, Curb  Records, and highlights a major realignment in music distribution that is  taking place amid the increased concentration of the record industry over the  past decade.  </P> <P> "I think the whole thing is spiraling out of control," said IRS Records  President Jay Boberg. Today, "economics and business judgments are smaller  considerations. Companies are into a maniacal pursuit of (sales) volume and  market share."  </P> <P> CEMA Vice President David Kronemyer acknowledged that his company has its eye  out for more distribution deals.  </P> <P> Six large corporations -- Time Warner, Sony, MCA, Thorn EMI, Bertelsmann (which  includes BMG and RCA) and Philips (which includes Polygram) -- now account for  93% of the sales of recorded music, according to the Recording Industry Assn.  of America. Their distribution units typically receive 10% to 25% of an album's  wholesale price for placing the product in record stores and other retail  outlets, although many deals also include manufacturing, which can produce  additional income.  </P> <P> The six major record companies have gobbled up so much business that only about  a dozen independent distributors remain, compared to more than 20 in the early  1980s, experts say. And, unlike the past, it seems that no label is too small  or too controversial for the majors today.  </P> <P> In a deal valued at more than $3 million, for instance, Time Warner's Atlantic  Records this month agreed to manufacture and distribute Luke Records, which is  the home of the controversial rap group 2 Live Crew. The company has been  embroiled in several lawsuits, including one in federal court in Florida that  resulted in a major obscenity ruling against Luke Records.  </P> <P> Other recent deals include BMG's multimillion-dollar pact in March to  distribute Windam Hill Records -- formerly handled by A&amp;M Records.  Meanwhile, Geffen Records will switch to MCA Distribution Corp. next year as a  result of MCA's $545-million purchase of Geffen in March.  </P> <P> "There are not too many options open to the record companies in terms of  increasing their market share," said Roger Lifeset, an independent record  consultant. Major record companies are "absorbing everything at this point."  </P> <P> Independent labels that are not handled by one of the majors must rely on mail  order or an informal network of regional distributors, such as California  Record Distributors Inc. in Chatsworth and Lanham, Md.-based Schwartz Bros.  </P> <P> Stuart Schwartz, chairman of the Lanham concern, conceded that "the pickings  for independent distributors have gotten leaner over the years." But he said  his company, which reported net income of $707,000 on sales of $98 million in  1989, has managed to survive by expanding its territory as far north as Maine  and as far south as Florida.  </P> <P> Major companies, however, have the staff and financial clout to distribute  records to virtually every shopping mall and mom-and-pop store in the country.  But as they gobble up more music, experts say specialized music can get lost in  the shuffle.  </P> <P> Boberg said IRS Records was on good terms with MCA but left because CEMA  offered a better financial deal. CEMA will handle all manufacturing and  distribution for the label starting Sept. 1, and eventually about 52 titles  released through the IRS distribution deal with MCA will shift to CEMA. But  under an earlier agreement, IRS' biggest selling act, Fine Young Cannibals,  will remain with MCA and won't be part of the new distribution deal.  </P> <P> In terms of losing business to competitors, CEMA has been in MCA's shoes.  </P> <P> And CEMA could lose more business as a result of a management shake-up at  another label it handles, Enigma Records.  </P> <P> Sources say Enigma plans to discontinue its Intima jazz label, as well as its  independently distributed Restless rock label, following the resignation of  President Jim Martone earlier this month.  </P> <P> John Burns, executive vice president of MCA Distribution Corp., would not  comment.  </P></p>

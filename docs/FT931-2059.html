			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / BBC World TV faces CNN attack BBC World Service Television is about to face a counter-attack from Mr Ted Turner's CNN International. The Atlanta-based international television news service has been surprised by the speed with which the BBC's 24-hour television news service from London has established itself. In Asia, for instance, BBC World Service television is available in an estimated 11m homes with up to 45m viewers 15 months after its launch on the Star TV system in Hong Kong, a company set up by Hutchison Whampoa. Mr Tom Johnson, president of CNN, concedes that in the past CNN International has been too American in its coverage but that is all about to change. He said: 'We intend to double our international broadcasting in a single year.' At present 40 per cent of CNN International's coverage is international and the rest American orientated. The proportion of international coverage is to be increased to 70 per cent by the end of this year. A Dollars 10m development programme has been approved and there will be an increasing trend to hiring international reporters such as Mr Brent Sadler, formerly of Independent Television News in the UK, rather than sending correspondents from the US. Mr Johnson said: 'We intend to compete aggressively in all areas with the BBC. He added that he had great respect for the quality of journalism produced by the corporation. 'We will let the marketplace judge the results of our efforts,' said Mr Johnson, who believes that there is room for both the CNN and BBC approaches. In the past three years there has been a dramatic increase in the international distribution of CNN. Its service is now on 11 satellites and there are few parts of the world where it cannot be received. The BBC aims to span the world with a self-funding television equivalent of World Service radio by the end of this year. Mr Christopher Irwin, chief executive of WSTV, said: 'We are on course despite the world recession.' The BBC strategy has been to set up in business with regional partners - with the M-Net subscription TV service in Africa and the Nissho Iwai company in Japan. Subscriptions for the 24-hour European service are handled by TV-Extra, a subsidiary of Philips, the electronics group. Mr Irwin said: 'We have witnessed a similar response to the Star TV channels elsewhere in the continent from Taiwan to the Gulf, where BBC WSTV is rebroadcast around the clock on a dedicated terrestrial channel owned by Bahrain TV.' Even Taiwan, which has strong US links, has a BBC audience of 2m - an increase of 66 per cent in six months. Mr Johnson reflects a little wistfully on the fact that CNN was approached first by Star TV but the two sides were unable to agree a deal. 'We gave the BBC the opportunity to compete,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASIAN-AMERICANS PUT QUALITY ABOVE PRICE, SURVEY SAYS;  </P> <P> MARKETING: THE NEW DATA ON PREFERENCES WILL LIKELY ADD TO ADVERTISERS'  PERPLEXITY OVER HOW TO REACH THIS POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE, BUT CULTURALLY AND  LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION.  </P> <P> Although Asian consumers have a reputation for frugality in their homelands,  where saving is encouraged, their Asian-American counterparts are avid shoppers  -- generally less concerned about price and convenience than they are about  quality, according to new research.  </P> <P> The findings are bound to renew the debate among advertisers and marketers  about how to best reach America's rich mix of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans,  Filipinos and Southeast Asian immigrants, as well as highly assimilated  Asian-Americans. Although such consumers are widely viewed by Madison Avenue as  a potentially lucrative market because of their comparatively high incomes and  education levels, differences in language and culture make them difficult to  reach, experts say.  </P> <P> "Most advertisers think that all they need to do is simply translate an English  ad to reach this market," said David Chen, executive vice president of the Los  Angeles advertising firm Muse Cordero Chen &amp; Baca. "But there are problems  with that; there are many differences among Asian people.  </P> <P> "I can understand advertisers being concerned with the difficulty," Chen said,  "but it's not a difficulty we cannot overcome. Themes like stressing quality  have universal appeal" among many Asian groups.  </P> <P> A study by the SRI/Gallup organization of Lincoln, Neb., found that in choosing  a product, 67% of 779 Chinese-American consumers surveyed ranked the quality of  the product more important than price, store location or service. Similarly, an  SRI/Gallup survey last year of 400 Japanese and Korean households in Southern  California found that while there were "significant" cultural differences  between the two groups, both "are upscale shoppers with rapidly expanding  purchasing power."  </P> <P> More recently, both Impact Resources of Columbus, Ohio, and the Find/SVP  research organization in New York found Asian-Americans to be avid shoppers who  are generally more concerned about product quality than the general population.  For instance, while price was more important to the total population than among  the 3,251 Asian-Americans surveyed in the Impact study, 54% of the  Asian-Americans said quality is the most important reason for selecting a men's  clothing outlet, compared to 50% of the total population.  </P> <P> Quality, of course, is a subjective concept, and it is still unclear to many  experts why Asian-Americans embrace certain brands or whether they will remain  loyal to them as they become more acculturated. Nevertheless, some marketing  specialists believe that companies should continue to direct special campaigns  at even highly assimilated third- and fourth-generation Asians, although  convincing advertisers of that approach has been difficult.  </P> <P> "We've been banging on the door since 1985, and now we're beginning to see  greater acceptance of the Asian market," said Greg Sullivan, president of Asian  Television Sales, a San Francisco company that sells advertising time on three  Asian-language television stations, including KSCI in Los Angeles. "What  advertisers don't realize is that if you are an Asian immigrant, 80% of this  stuff on TV you've never heard of."  </P> <P> Concentrated in three areas -- California, Hawaii and the New York metropolitan  area -- Asian-Americans represent a large and rapidly growing market.  </P> <P> The Asian population has increased 67% since 1980 in Los Angeles County alone,  according to a 1987 Census Bureau estimate. And because the mean family income  of Asian-Americans is about $10,000 higher than that of Latinos, their buying  power is substantially greater, said Holmes Stoner, head of Artesa Media  Services, a Los Angeles ad agency that specializes in marketing to Latinos and  Asians.  </P> <P> Yet, unlike Latino immigrants who come from countries closer to the United  States, Asians are not as familiar with the broad universe of American goods.  As a result, many Asian-Americans flock to a dominant brand deemed "the best"  by their immigrant neighbors, experts say.  </P> <P> For example, studies conducted between 1986 and 1988 by SRI/Gallup found that  40% of Chinese consumers surveyed used Tide laundry detergent, 44% of Koreans  used Ajax cleaner and 70% of Japanese used either Crest or Colgate toothpaste.  No other brand had more than a 10% share in each of those product categories.  </P> <P> As a result, many experts see a tremendous opportunity to instill brand loyalty  and grab a large share of the Asian-American market by trumpeting the quality  or the prestige of their product to newly arrived Asian immigrants.  </P> <P> In advertising to the general public, for example, Metropolitan Life Insurance  Co. of New York runs ads featuring the comic strip character Snoopy saying,  "Get Met; it pays." But in a special campaign directed at Chinese- and  Korean-Americans, the company stresses its prestige, as well as Asian values  such as financial security and family responsibility. Instead of showing  Snoopy, the ads shows several massive office buildings owned by Metropolitan  Life.  </P> <P> "It's a more tangible identification of where our financial strength lies,"  said William Orton, a marketing executive with Metropolitan Life. "We did a  fair amount of market research in terms of what major themes would appeal to  the Asian community . . . We emphasize the prestige of dealing with a company  that was here yesterday and will be here tomorrow."  </P> <P> Similarly, Las Vegas hotels such as the Desert Inn and Caesars Palace have held  Chinese New Year parties, advertised on Asian-language TV and put on other  glossy promotions stressing the quality and prestige of their hotel's  accommodations to entice both Asian-American and foreign tourists. Caesars also  has marketing offices throughout Asia -- as well as in heavily Chinese-American  Monterey Park.  </P> <P> "The Asian community is a significant market for Caesars Palace; we try to  emphasize (to them) the elegance and ambience of our world-renowned resorts,"  said Jack Leone, a vice president at Caesars World Inc.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T has taken a somewhat different approach. Last year, it became the  first U.S. company to air a regional television commercial with entirely  Japanese dialogue, said Mark N. Burgess, AT&amp;T's acting director for  international advertising. The 30-second ad, which had English subtitles, shows  a Japanese-American man calling long-distance to a colleague in Japan to relate  a joke told to him by his daughter.  </P> <P> Some Asian-American advertising executives, as well as the 157-page study  published in December by Find/SVP, prefer AT&amp;T's general market approach,  saying it's a waste of money to specifically target the Asian-American market.  They say Asian cultures are too different to reach efficiently with one kind of  campaign.  </P> <P> "Even though Asian people who come here have their own ethnic television, the  majority are watching regular network TV," said Clifford Yuguchi, president of  the Los Angeles advertising firm Bozell/Yuguchi Inc. "What companies ought to  do is pull off some of those white people and show more Asians."  </P> <P> Deborah Ching, executive director of the Chinatown Service Center in Los  Angeles, says she, too, would like to see more Asian-Americans on TV. But she  said she is turned off by some efforts that have "racist and sexist" depictions  of "Asian men as less than masculine and Asian women as exotic, desirable and  subservient." She cited as particularly offensive the Singapore Airlines'  "Singapore Girl" commercial that shows attractive female flight attendants  serving passengers.  </P> <P> Bob Candiotti, a spokesman for Singapore Airlines, responded: "It's true that  the presentation of Singapore girl has been one of our ongoing ad campaigns for  several years. To us, the Singapore girl is symbolic of our high level of  service. Their uniforms are actually quite modest; they wear ankle-length  dresses. We do not view the ads as being sexist or racist."  </P> <P> Although many marketers say they are moving away from unfavorable Asian  caricatures, there are still slip-ups and outright mistakes.  </P> <P> Playboy magazine once wished Chinese celebrants "Year New Happy" in a full-page  newspaper ad. And Filipinos -- the nation's largest Asian-American group -- are  sometimes mistakenly lumped with Latinos by marketers because Filipinos often  have Spanish surnames.  </P> <P> A more practical problem in reaching the Asian market is the lack of national  media. Unlike Spanish-language television, which has two national broadcasting  networks, there is no national Asian TV. Instead, regional systems -- such as  KSCI Channel 18 in Los Angeles and KTSF Channel 26 in San Francisco -- provide  programming in areas with large Asian populations.  </P> <P> The print medium is even more fragmented. In Southern California, there are at  least 15 Vietnamese-language newspapers, more than a dozen Chinese newspapers  and three Japanese papers.  </P> <P> "Unless you are willing to get in there and get your hands dirty, the  (Asian-American) market can be really intimidating," said Stoner of Artesa  advertising. "You can't go out there with a typical kind of ad and try to be  all things to all people."  </P> <P> Indeed, although Find/SVP agreed with other experts that Asian-Americans have a  "commitment to obtaining products and services noted for having the 'best'  quality" the study went on to conclude that: "In reality, each of the separate  Asian-American ethnic groups is a separate ethnic market. The only  characteristic they all have in common is their 'American-ness.' And it is only  through their 'American-ness' that the various groups can be reached through  the same marketing campaign."  </P></p>

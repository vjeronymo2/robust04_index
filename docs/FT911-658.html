			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / MoD to sell military research airfields at Farnborough, Hampshire, and at Bedford - were confirmed by the Ministry of Defence yesterday. They would become 'available for disposal' as a result of a decision to concentrate research flying activities at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. Preliminary studies indicated that the Bedford site might be used for commercial non-passenger traffic. Options for Farnborough, which hosts the UK's International Air Show, ranged from business and commercial aviation to 'more extensive development'. The MoD said it would honour its commitments to keep the Farnborough show. The Society of British Aerospace Companies, responsible for the exhibition, said it assumed the show would remain at Farnborough 'through to the turn of the century'. Mr Kenneth Carlisle, junior defence procurement minister, announcing the move in a written Commons reply, said the transfer to Boscombe Down was expected to take 'a number of years'.</p>

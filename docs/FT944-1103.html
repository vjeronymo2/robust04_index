The remaining 26,000 students had either applied late or had failed to complete their forms correctly. Sir Eric Ash, acting part-time chief executive in the absence of Mr Ron Harrison, who is ill, said students still waiting for loans should approach their universities for hardship loans. He said he was 'absolutely certain' the company would not repeat the mistakes next year, which had led to 'too many' students facing delays. Sir Eric said: 'The Student Loan Company is a very well-run company which has run into a specific problem which no one anticipated.' Vice-chancellors have campaigned to make loans repayable through income tax or National Insurance. However, the government intends to cut grants by 10 per cent next year and the year after, and make up the balance in loans. Mr Bryan Davies, Labour's higher education spokesman, said: 'If it had been pensioners who had been waiting weeks for their pension, the nation would have been in uproar.'</p>

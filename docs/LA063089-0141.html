			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> PRECOCIOUS PASTA GRILL LEAVES FORMULA BEHIND BUT HAS GROWING PAINS  </P> <P> Spaghettini, the swank Seal Beach grill and pasta house, celebrated its first  birthday last weekend. Like many babies, it gets by largely on beauty.  </P> <P> Its many dining rooms are large and airy, with high ceilings, terra-cotta  floors, handsomely dressed tables, ladder-back chairs and French country murals  on the walls. There is a library room with cabbage-green carpets and  crescent-shaped booths under shelves of ancient-looking books, so this baby can  grow up smart. And there is an open kitchen, complete with mesquite grill and a  brick, oak-burning pizza oven, so it won't have to be jealous of the other  kids' toys. And there is even an ultrachic bar, so it won't be lonely when it  is old enough to swing.  </P> <P> But right now, I would say the kitchen is having its share of growing pains. An  appetizer of fried mozzarella dipped in seasoned bread crumbs has almost no  character at all, dripping with an undeveloped tomato basil sauce. Green-lipped  New Zealand mussels are quite a bit better -- large and meaty with a chewy  bite, and can stand all by themselves. Too bad some doting chef props them up  with more of that tomato sauce. As for the steamed artichoke, expect one so  overcooked that it will taste like Pablum.  </P> <P> Luckily, babies are unpredictable. Even though the iceberg lettuce on the house  salad could be crisper, the dressing, a creamy Parmesan with celery seed, is  terrific. That makes up for the inclusion of a cherry tomato you couldn't spear  with a fork. And one of the house soups, cioppino, is another surprise,  chock-full of shrimp, crab and lusty chunks of snapper. A bowl of this and the  fine house bread makes an inexpensive light lunch.  </P> <P> Pizzas are full grown, though yeasty, with plenty of bounce and an aroma of  oak. The excellent sausage pizza (using wonderful sausage made by a local  company called Santa Fe) has plenty of grilled mushrooms and roasted peppers;  the shrimp pizza with virgin olive oil, herbs and provolone cheese makes me  want to bill and coo. Only a gooey sausage calzone, oozing ricotta and mushy  black olives, makes me cranky. The olives taste as if they come from a can.  </P> <P> All pasta at Spaghettini is made fresh daily -- but not necessarily cooked with  care. The pastas I ate at lunch were fine, served al dente with the proper  amount of sauce. But the ones I sampled at dinner were bland, overcooked and  drowning in sauce.  </P> <P> Chicken fettuccine with seasonal vegetables is about the best -- excellent  strips of mesquite-broiled chicken in a rich Alfredo sauce. And you can't go  far wrong with fusilli and vine-ripened tomatoes in a cheese sauce with fresh  basil.  </P> <P> But stay clear of linguine with whole clams: The clams were flavorless and came  sitting on top of a bowl of sticky glop. That goes double for half-moon ravioli  stuffed with lobster and ricotta cheese: The sauce is starchy, and the filling  tastes as if it was made by Gerber.  </P> <P> The entrees, however, are mature and impressive -- the best things to eat in  this restaurant. The meats are well grilled and seem to be first-quality.  </P> <P> A mixed grill -- paillard of chicken with fresh rosemary, that wonderful  sausage, and marinated, blackened shrimp -- comes with seasoned Swiss chard,  firm, tender asparagus and perfectly cooked buttered pieces of carrot.  </P> <P> A large, tender veal chop arrives perfectly blackened and fragrant with  rosemary and thyme.  </P> <P> Thick, juicy lamb chops, my personal favorite, are basted in extra virgin olive  oil with oregano and garlic and taste like something you might find in a  country house in Tuscany. Sliced, marinated sirloin steak is great too; the  marinade is one of the best I have ever tasted.  </P> <P> Naturally, there are sweets, which all babies love. Top recommendation here  would be Spaghettini mud pie, a wonderfully cloying, convoluted concoction with  a chocolate oatmeal crust and a praline almond ice cream filling, floating on a  pool of caramel sauce. Also worth hollering about is green apple strudel,  served warm with whipped cream.  </P> <P> For adults, there is something called an Italian kiss; it's made of Bailey's,  steamed milk and Frangelico and it is served in a brandy snifter. I'll have to  try that one when I grow up.  </P> <P> Spaghettini is moderately priced. Appetizers are $3.25 to $7.95. Salads and  homemade soups are $3.95 to $8.25. Brick-oven pizzas are $6.95 to $8.95. Pastas  are $10.25 to $14.50, including soup or salad. Entrees, which include soup or  salad and pasta, are $10.95 to $16.95. The good, reasonably priced wine list  has many excellent California selections.  </P> <P> SPAGHETTINI  </P> <P> 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, Seal Beach  </P> <P> (213) 596-2199  </P> <P> Open for lunch Monday to Friday 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Saturday to Sunday, noon  to 3:30 p.m.; dinner, 4:30 to 10 p.m., Saturday until 10:30 p.m. and Sunday  until 9:30 p.m.  </P> <P> All major cards accepted  </P></p>

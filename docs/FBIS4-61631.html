			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "May We Avoid Above All Else.... Fund </F> Dies Before Having Been Born"]    [Text] Yet another planned noose around the neck of this  country's media is unlikely to work. The idea for the creation  of a new structure in "support of the mass media" -- in addition  to all that already exist -- has very long been floating around  in the capital's political circles. Some time ago this idea  even added up to a specific draft law "On a National Fund in  Support of the Mass Media" whose elaboration was included in an  official plan for the State Duma committee for information  policy and liaison. The press went aflutter: the plan was for  the Fund to take over control of all the money that comes from  the budget (state subsidies) and the sprinkling of money that  does not come from the budget, and make its own decisions on who  gets it and who does not.    It goes without saying that the position of head of such a  fund would be the most coveted morsel for mass media officials,  because whoever took over this position would become Russia's  key monopolist -- he would be in a position to pull the strings  that control the "fourth estate" any old time and to issue  instructions on what and how should be published, on whether  there should be a lobby today for metallurgy workers or for  Gazprom. The draft law was supposed to go before the Duma  Council at the end of April for the inclusion of this matter on  the agenda. The Lord, however, has taken pity, and the draft  law was quietly laid to rest by the sensible part of the  deputies to the gushing joy of the scriveners. This is a  veritable gift to the Russian press for its professional holiday  -- Press Day-94.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL STUDY IS ACCEPTED  </P> <P> A study showing three options for year-round schools in Capistrano Unified  School District was accepted Monday by the board of trustees, although no  preferred plan was chosen.  </P> <P> By submitting the study to state officials before Jan. 1, the district  qualifies for extra money for school construction from next year's year-round  program budget, according to a report by Assistant Supt. William D. Eller.  </P> <P> His study used projected enrollment figures and classroom capacities to show  three ways that year-round schools could be set up.  </P> <P> One version divides students into four groups who would attend school for nine  weeks, then take three weeks off, rotating vacations so that one group is  always off.  </P> <P> A second option uses the same four groups, but the rotation changes every 12  weeks and students get a four-week vacation.  </P> <P> The third schedule is heralded in Eller's report as "the best space-saver of  current year-round calendars." Using three groups, students are required to  attend four out of six terms and take the remaining two terms as a vacation.  Each term is 43 days.  </P> <P> After the first group of students completes two terms, the second group starts  its session. The process is repeated for the third group, which starts after  the second group has completed two terms. By this time, the first group is on  vacation.  </P> <P> Eller's report said the last option is the cheapest because it would require  fewer portable classrooms. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Gatt tariff talks resume SENIOR trade officials from 40-50 countries will today try to nudge forward the negotiations on reductions in tariffs and other trade barriers in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. These negotiations, a key component of the overall liberalisation package, ground to a halt in March along with the rest of the Round following the failure of the US and the European Community to settle their differences over farm trade. This in turn has prevented the US and the EC from agreeing tariff cuts on farm and industrial goods between themselves, an accord which would set the pattern for the rest of the 108 countries taking part in the Round. Mutual concessions by the world's biggest traders have to be extended to all under the non-discriminatory 'most favoured nation' principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Smaller countries are impatient and frustrated by the transatlantic stalemate. They hope to press the US and EC to reveal enough about the likely outcome of their tariff negotiations to enable the country-by-country talks to recommence. However, US and EC trade officials say they do not expect much progress because neither side wants to 'assume' concessions that are still to be fought over. One official talked of 'sacred cows' which leaders remain unwilling to slaughter. For example, the EC is refusing to concede 'zero-for-zero' tariff deals in several industrial sectors until it has a commitment from Washington to cut high US tariffs on textiles. The US does not wish to make concessions on textile tariffs without some idea of what the EC offer on farm goods will eventually look like. Despite the pessimism, both sides have sent top-level officials to Geneva, including Mr Hugo Paeman, the EC's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Warren Lavorel, his US counterpart. They are expected to hold talks tomorrow with opposite numbers from Japan and Canada. Negotiations have also restarted in the Swiss city on commitments by individual Gatt members to liberalise trade in services, though officials said these were expected to be fairly technical and low-key.</p>

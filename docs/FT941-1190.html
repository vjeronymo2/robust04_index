			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Cinema visits down by 25% Cinema admissions in the last quarter of 1993 were 25.7 per cent below the figure in the third quarter, say Central Statistical Office figures, Raymond Snoddy writes. The fall comes against a background of rising cinema admissions in the UK. There were an estimated 22.6m admissions in the period and 1,625 screens were operating at 511 sites with average revenue per screen of Pounds 38,600. Estimates of cinema activity in the UK are calculated from the returns made by a small voluntary panel of contributors.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL PRICES HIGHER ON JITTERS ABOUT PANAMA PIPELINE  </P> <P> The price of oil jumped more than 50 cents a barrel Thursday on the possibility  that deliveries might be disrupted if Panama closes a pipeline that transports  Alaskan crude to refineries in the eastern United States.  </P> <P> Crude oil for delivery in June on the futures market jumped 54 cents to $20.06  a barrel after reaching an early high of $20.25. Alaska North Slope jumped 56  cents to $18.16 a barrel in the cash market where actual barrels are traded.  </P> <P> "There's always a possibility that (Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega could try to  shut down the pipeline," said Nauman Barakat, vice president at  Prudential-Bache Securities.  </P> <P> "If there is dislocation, there would be a tight supply, but I think the market  is getting ahead of itself," said Andrew Lebow of ED&amp;F Man International  Futures.  </P> <P> But other oil industry experts said it was unlikely that Panama's 81-mile  Petroterminale pipeline would be closed. "I don't think there's much  possibility that the line would be shut down," said Charles Ebinger, an analyst  with International Resources Group in Washington.  </P> <P> President Bush said Thursday that the United States will send a brigade-size  force to U.S. bases in Panama to augment military forces assigned there.  </P> <P> London shipping brokers said early Thursday that there was no evidence of ship  owners or charterers avoiding the Panama Canal.  </P> <P> Industry sources estimate that the pipeline generates revenue of about $100  million a year for the Panamanian government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pipeline Fees Frozen  </P> <P> A spokesman for Northville Industries of Long Island, N.Y., operator of the  pipeline, said pipeline fees were frozen in an account last year as part of a  package of U.S. economic sanctions put in place after Noriega seized power.  </P> <P> A federal judge in Boston froze the pipeline fees in March, 1988, but  Northville is permitted to continue paying its Panamanian employees.  </P> <P> President Bush said Thursday that economic sanctions would remain in force.  </P> <P> Louis James, director of energy services for AUS Consultants in Philadelphia,  said a Panamanian shutdown of the pipeline might trigger a wave of unrest among  workers.  </P> <P> If a shutdown should take place, Ebinger said, crude oil prices could jump an  additional $1.  </P> <P> "Assuming the worst, it would be a dramatic market response similar to Prince  William Sound," he said, referring to the March oil spill in Alaska that pushed  prices up.  </P> <P> But oil analysts said there are alternatives for moving the oil in the event  the pipeline is closed, such as increased traffic through the Panama Canal or  chartering very large vessels to ship the oil around South America.  </P> <P> Ann-Louise Hittle, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said specially  designed tankers holding up to 90,000 tons of oil could travel through the  canal and unload on the eastern side of Panama.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gasoline Prices Jump  </P> <P> She also estimated that there is 2.5 million barrels of storage capacity on  each side of the pipeline, which translates into supplies for roughly eight  days.  </P> <P> Oil traders said they expected the price of West Texas Intermediate, the main  domestic grade, to trade in the range of $19.50 and $20 once the excitement  about Panama dies down.  </P> <P> Gasoline prices jumped a hefty 2.56 cents a gallon to 67.28 cents, while  heating oil rose 1.20 cents to 48.68 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Traders said Environmental Protection Agency approval of clean-air regulations  that will make refining gasoline more expensive also pushed prices higher.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Antonia Vymazalova report: "Execution of Posts Under </F> Control"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava -- Yesterday's 11th meeting of the  government was chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac  because Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik is paying a state visit to  France. [passage omitted] The government approved a National  Council of the Slovak Republic bill on the issue of state bonds.  Its passage will make it possible to gain on the capital market  the necessary financial resources to cover the state budget  deficit on the Slovak Republic's state closing account for last  year. The state bonds should be issued by the Ministry of  Finance in a total amount of 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk].  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that, in view of the low  level of liquidity of Slovak commercial banks, the bonds would  not be issued all at once. A wide range of entities, from  individuals to bank consortiums, will have access to them.  [passage omitted]    The Ministry of Finance submitted to the government meeting  a  report on the use of budget resources in the second half of 1992  and in 1993. According to the report, individual government  departments last year drew Sk248 million and in 1993 Sk543  million without justification. The ministries, particularly the  Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs,  and the Family, used the resources to purchase computers and  passenger cars without preceding public tender. The relevant  government members were asked to draw conclusions from the  results of the inquiry within a month and to report about them  to the government.    Draft amendments to the law on the value-added tax, the law  on the administration of taxes and fees, and the law on changes  to the system of territorial financial authorities as amended by  subsequent regulations were added to the agenda of the  government meeting. The submitted draft amendment to the law on  the value-added tax changes the list of goods and services  subject to the pertinent rate of value-added tax. According to  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus, under the amendment, the  taxation of about 10 percent of goods that are currently subject  to a value-added tax of 6 percent will be raised to 25 percent.  The higher tax will not apply to any basic, vitally important  goods. [passage omitted]    [Bratislava SME in Slovak on 17 May on page 1 carries a  300-word interview with Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by Ivan  Stulajter entitled "Final Talks with IMF on Stand-By Loan Will  Be Held in a Few Days." In the interview, which was conducted  the day before the cabinet meeting, Filkus says that the planned  increase in the number of items that are subject to a  value-added tax of 25 percent, instead of 6 percent, should  generate extra budget revenue of "Sk3.5 to Sk4 billion."]</p>

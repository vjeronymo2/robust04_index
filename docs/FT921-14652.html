			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Stakis seeks to extend debt pact STAKIS, the UK hotels and health care group where a rescue is in progress under chairman Sir Lewis Robertson, is to negotiate with its bankers an extension of a standstill agreement on repayment of Pounds 192m debt. This follows its decision not to sell 19 casinos which it had hoped would raise Pounds 100m. Sir Lewis said it had not been possible to sell the casinos at an acceptable price and Stakis would keep them for their 'generally strong and dependable cash flow'. Stakis yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 47.4m for the year to September 30 after exceptional costs of Pounds 43.7m which were announced with the interim results in June. These involved a Pounds 32.2m write-down on property developments and other assets, and Pounds 11.5m of provisions for restructuring. In 1989/90, Stakis reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 30.6m including disposal profits of Pounds 18m. The results were in line with analysts' expectations. Stakis is paying a final dividend of 0.45p making a total for the year of 0.9p compared with 2.70p in 1990. Interest paid was Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 8.9m). Stakis embarked on a recovery programme last June after sacking Mr Andros Stakis, son of the company's founder Sir Reo Stakis, as chief executive. It decided to concentrate on hotels and nursing homes and withdraw from some leisure activities while planning a phased withdrawal from property. The company last month installed Mr David Michels, a former executive of Hilton International, as chief executive. It has raised Pounds 30m by selling its pubs, restaurants and pizza houses, bringing debt down from a peak of Pounds 215m at the end of September. The standstill agreement on repayment of Stakis's bank debt expires in March. Stakis wants to renegotiate it for a further year and Sir Lewis said that its main banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, had authorised him to say that they were sympathetic to the renewal. However, Stakis has debts to 21 banks, some of them overseas. Talks with the banks begin next week. Sir Lewis said gearing was 63 per cent and that it was 'far better for the banks to have a going concern than to enter into the uncertainties of receivership'. He said all divisions had made operating profits, except property which lost Pounds 1.1m. Sir Lewis added that Stakis had surmounted internal problems but because of the recession, the company's potential was unlikely to be realised 'on a useful scale' before the end of the current financial year.</p>

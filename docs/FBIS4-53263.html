			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The transplantation of  humus-pot maize seedlings has been stepped up in the rural  communities of Korea.    According to data available at the state agricultural  commission, 64.2 percent of humus-pot maize seedlings were  transplanted throughout the country as of May 13.    Humus-pot maize seedlings were transplanted in 90 percent of  the fields in South Hwanghae Province, 87.4 percent in Nampo  municipality and 86.6 percent in Kaesong municipality.    Cooperative farms in South Hwanghae Province are  transplanting more humus-pot maize seedlings than the daily plan  by giving precedence to ridging and other process precedent.    Cooperative farms in Nampo and Kaesong municipalities  transplanted humus-pot maize seedlings 1.2 times that in the  same period of last year, correctly ensuring the number of maize  plants per phyong (one phyong equals 6 feet square) and a total  number of maize plants.    Cooperative farms in mountainous areas of Chagang and  Yanggang Provinces transplanted humus-pot maize seedlings in  many fields in a few days.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE: NEW RULES ADD INCENTIVE FOR TAX-LOSS SELLING  </P> <P> Get ready for a heavier-than-normal year-end rush of investors selling stocks  and other assets to recognize losses for tax purposes, many experts say. Thanks  to the poor stock market and new tax rules, many individuals and institutions  have a greater incentive to engage in tax-loss selling this year.  </P> <P> Accordingly, if you have investment losers and want to take the losses,  consider selling now before the crowd drives down the value of your investment  even more.  </P> <P> Tax-loss selling is a good practice in any year if you have capital gains or  ordinary income to shelter. Tax laws allow you to use capital losses to reduce  capital gains dollar for dollar. If your capital losses exceed your gains, you  can use up to $3,000 of the losses to shelter ordinary income from wages. You  can carry forward any leftover capital losses to future years.  </P> <P> "If you have already taken some gains, and have losses in stocks that you are  not particularly satisfied with, sell those losers and take those losses now,"  advises William G. Brennan, partner with the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young  in Washington.  </P> <P> This selling -- along with further dumping by professional money managers  seeking to "dress up" their portfolios for year-end reports -- often drives  down stock prices in late November and December.  </P> <P> But thanks to this year's moribund stock and real estate markets, many more  investors are likely to be holding losers. That, plus the gloomy outlook for  many stocks and real estate, could prompt more year-end selling than usual.  </P> <P> "We're in a very weak market, so obviously more people have losses," says Kurt  Brouwer, president of Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, a San Francisco money  management firm. Stocks most vulnerable to a selloff, he says, include issues  that have already taken a heavy beating, such as banks, savings and loans,  insurance and brokerage firms, retailers, telephone and technology firms, and  small-company stocks in general.  </P> <P> New tax provisions enacted last week as part of the federal budget accord could  prompt even more investors to sell.  </P> <P> For example, if you're now in the 33% individual tax bracket -- the so-called  bubble -- you may want to sell losers. That's because your rate next year will  fall to 31% or less; thus, your losses are more valuable this year because they  will shelter capital gains or wages being taxed at a higher rate.  </P> <P> You may also want to sell winners if you are a very high income taxpayer now in  the 28% bracket. Because the budget accord phases out exemptions and reduces  deductions for wealthy taxpayers, you could end up paying a slightly higher  capital gains rate next year. So you might want to take gains this year,  particularly if you think those winners may turn into losers if you hold them  much longer.  </P> <P> Yet another group that may want to sell now includes those who wanted to sell  earlier but waited in hopes that Congress would lower capital gains rates.  Since that bid failed, those people may be inclined to sell now.  </P> <P> What should you do?  </P> <P> First, don't let taxes be your sole motivation for selling. The rise or fall in  price of a stock or other investment can easily outweigh any tax benefit.  Accordingly, base your decision primarily on your outlook for the investment.  </P> <P> "Now is a good time to ask yourself, would I buy this stock today at this  price?" Brouwer says. "If the answer is 'no,' you should sell it."  </P> <P> If you have mutual funds, you need not be as concerned about tax-loss selling,  Brouwer adds. That's because the fund's portfolio manager usually takes care of  selling losers in the portfolio to minimize your tax bite.  </P> <P> What if you have a loser but are optimistic that the stock may go up?  </P> <P> Consider selling it and then buying it back at least a month later. The "wash  sale" rule prohibits you from recognizing a capital loss on a security that you  sell and buy back within 30 days. But if you wait 31 days to buy back the same  stock, who knows? You might get it cheaper if tax-loss selling is rampant.  </P> <P> What if you have a winner but think it will become a dog?  </P> <P> You can delay taking the capital gain until next year -- when your tax rate  might be lower -- yet still lock in the profit now and protect yourself from  further losses. How? By a technique known as "selling short against the box."  Under this method, you sell borrowed securities -- what is called selling short  -- identical to the ones you own. Next year, you sell your original securities  to close out your short position.  </P> <P> If you have appreciated real estate or other non-publicly traded assets,  consider deferring the gain through an installment sale, suggests Sidney Kess,  an accountant and tax attorney in New York. This way you can spread your gain  over time.  </P> <P> In any event, if you have losses, "do it as soon as possible" to avoid the  year-end rush, suggests Adrian Moravcsik, financial consultant with Bailard  Biehl &amp; Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., financial planning firm. His firm's  clients have already taken their losses, he says.  </P> <P> But selling is not the only option. If you have appreciated assets, consider  donating them as a charitable contribution. This way you won't be liable for  the capital gains tax, and under most situations you can take a deduction for  the value of the property. (But don't do this if you have a loser. Instead,  sell it and donate the proceeds; that way you get to report the capital loss.)  </P> <P> Another option to reduce capital gains is to give appreciated assets to your  children, Brennan suggests. They can then sell the assets and be taxed at their  presumably lower rate.  </P> <P> Finally, don't just think in terms of selling. Price declines resulting from  mass year-end dumping could result in good buying opportunities, Brouwer says.  </P> <P> "If you see a company or mutual fund you are following pushed down, this is  going to be a good time to take some positions," he says.  </P></p>

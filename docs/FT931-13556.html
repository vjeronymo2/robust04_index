			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Union official to appeal over suspension A POWER struggle over strategy and political direction is threatening the stability of Britain's fifth largest union - the 600,000-strong Manufacturing Science and Finance Union. The increasingly bitter wrangling could today lead to the dismissal of Mr Jack Carr, the union's assistant general secretary. He was suspended just before Christmas by Mr Roger Lyons, the union's general secretary, who accused him of 'gross misconduct' in the handling of the union's finances. Mr Carr is appealing against the decision today before a panel of the union's executive. If he loses he faces dismissal as a full-time official after 18 years of service. Yesterday Mr Carr said he would take his case 'all the way' to defend his 'credibility and reputation'. He said Mr Lyons had started 'a political cleansing of the union' and that other officials were facing discrimination. Although Mr Lyons is careful to make it clear that Mr Carr is not guilty of any personal dishonesty, he says that the assistant general secretary dispensed with an estimated Pounds 300,000 of the union's money to retiring officials without telling the executive. The most serious case involves the union's former general secretary, Mr Ken Gill, who left with a retirement package worth about Pounds 200,000. When the matter came to light, Mr Gill agreed to a Pounds 60,000 reduction in the value of his retirement terms. Mr Carr would not go into the details of his case yesterday pending the appeal hearing, but the row is only part of a much wider conflict that has been in existence since the MSF came into being five years ago after the merger of ASTMS, the white-collar conglomerate created by Mr Clive Jenkins, and TASS, the technical and administrative workers union, with a strong presence in white-collar engineering. The battle for domination in the union is between two cultures. ASTMS was a loose-limbed, almost anarchically run union with a stylish populist approach that worked well in the boom years of the 1960s and 1970s but less so in the recession. TASS was more businesslike, disciplined and centralised, run by a cadre of tough-minded professionals grounded in the ideology of the class war. The predominantly ASTMS faction - under the banner 'MSF for Labour' - says it wants to rescue the union from what it sees as a Leninist legacy of bureaucratic centralism. Mr Lyons, a former ASTMS official, wants to take MSF into a mainstream trade union position and free it from 'unreconstructed Stalinists'. He denies strongly that there is any political motive in his action against Mr Carr. But Unity Left, the TASS-dominated grouping in the union, has accused Mr Lyons and his allies of launching a witch-hunt against their ideological enemies.</p>

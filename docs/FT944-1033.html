			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Montague throws in towel to end bankruptcy battle Mr Robert Montague finally conceded defeat yesterday in his attempt to stave off bankruptcy, resigning as chief executive of Tiphook, the trailer rental company he founded 16 years ago. The Pounds 2.5m bankruptcy writ being brought by the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be opposed by Mr Montague's solicitors when it is heard this morning at Oxford county court. Mr Montague had been trying to reach an agreement with his creditors - to whom he is said to owe more than Pounds 35m - following the bank's writ in September. However, negotiations broke down, prompting Barclays Bank last week to issue its own writ on the estimated Pounds 9m it is owed. Barclays is also thought to have appointed its own re-ceivers, to look after the affairs of Mr Montague's Oxfordshire estate. His bankruptcy would have disqualified him from sitting on the board of Tiphook, which earlier this year almost collapsed under the weight of its debts. Last week it renamed itself Central Transport Rental Group as part of its reconstruction. Mr Ian Clubb, the chairman, will take over Mr Montague's responsibil-ities. Mr Montague will receive no compensation from CTR. His 4.5m share options will be cancelled. Only 2m of these could have been exercised. However, he will receive a previously agreed payment of Pounds 250,000, due to be paid in September 1995, as part of the sale of Tiphook's container operations in January to Transamerica. The flamboyant Mr Montague, 46 - famous for his extravagant braces and suave appearance - was one of the most successful businessmen of the 1980s. His success in building Tiphook from scratch into the second largest container group in the world earned him a CBE in 1990 and a large following among institutional investors. However, he borrowed heavily against his share holding in Tiphook to take up his rights in a number of the company's issues in the late 1980s. When the Tiphook share price collapsed, Mr Montague was left with his own huge debts. Mr Montague's lavish lifestyle, including a Pounds 7m yacht and an Pounds 8m estate in Oxfordshire, added to the problems. He was also criticised for the large salaries commanded by some Tiphook directors.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / French budget seeks to stave off pressure against franc THE French government yesterday tabled a compromise budget for 1993, seeking to stave off pressure on the franc, while offering limited tax breaks before next March's legislative elections. The budget, agreed by the cabinet yesterday morning, proposes a fractional real rise in public spending and a smaller deficit than the markets had expected. Paris plans to lift government spending by 3.4 per cent to FFr1,367bn (Pounds 156.76bn) next year, as against a stable inflation rate of 2.8 per cent, making this the third year running in which the state has held expenditure barely ahead of inflation. Tax receipts are expected to fall, leading to a steep rise in the budget deficit. The shortfall is forecast to reach a record FFr165bn, which would represent 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, based on the government's forecast that the economy will grow by 2.6 per cent in 1993, up from the 2.1 per cent forecast for this year. 'It's a good budget, a coherent budget that recognises our priorities,' said Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister. Next year's deficit would still be just below the 3 per cent GDP target for budget deficits set by the Maastricht treaty as a criterion for monetary union. Economists fear the 1993 deficit could easily turn out larger than the government expects, on the grounds that the interest rate increase provoked by the recent currency crisis could make its growth forecast unattainable. France's budget deficit has overshot in each of the past two years, because receipts from value added tax and corporate taxation, representing 58 per cent of the government's income, have been eaten away by the economic slowdown. The current year's deficit is expected to be well over FFr135bn, as against the FFr89.6bn on which the 1992 budget was originally based. The education ministry, by far the biggest spender, is to get a 7.2 per cent increase in allocations to FFr281bn, which will enable it to take on an extra 10,000 staff. Yesterday's tax breaks are worth FFr4.5bn in a full year and include income tax reductions for parents of school-age children, incentives for buyers of cars fitted with catalytic converters and confirmation of a small reduction in corporation tax - from 34 per cent to 33.33 per cent - announced last spring. The budget will go to the national assembly for approval in mid-October, where it will be the subject of a no-confidence vote against the weakened government. Conservative opposition parties say the budget does not do enough to stimulate the flagging economy. The government survived the last censure motion, on farm policy reform in June, by just three votes. But since then, four Socialists MPS have moved to the senate, the upper house.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Mohamed Farah Aidid, chairman of the Somali  National Alliance [SNA] and the United Somali Congress [USC],  congratulated the Somali people, particularly SNA supporters, on  the occasion of the 26 January anniversary and the successive  victories scored by the people in achieving their aim based on  justice and coexistence. The SNA chairman began his speech by  saying that 26 January is the third anniversary of the toppling  of the dictatorial regime that misruled the Somali people for  over 21 years. He said it is an occasion that the Somali people  should mark and celebrate fully.    Mohamed Farah Aidid also took the opportunity to  congratulate, with great confidence, fighters, heads of social  organizations, all strugglers and SNA supporters wherever they  may be, as well as other organizations which participated in the  political and armed struggle. [passage omitted]    He said the struggle had brought about peace, justice,  unity,  progress, democracy, fraternity, respect for the Islamic  religion, equality, and a revival of the Somali people's  culture, customs, and history. [passage omitted]    Most noteworthy, Chairman Aidid said, are the victories  achieved in the defense of the Somali people, spearheaded by SNA  leaders, fighters, women, elders, youth organizations,  intellectuals and politicians, as well as the Alliance's  supporters. He added that in the defense struggle, the  unprovoked UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] attacks against the  Somali people have been countered.    He said UNOSOM-II's aim was colonialism, the massacre of  people, and the destruction of private and national assets. The  colonialists employed the most highly sophisticated weapons, be  they on the ground or air, and an estimated 13,000 people,  including children, women, and the elderly, were killed over a  five month period and twice that number were injured. Apart  from the deaths and injuries, private and national assets were  destroyed. And although assessment is being carried out to  determine the extent of destruction of these assets, the losses  have run into the millions of dollars.    Aidid said the world was surprised and still is surprised at  how UNOSOM turned its humanitarian program into the aforesaid  activities. The world is of the opinion that the Somali  people's dignity, independence, and nationhood have been  disregarded. As the Somali people responded to the aggression,  a lot of comments were made, and the strugglers who defended  Somali dignity and nationhood were recognized as heroes who  became the symbols and defenders of human rights, peace, and  international progress.    The Somali people within and outside the country are united  in the claim that the SNA strugglers are the only people who  defended the Somali people's honor and nationhood and brought  home tangible victory. All the leaders of the countries of the  world and their peoples share the SNA's view. The SNA's  reputation is very high, and therefore it always deserves full  commemoration on every occasion. Somalia is also defending the  dignity and independence of Third World countries and those who  believe in peace and progress. Aidid said UNOSOM should  compensate the Somali people for the destruction of property and  life as such steps could heal wounds and promote peace and  reestablishment of cordial relations between the inflicters of  the damage and the victims.    We call on all Somali people, Mohamed Farah Aidid said, to  learn from the problems brought upon them and the misrule by the  successor regime ever since they attained independence. It is  imperative for the Somali people to attain unity, peace, and  progress and to build a new Somalia where stability and respect  for each other's rights, cooperation and brotherhood and  consultation are practiced. He called on the Somali people to  forget their differences and instead turn to the only way, that  of defending their dignity and newly written history which is in  their favor. Aidid said we should remember the strugglers of  various ages who died bravely in the defense of Somali dignity  and sovereignty. [passage omitted]    Aidid said the Somali people should assist the injured,  orphaned, and refugees, wherever they may be. Aidid said we are  obliged to thank those governments and international  organizations who provided the Somali people with humanitarian  aid during the worst times when the Somali people were faced  with hunger and starvation. He said we have expressed our  profound gratitude to the neighboring governments that welcomed  and hosted Somali refugees, and we would like to tell these  governments that we will reciprocate in a similar way.</p>

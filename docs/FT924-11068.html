			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Letter: Say nothing - get elected Sir, It has long been clear that a US presidential candidate needs to be white, male and a millionaire. This year's campaign seems to have added a new entry criterion - the candidate not telling anyone what his policies will be if elected. Mr Perot's recent position in the polls suggests this is positively beneficial. Does this mean voters have decided that nothing the president does will make any difference to their economic well-being?

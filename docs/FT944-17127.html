			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: IBM in bid to reclaim PC leadership with 'Warp' With the launch tomorrow of 'OS/2 Warp' a personal computer operating system program, IBM begins a concerted effort to reclaim technology leadership in the PC industry. Warp is a direct challenge to Microsoft Windows, the software that comes with virtually every PC sold today, except the Apple Macintosh. At public events throughout North America and Europe, IBM executives will tout the advantages of Warp. Several leading PC manufacturers, including Compaq Computer, Dell Computer and Toshiba as well as IBM's own PC division, are expected to participate in the presentations, promising to offer Warp as an alternative to Windows. Warp is, however, just one part of IBM's strategy to reclaim its PC leadership. Another critical element of the plan is to establish a new hardware standard for PCs based on the PowerPC microprocessor, jointly developed by IBM, Motorola and Apple Computer. IBM is believed to be in intensive negotiations with Apple aimed at agreeing on a standard design for PowerPC computers that will run both Apple's Macintosh software and IBM's OS/2 Warp. Talks between the two companies have been held, on and off, for several months, but are now a 'high priority'. Rumours that an agreement may be close and that it could be cemented by an IBM equity investment in Apple fuelled a sharp rise in IBM's shares on Friday to Dollars 71 1/8 from Dollars 68 3/4 . If the companies can agree on a design for a PC that can run both Macintosh software and OS/2 Warp it could pose a significant challenge to today's PC standard based on Intel microprocessor chips and Microsoft Windows software. Talk of an IBM investment in Apple follows a week of intense rumours of Apple takeover bids by either Motorola, the communications and semiconductor group, or AT&amp;T, the telecommunications giant. While the earlier rumours have been dismissed by most industry analysts, the possibility of IBM taking a stake in Apple rings true because IBM has a keen interest in persuading Apple to help it to establish a new PC industry standard. Of more immediate concern to IBM, however, is the runaway success of its latest standard PC products. The Aptiva line of IBM PCs for consumers and small businesses is a sell-out. Just three weeks after introduction, Aptiva orders have overtaken IBM's planned production for the fourth quarter.</p>

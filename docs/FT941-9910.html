			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts hit by jitters as traders await auction announcement UK government bonds and futures traded nervously yesterday as traders took bets on whether the Bank of England would announce a February gilts auction today. The March long gilt future rose as high as 116 1/4 before dropping back to close at 115 5/8 , down  9/32 on the day. Some dealers believed that the market's weakness since the base rate cut earlier this week would discourage the Bank from issuing more paper, especially since it had almost completed its funding programme for the current 1993-1994 year. But others decided that the Bank would announce an auction of short-dated gilts today in order to make inroads into next year's funding programme and to be seen to be consistent with its auctions. They expected the Bank to re-open the benchmark 6 per cent gilts due 1999 by about Pounds 2.5bn. The closing yield on these gilts was 6 per cent. German government bunds and futures ended little changed after a volatile day's trading. The March bund future traded between a high of 99.36 and a low of 98.84 before ending at 99.12, down 0.08 on the day. Analysts said the market continued to dwell on the timing of an interest rate cut by the Bundesbank. Mr Kit Juckes at S. G. Warburg said that an interest rate cut could come as early as next week now that the D-Mark was firmer and there had been some pay settlements with the IG Metall engineering union. However, Mr Neil Williams at Daiwa Europe said he did not expect the Bundesbank to move on interest rates until the end of March and that the market would remain under a cloud until then. Italian government bonds started to suffer a little after their recent strong performance. But traders put the weakness down to a temporary correction. The March future ended at 118.09 down 0.41 point on the day and in the middle of the day's trading range of 117.88 to 118.65. Meanwhile, Banca Commerciale Italiana said in a report that it expected the Italian treasury to issue a net L127,700bn of paper this year which should contribute to containing the budget deficit at L150,800bn, slightly below 1993's L153,000bn but still above government targets of L144,200bn. French government bonds came off the day's highs in disappointment that the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.20 per cent at yesterday's securities repurchase tender. The March notional future ended up 0.22 point at 128.98, off the day's best level of 129.16. Japanese government bond futures closed slightly easier in light trading as dealers squared their positions ahead of today's public holiday. The March futures contract ended at 114.53 in Tokyo, up from a previous day's close of 114.66, and traded around 114.50 in London. Mr James Greener, analyst at Tokyo Trust International, noted that JGBs rose on the week for the first time in a month and broke above an important chart resistance point. He added that the ministry of finance's funding plan for the next year was well received by the market and appeared to calmed some fears of rampant over-supply. US bond prices retreated after the Treasury's 30-year debt auction yesterday, as traders prepared for tomorrow's data on producer prices and retail sales. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at 97 17/32 , with the yield rising to 6.433 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was down 3/32 at 99 5/16, to yield 4.435 per cent. In early activity, prices ebbed as the market awaited the outcome of the final leg of the Treasury's Dollars 40bn quarterly refunding programme. News of a decline of 47,000 in weekly claims for unemployment benefit had no impact on sentiment. In the afternoon, the auction of Dollars 11bn in 30-year securities, the first new issue in six months, proved a success. The bonds were awarded an average yield of 6.43 per cent, in line with expectations. Afterwards, prices dropped further as attention turned to tomorrow's figures on producer prices and retail sales in January. The data will provide a clue to the timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to boost short-term interest rates. Analysts said the market had already priced in an unfavourable PPI reading, but was counting on a soft reading on consumer purchases.</p>

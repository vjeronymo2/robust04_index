			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG ONE;  </P> <P> WORSE THAN SAN ANDREAS  </P> <P> Mention earthquakes and Orange County residents look to the notorious San  Andreas Fault, 30 miles northeast of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Yet  experts say a greater danger lies underfoot the Newport-Inglewood Fault slicing  north along the Orange County coast from Newport Beach. It has already provided  the worst urban quake in Southern California history -- the 1933 Long Beach  Earthquake that killed 120 people and caused $40 million damage. Yet that  6.3-magnitude jolt was not the worst this fault can deliver. Geologists believe  a quake of at least magnitude 7 is possible -- and that would cause more death  and destruction than an even greater quake along the San Andreas. Based on  interviews with experts and a scenario recently published by the state, here is  what Orange County would be like if a 7.3-magnitude quake struck at 7:41 on a  typical Monday morning.  </P> <P> * A major water line snaps near Fullerton Creek in Buena Park  </P> <P> * El Toro Marine Corps Air Station closes for 6 hours, but an inspection of  runways finds no serious damage because the facility is inland and not subject  to significant ground settlement  </P> <P> * John Wayne Airport sustains damage to the runway, fuel tanks and other  structures. Closed for 24 hours, it reopens after repairs are made at the  northeast end of its runway. But surrounding freeway damage makes it difficult  to passengers to reach the terminal  </P> <P> * Sewage plant in Fountain Valley, one of two serving 80% of the county's  2.1-million residents is severely damaged and likely to remain that way for  weeks or months. Raw sewage overflows into streets and the ocean  </P> <P> * The Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center -- an emergency earthquake  operations post -- sustains significant damage to runways, fuel tanks and  structures. Closed for 24 hours, it reopens for landings of C-130 cargo planes  bearing relief supplies  </P> <P> * Alamitos power plant is shut down for more than 3 days  </P> <P> * Haynes power plant is shut down for more than 3 days  </P> <P> * A major natural gas line to the Huntington Beach power plant ruptures east of  Bolsa Chica Beach State Park  </P> <P> * Huntington Beach power plant is shut down for more than 3 days  </P> <P> * Sewage plant in Huntington Beach, one of two serving 80% of the county's  2.1-million residents is severely damaged and likely to remain that way for  weeks or months. Raw sewage overflows into streets and the ocean  </P> <P> * San Onofre nuclear power plant, 5 miles south of San Clemente, is undamaged  </P> <P> * Storage tanks in Seal Beach are damaged and spill fuel into Alamitos Bay  </P> <P> * Water Supply  </P> <P> Water lines and pumping stations near the fault are damaged, forcing coastal  cities to rely on local storage facilities and tank trucks for drinking water  </P> <P> * Natural Gas  </P> <P> Thousands of underground natural gas connections are leaking and many have been  ignited  </P> <P> Phones  </P> <P> Throughout the region, telephone switching equipment is overloaded and  automatically shuts down a few minutes after the quake. Within 25 miles of the  fault, phone lines designated for essential services are 25% usable after the  first day, 50% usable after the second day and 75% usable at the end of the  third day. The restoration of phone service to the public will be significantly  slower  </P> <P> 'Strike-slip' Fault  </P> <P> * Earthquakes along the Newport-Inglewood and San Andreas fault occur when  earth on either side of the fault line lurches horizontally in opposite  directions. In contrast to the "strike-slip" fault, a "thrust" fault -- such as  the one that caused the 1971 Sylmar-San Fernando quake -- has one sides that  moves vertically up or down against the other  </P> <P> Richter Scale  </P> <P> In 1935, former Caltech professor Charles F. Richter devised a logarithmic  scale that grades the severity of earthquakes. Each whole number on the scale  indicates a quake that is 10-times greater than the number before. A magnitude  of 5.0, for example, would be 10-times a 4.0, but 100-times a 3.0. The atomic  bomb dropped on Hiroshima -- about 20,000 tons of TNT -- would amount to a 6.3  earthquake. So the 7.3-magnitude quake in the Newport-Inglewood scenario would  exert 10-times the force  </P> <P> 8.3 San Francisco 1908  </P> <P> 8.1 Mexico City 1985  </P> <P> 7.7 Kern County 1952  </P> <P> 7.3 Scenario Quake  </P> <P> 7.0 Eureka 1980  </P> <P> 6.7 Coalinga 1983  </P> <P> 6.6 Imperial Valley 1979  </P> <P> 6.4 San Fernando 1971  </P> <P> 6.3 Santa Barbara 1925  </P> <P> 6.3 Long Beach 1933  </P> <P> 5.9 Whittier Narrows 1987  </P> <P> Hospitals  </P> <P> Hospitals nearest the fault zone lose the use of 50% of their beds due to loss  of power and equipment failures.

Considerable damage has closed all 10 lanes through  Westminster, Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, Costa Mesa and Irvine to just  beyond Jamboree Road. Some parts are expected to remain so for 3 days, but the  stretch in Costa Mesa and Irvine will be closed indefinately  </P> <P> * MacArthur Boulevard is closed on both sides of San Diego Creek, near the UC  Irvine campus, and is expected to remain so for 3 days  </P> <P> * Pacific Coast Highway is closed from Seal Beach to Corona del Mar and is  expected to remain so for 3 days  </P> <P> * Costa Mesa Freeway is severely damaged at the Pacific Coast Highway  interchange and no traffic is expected to use it for 3 days. The freeway is  partly open from there to the San Diego Freeway, but the remaining stretch to  the Santa Ana Freeway is closed due to heavy bridge and interchange damage and  is expected to remain so for 3 days  </P> <P> * Garden Grove Freeway is damaged at interchanges with the San Diego Freeway,  where traffic will be blocked for 36 hours, and Beach Boulevard, where traffic  will be blocked for more than 3 days. In Garden Grove, there is light damage at  the freeway's interchange with Harbor Boulevard. But major ground failures  along the freeway are expected to block traffic for at least 2 days  </P> <P> * Santa Ana Freeway is open but has localized damage from Buena Park to San  Juan Capistrano  </P> <P> * Artesia/Riverside Freeway is open but has localized damaged from Buean Park  to Yorba Linda  </P> <P> * Orange Freeway is open but has localized damage from Brea to the Santa Ana  Freeway  </P> <P> * Beach Boulevard is open but has localized damage from Buena Park to Garden  Grove. It is partly closed from the Garden Grove Freeway to the San Diego  Freeway and around Pacific Coast Highway  </P> <P> A Closer Look  </P> <P> Geologists say the width of the Newport-Inglewood Fault line varies and much of  it lies beneath the surface  </P> <P> Source: Planning Scenario For A Major Earthquake On The Newport-Inglewood Fault  Zone, California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology,  1988  </P></p>

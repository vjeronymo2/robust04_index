			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Marginal impact on new investment - Capital allowances BY RAISING capital allowances on new investment in plant machinery and buildings, the chancellor has made new investment marginally more attractive. But the Treasury's growth forecasts suggest this incentive will have no more than a marginal effect on investment. The statement introduces a 40 per cent first-year allowance for expenditure on machinery and plant incurred by businesses in the 12 months ending October 31 next year, rather than 25 per cent as at present, and a 20 per cent allowance on new buildings. Companies will use the allowances to write off more of the cost of investment against their corporate tax liability in the year in which the investment is made. The balance of expenditure will continue to be written down in subsequent years at 25 per cent a year. The measure will cost Pounds 200m in 1993-94 and Pounds 500m in 1994-95. But while the Treasury expects total fixed investment to grow by  1/4 per cent next year, business investment is expected to remain stagnant. The rise in total investment is accounted for by a projected 1 per cent rise in private dwellings investment and a 1 3/4 per cent increase in public investment, neither of which is affected. The corporate tax change effectively reverses, for a limited period, a central element of the 1984 change in corporation taxes, piloted through by the then chancellor Mr Nigel Lawson. The increase in allowances, in effect, rebalances the taxes that companies pay on new investments by giving greater relief in the year in which the investment is carried out. The problem with raising allowances, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, is that it is an expensive way of generating what tends to be a small amount of activity. Investment which would have occurred anyway qualifies for the extra relief as well as any new investment the relief generates. If investment is discouraged by depressed consumer demand, marginal tax changes tend to make little difference to investment volume. The Labour party proposed an almost identical change in allowances for new investment in its election manifesto. The Labour party estimated its increase in allowances would cost Pounds 600m in the first year, assuming a larger investment response.</p>

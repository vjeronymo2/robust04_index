			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ARAB ARTISANS CREATE DAZZLING MOSAICS  </P> <P> Essa Bitar deftly shuffled a bundle of multicolored slivers of wood in his  fingers and displayed a star-shaped design at its tip, a building block for a  modern craft rooted in centuries of Arabic tradition.  </P> <P> The intricate mosaic veneers made by artists such as Bitar for the past century  have become some of the most famed handicrafts in this ancient city that is  celebrated for its many arts.  </P> <P> Tiny bits of wood and plastic or bone form swirls and stars that dance in  arabesques with tiny checkerboards, crosses and triangles atop tables and  chairs, on jewel boxes, picture frames, clocks and game boards.  </P> <P> In the stalls that overspill into the twisting alleys of Damascus' medieval  marketplace, a few dollars will buy a flashy gift box adorned with little star  patterns, intricate but easily made and with as much plastic as wood.  </P> <P> Well over $1,000 might be asked for an antique chair rich in delicate,  interwoven lines of bone and rare woods, and spangled with mother-of-pearl  inlay.  </P> <P> Bitar and others say the craft originated about 1890 when a carpenter named  George Bitar was pondering the ornamental inlaid stonework that has been a  feature of Islamic and Arabic architecture for more than 1,000 years.  </P> <P> "He thought why didn't he try it on wood?" said Bitar, who is only distantly  related to the craft's founder.  </P> <P> Today, several thousand craftsmen turn out the mosaics, which seem ubiquitous  in the Syrian capital, often in offices and homes as well as in tourist shops.  </P> <P> The craftsmen use woods of different colors to form their designs: yellow lemon  wood, green from the pistachio tree, red from rosewood, browns from apricot and  walnut. White, which once came from cow and camel bones, is now more often  plastic.  </P> <P> The woods are cut into long, angular pieces sometimes thinner than a match  stick, then glued together in bundles or blocks to form designs.  </P> <P> When a block has dried and hardened, it may be glued to others to form a larger  pattern. Thin pieces are shaved off this mother chunk and inlaid alongside  others on the furniture or box, with some pieces applied individually.  </P> <P> Cheaper pieces today are almost mass-produced, with entire surfaces covered  with slices from one or two mother blocks. Finer work tends to have less  plastic, more intricate patterns and greater hand inlay.  </P> <P> Multiple strips of wood may line the mosaics and twist off into arabesques of  their own, often complemented by individually set pieces of mother-of-pearl.  </P> <P> Many Damascus artisans also practice the older craft of inlaying  mother-of-pearl and ivory, products which are often more costly than mosaic  work because of their ingredients.  </P> <P> "Look at these lines," said Bishara Awad, pointing to the entwined bands of  mosaic inlay dotted with mother-of-pearl decorating an antique picture frame on  the wall of the 124-year-old S. G. Nassan handicrafts factory.  </P> <P> "There aren't more than three or four people now who are making these designs."  Awad has worked at Nassan's for 35 years.  </P> <P> The very term arabesque (a decorative design scheme) for entwined floral or  geometrical designs shows how closely that style has been identified with the  Arab world.  </P> <P> Mosaic and inlay are also rooted in the centuries. The 200-year-old Azem Palace  in Damascus' old city displays stonework patterns on fountains and walls that  are echoed in the designs on wooden boxes in tourist shops nearby.  </P> <P> The Christian Byzantine Empire that ruled the region before Islam's conquest in  the 7th Century left a legacy of intricate stone mosaics, often illustrating  Bible stories, on floors throughout the Middle East.  </P> <P> And the National Museum holds an inlaid ivory panel carved some 4,000 years ago  by a craftsman in Mari, in present-day Syria 260 miles east of Damascus.  </P></p>

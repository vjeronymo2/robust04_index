			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Abrams claims victory over Ferraro MR Robert Abrams, attorney-general for New York state, yesterday claimed a razor-thin win over Ms Geraldine Ferraro, former vice-presidential candidate, in the hotly contested primary battle to become the Democratic candidate for the New York Senate seat at stake in November. Ms Ferraro, who was on the receiving end of a vitriolic television advertising campaign in which Mr Abrams accused her of numerous ethics violations, was refusing yesterday to concede defeat. With 99 per cent of precincts having reported, Mr Abrams had 410,402 votes (37 per cent), while Ms Ferraro had 399,410 votes (36 per cent). Two other candidates split the rest. Ms Ferraro, although clearly disheartened after she had spent millions of dollars on the contest, argued that she might yet win when absentee votes were counted. The Democratic victor will run against Senator Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a right-wing Republican who has himself been the target of ethics probes and has been rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee. Mr Abrams, a liberal, has argued that he is better placed than Ms Ferraro to challenge the senator over ethics. In a primary for a Manhattan seat in the House of Representatives, Democrats elected the late Mr Ted Weiss, although the liberal incumbent had died on Monday. Now Democratic party leaders will select a candidate to contest the November election.</p>

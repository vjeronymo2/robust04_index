			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUTERS' RESISTANCE TO CAR POOLING  </P> <P> During my daily commute, El Toro to Hawthorne, I observe sedans from various  cities, Caltrans, area transit districts, the air quality district and unknown  agencies bearing government plates. Most of them have the common denominator of  a single occupant except for the few vans labeled as van pools.  </P> <P> These cars are not only under-utilized, but they are subsidized by taxpayers  providing free transportation to a government employee for his daily commute. A  very nice tax-free addition to their income.  </P> <P> I will consider the ride-share program as a serious attempt to alleviate  traffic when cities and other agencies have 100% participation and no employee  is allowed to commute in a government-owned vehicle other than a van pool.  </P> <P> These agencies all have the same philosophy. We'll make rules that won't affect  me and thee but will make it rough for the guy behind the tree (the beat-up  taxpayer).  </P> <P> Let these people stop their preaching and have them participate like the rest  of us are expected to do.  </P> <P> VERNON L. BUSH, El Toro  </P></p>

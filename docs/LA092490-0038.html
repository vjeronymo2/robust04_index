			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: CASTING -- EQUITY STYLE -- IN THE YEAR 1999  </P> <P> The following is not yet reality, but a dark Orwellian dream of the future,  though the syntax exactly matches a story in The Times detailing a suit against  the City of Alhambra for "biased hiring." I marched with Dr. King. I saw his  dream distorted to quotas. As Orwell put it in "Animal Farm," "All animals are  equal, but some animals are more equal than others." I fear this is the future  of the American theater. God help us all.  </P> <P>  Actors' Equity filed charges today against Gordon Davidson and the Los Angeles  Center Theatre Group for casting discrimination against minorities. The action  was taken after Davidson declined Equity's recommendations to revamp his  casting practices to expand casting of blacks, Latinos and Asians, particularly  in leading roles.  </P> <P> Equity's casting committee stated that, though Davidson had cast a black actor,  Reuben Mantellan, as Othello (an Equity-designated black role) in his  forthcoming production of the play, he had engaged an Arab actor as a standby  for the part. "The title of the play is 'Othello, the Moor of Venice,' "  Davidson said. "The role has often been played as an Arab. Reuben is my choice  for the part, but I have to have someone ready in case he gets sick!" The  casting committee also expressed regret that Davidson had included in the  program a photograph of Laurence Olivier, a Caucasian actor who played the part  half a century ago, in blackface.  </P> <P> Davidson is not liable for criminal charges, since Equity's casting guidelines  are not yet federal law, though Sandra Good, spokesperson for Actors' Equity's  Casting Committee, affirmed that it was Equity's intent to include them in the  omnibus bill now in the Congress expanding National Endowment for the Arts  guidelines on artistic content. "Why limit legislation merely to subsidized  art?" she said. "Minority actors deserve protected casting at every level of  the commercial theater as well. This is top priority."  </P> <P> Equity's casting committee has further mandated that one of its members sit in  on every audition Davidson conducts in the future, and also in any private  meetings discussing casting. "Mr. Davidson is the most important  producer/director in Los Angeles," Good said. "He has to recognize that his  casts must reflect the ethnic mix, not only in California, but in Equity. Quota  casting is the new reality." Davidson was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> See letters to Counterpunch, F4.  </P></p>

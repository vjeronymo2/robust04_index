			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Information agency reports from Kuybyshev, Yekaterinburg, </F> Samara, and Krasnodar: "Elections Postponed in Kuybyshev,  Sverdlovsk, and Chelyabinsk Oblasts and Krasnodar Kray. Why?"]    [Text]Information concerning this was transmitted by  information agencies. One reason was indicated: A complicated  socioeconomic situation in the regions. We asked our  correspondents to report to the readers whether this were really  the case. This is what they report.  <H5>  Yekaterinburg </H5>   Report by Vladimir Stakheyev: "The Reasons for the Delay Are  Purely Technical"    "The postponement of the date of the elections to the oblast  duma and local self-government organs of the Urals is by no  means explained by the socioeconomic situation," our  correspondent was told by Natalya Ponomareva, the press  secretary of the head of administration of Sverdlovsk Oblast.    As is known, E. Rossel, the former head of administration,  was dismissed from the position by an edict of the president of  Russia of 9 November 1993. The very same edict temporarily  entrusted his duties to V. Trushnikov, the chairman of the  oblast government.    It is natural that out of ethical and other quite  understandable reasons, the acting head of administration did  not begin to sign such an important document as a statute  (albeit a provisional one) concerning the oblast duma and organs  of self-government, and also concerning elections to these  organs of authority.    With the appointment of A. Strakhov as head of  administration, the documents were signed and already published  in January. Elections in the Middle Urals, according to the  provisional statute, will be held within 72 days after the  publication of these documents; that is, on 10 April 1994. So  the postponement of the date of the elections in the kray to a  later date is not associated with any other reasons.  <H5>  Samara </H5>   Report by V. Mikhaylov: "Ready for Elections on the Volga"    Did the administration of Samara Oblast appeal to the  president of the Russian Federation for a delay in the time of  conducting elections to local representative organs of  authority? I asked this question of many officials of the oblast  administration, and all of them, as if they had come to an  agreement, answered "No."    After breaking through a consultative palisade, I got into  contact with Vladimir Mokryy, the deputy head of the oblast  administration and manager of the staff.    "It never even crossed our minds," he said. "Really, in the  oblast, as on the whole in the country, the socioeconomic  situation is rather complicated. Plants are working on a short  week, many plants have not issued pay for a month and more,  prices are increasing.... But, in our opinion, this is not the  reason for the postponement of the elections to the oblast duma  and to city and rayon representative organs. Work in this  direction is moving at the prescribed pace: Electoral districts  have been formed, and candidates for deputy are being nominated.  The elections will be held at the end of March. We are confident  that there will be no interruptions."    "Is it possible that the leadership of the city of Samara  would like to delay the elections?"    "No," I was assured by Aleksandr Simonov, business manager  of  the city administration. "We will hold the elections on the  scheduled dates. We have no objective reasons for doubting this.  Samara Oblast is ready for elections to local organs."  <H5>  Krasnodar </H5>   Report by Aleksandr Bulygin, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  correspondent:  "Common Sense Is Dictating"    Sergey Danilenko, deputy chairman of the electoral  commission  of Krasnodar Kray, explained that, guided specifically by this  principle, the Kuban authorities decided to postpone the dates  of the simultaneous elections of deputies to kray, rayon, and  city dumas to 12 June. Rejecting suspicions of some kind of  intent, Sergey Andreyevich does not decline answers to tricky  questions:    "How ready you journalists are with assessments. But the  central electoral commission responded to our letter that `it  does not detect legal obstacles for the conduct of simultaneous  elections to the kray legislative assembly and local  self-government organs in May-June of this year.' And President  of Russia Boris Yeltsin has looked into the situation developing  in the regions, and has advised not `to capture' the electoral  commissions in the localities with tough provisional limits. The  kray administration has no aspiration to gain time, or to  receive any kind of additional advantages. There is only a  desire to cut expenditures at a minimum to 6 billion rubles [R].  That is what the cost of the elections would be just to the kray  duma, and even more for the city and rayon elections. It would  not be difficult to predict the opinion of the taxpayers  concerning such generosity."    "But, after all, the administration has scheduled elections  for 3 April?..."    "Yes, such a decision was made when there was no clarity  concerning the elections of deputies to local self-government  organs. But what would happen if we did not make corrections?  Posters of candidates and party blocs who ran for election to  the Federation Council and the State Duma have not been washed  off everywhere yet, and it would already be necessary to start  in the kray, followed by the city and rayon parliaments. Will  there be many who will want to vote within two or three months?  And also, work in gardens and kitchen gardens will be in full  swing. By June, incidentally, the period of strenuous effort of  the dacha crowd will subside, and the season of mass leaves will  not be under way yet."    "What do you expect from the next preelection marathon?"    "I do not think it will be easy. Rather the opposite, and it  will be complicated not only by extraneous campaign features,  but also by an increase in the number of aspirants for one seat.  We must take into account the statute on elections and other  documents. The city and rayon electoral commissions have plenty  of troubles. They also heaved a sigh of relief when they learned  about the postponed voting dates. After all, the kray center  alone will have to break more than half of the precincts into  smaller units, to find and ready premises, to collate and revise  voter lists, and to bring all documentation into conformity with  the new statute on elections. In a word, we are up to our ears  in work."</p>

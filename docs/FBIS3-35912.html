The Armenians attempted to reseize the recently lost  positions. As a result of fierce fightings the attempts by the  Armenian units to advance towards the town of Ter-Ter were  suppressed. Two Armenian tanks, one armoured personnel carrier  were destroyed and 15 Armenian soldiers were killed during these  fightings.    In Kelbadzharskiy region (the northern sector of the front)  the Armenian units attempted to seize back the hills and  villages retaken by the Azeri Army a week ago. But the enemy  failed due to the coordinated actions of the Azeri units.    At the southern sector of the front (Beylagan-Fizuli)  fightings for the hills in the vicinity of the city of Fizuli  continued. Due to the intensive activity of the Azeri artillery  there, 5 Armenian tanks were destroyed and about 20 Armenian  soldiers were killed.    A comparative calm is seen at the other sectors of the  front.</p>

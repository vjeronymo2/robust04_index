			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Crisis talks under way on Czech national airline CRISIS talks between CSA, the Czech national airline, and minority shareholders, Air France and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), got under way in Prague yesterday. As they did so a senior Air France official firmly dismissed suggestions in the Czech press that the French company was contemplating withdrawing its investment in CSA. 'There is absolutely no question of Air France pulling out of its participation in CSA. Our investment is a long term investment. What we are doing is holding discussions with the (Czech) government to find solutions to CSA's financial and operational problems,' Mr Francois Eldin, Air France vice-president for communications, said yesterday. Air France, jointly with the Caisse des Depots, and the EBRD bought 40 per cent of the Czech airline's shareholding capital in 1992. Air France invested Dollars 18m, the Caisse des Depots Dollars 12m and the EBRD Dollars 30m. Yesterday's extraordinary meeting of shareholders in Prague was called after a recently published audit by consultants Ernst &amp; Young found the Czech company had been overvalued by some Kcs746m (Dollars 25.7m) when it was partially privatised. The decision to have a new audit was made following talks between Mr Bernard Attali, then Air France's president, and Czech ministers, before the summer. Air France and the EBRD are asking the Czech government to make up the difference between the two valuations by an equivalent injection of fresh capital into CSA. But until now, the Czech government, which still owns 49 per cent of the shares through its National Property Fund, an institution established to manage privatisations, and the state's shareholding, has been cool to the idea of providing new finance for the airline which faces mounting losses.</p>

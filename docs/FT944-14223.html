			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Thai bond market set for lift-off - The Emerging Investor The Thai bond market may be poised to become one of Asia's fastest growing debt markets - perhaps even emulating the extraordinary rise of the Bangkok stock market over the past decade. By default Baht-denominated bonds could, alongside the Hong Kong market, become one of the most attractive debt markets for foreign investors in east Asia, according to a senior World Bank official. The historically moribund secondary market for Thai bonds could receive a lift when trading starts on the over-the-counter market on November 1. 'There is a huge potential - the Thai stock market is equivalent to 105 per cent of the GNP; the bond market measures less than 5 per cent of GNP,' said Mr Ishmail Dalla, head of a World Bank mission to advise the Thai government on the privatisation of state enterprises. 'We see a small market that is starting to explode,' said Mr Vuthiphong Priebjrivat, the managing director of Thailand Rating and Information Services, the newly established credit rating agency. It could be several years before rival emerging debt markets in Asia overcome their regulatory teething problems or a hostility to foreign investment. Korea, for instance, has a large debt market but it remains largely fenced off to overseas investors, partly for fear that capital inflows will drive up the value of the won. The Malaysian bond market motored from nothing to Dollars 6bn last year after the government insisted that every debt issuer had to obtain a rating. A requirement that all debt issues obtain a credit rating makes it much easier for portfolio managers to invest in Malaysia's fixed income market. Yet the Kuala Lumpur authorities' penchant for interfering was displayed last year when Bank Negara deliberately squeezed out many foreign capital deposits for fear that they would disrupt the monetary regime and the exchange rate. Thailand is generally more relaxed about foreign capital inflows and has a currency that has tracked the dollar without significant interruption for many years. The finance minister, Mr Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, said: 'We are the poorer for not having an active bond market - we want to see one get going.' The Baht bond market hardly twitched in the dozen years to 1992, when rapid economic growth was driving the stock market's capitalisation up nearly 60-fold. Thai administrations have traditionally been cautious about going into debt; for the past six years governments have run a budget surplus and reduced the volume of government bonds at issue. Corporations - public or private - were simply not allowed to issue their own paper until late 1992: foreign direct investment, the lively stock market and banks provided adequate capital sources. The general complacency over a debt market has been shattered by two developments: the need to revamp the countries' creaking infrastructure and the corporate sector's enthusiastic discovery of disintermediation - tapping by borrowers of savers without the help of the banks. The World Bank calculates that the 15 public utilities that it has targeted for privatisation will need to raise external funding of Dollars 52.5bn between now and the end of the century. Mr Dalla, a bank official, said: 'The Thai government is loath to borrow money directly and the Thai banking sector is not geared up for long-term lending. Yet equity investors demand too high a yield - the bond market is the only place to go.' As a rule-of-thumb Mr Dalla reckoned that three quarters of infrastructure funding should come from the debt markets and a quarter from the stock market. Thailand's debt market is well developed but has concentrated on short-term maturities, with finance companies issuing promissory notes to fund their lending and cor-porations issuing short-term paper known as bills of exchange. Corporations have discovered that, following the legal changes, they can often obtain funds more cheaply and with fewer collateral requirements by issuing bonds than going to their traditional bank lenders. Mr Vuthiphong reckons that the market for corporate bonds could climb from Bt20bn at the end of 1993 to nearly Bt100bn this year and perhaps Bt250bn by 1995. Assuming that state enterprises add another Bt100bn to the Bt150bn of bonds already at issue then he said that the total bond market could surpass Bt500bn (Dollars 20bn) by the end of 1995. The capitalisation of the stock market is currently about Bt3.5 trillion or Dollars 141bn. These figures do not include the Bt40bn raised by corporations on the Euroconvertible debenture last year. By tapping the Euromarkets in this way, the corporations learnt about debt markets, although rising interest rates and weaker Bangkok share prices have combined to close off this avenue for funds for the moment. Next week's first tentative steps in scripless closed circuit over-the-counter (semi-regulated) trading should involve up to 15 active traders, although more than 60 organisations have registered an interest (perhaps because they believe this is a one-time only application). Some sceptics have still to be convinced that Asian investors, hooked on the excitement of a stock market as volatile as Bangkok's, will be attracted to the bond market. Yet the government is pushing for the development of the central provident fund, the mutual fund and insurance industries, and other obvious customers. Tipsuda Thavaramara, bond specialist at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said: 'We want to see a lively bond market if possible. We'll have several teething problems but nothing that's going to kill the market.' Mr Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, the director at the Bank of Thailand in charge of bond market development, said that in the absence of an adequate government bond yield curve to act as a benchmark, investors would probably have to be content to trade in blue chip corporations and state enterprises. Mr Thirachai said: 'I won't worry if things aren't desperately exciting straight away. The demand is there - it's inevitable.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Friday   Week on week change Stock                           Country  21/10/94       Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- President Enterprises            Taiwan   2.5167        0.6281   33.26 Buenaventura (L)                   Peru   5.5126        1.1667   26.85 Buenaventura (C)                   Peru   5.1214        0.7979   18.46 TPI Polene                     Thailand   9.7792        1.5230   18.40 Walsin Lihwa Wire &amp; Cables       Taiwan   1.3755        0.2133   18.35 Minsur                             Peru  10.3417        1.4036   15.70 Evergreen Marine                 Taiwan   2.2861        0.2408   11.77 Pitt Exploration &amp; Production  Thailand  11.0040        1.1561   11.74 Far Eastern Textile              Taiwan   1.5215        0.1567   11.48 Cementos Lima                      Peru   2.3516        0.2100    9.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

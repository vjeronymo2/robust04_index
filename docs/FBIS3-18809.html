According to the Institute of the German Economy (IW, Cologne),  in 1993 only Luxembourg fulfilled all the criteria for  membership. The other 11 states of the European Union [EU]  would, however, not have managed to get into the EMU club. This  is the result of a comparative study the IW presented in Cologne  on Wednesday [9 March]. The main stumbling block was high  national debts: All EU countries except Luxembourg were further  from the target figures than ever before. The Monetary Union is  to come into force in 1996, or 1998 at the latest.    According to the IW, Germany failed to meet two of the  criteria in 1993. The inflation rate of 4.3 percent and the  public household deficit of 4.2 percent of the GNP exceeded the  permitted figures. The deviations are, however, not very high,  which should make it possible for Germany to meet the criteria  by 1996. The high inflation rate is mainly due to the  development of prices in eastern Germany, which was influenced  by special factors.    The IW says that in addition to Germany, six other EU  countries -- Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Ireland,  and the Netherlands -- stand a comparatively good chance of  fulfilling the entry criteria by 1998 at the latest. Greece,  Italy, Portugal, and -- apart from remaining slightly under the  permitted debt level -- Spain failed to fulfill any of the  requirements in 1993.</p>

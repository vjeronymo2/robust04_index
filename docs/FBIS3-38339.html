			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Davos, January 29 (BTA) -- Today Bulgarian Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov attended a brinkmanship [as received]  session where he spoke on the major goals of the Bulgarian  Government in the period of transition to a market economy, the  cabinet's Press Office said.    The difficulties Bulgaria encounters could be mitigated by  improving the legal basis, preserving the real-term pensions and  incomes, and improving the public regulating institutions to  settle the conflicts between the different social groups, Prime  Minister Berov said.    This country needs a restrictive financial policy to curb  the  annual inflation rate, expeditious privatization of the  state-owned units, and providing markets, notwithstanding the  defence-oriented foreign policy of the European Union, the  speaker said. However, the progress is unthinkable without  preventive actions aimed against all signs of religious and  ethnic hostility, without holding back the flow of immigrants  from poorer countries, which pulls the crime rate up and calls  for a variety of temporary law-enforcement measures, Prof. Berov  went on to say.    Political confrontation should be opposed, private traders  should be encouraged to turn to production, the private medical  practice and introduction of health insurance system with  partial payment of medical treatment should also be promoted,  and new agricultural laws should be passed to prevent the  fragmentation of land, the speaker also said. The transition to  a market economy showed that reforms are painful and will take  longer than we initially believed, the Bulgarian prime minister  said.    At the session Prof. Berov met Finland's Prime Minister Esko  Aho who showed deep interest in the progress of the economic  reforms in Bulgaria. Mr. Aho evaluated in highly positive terms  the achievements this country has made so far and the policy the  incumbent government is pursuing. The two heads of state  discussed the possibilities for establishing active business and  economic relations between Bulgaria and Finland, the cabinets'  Press Office said.    Later Prime Minister Berov met Swiss head of Federal  Department of Public Economy Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. The two  agreed that the bilateral relations are developing actively but  certain steps should be taken to overcome the decline in the  commercial exchange.    The Bulgarian prime minister met also with Sir Leon Brittan,  member of the Commission of the European Communities, to discuss  Bulgaria's joining the European structures.    Later in the afternoon Prof. Berov met with outstanding  representatives of international business circles and briefed  them on the progress of the economic reforms in this country.  The Bulgarian head of state touched upon the stumbling blocks  in the period of transition to a market economy, the actions  taken to improve the investment climate in this country, the  major goals of the incumbent government's economic policy, the  land reform. Bulgaria's policy in the Balkans was one of the key  issues in the talks, the cabinet's Press Office said.</p>

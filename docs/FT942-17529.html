			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Decent fizz for a tenner - Appetisers The rules for making sparkling wines vary from region to region but, typically, stipulate a minimum time for ageing the wine on the lees. Those for champagne now insist on at least 15 months, but research shows that it takes at least 18 months for this process to have any perceptible impact on flavour by rounding out acidity and adding complexity. It is almost impossible for the consumer to establish how long a bottle of non-vintage fizz has been aged on lees, but Laytons of London NW1 (071-388-5081) has managed to track down an unusually respectable champagne for Pounds 9.95 which, it claims, has benefited from four years in bottle. Laytons Champagne Brut NV, available from Laytons and Andre Simon shops in London, certainly tastes mellow for reasons of age rather than added sugar. This is more than can be said for most champagne under a tenner. ***** Meanwhile, in my swoon over vintage madeira earlier this year, I forgot to mention that Bottoms Up - most unusually for a high street retailer - takes this exciting style of wine seriously. The chain's exceptionally attractive list boasts no fewer than five examples, including the first-class Blandy's Bual 1954 at Pounds 65. Probably best value is Rutherford &amp; Miles' Malvasia solera 1863 at Pounds 39. The unit price might seem high, but these are powerful wines which will last in an opened bottle for months and months. ***** London wine lovers have three important consumer wine fairs to choose from on Saturday, May 14. The organisers are taking advantage of the annual influx of wine producers to the London Wine Trade Fair the following week. Wine merchant La Vigneronne's Alsace Wine Fair takes place between 11am and 6pm in the Sherfield Building of Imperial College, off Exhibition Road, London SW7. An entrance ticket costing Pounds 15 (from 071-589- 6113) allows tasters 15 tastes and further tasting coupons are on sale. The Great Australian Wine Tasting is from 11am until 5pm in the Old Horticultural Hall in Greycoat Street, London SW1. The Pounds 12 cost of tickets (from 071-925-0751) can be redeemed on orders of Pounds 75 or more taken at the fair and there are no restrictions on grog intake. At the end of the LWTF week, some winemakers will be staying on for the Oddbins Wine Fair at the Park Lane Hotel on May 13, 14 and 15. Charity tickets are Pounds 10 from any Oddbins branch.</p>

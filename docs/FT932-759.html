			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Markets: Tracking down the right investment - Serious Money SELECTING THE right equity fund from the myriad options available is a tricky process. However hard you scrutinise the past performance, there is no guarantee that funds at the top of the charts will continue to do well. The sad fact is that the majority of funds fail to outperform the market index. The odds are thus stacked against you and in favour of underperformance. Hence the emergence of index-tracking funds. These do not attempt to select shares by the old analytical standbys. They simply try to match the index's performance, normally by selecting stocks which have tracked it in the past. Once set up, the costs of running an indexed fund ought to be lower than on a conventional fund. Even so, there are inevitably some costs and these prevent the funds from exactly matching the index's performance. Nevertheless, the UK funds have performed well and in general have above average performances for their sectors. The overseas tracking funds have not done so well, particularly in Japan. Conventional fund managers argue that they can still beat the index, and it may well be that if the market moves sideways for the next year or so, the emphasis will be on stock picking. Small companies may well be set to outperform over the next year or so, which may help active managers. Nevertheless, indexed funds may well be a good core holding for first-time investors over the longer term. Here follows details of the main unit trusts in the area; there is also a small number of tracker investment trusts - Venturi, Malvern and two Hoare Govett small company funds.

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Roxboro makes Pounds 55m purchase and placing Roxboro, the specialist electronic and electrical products manufacturer which came to the market in November, plans to acquire Solartron, a sensors, transducer and measurement instruments group, for an initial Pounds 55.3m, including Pounds 12.3m of assumed debt. The group, which raised Pounds 11.9m net of expenses when it was floated at 230p a share last year, also announced a placing and open offer at 255p to raise Pounds 30.6m on the basis of 37 new shares for every 100 held. The placing of the 13m shares, subject to a recall of 8.7m, is fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu with James Capel as brokers. Roxboro's shares closed up 14p at 284p. Roxboro will pay an initial Pounds 26.4m in cash and issue 6.1m shares to the vendors who include Solartron's management and Schroder Ventures which backed a Pounds 35m management buy-out from Schlumberger in November. A further consideration of up to Pounds 10m will be paid subject to the Solartron operations achieving pre-tax profits of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7.5m in the year following acquisition. Mr Harry Tee, Roxboro's chief executive, yesterday rejected suggestions that the price was too high. He acknowledged that Solartron's management buy-out team led by Mr Philip Tempest, managing director, struck 'an absolutely superb' deal but said, 'for us it is still an excellent deal because it is earnings enhancing immediately'. He said the acquisition would double Roxboro's turnover and profits. As a result it raised its forecast dividend for this year to 4.5p against the 1.9p flotation forecast. Solartron reported profits of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 4.1m) before tax and group charges of Pounds 800,000 last year on turnover of Pounds 48.2m (Pounds 44.7m). It makes electo-mechanical devices which are used widely throughout industry to measure pressure, density, displacement, temperature, flow, viscosity or other variables. COMMENT This is a smart deal even though it would have been even sweeter at the bargain buy-out price five months ago. The sensor and transducer markets are among the fastest growing segments of the electronic components industry and Solartron already has a strong or leading position in more than a dozen different niche markets. The acquisition fits group strategy and Roxboro expects to improve further Solartron's margins. Gearing after the purchase will be an acceptable 29 per cent, and will fall. The market has already given the deal its approval by lifting the shares 5 per cent.</p>

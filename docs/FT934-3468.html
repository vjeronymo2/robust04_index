			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (13): More deals transcend borders - The regions / Assessing activity outside London The regional pattern of management buy-outs in the UK changed dramatically in 1993, with surges of activity in Scotland and two English regions - the south-east and the north-west - but it is probable that nothing much can be read into this. There were sharp declines in share in south-west England, East Anglia and the north, and smaller ones in Yorkshire and Humberside, the West Midlands and the East Midlands, while Wales and Northern Ireland slightly improved their normal, if small, shares. The figures, which relate to the first six months of the year, have been collected by the Centre for Management Buy-out Research, at Nottingham University. How significant they may be, however, is obscure. Dr Ken Robbie, research fellow in the centre, says this is because management buy-out and buy-in activity suffered a sharp decline in the first six months, recording the lowest first-half total since 1987. This means changes in regional shares may well not herald a new pattern. Only 206 deals were completed in the first six months of the year - about 37 per cent down on the same period last year. The aggregate market value of Pounds 1.52bn fell about 10 per cent. Activity cannot therefore be seen as 'normal'. Individual deals - or taking longer than usual to conclude them in some areas - may have had a disproportionate effect. The south-east shows how erratic the change in shares appears. After falling back to 32 per cent of the national market in 1992, it shot up to 39.3 per cent of the first-half deals of 1993 - the highest it has ever achieved. The north-west, which is the second biggest UK economic region after the south-east, also picked up to a record share - 11.3 per cent, against 10.6 per cent in 1993. Scotland surged most, moving from an 8.8 per cent share to 13.6 per cent. The biggest dives were in the south-west, which plunged from 8.1 per cent last year to 3.6 per cent in the first two quarters of 1993, and the north of England - the north-east and Cumbria - where the 1992 share of 5.2 per cent collapsed to only 1.8 per cent. East Anglia went from 4.7 per cent to 3.0 per cent. Yorkshire and Humberside fell by only 0.2 percentage points to 7.7 per cent, the West Midlands by 0.5 points to 8.3 per cent and the East Midlands by 0.4 points to 6.6 per cent. Wales's share moved up slightly from 4 per cent to 4.2 per cent, as did Northern Ireland's, from 0.5 to 0.6 per cent. What Dr Robbie has noticed, however, is an increasing number of deals involving people working across regional borders. The most notable example was the buy-out of Leyland Trucks from Daf (see this page). The plant is in Lancashire, but most of the professional advice came from corporate finance experts, lawyers and other professionals in Leeds, led by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. This is different from before. The rise of regional financial centres such as Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham had seen each regional capital keeping deals within the region - and the professional fees generated very much to itself. The reduction in general levels of activity is one reason why there may now be some 'poaching' in neighbouring regions. Another is rationalisation within professional firms, with a few top consultants operating on a super-regional basis - covering the whole of the north, say, from Manchester or Leeds - but drafting in local reinforcements when deals move into the final stages of processing. At the other end of the scale, polarisation of financial and professional services into regional capitals can rebound. Some companies on Merseyside, for example, resent having to go Manchester for advice. Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, has therefore put a substantial corporate finance resource into Liverpool, headed by Mr Amin Amiri. Some advisers are sceptical about the management buy-out market anyway. Mr Lindsay Forbes, director of the British Linen Bank - the merchant arm of the Bank of Scotland - in Manchester, thinks most have been nothing special. There were many of them in the regions, because of the way many national companies bought subsidiary companies in the 1980s and spread their branch factories around the country. When they had to rationalise, they started lopping in the regions. Moreover, many of the companies were bought cheaply by their managements from divesting parents which were anxious to be rid of them. They have not had to do much to perform well enough for backers to look to flotation around now to realise their investments. Mr Forbes says that there remains a shortage of good deals, partly because there are now fewer motivated vendors, but more importantly because there is a perpetual shortage of good managers who can triumph when there is not much general scope for improvement. A mediocre management can hide its deficiencies when there is only slight economic upturn if price-to-earnings ratios take a quantum leap from a low base. If the price of a buy-out was five times earnings three years ago and it can be floated at 15 times much higher earnings now, everyone makes a great of deal of money. But a company that costs 12 times earnings now, in an improving economic climate, will probably have to float or be sold at more than 20 times earnings to achieve similar gains. This will require very good management, and this is in shorter supply than deals. 'There's a lot of money looking for a quality home - and not enough quality homes,' says Mr Steven Hartley, Manchester corporate finance partner of Stoy Hayward, the accountants, summing up the current regional MBO market. In spite of this, Stoys in Manchester has been lead adviser in several MBOs this year, including M &amp; I Materials, Palletower, Armourshield, Sondhi Kellar and Lorco Hygiene, and one MBI - Xenon Holdings. Mr Tony Hyams, regional director of Barclays Development Capital, also remains bullish. He thinks one reason why the north-west has improved its national share this year is because the financial and professional services sector has developed so strongly in Manchester. 'Over the past few years we have seen a discernible trend for the money to move where the industry is. There is also an increasing preference in industry to deal with local advisers wherever possible. 'Meanwhile, the cautious approach of many quoted companies and trade buyers towards acquisition often leaves the existing management in a strong position as potential purchasers. 'Those choosing the MBO route will find plentiful funds in the regions, not only from venture capitalists, but also from banks which have taken far less of a battering in the north than the south,' Mr Hyams added.</p>

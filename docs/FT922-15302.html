			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Showman on a magic carpet ride abroad / A look at how one Indian entrepreneur made his name As India heads down the path of export-led growth, it is running up against the same problem that beset Japan, Korea and Taiwan in their early years of expansion - a reputation for shoddily-made, ill-designed goods. One of the few Indian companies to have succeeded in selling high-quality products abroad under its own brand name is Shyam Ahuja. A Bombay-based, family-owned concern that began by making durries (flat woven rugs) it now sells hand-made furnishing fabrics through more than 80 up-market stores from New York to Tokyo, Hong Kong, London and Sydney. When Shyam Ahuja, a flamboyant showman with a taste for self publicity, set up his own business supplying durries, he aimed at the top of the range: designers like David Hicks and stores like Ralph Lauren in the US and Liberty in London. An inveterate dropper of famous people's names, he claims that Sonia Gandhi, George Bush and Margaret Thatcher own his durries. Unlike most other Indian companies, he recognised the importance of having his own brand name, and marketing it hard. He spends three-quarters of the year travelling abroad, keeping in touch with international tastes, talking to buyers and making his presence felt at international trade exhibitions. By selling under his own name - as opposed to most Third World manufacturers which supply goods to chain stores that market them under their own labels - Shyam Ahuja has ensured that profit margins are high. His reputation for quality and design enables him to charge higher prices than other manufacturers producing similar goods. 'I see what the market can pay,' he says, admitting in the same breath that his production costs are relatively low. Retail prices abroad are about four to five times higher than the cost of a fabric at shipment from India. Shyam Ahuja claims responsibility for introducing Indian durries to the West in the 1970s. He took the traditional floor covering and added new designs and lighter, pastel colours. He also used finer cotton or wall yarn and ensured it was well finished. He now complains that other Indian manufacturers flooded the market with poor-quality copies of his designs - destroying the image of the durrie abroad. In 1983 he made another breakthrough when Ralph Lauren bought his floor coverings - but on the basis of designs supplied by Lauren. More recently he has become restless at manufacturing for another brand name and is anxious to break the link. He does not always get it right. He says that Liberty, his main London outlet, last year told him that sales of pastel colours, which have symbolised his designs, were plummeting. The result has been a new collection based on bold reds and using themes from American Indian culture. The difficulty of producing hand-made products in India is maintaining quality. Shyam Ahuja reckons that he has 18,000 weavers working for him  - equivalent to the workforce of a large steel mill. Most work from home and are paid on piece rates. The company supplies the weaver with raw materials - cotton, dyes, wool - to ensure consistency. Of the 250 permanent staff on Shyam Ahuja's payroll, a large number are involved in inspecting goods at different stages of manufacture. Shyam Ahuja claims that he rejects 30 per cent of the products that arrive at his Bombay headquarters.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAMIBIANS CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Namibians took to the streets Wednesday in a riot of pomp,  color and pageantry to celebrate their nation's independence.  </P> <P> The world's newest nation, which became the 160th member of the United Nations,  launched a massive street party to mark the end of colonial domination, first  by imperial Germany and since 1915 by neighboring South Africa.  </P> <P> President Sam Nujoma and his Cabinet were installed by U.N. Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar.  </P> <P> At the ornate Tintenpalast (Ink Palace) in Windhoek, the elected delegates who  drafted Namibia's liberal constitution voted themselves into power as a  National Assembly, dominated by Nujoma's South-West Africa People's  Organization (SWAPO). Nujoma's keynote speech concentrated on the country's  economy, and he again buried SWAPO's Marxist past with a strong call for a  mixed economy and private investment.  </P> <P> President Bush lifted U.S. sanctions, which were extended to Namibia when it  was under South African control, and established full diplomatic relations.  </P></p>

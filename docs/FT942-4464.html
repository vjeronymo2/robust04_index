			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz sets rights terms Shareholders in Daimler-Benz will be offered shares in the long-awaited rights issue at DM640 a share, a discount of 20 per cent to last night's closing price of DM804.50, the German cars-to-aerospace group announced yesterday. The issue will raise just under DM3bn (Dollars 1.8bn) for Daimler-Benz, making it the biggest rights issue by a German company. The subscription period for the new shares will be from June 20 to July 5. The global co-ordinator to the issue is to be Deutsche Bank, the largest shareholder in Daimler with a 24.4 per cent stake. Senior underwriters are Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. Daimler said rights not taken up by existing shareholders would be placed with international investors. Daimler is the only German company to have a full listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Mr Gerhard Liener, Daimler finance director, has stated that he wanted to use the issue to raise the percentage of Daimler shares owned by US investors from the current 7 per cent. It is understood that Deutsche Bank will maintain its shareholding at its current level by taking up its rights to new shares. Other large shareholders include the government of Kuwait, which is thought likely to maintain its 14 per cent stake, and Stella, a holding company owned by large German industrial and financial companies which owns 12.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondent Chen Peng (7115 7720)] </F>   [Text] Haikou, 9 May (XINHUA) -- The Hainan Armed Police  Corps recently captured a crime gang in Xinpo Town in Qiongshan  City.    Chen Pixiong, Zhou Nucai, Liu Jiujin and others in the  village assembled a dozen of so young people who loved pleasures  and loathed work and formed themselves into a gang. So far this  year they have regularly used guns and other lethal weapons to  stop vehicles travelling on the expressway by the village and  rob the passengers of their money and belongings; and they also  entered people's houses to steal and rob them. The money and  belongings they have stolen exceeded 200,000 yuan.    Determined to annihilate the gang, the Qiongshan Municipal  Public Security Bureau had on many occasions sent police to the  town to detect the gang's whereabouts. On the night of 27  April, public security police, with the masses' assistance,  learned that the gang's ringleaders and other members had  returned to the village to rest, and immediately informed the  Hainan Public Security Department, which in turn informed the  Hainan Armed Police Corps, demanding that personnel be sent to  the village to destroy the gang. The Hainan Armed Police Corps  immediately selected 50 officers and men to encircle and capture  the gang. Early in the morning the next day, the armed police,  without firing a single bullet, captured all the ringleaders and  members of the gang.</p>

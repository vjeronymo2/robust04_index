			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / TUC underwrites union's overdraft The Trades Union Congress general council agreed yesterday to underwrite a Pounds 250,000 extension to the Pounds 1.2m overdraft facility held by Ucatt, the construction union, with Unity Trust Bank. The TUC's move is unprecedented but Mr John Monks, general secretary, said yesterday that no UK trade union in had ever gone bankrupt. Mr Doug Douglas, deposed as president of the GPMU print union by its executive, has won his case in the High Court and been reinstated. The union will not appeal.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Australia set to increase spending and cut taxes AUSTRALIA'S Labor government is expected to announce capital spending and tax cuts of between ADollars 2bn and ADollars 3bn (Pounds 862m-Pounds 1.29bn) tomorrow in an attempt to speed up economic recovery and resuscitate its fading electoral prospects. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, will announce details in a wide ranging economic statement which could make or break Labor's chances in the next federal election, due by mid-1993. Consultations with business organisations, the trade union movement and other interest groups have made the statement the most eagerly awaited policy package since 1986 when Mr Keating, then federal treasurer, warned that Australia would become a 'banana republic' unless it overcame chronic economic problems. The principal aim is to generate business and consumer confidence to strengthen a patchy recovery from six quarters of flat or negative economic growth which has pushed unemployment to 10.3 per cent. Confidence in government claims that the recovery has begun was damaged last week by figures showing that seasonally adjusted retail trade and private new capital expenditure contracted in the December quarter. However, the government must also reverse a drift of support to the opposition conservatives caused by Labor's handling of the economy and a damaging leadership struggle between Mr Keating and Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister. Mr Keating has been unable to reduce a gap of up to 20 percentage points in the opinion polls since taking over in December. The statement will concentrate on attempts to stimulate economic activity quickly through a mixture of personal tax cuts and spending on infrastructure projects. The government has been overwhelmed with calls for infrastructure spending, but is likely to restrict itself to modest improvements to roads, railways and ports. Major projects likely to to be approved include a standard gauge railway from Melbourne to Adelaide and airport terminal improvements in both cities. The statement will also contain measures to stimulate private investment, probably through accelerated depreciation allowances. The tax treatment of banks' bad debts will be changed in an attempt to discourage foreclosures and stimulate fresh lending. The government is also likely to give a fillip to the faltering structural economic reform process through further deregulation of the aviation market and faster progress towards rail and port reform. Mr Keating has ruled out a slowdown in the government's 10-year tariff reduction programme, in spite of pleas for greater protection from the unions and some industry sectors. The statement is unlikely to unsettle the financial markets unless the fiscal stimulus is substantially greater than expected. However, some economists believe any stimulus could overheat the economy if the recovery already under way is stronger than it appears. Access Economics, a Canberra consultancy, said the 1991-92 federal budget deficit is likely to exceed ADollars 9bn, compared with the government's estimate of ADollars 5bn, and warned that fiscal pump priming 'is likely to score high on temporary job creation, but low on durability.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 17 (AFP) -- The European Union is  facing a "crisis of growth" as it wrestles with the problems of  incorporating new members, Jacques Delors, president of the EU's  executive European Commission, said here Tuesday [17 May].    He was addressing the newly-formed Committee of the Regions,  a body formed under the EU's Maastricht Treaty to give local  communities a voice in Brussels.    "How do we extend our values of peace and mutual recognition  to all the countries of Europe while still retaining the goal of  a united community?" Delors asked.    He called for a fundamental reform of EU institutions after  the union's planned expansion to take in Austria, Finland,  Norway and Sweden next year.    The EU has scheduled a conference in 1996 to streamline its  functions with a view to ensuring that expansion will not weaken  its capacity to take quick and effective decisions and actions.    Delors warned against the "easy" option" of an infinitely  elastic EU, and was critical of German pressure to absorb the  new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe into the union.    The EU would have to double its annual budget -- currently  at  about 73 billion ECU (84 billion dollars) -- if Hungary, Poland,  the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania and Bulgaria were to  join, he said.    Germans should make their own calculations about how this  would translate into higher taxes, he added.</p>

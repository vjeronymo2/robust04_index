			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SELF-INTEREST AND OIL CRISIS IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> In Helena Cobban's column ("Strategic Ally, Strategic Myth," Commentary, Aug.  16), she attempts to chastise and categorize Israel as more of a burden in the  Persian Gulf conflict than a strategic asset. Perhaps she needs to be reminded  that it was Israel that made sure we would not be facing an Iraq armed to the  teeth with nuclear weapons! Perhaps Ms. Cobban has a reason why she doesn't  want to remember, or remind us of this?  </P> <P> JOE GELMAN  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

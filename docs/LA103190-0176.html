			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> '65 TWINS TO FACE DODGERS IN FEB.  </P> <P> The 1965 Minnesota Twins, who lost the World Series in seven games to Los  Angeles, will get another shot at the Dodgers in the 1991 Dream Game.  </P> <P> The seven-inning benefit game will be played Feb. 3 at Phoenix Municipal  Stadium, with proceeds going to the child development center at Phoenix  Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> The game has matched noteworthy teams of the past in a series that began in  1986.  </P> <P> "I'm glad to play for two reasons," former Twins ace Jim (Mudcat) Grant, now a  Los Angeles businessman, said. "It's for a good cause, and it gives Minnesota  another chance to get even with those suckers."  </P> <P> Sandy Koufax, pitching on two day's rest, beat the Twins 2-0 in Game 7 to give  Los Angeles the title.  </P></p>

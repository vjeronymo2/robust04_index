			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / People: Gestetner - Inchcape takes hold Inchcape, the international services and marketing group which in May took a 15 per cent stake in Gestetner Holdings, is strengthening its ties with the struggling office and photographic equipment distributor. Stephen King, 44, Inchcape's director of financial control since 1987, has been appointed finance director at Gestetner. He replaces Brian Copsey, who is leaving to live full-time in Monaco, where he has been resident since 1986. King will be continuing a close working relationship with his current boss, Rod O'Donoghue, Inchcape's finance director, who joined the Gestetner board as a result of the May deal, along with Andrew Cummins, Inchcape's strategic director. In spite of the close ties between the two companies, King's name was put forward by an international executive search agency, which came up with five candidates. The choice was finalised after David Thompson, until recently non-executive chairman of Rank Xerox in the UK, agreed to move to Gestetner as part-time chairman. Inchcape has an option to increase its holding in Gestetner to 25 per cent by July next year. Ricoh, the Japanese photocopier manufacturer, already has a 24 per cent stake in the company, which is the world's largest independent distributor of office equipment. Gestetner's Australian management, under Basil Sellers as chairman and chief executive, moved the group away from stencil duplicators towards photocopiers, but also made an ill-judged expansion into the photographic equipment market. Sellers remains on the board as a non-executive director.</p>

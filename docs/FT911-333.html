			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Bank's role Sir, As the director of a small company that would not be in business without the help my bank has given me over the years, I think that Mr F X O'Malley (Letters, May 2) is wrong in suggesting that managers should visit their customers. Surely his time and that of his bank manager would be better employed by making sure that he regularly updates his company's cash flow and any other financial projections deemed necessary. From my experience, this should be done at least once a month and the information then forwarded to the bank manager for review. Far from being a subjective approach, this is the best method I know for detecting problems at an early stage. Robin Huttenbach, Nelson Design, Southbank Technopark, 90 London Road, SE1</p>

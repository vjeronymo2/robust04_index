			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRONCOS' PERRY UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT  </P> <P> Denver Broncos tackle Gerald Perry is under investigation for third-degree  sexual assault charges, the fifth time he has been named in a criminal case in  nearly two years.  </P> <P> Aurora Police Department spokeswoman Linda Barrow said police officers removed  Perry from a woman's home about 3 a.m. Tuesday at the woman's request.  </P> <P> Later, the woman called police and told them the 6-6, 305-pound tackle made  unwanted sexual advances, Barrow said. No weapons were involved.  </P> <P> Perry has not been arrested, Barrow said.  </P> <P> Aurora Police Division Chief Ron Sloan said, "There is some question as to how  the actual contact came to be. That's under investigation. That's an integral  part of the investigation."  </P> <P> Broncos Coach Dan Reeves would not speculate on Perry's future with the team,  but said he was aware of the investigation.  </P> <P> "There are some things happening, but until that investigation has been done, I  don't know a heck of a lot about what's going to happen," he said. "Certainly  I'm disappointed that anything is going on."  </P> <P> Since December, 1988, Perry has been convicted twice of soliciting a  prostitute, was acquitted of a rape charge and was arrested on a third-degree  assault for hitting a Denver man at a bar.  </P> <P> Perry is scheduled for trial in the bar fight case in December. He was  undergoing treatment for alcoholism at an Arizona rehabilitation center when  the charges were filed.  </P> <P> Last year, Perry served 15 days in jail for the second solicitation offense.  </P></p>

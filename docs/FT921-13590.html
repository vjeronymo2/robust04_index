			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: District council spending that bears examination Sir, Reports of our analysis of Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for 295 shire district councils have focused on political debate, yet Mr Michael Portillo's assertion that our findings are 'ludicrous' cannot go unchallenged (Parliament and politics, January 17) . The report concentrated on shire district councils because the figures for these authorities bear examination. The study was requested by our members who have often expressed their concern about the way in which SSAs are set. The proposed national average increase in SSAs is 6.8 per cent, yet Liberal Democrat and Labour controlled districts are in line for increases of 4.87 per cent and 3.92 per cent respectively. Our research was unable to find a reason which would account for this. Mr Portillo cites increases in some London boroughs to demonstrate even-handedness. For the record, in the 32 London authorities both Labour and Tory administrations received average SSA increases of 7.7 per cent. Liberal Democrat authorities and hung councils get 7.3 per cent. The closeness of the London figures is an explanation of differences between districts even more important. Judy Mallaber, director, Local Government Information Unit, 1-5 Bath Street, London EC1</p>

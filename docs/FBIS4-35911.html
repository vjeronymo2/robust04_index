			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "To Preserve Yemen's Unity First"] </F>   [Text] The attempts to internationalize the crisis of  fraternal Yemen should be stopped immediately and without  hesitation. This is because these suspect attempts imply a  noteworthy encouragement of the secessionist tendency as a  prelude to fragmenting the Yemeni homeland and people.    If the UN Security Council interferes in Yemen's internal  affairs, it might decide to send international troops to Yemeni  territory, which is similar to what the Security Council did in  Somalia and other areas. We believe that the bitter and  difficult experience in Somalia was sufficient for the Arabs to  learn the necessary lesson and stop inviting foreign states and  forces, whether friendly or hostile, to interfere in Arab  affairs.    All Arab states and parties should know that foreign  military  and political interference will not be in favor of Yemen, its  national unity, or its territorial integrity. If the Arab  League really cares for halting the destructive war in Yemen, it  should activate the stipulations and articles of its charter and  abide by its by-laws, all of which provide for resolving any  Arab crisis inside, and not outside, the Arab house.    The Arab League should also make all necessary efforts and  moves in order to foil the secessionist tendency among the  southern Yemeni leaders and urge them to commit themselves to  legitimacy and unity.    No Arab party supports the continuation of the ongoing war  between the brothers in Yemen because it is a destructive war  that will inflict grave damage on the Yemeni economy and its  infrastructure and superstructure. All Arab states should make  serious and responsible initiatives to halt this war, extinguish  its fire, and stop the Yemeni bloodshed. They should also  stress the protection of Yemeni unity, respect for legitimacy,  and the prevention of any foreign interference in the affairs of  this fraternal Arab country.    A real solution to the Yemeni crisis is one that would  safeguard the Yemeni people's unity and preserve Yemen's  territorial integrity. Such a solution will not be provided by  any form of foreign interference or internationalization of the  crisis.</p>

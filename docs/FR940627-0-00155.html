			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the end of the exposure period, tissues and/or organs from a subgroup of the test animals are specially preserved according to the requirements of the neurological, pulmonary, and reproductive organ examinations. Tissues/organs from the main test population are preserved using standard techniques for the general toxicity evaluation. Test animals will be subjected to a full gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the body, all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their contents. All major organs must be weighed. Gross pathology must be performed on the following target organs and tissues: liver, kidneys, lungs, adrenals, brain, and gonads. Histopathology must be performed on all gross lesions and specific organs/tissues, as follows: respiratory tract (i.e., lungs, nasopharyngeal tissues, trachea), brain, heart, sternum with bone marrow, salivary glands, liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, reproductive organs (i.e., uterus, cervix, ovaries, testes, epididymides), aorta, gall bladder, esophagus, stomach, intestinal tract, urinary bladder, representative lymph node, and peripheral nerve/tissue. Other organs and tissues must be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future histopathological examination, as described in the regulatory text of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described earlier, the 90-day subchronic inhalation study will serve as a basic framework for the Tier 2 testing program. The following sections provide brief descriptions of the ancillary assays and other additional test and/or measures performed under Tier 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity Assays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the evaluation of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, Tier 2 includes a battery of three genotoxic assays: Salmonella, micronucleus (MN) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). These assays are specific for mutagenic/carcinogenic outcomes at a cellular level, but the tests may not be indicative of non-mutagenic or initiation/promotion cancer mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the Tier 2 genotoxic assays are considered cost-effective indicators of mutagenicity and, by implication, predictors of suspect carcinogens. The rationale for using these tests for the assessment of potential mutagenic and carcinogenic effects is based on the general assumption that cancer is a multi-stage process involving a variety of events that can include genotoxic steps. The general consensus among scientists is that many of the cancers may be attributable to adverse genetic changes. Because genotoxic steps are generally implicated early in the process of cancer development, their detection has assumed the status of presumptive carcinogen identification. EPA recognizes that this working assumption has some limitations because there is always a possibility of having false positive (mutagenic noncarcinogens) or false negatives (nonmutagenic carcinogens) when evaluating the carcinogenic potential of the test substance. However, these limitations do not preclude the usefulness and the effectiveness of the genotoxic assays (i.e., Salmonella, MN, and SCE) as cost-effective predictors of potential mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in the context of the Tier 2 testing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of the Tier 2 assays required for the evaluation of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity is provided in the following sections. The two in vivo assays (MN and SCE) can be conducted concurrently with the 90-day subchronic inhalation study (i.e., same animal population). The Salmonella assay is run separately, because it does not require the exposure of live animals to emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella Assay <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Salmonella assay is an in vitro test for mutagenicity and, by implication, for carcinogenicity. The assay makes use of five mutant strains of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium which cannot grow in a medium deficient in histidine due to an inherited inability to produce this amino acid. Exposure to mutagenic or carcinogenic substances can elicit reverse mutations, such that the bacteria regain their ability to grow in a histidine-deficient medium. In this test, bacteria will be exposed to the semi-volatile and particulate extracts of combustion emissions (see Section VI.B.2 for information on sampling of combustion emissions for testing). Test procedures for this assay have been described in previous literature. <FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>  After exposure, the cells will be plated on histidine-deficient media (both with and without metabolic activation) and incubated for a designated period of time. The number of emissions-induced mutant colonies (revertants) growing on the plates will then be compared to the number of spontaneous revertants in control cultures. The testing guidelines for the Salmonella assay are included in &sect;79.68 of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Huisingh, J.L., et al, ``Mutagenic and Carcinogenic Potency of Extracts of Diesel and Related Environmental Emissions: Study Design, Sample Generation, Collection, and Preparation,'' In: Health Effects of Diesel Engine Emissions, Vol. II, W.E.

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / VW may be last to run from the Japanese bear: Christopher Parkes analyses change at Europe's leading carmaker Volkswagen's withdrawal last week from Swatch-Mobil, a development project for a high-fashion fun car, illustrates two topical points about Europe's leading motor manufacturer: this is no time for either extravagance or frivolity. The fact that VW, which is to invest an average DM9bn (Pounds 3.7bn) annually for the next five years in its vehicles operations, baulked at paying a mere DM50m a year to continue work on a promising micro-car in collaboration with the Swiss watch industry, showed how closely costs are being scrutinised. It provided few clues, however, to VW's responses to the bigger questions being asked: how the group will reverse increasing operating losses in the core Volkswagen division (DM1bn last year), reinstate itself in the US market where it has less than 1 per cent of market share, correct its German plants' relative cost disadvantages estimated at Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 660) a car vis-a-vis the Japanese, compete effectively while the D-Mark is stuck at unhelpful exchange rates, deal with the domestic demand slump, and at the same time face up to the Japanese threat. All German motor makers face similar long and short-term issues, but VW is the only one not yet to present something resembling a coherent response. The new chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, was widely expected to correct this after the extended Christmas holiday. However, little has emerged apart from shuffling and fudge. A supervisory board meeting resulted in modest cuts and unclear postponements in the group's medium-term investment plan. The personnel director, responsible for this year's 5 per cent pay award (compared with less than 4 per cent in other sectors) was moved sideways. Mr Piech's admirers had looked forward to the announcement of a grand design comprising sweeping job cuts - in the cumbersome management hierarchy, on the board as well as the shop floor - and plans, at least in outline, for an overhaul of manufacturing methods. By most estimates, VW's German manufacturing operations are carrying 50,000 surplus workers. Its flagship Wolfsburg works is regarded as a white elephant and a quality-control disaster zone. Annual sales per employee of DM286,000 in 1991 compared poorly with DM476,000 at Adam Opel, the General Motors' subsidiary, and Ford-Werke's DM466,000. Mr Piech is acting more slowly than was anticipated of a man who came from Audi proclaiming: 'How can I be patient while Japanese manufacturers' costs are 30 per cent better than those in Germany?' A little patience is necessary, however, while VW's new chief comes to terms with Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the powerful IG Metall metalworkers' union. Not only does VW management have to negotiate pay and conditions deals with Mr Steinkuhler's team, it also has to live with him as a senior member of the supervisory board. In a boardroom alliance with representatives of the Lower Saxony government - a Social Democrat/Green coalition that controls 20 per cent of VW shares - the union boss represents a formidable opponent to radical change, especially job losses. According to Mr Louis R Hughes, former head of Opel, General Motors' German subsidiary, the German industry workforce should be cut by half - 450,000 - during the next few years. Even the most modest estimates say 200,000 workers must go to retain competitiveness. The main reason for change is the build-up of low-cost Japanese capacity in European transplant works, which are expected to be capable of producing up to 2m cars a year by the end of the century (compared with 5.3m from German manufacturers). About 750,000 will be aimed at the market segments where Germany is most strongly represented. There is a further, potent force at work: recession, which has paradoxically presented indigenous manufacturers with an opportunity. It gives management a chance to hasten changes in political and popular attitudes. That is essential if structural adjustments are to happen with the minimum disruption. Job cut plans, announced by almost all German vehicle makers a year ago, have been accelerated. Short-time working is in operation in most plants, and VW and Opel have sought to drive home the none-too-subtle message to the workforce with extraordinarily grim forecasts of falls in German and European demand for cars this year of up to 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. These measures will have compounded the shock effects of recent investment decisions - BMW to open its first foreign plant in the US, Mercedes' cancellation of a DM1bn truck plant in eastern Germany and Audi's choice of Hungary instead of eastern Germany for an engine parts works. In that climate, negotiations to postpone a further one-hour cut in western engineers' working week and to water down a deal to give their eastern colleagues full-pay parity by next year have more than a fair chance of success. If the employers win, it could signal the start of the adjustment in attitudes demanded by Mr David Herman, fresh from Saab as successor to Mr Hughes. Shocked by 10 per cent absenteeism at Opel, where 3,500 production workers fail to turn up every day, he said it was time to start thinking and acting in global terms. 'In terms of productivity, labour costs, working hours and absenteeism, the German economy has fallen steadily behind its most important competitors for the past six years,' he added. Opel, like Ford-Werke, has drawn heavily on its parent's experiences with the Japanese back home in adjusting its German cost base and manufacturing methods. As part of its reward, and part of the price VW has paid for its lack of attention to domestic matters, it has won market leadership in eastern Germany. Not so long ago, Germans used to enjoy their jokes about the Opel. It was a car for proles: 'Jeder Popel braucht sein Opel.' Mr Hughes made his own joke about the German car industry as he prepared to leave Opel last summer. It concerned two hunters confronted by an angry bear. One quickly pulled on his running shoes. The other laughed: 'That's no use, the bear can easily outrun a man.' 'That's not the point,' his pal replied. 'The main thing is that I can outrun you.' German motor industry executives still like to tell it, even though few find it funny any more. Change at Porsche, Page 22 BMW sales, Page 22</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Higher raw material costs limit Waddington's advance John Waddington, the packaging, printing and games company, yesterday warned that raw material price increases were putting margins in its packaging businesses under pressure. Mr Geoff Gibson, finance director, said prices for some plastic polymers had risen by up to 70 per cent, with four increases in the US since April. Operating profits for the six months to October 1 in the packaging division, which accounts for two thirds of group turnover, fell from Pounds 6.82m to Pounds 6.68m, in spite of an increase in sales from Pounds 72.1m to Pounds 82.2m. The latest figures include contributions of Pounds 433,000 to profits and Pounds 3.16m to sales for one month from Imca Beheer, the Dutch cartons business acquired in July. The US food services business lifted operating profits from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 3.4m, while the pharmaceuticals packaging business improved from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.1m. These gains were offset by the food and drinks packaging sector, which fell Pounds 300,000 into the red (Pounds 1.4m profit). Total pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 9.01m to Pounds 9.88m on the back of a rise in turnover from Pounds 118.2m to Pounds 122.8m. The specialist printing division lifted operating profits from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 2.17m on sales up from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 27.2m. Profits from games eased to Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 2.2m), held back by supply shortages in the new ranges of radio controlled toys and pre-school toys. Sales improved to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 11.9m). Earnings per share were static at 7.88p, after restating the previous earnings following the Pounds 42m rights issue for buying Imca. The interim dividend is 3.8p (3.68p). COMMENT Raw material price rises for plastics, paper and board are unavoidable, and will soak up a lot of management time as very few of the group's contracts include automatic price increases. But they are not the sole reason that the City is cutting its forecasts for this year - the attempt to diversify away from margarine containers has not gone well. The cost of cutting capacity to meet demand will further damage profitability. Forecasts for the year have been reduced from as much as Pounds 25m to as low as Pounds 20m, giving a prospective multiple of 16, which looks about right, bearing in mind the disappointments and uncertainties.</p>

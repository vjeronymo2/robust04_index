			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (8): Nearing a digital era - Manufacturers have added a number of new features to photocopiers Long past its forecast sell by date, the analogue photocopier market is alive and well and still growing, albeit at a more modest rate than in previous years. According to Jacqueline Hendriks, document management industry analyst at Dataquest, the market increased by about 7 per cent in 1993, with 1.15m photocopiers shipped in western Europe and the UK accounting for 135,400 unit placements. However, while manufacturers are still investing heavily in the technology, with the main R&amp;D focus being on higher reliability and productivity with greater ease of use, the industry is working steadily, if quietly and cautiously, towards the digital era. Oce van der Grinten, Europe's one remaining indigenous copier manufacturer acclaimed for its 'clean and green' high volume analogue machines, has intimated that 1996 will mark the end of the line for further development of analogue machines, with all R&amp;D investment from then being devoted to digital technology. It is not as bold a step as it may sound. As part of a European office automation initiative in the 1980s, Oce hosted the first ever demonstration of digital copier-printer technology with connectivity support across multiple computer platforms. But the investment required to turn it into a commercial product line was not sustainable, so the developments were put on the back burner to await a more digitally aware marketplace. Developments across the copier industry over the past few years should make the copier-based printer (as distinct from the printer that has a multiple copy function) the preferred choice for organisations looking for a directly connected output device that can produce multiple documents sets, in colour or black and white, finished ready for distribution. State-of-the art attributes that should appeal to the computer print world include: Multiple copy speeds of up to 100 pages per minute; 100 per cent operation at full rated engine speed for every process, including double-sided copying, from image input to sorting and stapling; Robust paper feeding systems that minimise the risk of paper jams; Longer lasting components that are more environmental friendly; and Graphical displays with touch-screen controls. Epitomising the latest trends, the Minolta CS Pro (Customer Satisfaction through increased Productivity) Series is claimed to be 250 per cent more reliable than existing machines, with a CPU Watchdog facility which monitors each operation (feeding, duplex, sorting, stapling). If a fault develops, the function concerned is isolated so that other copier functions can continue to be used as normal. Higher productivity innovations include: More logical left to right feeding of originals and two-way remote diagnostics facility (Minolta); A zoom area indicator which tells the user which area of the original will be copied, plus a new print engine which only requires servicing once every 100,000 copies (Toshiba); and An I-ADF (inverting automatic document feeder) which automatically counts, feeds, copies and returns up to 50 originals in order (Panasonic). Developments from Ricoh include an auto tandem paper tray with automatic switching for continuous operation; a dual feeder which allows one job to be started as another is being completed; a 360,000-copy organic drum; and auto sensing of operator presence which automatically activates the touch-screen LCD control panel. At Sharp, the main focus is on high volume copying with an innovative vacuum paper feed system which lifts and separates each sheet of copy paper for trouble-free operation; while at Konica a low-volume copier has a clam-shell design which opens from the back rather than the side to give service engineers easier access, plus cross-range compliance with the more stringent Blue Angel II environmental standards. Most manufacturers with digital products in the wings, including Infotec, Konica, Lanier, Minolta and Ricoh, say that the bid for a share of the copier-printer market will begin in earnest in 1995. The only question is, how digital will be the products. Clever tricks offering advanced image manipulation such as 999 per cent zoom reduction and enlargement may be a talking point, but they are hardly practical features likely to win over users on a general office computer network. More useful is easy access to the document production facilities and transparent connectivity with good software. 'Digital copiers like the AR-5040 will challenge the way companies think about the role of the copier in the document production process,' says David Naylor, general manager for copiers and fax at Sharp UK. 'Features such as duplex (double sided) scanning, mailmerge, anamorphic zoom and even booklet production, combined with a SCSI interface, will bring a new level of document finishing at the workgroup level previously only available on much large, high volume copiers'. Industry analysts such as Jacqueline Hendriks of Dataquest point to the Canon GP55 which can now be delivered with a computer interface that turns it from an expensive copier into a high-speed (30 pages per minute) network laser printer/copier complete with A3, duplex, sorting and stapling capabilities. Unlike commercial concerns, educational establishments have already embraced the concept of the digital copyprinter, in the form of the upgradeable electronic duplicator from suppliers such as Alcatel, Gestetner, Infotec, Ricoh and Riso. Offering speeds up to 130 copies per minute, a high 400 DPI resolution and cost per copy of less then 1p in multi-copy mode, 40 per cent of purchasers say the cost-justification of paying a higher price for a copying facility was the ability to upgrade it to digital copier-printer at a later date to allow direct input from a personal computer. The future of digital colour copying for general office applications is not quite so certain, however. Buyers know that access to such a facility would enable them to produce more eye-catching presentations and improve their chances of winning new business, but the catalyst of change is usually cost savings. Nevertheless, the 1994 Kodak Office Imaging survey found that more than a quarter of organisations in the UK use spot colour for 10-30 per cent of document colour compared with just 6 per cent a year ago. Moreover, 50 per cent of companies reported that 10 per cent of their total document output was colour compared with one in 10 companies in 1993. Yet, according to Roger Riseley of InfoQuest, a new market research organisation, just 1,300 colour units were sold last year, with only the Canon CLC 10 selling in anything like 'real numbers, though far less than in 1992'. Partly responsible for the decline, he suggests, was the arrival of the Xerox Majestik which 'was beginning to walk away with the colour market towards the end of 1993'.</p>

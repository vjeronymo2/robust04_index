			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Excerpts] Tashkent, 20 Apr -- Maintaining political  stability and further economic development in the countries of  Central Asia not only meets the fundamental interests of the  countries of that region, but is also of important significance  for the preservation of peace in Asia and throughout the world.  This is stated in an information report issued today by the  Chinese delegation on the results of the official visit to  Uzbekistan by Chinese State Council Chairman Li Peng. China, it  stresses, supports the efforts of the Uzbek Government in  strengthening regional security and stability, steadying the  situation in the country, and developing the national economy.    Li Peng left for Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] in the afternoon.  [passage omitted]    Speaking to Uzbek parliamentarians on Tuesday [19 April],  the  head of the Chinese Government described the PRC's policy in  relation to the Central Asian republics of the former USSR who  are now living through difficulties that are typical of the  whole post-Soviet situation. The four points of China's current  policy in this region, which is populated mainly by Muslims,  include: A policy of good-neighborliness, friendship, and  peaceful coexistence, a rejection of hegemonism and a policy of  force, mutually advantageous cooperation with the purpose of  assisting general prosperity, and the development of trade and  economic ties, respect for the choice of the peoples of all  countries, recognition of the variety of models of development,  and the right of choice of a social system, respect for  independence and sovereignty, and assistance in regional  stability.    Li Peng stressed that the development of relations between  China and the Central Asian states is not directed against any  third country. It is our wish that the Central Asian states  live in harmony and develop friendly relations with all  countries, including Russia and the other CIS states, he said.  [passage omitted]    Today, the PRC State Council chairman visited the Tashkent  Valeriy Chkalov Aviation Works. Last year China leased from  Uzbekistan seven Il-76 heavy aircraft.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GODDESS GIVEN PANEL'S OK TO RISE AGAIN  </P> <P> She's back. Well, almost.  </P> <P> Creators of the tenacious "Goddess of Democracy" replica in Los Angeles  received backing Thursday from the city Cultural Affairs Commission to  resurrect the 23-foot-high statue near City Hall.  </P> <P> If final approval is given by the General Services Department, the city will  see a return of the itinerant statue, one of many copies inspired by the  goddess statue that was toppled during pro-democracy demonstrations in  Beijing's Tian An Men Square in June. The local version was hastily erected  last June atop a Civic Center footbridge, moved to Chinatown and eventually  demolished by vandals.  </P> <P> The battered pieces of the stately symbol were collected by Santa Monica  sculptor Tom Van Sant, creator of the replica and who was largely responsible  for the effort to revive the statue.  </P> <P> Van Sant, other artists and Chinatown representatives presented the commission  with a proposal to install a fortified version of the three-quarter-ton  wood-and-plastic statue in an unused flower planter to the north of City Hall  East, near the intersection of Temple and Main streets.  </P> <P> After listening to Van Sant's presentation, commission members unanimously  agreed to recommend the proposal to General Services, which is ultimately  responsible for granting permission for the monument to go up.  </P> <P> "We are pleased with the site and the terms," Van Sant said outside City Hall  on Thursday after meeting with the commission.  </P> <P> The commission's recommendation stipulated that the artists and supporters  cover the cost associated with erecting the statue. Van Sant said the tab for  materials and for installing, lighting, insuring and -- after 18 months --  removing the statue will come to about $2,500, though many of the services are  being donated.  </P> <P> The statue will be "on loan" to the city for 18 months, while a Goddess of  Democracy Statue Fund Committee attempts to raise $250,000 to create a solid  marble replica of the Goddess, Van Sant said.  </P> <P> If the marble version is made, he said, it will be offered to the Chinese  people and government as a replacement for the original Tian An Men statue.  </P> <P> "With the distinct possibility that the statue is not welcomed by the Chinese  government, we are asking the city to hold it on loan, until the gift is  accepted," Van Sant said.  </P> <P> The replica has had a rocky history in Los Angeles. In June, it was erected on  a Civic Center pedestrian footbridge without permission, then moved to  Chinatown, where vandals unceremoniously brought it down, decapitated it and  left the remains to be carted away by Van Sant and friends.  </P> <P> The sculptor has since pieced the work back together, adding wood  reinforcements to the frame, and is in the process of putting a hard, white  polyurethane and plaster surface on it "so it will be able to withstand minor  attacks," he said. Van Sant said applying the coating will take about a week.  Then the statue will be ready to go up, subject to final city approval.  </P> <P> Van Sant said he will make an appointment to pursue the final approval after  the commission notifies the General Services Department of its recommendation.  </P> <P> Van Sant said he already is planning the installation ceremony.  </P></p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Rabuka wins second Fiji term Mr Sitiveni Rabuka, who led a military coup in Fiji seven years ago, is set to be sworn in for a second term as the country's prime minister after Fiji's week-long general election left his Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party with an increased number of parliamentary seats. The SVT won one extra seat in the election, taking its tally to 31. While this is not a majority in the 70-seat parliament, the General Voters party, which was the SVT's main coalition partner in the last government, took four seats, compared with five previously. With support from a couple of independent MPs, Mr Rabuka is expected to command a slim majority in parliament and be in a position to govern. The result is a severe blow for the Fijian Association, the new party formed by SVT dissidents whose decision to vote down the 1994 budget triggered the election. The FA won only five seats, against pre-election expectations that it might gain a dozen. Mr Rabuka first became prime minister as a result of the 1992 elections, five years after leading two military coups which overthrew an Indian-dominated coalition government. On the fraught racial issue, Mr Rabuka said yesterday his party would this year consider inviting Indians to join a so-called government of national unity: 'That is still a possibility.' But he warned that no big changes could be expected to government policies discriminating against Indians in favour of Fijians. The relatively decisive clear outcome of the election may come as a relief to the business community. The country has been operating without a budget for the current year.</p>

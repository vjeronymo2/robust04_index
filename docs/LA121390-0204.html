			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CITIZEN CHARGED IN MAY KILLING OF IMMIGRANT BOY;  </P> <P> BORDER VIOLENCE: THE RANDOM SHOOTING WAS ONE OF THOSE RECENTLY DEPLORED AT A  MEETING OF U.S. AND MEXICAN PRESIDENTS. THE 12-YEAR-OLD WAS EN ROUTE FROM  MEXICO TO HIS PARENTS' APARTMENT IN STANTON.  </P> <P> Authorities arrested a laborer Wednesday and charged him with firing the shot  that killed a 12-year-old Mexican boy who was gunned down almost seven months  ago as he and family members walked along a border hillside en route to his  parents' home in Orange County.  </P> <P> The death of Emilio Jimenez Bejines is one of a number of border-area homicides  this year that led the presidents of both Mexico and the United States to  condemn the growing violence during a meeting in Monterrey, Mexico, last month.  </P> <P> Charged with first-degree murder in the shooting is Dwight Ray Pannel, a  23-year-old U.S. citizen who lives in Imperial Beach and works occasional  construction jobs. Pannel was arrested at his home and was being held in lieu  of $1 million bail. He was also charged in several robberies and an assault  case involving undocumented immigrants who were victimized earlier on the day  of the murder for "beer money," according to court papers.  </P> <P> Shortly before firing the fatal shot, according to a witness quoted in court  papers, Pannel said, "Let's shoot some aliens." He then fired a .30-caliber  hunting rifle toward a hillside where many undocumented immigrants had  gathered, the witness told investigators. Pannel fired from the rear balcony of  the home of a friend who lives about half a mile north of the international  boundary, in an area regularly traversed by migrants headed north.  </P> <P> Luis Aragon, the San Diego deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the  case, refrained from calling the shooting a racially linked "hate crime." The  suspect has no known link to organized hate groups, Aragon said.  </P> <P> Emilio was shot about 3:30 p.m. May 18. He died of a single .30-caliber gunshot  wound about 1 1/2 hours after he, two siblings and an uncle had crossed the  border.  </P> <P> The dead boy's father, who lives in a Stanton apartment house, is a legal U.S.  resident via the amnesty program, but the three youths and the boy's mother are  undocumented, according to family members.  </P> <P> "We've suffered enough from this," the boy's father, Ernesto Jimenez, said  Wednesday. "All we want is justice."  </P> <P> Enrique Loaeza, the Mexican consul general in San Diego, said the Mexican  government was "very satisfied" that the long-pending inquiry finally appeared  to be moving forward.  </P> <P> The charges against Pannel represent a major turnaround in the investigation,  the result, prosecutors say, of lengthy questioning of witnesses.  </P> <P> Throughout, investigators say, they were convinced that the fatal bullet was  fired from the rear balcony of the border-area family home of Leonard Paul  Cuen, 21, who was initially arrested as a suspect in the case but was released  10 days later. Ballistics tests have positively identified Cuen's .30-caliber  hunting rifle as the murder weapon, authorities say. Police had said Cuen fired  during a day of beer-drinking and target shooting with friends.  </P> <P> However, an affidavit now on file in Superior Court shows that at least three  men, including Cuen, fired shots from the balcony on the afternoon of the  murder. There is a direct line of fire from the balcony to the site where the  boy was felled, about 430 yards to the south, authorities say.  </P> <P> Prosecutors now say Cuen was inside the house taking a shower when the fatal  shot was fired. Pannel was on the balcony, and, according to the affidavit, two  witnesses who were also on the balcony saw Pannel fire the rifle into the hills  about the time of the boy's death.  </P></p>

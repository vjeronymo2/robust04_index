			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) --  Argentine President Carlos Menem has reported that Fidel Castro  told his Latin American colleagues he will hold elections in  Cuba when this continent becomes "integrated."    At a news conference in the aftermath of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit, which ended today in Cartagena, Menem  commented on the talks the presidents have held on the Cuban  issue and said that in order to readmit Cuba into the OAS, this  country must first return to democracy.    Commenting on the same conversation on Cuba, Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria stressed the talks held with Castro and  the hope for "gradual changes" on the island. However, Gaviria  added the Cuban president could not be persuaded.    Menem refused to disclose what was said about Cuba during  the  closed-door meeting held today by the 23 leaders who attended  the summit.    As for the conference declaration's last paragraph, which  criticizes the "coercive" measures adopted to the detriment of  some Ibero-American peoples, Menem said as soon as Cuba becomes  democratic "we will exert pressure on the United States to end  the blockade on the island." The Argentine president insisted  "the only way Cuba can join the OAS is by establishing a  democracy." However, Menem reported that the Cuban president  said that "once America becomes integrated, he will hold  elections to democratize the country."    As for Castro's statements, President Menem pointed out:  "integration is what took place in Europe," recalling the case  of Spain, where democracy arrived before being accepted into the  EEC.    Meanwhile, President Gaviria stressed "we had never held  talks on Cuba such as during these talks, and we all trust there  will be a gradual change there; that is, we hope and expect a  peaceful change to take place in Cuba."    The main issue at the news conference, also attended by  Chilean President Eduardo Frei, was the same as that of the  summit: Cuba. Fidel Castro was the talk of the town in Cartagena  when he appeared wearing a guayabera shirt instead of his  traditional army green uniform and when he angrily asked the  presidents to respect his country as he respects theirs.    President Menem said today that the Ibero-American  presidents  are "anxious" to see democracy in Cuba, adding that that all  depends on the Cubans themselves.    As for the next summit to be held in Argentina, Carlos Menem  stressed he will extend an invitation to Castro, who has  attended the four previous summits, and jokingly said: "Castro  already sees we are indeed democratic."    As he emphasized the good atmosphere attained at the  Ibero-American meeting, Gaviria pointed out the Cuban leader  already speaks of "his good friend, President Menem." The  Colombian president also commented on the different "positions"  on the Cuban issue taken by the Ibero-American countries.  However, he underscored that "the objective is the same: we all  want political and economic changes in Cuba, and we all want  Cuba to return to the inter-American system should these changes  take place."    President Gaviria told EFE we all have tried to persuade  Fidel Castro through dialogue, but there have been no  "commitments" whatsoever.</p>

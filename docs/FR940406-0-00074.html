			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The Military Departments should identify properties with potential for rapid job creation and begin, as soon as possible, but not later than completion of the new expedited McKinney Act screening (paragraph (b) of this section), an appraisal or other estimate of the property's fair market value. Such appraisals or estimates should address a range of likely market values taking into account: feasible uses for the property; the uncertainties in property development; and, current market conditions (i.e., recognizing the state of the market after a closure announcement). The appraisals should not be based on the replacement cost of the properties, since they may not be readily adaptable for civilian use. Additionally, the appraisal should not be based on the highest and best use, but the most likely range of uses consistent with local interests. The above appraisal may be accomplished for 1988 and 1991 closures if it is determined that it would be beneficial to do so and will not delay the disposal process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To assist in the appraisal/estimation of fair market value of properties with a potential for rapid job creation, and to determine if interests exist in properties not originally identified for rapid job creation, the Military Departments shall, for 1993 and 1995 closures, advertise for expressions of interest in all or any substantial part of each closing installation. For the 1993 and 1995 closures, the Military Departments shall advertise at the completion of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process (see paragraph (b) of this section). The Military Departments may advertise for expressions of interest in all or any substantial part of each closing installation on the 1988 or 1991 closure lists if it is determined that it would be beneficial to do so and will not delay the disposal process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Advertisements for expressions of interest shall be open for 6 months. Expressions of interest received should detail the intended use, the site plan, the jobs estimated to be created, the schedule for development and hiring, and an evaluation of the worth of the land and buildings. Expressions of interest will be shared with the local redevelopment authority. Advertisements for expressions of interest will be conducted simultaneously with all other disposal actions and are not an additional step in the disposal process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Military Departments shall analyze each expression of interest and determine within 30 days of receipt if it is made in good faith and represents a reasonable development proposal. If the Military Department decides that an expression of interest received demonstrates the existence of a ready market, the prospect of job creation, and offers proceeds consistent with the range of estimated fair market value, it may decide to offer the property for sale. The property proposed for sale shall promptly be publicly identified, and the redevelopment authority shall be notified. The redevelopment authority may request reconsideration of this decision under paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Potential offerors will be encouraged to work with the redevelopment authority so that their development goals will be compatible with the local redevelopment plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If a redevelopment plan has not been completed, the redevelopment authority will be encouraged to include the potential for sale of the property identified by the Military Department under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, in the plan. The DoD Component will evaluate whether the potential sale of the identified property is covered by any ongoing environmental analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Based on this evaluation, consideration can be given to integrating the potential sale into the existing analyses or preparing additional analyses required by law or otherwise deemed appropriate. The environmental impact statement shall, to the extent practicable, be completed within 12 months, or a Finding of No Significant Impact issued within 6 months, of the public announcement identifying the property proposed for sale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

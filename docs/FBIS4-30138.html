			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Seiyu Take 1.41 Billion Yen Loss; </F> Will Take Over a Part of Telecomsat Satellite Cable Circuit  Resale Operations"]    [Text] Seiyu will take a 1.41 billion yen loss when it  liquidates its Telecomsat (Minato-ku, Tokyo) satellite cable  circuit resale operations on August [1994] but will continue one  part of operations. Telecomsat was engaged in the business of  leasing repeaters from privately operated communication  satellite firms and reselling cable circuits to corporations for  intra-firm reception of television broadcasts, but had  accumulated deficits totaling 2.289 billion yen since its  startup in 1988 and had decided to liquidate during a special  shareholders' meeting held in March. Regarding the operations  which will continue, Seiyu will boost its cable circuit resale  activities and its software division for program supply and aim  for profitable operations by the end of fiscal year 1995.    The continued cable television operations will be placed  under the control of Seiyu's Communications Broadcasting  Operations Department. Reportedly, Seiyu received a Type II  Class Communications Satellite Operator's license from the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in May of this year. It  will continue itscircuit sale services with its three corporate  clients and continue to supply educational programming which is  sent to 60 locations.    Telecomsat is capitalized at 1.1 billion yen, with Seiyu  being the largest shareholder controlling 19 percent of the  company along with investments by Kawasaki Steel, Tokyo  Broadcasting System and Matsushita Electric Industrial Company.  Aside from the 300 million yen in capital paid in, Seiyu holds a  loan valued at 1.11 billion yen payable by Telecomsat.</p>

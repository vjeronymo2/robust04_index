			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRASH LENDS INSIGHT INTO SLAVE LIFE  </P> <P> It was outside the women's restroom at Mt. Vernon that archeologist Dennis  Pogue collected some of his best trash -- remnants of wine bottles, china, even  leftover dinners -- buried in a cellar of slave quarters 200 years ago.  </P> <P> Pogue said he sifted through bits of fine imported porcelain, swirled stemware  and shards of wine bottles as well as more than 25,000 bones of opossums,  sheep, cattle, geese and other animals.  </P> <P> The discovery, during a recently completed archeological dig on George  Washington's 500-acre Virginia plantation, tends to dispel some myths about  slave life, said Pogue, who works for the plantation.  </P> <P> The items, similar to many unearthed in a similar dig several years ago at  Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's home, suggest that all slaves may not have eaten  only out of gourds and crude wooden bowls as originally thought. Some may have  used china and porcelain handed down from the mansion. The wine bottles don't  necessarily suggest the slaves drank wine, Pogue said. They may have held other  liquids.  </P> <P> The range of animal bones discovered suggests that some slaves' diets were more  diverse than originally thought, that they had time to hunt and had access to  weapons, Pogue said. Lead shot also was found in the trash.  </P> <P> "We're very confident that the slaves had some weapons," Pogue said. "They had  a wider diversity of foods . . . and most of them would have come from the  slaves' own efforts."  </P> <P> The suggestion that slaves had time to hunt would quash the notion that every  slave worked from dawn to dusk, Pogue said.  </P> <P> "We're trying to be very careful not to say more than the data suggest," Pogue  continued. "We're not going to say they were living the life of Riley . . . but  clearly they had time to do these things."  </P> <P> Other academics concurred in some of Pogue's conclusions that, although slave  life was harsh, materially it may have been somewhat better than historians  previously believed.  </P> <P> "The daily life of slaves was very, very hard in comparison to the life of  their owners and other whites," said Russell Adams, chairman of the Department  of Afro-American Studies at Howard University. "The diet was borderline, enough  to keep them producing, but not enough to make them very healthy. The seasonal  work was arduous, especially when agricultural products were bringing high  prices."  </P> <P> But Adams said that after harvest, on Saturday nights and on Sundays, slaves  did have some leisure time and were encouraged to hunt to supplement their  diets and keep busy.  </P> <P> Pogue said it is unclear whether all of Washington's more than 300 slaves  enjoyed fine china and hunting privileges or just the 70 blacksmiths,  carpenters, shoemakers, spinners, weavers and other artisans who lived near the  mansion.  </P> <P> Historians have documented a plantation hierarchy that awarded the highest  status -- and best living conditions -- to slaves who worked in the mansion,  followed by those in crafts and then field hands.  </P> <P> Pogue said he hopes to dig at the site of Mt. Vernon's field slaves' quarters  this summer to compare living conditions.  </P> <P> One item unearthed at Mt. Vernon and in digs elsewhere is a type of bowl called  colonoware, a crude, unglazed kind of pottery. Archeologists wonder whether  this was made by slaves, American Indians or both, Pogue said.  </P> <P> "It may be some African holdover," Pogue said, or the bowls may have had  something to do with the kind of foods slaves ate.  </P></p>

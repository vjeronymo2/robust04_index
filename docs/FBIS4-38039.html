			<p>BFN     [Text] Competent security organs have revealed that  elements from the "Lebanese Forces" [LF] were behind an  unspecified number of crimes that took place in Lebanon, the  most important being the explosion in Tripoli's vegetable market  in 1988. This explosion came after the failure to sabotage the  gathering held in the city to mark the first anniversary of the  assassination of former Prime Minister Rashid Karami and the  explosion of vehicles in west Beirut.    Judge Joseph Mi'mari, assistant government representative to  the military court, charged 12 LF members with the following  crimes: carrying out terrorist actions; detonating booby trapped  vehicles in various parts of Lebanon; contacting the Israeli  enemy and undergoing military training in its territories; and  killing many people. The charges were made in accordance with  Articles 5 and 6 of the 11/1/1948 Law, Articles 549/201, 278,  and 463 of the Penal Code, and 72 weapons. [sentence as  published] Most of these charges are punishable by the death  sentence.    Judge Mi'mari referred the following arrested defendants to  the military investigation judge: Pierre Rizq, alias Akram;  Samir Abu- Yunus, George Lawun, Tony Khuri, Hasan Fawwaz, Michel  Istifan, Hadi Mas'ad, George Makhluf, Hadi Sham'un, 'Azar  Mukhawwal, Ghayth Zaydan, and Joseph 'Antar.    AL-SAFIR has learned that "Akram" was charged with ordering  the liquidation of detained supporters of Minister Ilyas  Hubayqah and throwing of their bodies on the main roads between  Nahr Ibrahim, Juniyah, and Beirut. "Akram", an official in the  LF security service, put those tasked with liquidating six of  Hubayqah's supporters during the 27 September 1987 operation  under observation to ensure that they would not hesitate in  carrying out the order and hence prove their loyalty to LF  leader Samir Ja'ja'.    Michel Istifan was charged with planting a device in Tripoli  on the first anniversary of the assassination of Rashid Karami.  When the device did not explode, he changed the detonator "so  as not to waste it," as he said, and planted the device in the  city's vegetable market. Many traders and pedestrians were  killed in the explosion.    The others were charged with "liquidating" Lore al-Hashim  and  her husband when they tried to blackmail her after detonating a  vehicle in the western sector of Beirut during the war.</p>

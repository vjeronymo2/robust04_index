			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Digital Equipment Corp.: The Maynard, Mass.-based computer maker reported a  loss of $256.7 million in its fourth quarter, contrasted with a profit of  $313.2 million in the year-ago period.  </P> <P> The loss came on operating revenue of $3.4 billion, down 4%. For the fiscal  year ended June 30, after pretax charges of $550 million, net income totaled  $74.4 million, contrasted with $1.1 billion in the 1989 fiscal year. Total  operating revenue was up 2% to $12.9 billion. The company said its first  quarterly loss was mainly attributable to the $400-million cost of its  restructuring program. About 3,000 employees have left the firm under a  voluntary severance program implemented as part of that restructuring. The  company also cited "the continuing economic slowdown" that is affecting U.S.  and other markets.  </P></p>

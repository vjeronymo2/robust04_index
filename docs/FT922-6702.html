			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: BP and Banesto clash over stake undertaking A SIMMERING row between British Petroleum and La Corporacion Banesto, the Spanish industrial conglomerate, flared yesterday amid accusations that each had acted in in bad faith. At the centre of the row is an alleged undertaking by Banesto, the large retail bank that controls La Corporacion, to buy from BP 2.5 per cent of stock in the bank. This stake was held by Petromed, Spain's third largest oil refiner, which was acquired by the British company for Dollars 578m in June last year. The British company allegedly does not want the Banesto stock, which represents Pta7.6bn (Dollars 73.07m) at current market prices, and Banesto is unwilling to purchase it. The dispute surfaced at yesterday's annual shareholders' meeting of La Corporacion, which was attended by BP because it also owns 2 per cent of the conglomerate's equity as a result of the Petromed purchase. BP's representative at the meeting first irritated Mr Mario Conde, chairman of La Corporacion and Banesto, with questions from the floor. He then voted against the approval of La Corporacion's 1991 accounts. BP's defiant stand broke the traditionally complacent and self-congratulatory atmosphere of such meetings in Spain. The UK company's spokesman put 16 questions to La Corporacion's board that probed allegedly over-valued investments, consultant's fees and loans.</p>

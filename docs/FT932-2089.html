			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Employers optimistic on outlook for jobs FURTHER SIGNS of employer optimism about job prospects are expressed in a survey published today by Manpower, the employment services company. The survey, part of a regular series, shows that 22 per cent of the 2,200 companies contacted forecast job increases for the third quarter of the year while 13 per cent forecast job losses, resulting in a positive net balance of 9 per cent. Manpower said this compared favourably with the net balance of minus 1 per cent last quarter and a positive net balance of 6 per cent last year. No region is forecasting net job losses in the coming quarter, with London, south Wales and the south of England among the most positive, the survey shows. Job prospects in the capital, which have been negative in the past few surveys, show a positive net balance of 3 per cent. The manufacturing and service sectors are more optimistic than last year. The banking industry, energy and water were the industries in the service sector which were most negative about job prospects. The public sector was the least positive about employment prospects. Local government was the most gloomy. Manpower said: 'The continued weakness in this sector is probably due to the increasing levels of sub-contracting and continued budgetary pressures.'

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Bank workers accept 2% rise About 440,000 German bank employees yesterday accepted a 2 per cent pay rise, bolstering hopes that non-inflationary pay settlements can be achieved across the board in Germany. After four rounds of talks and a final 12-hour session, agreement was reached in line with earlier pay rises for engineering and public sector workers but below forecast annual inflation of 3 per cent. Construction, textile and print workers are the only big labour groups who have yet to negotiate a pay deal this year. Michael Lindemann, Bonn.</p>

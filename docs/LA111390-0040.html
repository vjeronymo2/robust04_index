			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LETTER FROM NORTH POLE DELIVERED TO CHULA VISTA -- 32 YEARS LATE  </P> <P> The Breese family was never much on writing letters -- or, as it turns out, on  receiving them, either.  </P> <P> But the Breeses got lucky a few days ago when a letter dropped out of the  postal twilight zone into Chula Vista -- 32 years after it was mailed from the  Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, during the first  transpolar voyage under the North Pole.  </P> <P> "Hell, no, I haven't got the foggiest idea what was in it. I didn't even know  it was missing. I'd forgotten all about it," said Denny Breese, the seaman who  penned the missing letter to his younger brother, Nick. They learned of its  discovery last week.  </P> <P> "That was a hell of a long time ago," Denny Breese added. "I was amazed, very  surprised, to say the least, that it was found."  </P> <P> The letter -- more significant for its commemorative seal and being lost for  more than three decades than for its simple contents -- now is in the hands of  the Breese boys' father, R. V. (Bus) Breese, the 77-year-old family patriarch  who still lives in Chula Vista.  </P> <P> "Oh, my yes, it was a big surprise," Breese said. "Denny didn't write that  much. Maybe once a month at the most. The whole family is like that though.  That's what makes this all the more interesting."  </P> <P> Denny Breese, now 56 and hunting sunken treasure in the Atlantic Ocean off  North Carolina, was a 25-year-old electronics specialist when he wrote his  brother in Chula Vista a one-page letter dated Aug. 6, 1958, three days after  the historic voyage.  </P> <P> Breese, despite his disinclination to write letters, sensed a bit of history in  the making and hurriedly penned 15 to 20 letters to relatives and friends.  </P> <P> The letters were stamped with special markings -- a large map of the North Pole  and postmarked USS NAUTILUS. NORTH POLE. 11:15 p.m. AUG. 3, 1958 -- and sent  off.  </P> <P>  Nick, this will be short, but I just found out that (the) mail is leaving the  boat in about 15 minutes. Please forgive me, I promise I'll write soon as we  get in.... I just want you to get this envelope that was stamped at the North  Pole. Some people think they'll be worth money to collectors someday. Drop me a  line. I'll write from England.  </P> <P>  Love, your brother,  </P> <P>  Denny.  </P> <P>  The Nautilus' voyage was a success, but the letter disappeared. Denny Breese  wasn't the only one to have forgotten it.  </P> <P> "No, he didn't know anything about it until just the other day," said Nick's  wife, Sandra, from Ft. Worth, Tex., where he lives now. "It was a surprise."  </P> <P> Although postal officials occasionally can explain the whereabouts of missing  letters being delivered years later -- there have been sacks of mail discovered  in long-locked attics or closets -- no one seems to know where Denny Breese's  letter has been all these years.  </P> <P> Apparently, it did not even attract the attention of the mail carrier who  delivered it; he must have been either dead-tired at the end of the day, or  else he regularly handles cargo from the Eisenhower era.  </P> <P> San Diego postal officials say they have no idea where the letter was, but last  week the letter arrived at the old Breese homestead in Chula Vista.  </P> <P> The Breeses moved more than 20 years ago, but the house's residents now, Kathy  Atkinson and Samuel and Amanda Rothstein, asked neighbors and learned that Bus  Breese still lived a few blocks away. They hand-delivered it.  </P> <P> "That was awful nice of them," Breese said. "They didn't have to do that. They  could have just thrown it away."  </P> <P> Breese, a prizefighter during the Depression and a retired fire chief, said he  will keep the letter for at least a few days until he decides how to get it to  his son, Nick.  </P> <P> Breese thinks highly of the U.S. Post Office -- "I've never had a bill lost  yet," he said -- but he is hesitant about dropping the long-lost letter into  another mailbox.  </P> <P> "I could send it special delivery, but I don't know," he said. "The odds of it  getting lost again are 10 million to one, but Nick might be out here soon, so  maybe I could just wait and hand it to him.  </P> <P> "That might be the best bet."  </P></p>

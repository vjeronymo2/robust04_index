			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Why Natasha and Irina are up for sale: Nicholas Woodsworth finds pathos in communism's collapse as he travels with a modern-day white slaver on the Tbilisi-Yerevan express to a brothel IT IS mid-day, and in the dismal suburbs of Yerevan, Rosa sits at her kitchen table in a red dressing gown, smoking cigarettes and slowly waking up. By the window, her face plump in the grey autumn light, Natasha begins to work on the pullover she is knitting. She is hungover, keeps missing stitches, and occasionally breaks the silence with muttered Russian curses. At the end of the tiny kitchen, Anna stands over a mirror placed on the top of the refrigerator. Carefully she applies lipstick, eye-liner, and rouge. Anna is 17 and loves colour, music and anything else that brightens life in this benighted city of the former Soviet Union. Don't I think, she asks me in broken English as she gazes intently in the mirror, that most Armenian women are dull and dowdy? I find myself unable to reply. I murmur non-commitally, and continue to sip tea. Somewhere along the way in the last few days I have lost any feeling for the criteria normally used to judge people. These are, after all, peculiar times. Not long ago the Soviet Union was known as one of the most controlled, monitored, and regulated societies in the world. Now, even here in traditional, conservative Armenia, isolated by the Caucasus and far from the main theatres of change, revolution has stood everything on its head. Political and economic structures have collapsed. Ideological guidelines have disappeared. Communism has failed. Capitalism has yet to get off the ground. In this limbo none of the old rules, or any rules at all, seem to pertain, except one: if the system does not work, work the system. Like the streets of Moscow, Odessa or Tashkent, the streets of Yerevan have become schools of hustle, scam and the wilder extremes of free market philosophy. Are most Armenian women dull and dowdy? I cannot say, any more than I can say if these three women lounging away the morning in deshabille are, in their practise of prostitution, vulgar or immoral. For them morality or immorality is beside the point; what counts is simply getting by. My intrusion into the lives of Rosa, Natasha and Anna was not a calculated one. It began, as many irregular things begin, with a train journey. The night train to Armenia from neighbouring Georgia is not well organised. There is not a single light on the main platform of Navtluqi Station in Tbilisi. Trains leave at irregular hours from platforms announced at the last second. Conductors remain indifferent to the fate of their charges. The Tbilisi-Yerevan express seems symbolic of the whole juddering ride of eastern Europe into the western world. Half an hour after we pulled out of Tbilisi, I was still wandering dim, crowded corridors, looking for a carriage and compartment that turned out not to exist. What I did find, however, was a squat, ugly, powerfully-built Armenian named Aram. Aram had a large white smile and a lot of gold rings on his fingers. He was proud of his second-hand knowledge of England. He stopped me in the corridor, and we chatted about Big Ben for a while. Then, after a short silence, he told me he was not travelling alone. 'Two girls I have with me', he said with an air of self-congratulation. 'That's nice. Are they little girls?', I responded, thinking him merely one more proud father. 'No', he replied with his widest smile and appropriate wide-palmed gestures over his chest. 'They are big girls.' In Aram's tiny, overheated train compartment I met Gala and Irina. Gala, a tall redhead in her late teens, was decked out in skimpy cotton pyjamas. Irina, heavier-set and a little older, was dressed in a good deal less, and struggled into a track suit as introductions were made. Neither women were great beauties, but both had a youthful freshness. As the train rattled through the night we brewed thick black Turkish coffee, drank Georgian brandy, chain-smoked an endless supply of Aram's American cigarettes, and made small talk. 'I am not interest money, I am not interest politics,' Aram explained through a heavy tobacco fug. 'I am interest only love.' He smiled at Gala and gave her a quick tweak on the bottom. She smiled back. But Aram's interest in love, it turned out, was not on the lines of simple boy-meets-girl romance. Aram, in fact, was a modern-day white slaver, and was running Irina and Gala down to Armenia from their home in the Ural mountains. These were not hardened pros. Like a large and growing number of young women in the former Communist states, they were pushed into prostitution by a lack of any other livelihood. In the Urals, they had been just two more mouths to feed; in Yerevan, they would be exotic, light-complexioned objects of attraction, and make themselves and their procurer a livelihood. When they had had enough and made sufficient money, they said, they would head back to their homes and a more normal life. In the meantime, Aram was finding them a distraction from a long and boring trip. Perhaps I, too, he inquired hospitably, would enjoy a little distraction? It would cost only 30 roubles an hour, about 95 US cents at today's exchange rate, surely an honest price for a friend. He indicated the compartment's narrow upper bunk. What does this signify, a country which was part of a global superpower, that put men into space and proclaimed 70 years of struggle for human dignity, offering up its youth for the price of a bag of crisps? I looked around the tiny room, not more than four by six feet square, and at the faces of Gala and Irina, lively with talk and brandy. Before I had time to reflect on the meaning of it all, there was a timely knock at the door. Irritably assigning me a new compartment, a ticket collector brought the evening to a rapid halt. But Aram had offered me more than just an hour with Gala and Irina; before I left he also offered me a place to stay in Yerevan. For a small introductory fee, he said, he would take me to a friend of his, someone who would welcome extra dollars in exchange for a few night's stay. What he did not tell me was that his friend was a madam running a call-girl business. Rosa, when I meet her, is a middle-aged woman with a tired face and kind eyes. Once she was pretty, but has let herself go. She smokes incessantly, drinks too much, and has put on too much weight. There are times when she is bright and animated, others when she sits despondently in the kitchen, her face drained and vacant. It does not take long to get to know her; she is friendly, intelligent, and warm-hearted. She is also frank about her business; it is, she says, the only way she and her daughter Anna have been able to survive. Rosa is well educated. Divorced, she has a degree in Slavonic studies from the University of Yerevan, and worked for 15 years as an office manager in a state-owned electronics firm. Her salary was 450 roubles, a sum that each month allowed her to make less than two week's worth of essential household purchases. Arranging sexual contacts is not making Rosa rich, but it gets her through the month. Many of her clients, functionaries in state factories and marketing networks, pay her in commodities much more appreciated than roubles - sugar, coffee, eggs, meat, soap and other items unavailable in the shops can be found in Rosa's kitchen. But without leaving her cramped studio flat, where day couches and collapsible cots make up accommodation for us all, I can see that life on the whole remains what it has long been - a dull exercise in cynicism, futility and resignation. Things, in fact, are even worse now than they were before. The room in which we live remains dark for most of the day; after Armenia's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, oil imports for power generation were cut. Gas for cooking and heating in these suburbs is fast running out, too, and will be gone before mid-winter. If it were not for Rosa's business, we would be living, as most people are, simply on fruits and vegetables harvested this autumn - soon these will run out. There is nothing to buy in the shops and housing is appalling. From the window I can see endless rows of apartment blocks stretching away to the horizon - they are so uniformly dingy, dilapidated and overcrowded that the suburb is known locally as Bangladesh. 'In Armenia,' Rosa tells me one afternoon between telephone calls and the comings and goings of grotesquely made-up women, 'everything is a problem. Food. Clothing. Transport. Heating. Electricity. All are problems. But sex, sex is no problem.' Indeed, the one import that still seems to be in steady supply from Russia is young women. Thus the presence of Gala and Irina on the train, and of plump, fair-haired lodger Natasha in Rosa's flat. Armenian men, it seems, prefer blondes. And Russian prostitutes, according to Rosa, offer the additional advantage of being less fussy. 'Armenian girls want presents, expensive dinners, and American dollars,' she says. 'Russian girls are happy with vodka and roubles.' For her daughter Anna, Rosa wants much more than presents or dinners - she wants to get Anna out of Armenia and living with distant relatives in Paris. For this she is saving every rouble she can to exchange for black market dollars. 'Isn't immigration to the west very difficult?', I ask. 'Not as difficult as staying here and living as I do,' Rosa replies grimly. For the moment Anna is nothing like her mother - she is friendly with the girls who work for Rosa, but does not share or want their life. She believes in another future. She wants to study computer programming, have money to buy fashionable clothes, and live somewhere where the halls do not stink of boiled cabbage. A couple of days after I arrive Anna and I escape the telephone calls and Natasha's fish-net stockings hanging over the broken bathroom radiator, and indulge in one of her favourite pastimes - going to church. It is not that Anna is overly religious, but in this Soviet-designed city of vast stone ministries and oppressive monumental statuary, there are few other places quite as appealing. Off Mashtots Avenue, we enter a dark and ancient orthodox church smelling of incense and candles. Anna crosses herself and we each light half a dozen thin wax tapers. We place them, besides scores of others, in front of a brass-bound triptych and richly-coloured oil paintings of the Virgin Mary. Suffused in the rich golden glow of candlelight, Anna's face, for just a moment, mirrors the contented faces in the images before her. One afternoon Rosa and Natasha, dressed and made up, told me to get my jacket on; they had a surprise, they said. Outside in the street a driver and battered black car were waiting, and in we piled. We cruised through the city, picking up women at shabby tenements here and there until the car was jammed and reeking of perfume. We entered an industrial zone, a wasteland of crumbling breeze block hangars and rusted-out trucks, and stopped outside an office. Three evil-looking men, all whiskers, cheap baggy suits and gold teeth, climbed into another beat-up black car and followed us. We repeated the process a number of times, until four black cars were on our tail. The cortege rolled out into the arid and rocky Armenian countryside, the girls chatting, Rosa enjoying my mystification. After an hour's drive through desolate, denuded hills, we arrived at Lake Sevan. In official tourist guidebooks the lake is known as the Jewel of Armenia, in the annals of Soviet hydro-electric power generation as an ecological disaster - constant drainage over the decades has almost destroyed it. Nonetheless, it is still a place to which Armenians repair for recreation. Recreation is what we came for, too. The evil men with gold teeth turned out to be managersof a state food co-operative, friends of Rosa. They had arranged a banquet at one of the lakeside hotels, but this was not really the main programme of the day. Within no time, polite toasts over pickled peppers, kebabs and Lake Sevan trout had turned into a lusty, uninhibited drinking binge. We toasted the past, the present, the future. We toasted our parents, our children, our friends, each other. We toasted Great Britain, we toasted Russia, we toasted any country we could think of. And with each toast we tossed down small tumblers of ice-cold vodka. Through the afternoon, in ragged succession, the men in baggy suits disappeared upstairs, girls in their arms and room keys in their hands. But finally, another kind of sensuality, some sort of deeper racial communication, surfaced through the laughter and alcoholic fog. By the time the soft light of evening crept over Lake Sevan, we were deep in remembrance of the fate of Armenia. We drank in memory of countless invasions of Armenia, of Turkish butchery, of Soviet oppression, of diaspora, droughts, earthquakes, and endless suffering. We were drinking for the relief of Armenia's pain. We danced, hands outspread above our heads. We sang, tears rolling down our faces. The ultimate end of the evening was not titillation, but commiseration. The next day, we are all dreadfully hung-over and Rosa's kitchen, not so mysteriously, is full of good things to eat. Once again Rosa is smoking at the table, Natasha is knitting and swearing, and Anna is putting on make-up. I sit there watching and thinking sadly of Anna's question to me. The truth is that, despite the make-up, the wild evenings, the drink and the men, life for these women is dull and dowdy. It is as cramped, cold, and unlovely as the flat that we are sitting in or the city that surrounds us. From an armchair in a more comfortable flat, in a more prosperous city somewhere in the West, the collapse of the communist system may appear highly desirable. It may even look glamorous. But closer up, there is no glamour, there is only pathos. For with it has come a collapse of moral authority, social concern and, ultimately, human values. Rosa, Natasha and Anna did not deserve communism. But neither do they deserve the new order which, for a long time to come, may prove to be no order at all.</p>

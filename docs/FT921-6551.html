			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: News Corp hopes to raise up to Dollars 1bn MR RUPERT MURDOCH, the international media magnate whose News Corporation last year restructured Dollars 8.2bn of group debt, said he hoped to raise up to Dollars 1bn over the next 12 months through long-term securities that will allow News Corporation to reduce its level of bank debt. Mr Murdoch, who on Monday announced plans to succeed the departing Mr Barry Diller as chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's Fox movie and television group, disclosed the debt reduction plan in an interview. 'We are going to have good profits at News Corp (in the year that ends this June 30) and as credit ratings improve we will go for more long-term debt issues to pay down more bank debt,' he explained. Turning to Fox, which contributed around Dollars 340m of News Corporation's operating income of Dollars 1.2bn in the financial year to last June 30, Mr Murdoch said he planned to devote three weeks out of every month on the day-to-day operations of Fox Inc, the parent company of the 20th Century Fox movie studio and the Fox television network. Mr Diller, who built the Fox TV network single-handedly over the past five years, surprised the US entertainment industry when he resigned on Monday in order to form or acquire his own business. 'I never though of bringing anyone else in,' said Mr Murdoch, adding that he had moved his base of operations to Los Angeles last year and planned to be at Fox 'as much as Barry was'. 'Now I can get back to what I like to do the best, which is running the business,' said Mr Murdoch, adding that Fox represents the biggest part of News Corporation's earnings. He said Fox's total operating income was likely to be Dollars 20m to Dollars 25m below last year's Dollars 340m level in the year to June 30, with the movie studio's profits down by Dollars 30m to Dollars 40m and the television network's earnings improved. Mr Murdoch added he planned to be involved in all aspects of the film and television business, including decisions on which films to make. He admitted he does not have film experience, but explained: 'The role I have to play is to say no, to employ an editor's judgment on movies and to make people sell ideas to me.'</p>

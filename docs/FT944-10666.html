			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (4): Diversity takes some odd shapes - The effect of the trend away from conglomerates on big companies Like many international corporations, Finnish companies have in recent years undergone a marked trend away from diversification. But the process has still left a clutch of oddly-shaped companies whose activities include such strange combinations as tennis racquets and cigarettes, sweets and contraceptives and diesel engines and lavatories. Finnish companies branched out into increasingly diverse areas of industry and business in the 1970s and 1980s, partly to find ways of continuing to grow in a limited home market and partly to take advantage of the relative lack of foreign competition, kept out by restrictions on foreign ownership. The rigours of recession, the falling of regulatory barriers and growing pressure to focus operations in areas where maximum returns can be gained have meant Finnish companies have followed the international fashion away from conglomerates. The most famous example is undoubtedly Nokia. Originally rooted in the forestry industry, by the late 1980s Nokia encompassed a sprawl of businesses covering forestry, engineering, computers and telecommunications  -to name but a few. Its concentration since 1992 on fixed and mobile telephony has reaped Nokia huge rewards (see article below). Other less well-known companies have followed a similar path with some success, becoming overwhelmingly dependent on foreign markets. But they have nevertheless remained, if no longer conglomerates, at least strangely-shaped groups with unlikely collections of interests. The following are three prominent examples: Amer Group. With annual turnover of around FM8bn, the group combines ownership of Wilson Sporting Goods, one of the world's top sports equipment labels, with concessions to sell Toyota, Citroen and Suzuki vehicles and make Philip Morris tobacco brands in Finland and a printing and publishing division. The group was set up in the 1950s to manufacture American-style cigarettes for the Finnish market - hence the name Amer. But Mr Seppo Ahonen, the chief executive brought in from Nokia two years ago, is steadily narrowing the group's focus down to sporting equipment and leisure products. Sporting goods already account for almost 50 per cent of group sales. This year Amer's remaining interests in the paper industry are being sold off. Mr Ahonen, who announced a three-fold rise in pre-tax profits in the first eight months to FM135m, says he is ready to consider offers for all non-sporting goods operations, which are all profitable. If they are sold, Amer will be a company whose dominating interest is a high-profile company involved in a highly competitive and marketing-sensitive business based thousands of miles away in Chicago. But Mr Ahonen is undaunted. He sees advantages in being headquartered in Helsinki, guiding a business with worldwide sales. 'I like the European way,' he says. 'I think we are prepared to give more time for long-term investments to develop than they are in America.' Huhtamaki. Started by Finnish confectioner Heikki Huhtamaki in the 1920s, the group had grown to encompass more than 10 business areas in the early 1980s. Since then a pattern of restructuring has left Huhtamaki in three industries - confectionery, food packaging and pharmaceuticals. Like Amer, annual sales stand around the FM8bn mark, with 41 per cent in North America where the Leaf business is the third largest player in the non-chocolate confectionery market. Leaf accounts for more than 60 per cent of sales, followed by the Polarcup packaging division with 25 per cent and Leiras, a company focused on contraceptives, with 12 per cent. Group profits in the first eight months were FM309m on sales of FM5.6bn. 'We don't think of ourselves as a diversified company any more,' says Mr Eero Aho, chief financial officer. 'Generally speaking, we are a food company as confectionery is a branch of the food industry and Polarcup is a food service industry.' Huhtamaki does not make any attempt to pretend that there are great synergies between the divisions, however. And Mr Aho admits: 'There is some kind of conglomerate discount in our share price, but it is difficult to say how much.' But the group says it is happy with the shape of the company and has no plans for further rationalistion. Metra. In its present form, the group was founded in 1991 through the merger of two diversified groups, Wartsila and Lohja. Today it revolves around the Wartsila main businesses of diesel engines - in which it is a world leader - bathroom equipment and security systems. After the merger, Metra, which last year had group sales of FM9.5bn, began a process of slimming down the newly-formed group. That included divestment of such diverse interests as Lohja Caravans, the largest supplier of caravans in the Nordic region, and Lohja building materials operations in the US. This year a further big step was taken when agreement was reached to merge Abloy Security, the group's locks and security systems unit, with the lock operations of Sweden's Securitas to form AssaAbloy, in which Metra will eventually have a 40 per cent holding. The move will leave Metra heavily weighted towards Wartsila diesel, which in the first eight months of this year accounted for FM3.7bn out of Metra's total sales, including Abloy, of FM7bn. The diesel operations are widely spread around the globe and Wartsila is a market leader in diesel generators. It sits oddly with Sanitec, the sanitaryware operation that remains Metra's second largest area of operations. But with sales and profits in the diesel division hit this year by project postponements and engine line development costs, Metra can argue that a simultaneous improvement in Sanitec's profitability is a valuable counter-balance, contributing FM195m in operating profits to the group's eight-month operating profit of FM413m - more than Wartsila.</p>

Noting that peace in the Middle East is of  great significance to the whole world, President Moi said it was  proved that no conflict is impossible to resolve amicably. The  president therefore hoped that the avenues for peace that have  so far been opened up will lead to everlasting peace in the  Middle East.    President Moi at the same time called on Israeli investors  to  look to Kenya and East Africa as an area (?ripe) for investment  and to join hands in partnership with the region. President Moi  was speaking during a luncheon hosted in his honor by the  Israeli prime minister, Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin, during his second day  in that country.    On the civil strife in Somali, the president once again  pleaded with leaders of the various factions to appreciate the  dignity of human life and give peace a chance. He noted that  civil strife in that country continued to have significant  implications in neighboring countries, especially Kenya. On the  Sudan, however, President Moi said that mediation efforts are  being made by the member states of the Intergovernmental  Authority on Drought and Development, IGADD, of which he is the  chairman. The president hoped that peace will eventually return  to southern Sudan. President Moi expressed his satisfaction at  the development taking place in South Africa, despite the  problems which must be overcome before final and sustainable  harmony is achieved.    The president commended the Israelis for their great  achievements in sectors of development like in agriculture,  technology and particularly in irrigation. He observed that  Israel faced similar problems to those facing Kenya and cited  uncertain rains, extensive arid land and infertile soils but  which he said had not stopped Israel from developing. He added  that the Government of Kenya values cooperation in all aspects  of development -- cultural, economical, political and  technological. However, he said there was need to strengthen  that cooperation. Later President Moi and Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin, on behalf of their governments, signed an  agreement on culture, science and education.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Shephard's pastoral vision: Alison Maitland and Deborah Hargreaves interview the agriculture secretary FARMERS need to improve their image and convince the public that they are doing something in return for more than Pounds 1bn in aid they receive each year, according to Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister. Mrs Shephard, who meets her European Community counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday, wants action to curb EC spending on agriculture combined with greater emphasis on the environment. She said a 'greener' Common Agricultural Policy made sense to the public so it was 'a much bigger question than just fiddling about with the regulations'. This would mean allowing whole farms to be taken out of production under controversial set-aside rules and turning over land for woodland. Britain was pushing hard for further reform of the CAP and reductions in the 'ludicrous' levels of EC beef stocks. In her 4 1/2 months in the job, Mrs Shephard has been working to force further CAP reform. Mrs Shephard, the daughter of a Norfolk smallholder, relishes the 'hands-on' aspects of her brief. But there has been some disappointment that she has failed yet to tackle some pressing matters. Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, stresses that 'there are a number of decisions which now require urgent attention'. Some critics suggest Mrs Shephard may be ducking difficult issues. Some of these, such as the future of set-aside schemes and the eventual objectives of a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement, require intense negotiation at EC or international level. But Mrs Shephard must also resolve some important UK matters. She must decide whether to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, the statutory minimum pay body for farm workers, in the face of opposition from employers and farm workers alike. She must also rule on the dispute over restrictions on the number of days fishermen can spend at sea and preside over milk market de-regulation. Farmers have argued that the diffuse nature of the industry makes the Agricultural Wages Board more important than other wages boards abolished by Mrs Shephard when she employment secretary. But she is not convinced. However, she hinted that concessions might be made on the fishing dispute. At the moment, the rules on days at sea, due to come into force in January, will affect all UK fishermen with trawlers more than 10 metres long. But she suggested the limits might be applied more selectively. In addition, she is keen to see British farmers tailor production more closely to the needs of consumers. Mrs Shephard is keen to erode the UK's Pounds 6bn food trade deficit, but has been criticised by the industry for not making money available to encourage consumers to buy British. Mrs Shephard said the government was looking at helping producers with strategy and market planning rather than giving more cash help. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has traditionally had a close relationship with farmers. Mrs Shephard takes a broad view of its role as encompassing the whole of the rural economy.</p>

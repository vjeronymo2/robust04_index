			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Saudi Aramco in new oil joint venture talks SAUDI ARAMCO, the state oil producer and refiner, is negotiating with two South East Asian oil refining groups over a potential multi-billion-dollar joint-venture refining agreement. The negotiations show Aramco is determined to continue its long-standing policy of guaranteeing supplies of crude to its major markets through joint refining deals, despite this week's cancellation of a Pounds 6.27bn project with Japan's three leading oil refiners. The Saudis did not reveal the names of the two South East Asian companies, but oil officials said the talks were towards a deal of similar scale to that which broke down this week. Saudi Aramaco is discussing the possibility of buying into and upgrading existing refineries in the region as well as building new plants. The talks are understood to be well advanced. Nippon Oil, Nikko Kyodo and Arabian Oil announced on Monday they were pulling out of the proposed deal with Saudi Aramco and Caltex Petroleum of the US due to the slump in demand for petroleum products resulting from Japan's economic slowdown. The joint venture would have purchased two existing refineries from Nippon Oil and Nikko Kyodo, while building a third in southern Japan. Mr Yasushi Ebihara, managing director of Nippon Oil, said his group was keen to proceed with the project and build the new refinery 'as soon as possible,' but Nikko Kyodo had wanted, for economic reasons, to postpone the project. The Saudis said the deal had fallen through over disagreements between the Japanese partners. They denied they had welcomed its cancellation for reasons of Saudi Arabia's own persistent budget deficits, or because Saudi Aramco is undergoing the considerable task of merging with Samarec, the state oil refining and marketing arm. Saudi Aramco says it was confident of having been able to finance the Japanese joint venture and had no doubts about its ability to finance another possible deal.</p>

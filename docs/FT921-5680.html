			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Telefonica lifts profits and payout by 6.7% TELEFONICA, Spain's government-controlled telecommunications group, lifted net profits in 1991 by 6.7 per cent to Pta80.9bn (Dollars 783m). It plans to increase its dividend by the same percentage to Pta87.2 per share from Pta81.7 in 1990. Presenting consolidated accounts for the first time to meet stock market rulings, Telefonica posted after-tax profits of Pta103.9bn due to good results at home and abroad plus asset disposals. Consolidated subsidiaries, in which the parent company has a 20 per cent to 50 per cent holding, include Chile's CTC and Entel telephone networks. Together, these contributed Pta7.7bn to group profits. A further Pta20bn was earned through the disposal of Telefonica's stakes in Alacatel and Telettra following the merger of the two companies last year. Income from subsidiaries and disposals helped Telefonica comfortably through extraordinary costs of Pta19.4bn incurred by Telefonica's decision to transfer its in-house pension scheme to the national security system. News of this development last week caused a sharp drop in the group's share price. Group capital investment fell by 13.6 per cent last year to Pta589.1bn after years of sustained expansion in new equipment and lines. Demand for new lines fell by 10.6 per cent last year, constituting a key indicator of the slowdown of the domestic economy.</p>

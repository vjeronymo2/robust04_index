			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In two articles, AL-THAWRAH speaks about the  dimensions of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its impact on the  Middle East peace process.    The first article, under the headline "Settlers, A Major  Pillar of Occupation," talks about the dangers Israeli  settlement activity poses to the peace process and the  impossibility of achieving peace under this settlement activity,  which is a form of occupation.    AL-THAWRAH asserts that contrary to the expectations of  Israeli rulers, the monstrosity of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  has revealed to the whole world that the complex of racism  controls Zionists, particularly the settlers. The massacre  revealed the extent of their black rancor against Arabs, to the  point of physical liquidation. Those people do not care about  the negative -- in fact destructive -- impact this will have on  the peace process, on which the world community pins great hopes  of achieving a just and comprehensive peace.    AL-THAWRAH says such a peace cannot be established before  the  Israeli occupiers and the Zionist settlers leave the occupied  territories. Let the settlers be the first to do this.    The paper adds: If the international community wants the  bilateral peace talks to resume, then appropriate resolutions  should be issued to provide international protection for  Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, to disarm the  settlers, and to deploy international observers as a prelude to  dismantling the Zionist settlements.    In the second article, under the headline "Incapable  Security  Council", the paper speaks about another aspect of this issue.  It explains that the Security Council's slowness in issuing an  appropriate resolution regarding Israel's responsibility for the  massacre and the situation in the occupied territories has  exacerbated matters and encouraged the Yitzhaq Rabin government  to go further in its measures to kill Palestinians and impose a  tight military siege and curfew following the massacre.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Rabin has shown an extreme disregard by not  ruling out a repeat of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre elsewhere in  the occupied territories. He wants to threaten the Palestinians  with new massacres and takes lightly the Security Council.    The paper says Arabs have a fair and necessary demand before  the Security Council. They want the Security Council resolution  to refer to an international deployment to ensure the security  of Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, including  the city of Jerusalem as part of the 1967-occupied territories.    The paper adds: Israeli policy, which is drowning in  terrorism, aims at depriving Washington of any peaceful  achievement, as long as the United States does not intervene and  only asks the parties concerned with the peace process to reach  solutions, and avoids applying pressure.    The paper concludes: Israel does not really want peace. The  evidence is the obstruction of the peace talks, the increase of  Israeli crimes, and the continuing construction of settlements  and the occupation of Arab territories. Peace does not coexist  with occupation.</p>

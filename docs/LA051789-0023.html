			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION BACKED  </P> <P> Santa Clarita transportation planners will recommend next week that the City  Council approve building a bridge that has pitted two neighborhoods against  each other, the city's public works director said Tuesday.  </P> <P> City planners are still preparing recommendations on when and how the bridge  would be built, Public Works Director John Medina said.  </P> <P> The proposed bridge would cross railroad tracks, San Fernando Road and the  Santa Clara River to connect Wiley Canyon Road and Via Princessa.  </P> <P> Residents of the Circle J housing development say the bridge will provide a  badly needed second access for their secluded neighborhood. But residents west  of San Fernando Road say it will bring unwanted traffic into their area.  </P> <P> Representatives from both neighborhoods met with city officials Monday night in  hopes of negotiating a compromise. But in the end, Medina said, Circle J  residents still demanded the bridge. The other group still opposed it.  </P> <P> In a related development, Councilman Carl Boyer III has endorsed the bridge,  calling it a necessary link in the city's overall road system. But the city  should first spend highway funds on building Rio Vista Road, a proposed  north-south artery, before constructing the bridge, he said.  </P> <P> The council will consider the issue Tuesday.  </P></p>

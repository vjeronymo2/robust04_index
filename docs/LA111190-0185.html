			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE SWEEPS CONSTRUCTION SITE OF LUXURY APARTMENTS;  </P> <P> ACCIDENT: BLAZE DESTROYS 330 UNITS. FIREFIGHTERS WERE HAMPERED BY DRY WINDS AND  LACK OF ACCESS TO WATER.  </P> <P> A fire that surged through a vast, half-completed luxury apartment complex in  Thousand Oaks gutted 330 apartments as firefighters, struggling with virtually  empty fire hydrants, worked to bring it under control late Saturday, fire  officials said.  </P> <P> The fire that razed 22 of the 36 buildings at The Knolls was started by a  plumber's soldering tool, Ventura County Fire Department officials said. The  damage to the $40-million project was set at $7 million, according to Regis  Homes Corp., partner and co-owner of the project.  </P> <P> A Ventura County fire captain was hospitalized for heat exhaustion and smoke  inhalation, and a Los Angeles city firefighter was treated at the scene.  </P> <P> More than 200 firefighters, summoned from 30 companies across Ventura and Los  Angeles counties, labored against dust-dry 25-m.p.h. winds that sent flames  veering capriciously over the rooftops of the unfinished, 540-unit  Mediterranean-style complex.  </P> <P> Their efforts were hampered as well by fire hydrants that were either  unreachable -- ringed with fire that leaped from street to street within the  heart of the complex -- or merely dribbling out water at low pressure, Ventura  County fire spokesman John Wade said.  </P> <P> "The fire forced them back away from the others (hydrants)," said Wade, and  when they were at last able to move back in, "some hydrants were dry."  </P> <P> When the nearby hydrants failed, firefighters set up a modern-day bucket  brigade, a "relay" of five or six firetrucks, linked up to pump water from  hydrants in a housing complex more than a quarter-mile from the fire.  Helicopters were called to ferry in water to supplement the supply.  </P> <P> Water mains within The Knolls were apparently either broken or shut off, Fire  Engineer Karry Ellison said. Fire officials will investigate whether the mains  were broken or had been shut off while plumbing work was being done, Wade said.  </P> <P> Three times Capt. Keith Mashburn's crew set up and laid out lines, he said, and  three times they packed it all up and moved because water pressure was so poor.  </P> <P> As fire raced through the open-beam unfinished construction, engines at one  point had to roll back from the searing intensity. One engine was badly  damaged, and on Mashburn's own engine, the taillights were melted into red  lumps by the heat.  </P> <P> Several hours after the 2:52 p.m. call, firefighters had gained the upper hand,  in part thanks to a natural fire break -- the wide main street leading into the  complex, which was to have been ready for its first tenants by the end of the  month.  </P> <P> The blaze that hurtled through the lavish complex, outfitted with tennis  courts, spas and pools, began when a plumbing contractor doing silver soldering  on the first floor of one apartment building inadvertently set the wire  smoldering, Wade said. Unbeknown to him, it spread up through the wire to the  second floor, where the blaze began in earnest.  </P> <P> "He was on the first floor," said Wade. "He did not even realize that the fire  had made a run to the second floor." Once he did, the plumber told a security  guard, who telephoned the Fire Department.  </P> <P> About a mile away, floating sparks from the main fire set off two small brush  fires, but they were quickly put out by firefighters.  </P> <P> Ironically, the roof tiles that sometimes protect houses from leaping flames  had not yet been installed on all roofs of the project, and stacks of tiles sat  waiting on the burning roof of one building.  </P> <P> At one point officials thought they might have to evacuate a home for cerebral  palsy patients about two miles north of the fire, but did not. Sheriff's  deputies did roll through a nearby neighborhood, knocking on doors or  admonishing residents by bullhorn to be ready to clear out if necessary.  </P> <P> "I put all my photo albums in the car," said Rosalie Mastrolonardo, whose  neighbors also loaded up their cars and waited for the evacuation order that  never came.  </P> <P> Dianna Riddle, a nursing student, said that after deputies came through three  times, she filled the car with the family's pet Yorkshire terrier, some photos  and earthquake supply kits, and "hundreds of dollars" in new nursing-school  books and uniforms. As she drove, many of her neighbors were placidly watching  the smoke from the fire, their children skateboarding idly down the street.  They were still there when she returned about 90 minutes later, the danger  past.  </P> <P> Along the rims of nearby hillsides, dozens of people came out to stand and  watch the spectacle of embers and smoke, to the annoyance of firefighters.  </P> <P> The development has been at the heart of four years of contention between the  owner-developer, Lang Ranch, and a homeowners group that argued that Thousand  Oaks violated its own growth-control ordinance in approving the plan that would  ultimately build more than 2,200 residences, including The Knolls.  </P> <P> The group contended it would create traffic and air-quality problems.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Psyche Pascual and Kirsten Swartz contributed to this  article.  </P></p>

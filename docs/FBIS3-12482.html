			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with George Habash, secretary general of the PFLP </F> by unidentified reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [AL-BILAD] What are the obvious lessons to be  learned from the grisly Hebron massacre?    [Habash] The massacre takes us back to the heart of the  Zionist agenda and its objectives. If there is a lesson to be  learned from the atrocity, this must be to put the Zionist game  plan under the magnifying glass, particularly at this moment  when numerous forces, including Zionism, imperialism, and  defeatist Arab forces are trying to cover up the true nature of  the Zionist agenda. Accordingly, it is imperative for  Palestinian and Arab masses to define their pan-Arab agenda and  aim at weeding out that cancerous growth.    [AL-BILAD] What will the PFLP's [Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine] response to the incident be? Are you  planning any action?    [Habash] Naturally, all our comrades in the occupied  territories must think up tangible reactions. Palestinian and  Arab masses outside Palestine must also translate their  condemnation of the massacre into action. I do not want to  offer the military struggle as an alterative to the intifadah or  mass and political struggle. What is called for is an  integrated militlary, political, and popular plan of action.</p>

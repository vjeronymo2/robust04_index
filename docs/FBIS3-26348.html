			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Han Chien-hua (7281 0494 5478): "Li Laizhu </F> Appointed Beijing Military Region Commander"]    [Text] Communist Chinese official sources confirmed  yesterday that the post of Beijing Military Region commander had  been taken over by Deputy Commander Li Laizhu. This personnel  change in a major military region indicates that Communist China  has quietly launched major personnel changes in local military  commands in the wake of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, held at the end of last year.    A few days ago, Li Laizhu accompanied Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee, on an inspection tour of  Shanxi in his capacity as commander of Beijing Military Region.  In its report, the official XINHUA News Agency has confirmed  that former Beijing Military Region Commander Wang Chengbin has  left office and his post has been taken by Deputy Commander Li  Laizhu.    A Beijing source pointed out: The new wave of military  personnel changes is the largest since the reorganization of  major military region leadership in July 1990. In addition to  making the ranks of officers younger in average age and raising  their level of professional competence, it is chiefly aimed at  consolidating Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin's  status among local army units. Last June, Jiang promoted seven  senior generals at one go. In conjunction with the personnel  changes in local military commands, this is aimed at maintaining  stability in the post-Deng Xiaoping era and making prior  arrangements.    It is pointed out that there have been high-level personnel  changes in four military regions. These are:    --Beijing Military Region: Li Laizhu takes over from Wang  Chengbin as commander;    --Shenyang Military Region: Political Commissar Song Keda no  longer holds his post;    --Nanjing Military Region: Fang Zuqi takes over from Liu  Anyuan as political commissar;    --Chengdu Military Region: Former Political Commissar Zhang  Gong no longer holds his post, which reportedly is taken by  Zhang Zhijian, deputy commander of Beijing Military Region.    Moreover, personnel reshuffles are also being conducted  among  leaders of the Navy and the Academy of Military Sciences.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero from the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Carlos Salinas says the reformation of  Article No. 27 puts an end to the great Zapatist revolution. He  said the struggle for land is over and now the battle is for  production and democracy.    The president distributed common land [ejido] titles and  confirmed the legality of the documents. Thus far this year,  600,000 peasants have received land titles, thanks to an  extensive statistical effort to establish boundaries.    In Aguascalientes, dozens of peasants gathered to hear  President Salinas deliver a message of reconciliation.    [Begin Salinas recording] The men and women of the  countryside no longer want to exhaust themselves in conflicts.  The struggle for land is over, and the victors are the Mexican  peasants. [end recording]    The president said an effort will be made to prevent  conflicts from eroding agrarian reform. He told the peasants  who received titles that their agrarian certificates puts an end  to the Zapatist revolution. The EZLN's lands are legally  secure, but that is not enough in one of the most backward  sectors of the economy.    [Begin Salinas recording] A struggle is now being waged for  the peasants to make their own decisions regarding production,  organization, democracy, and freedom. [end recording]    The president's tour was devoted to land ownership. In  Matamoros, Tamaulipas, the ceremony was very symbolic. Among  the people who gathered were 11 peasants who descended from the  group to whom Lucio Blanco in 1913 presented the first plot of  land resulting from the Mexican Revolution. Eighty-one years  later, they have titles for their plots.    [Begin Salinas recording] We have fulfilled the pledge of  the government of the Mexican Revolution. [end recording]    In this border city the president confirmed his pledge to  defend the country's sovereignty and independence.</p>

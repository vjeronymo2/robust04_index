The United States made the proposal in bilateral "framework"  trade talks held earlier this month in Washington, but Japan  rejected it.    The source said the proposed targets would lead to managed  trade, at a time when the world is moving toward free trade.    It is "now up to the U.S. to make concessions" in the  stalled  talks, the source said.    The source also said Japan cannot accept a U.S. proposal to  hold a quadrilateral ministerial meeting on market ccess in  advance of the Japan-U.S. summit in Washington between Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on  February 11.    The proposal "is out of the question," the source said.    Washington had proposed the talks among the United States,  the European Union, Canada and Japan under the auspices of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

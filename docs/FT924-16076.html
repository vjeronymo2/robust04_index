			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Rise in Scottish jobless forecast UNEMPLOYMENT IN Scotland is likely to rise from 243,000 to a peak of 282,000 next year, then fall slowly fall back to 255,000 in 1996, according to a monthly economic review published yesterday. The Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Scotland's main economic study organisation, said people could already expect to stay out of work longer. It called for government measures to tackle the issue. It said: 'The return of something like the former Community Programme is urgently needed, especially in the urban and other areas where high and persistent unemployment and long-term employment prevails. 'This would provide direction and purpose to those who presently have no chance of participating in the formal labour market, and help avoid the adverse social consequences of sustained job-lessness.' It predicted that demand in the Scottish economy would rally in the second half of this year, but recovery would not become strongly rooted until next year. The recent turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism would stimulate the real economy, but rising unemployment in July and August suggested that any 'significant' upturn would not take place before next year, the institute added.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Rapeseed popularity grows among 'greens' - Lubricants made from plant oils are gaining ground, but cost is a limiting factor To some, they jar on the eyes amid the summer green of the European countryside. To others, they are a welcome splash of bright colour. Throughout northern Europe and across parts of North America, glaring yellow fields of rapeseed have become a common crop for the foodstuffs industry. Increasingly though, the plant is making inroads into industry - encouraged by EC subsidies - as the base oil for lubricants which do not pollute the ground or air. As industrialised countries introduce stricter environmental laws and guidelines, the use of non-mineral oil-based lubricants is gaining ground. Last year, Austria became the first country to put a legal ban on lubricants containing mineral oil, though this was only for use with chain saws. Other countries, notably Germany and Switzerland, are becoming more conscious of the damage lubricants can do to the environment, especially near rivers or streams. Thus, reckons Theo Mang, technology director at Fuchs Petrolub of Germany, use of environmentally friendly lubricants could account for between 10 and 15 per cent of the German market by the end of the century. At present, they make up only around 1.5 per cent of the market, which totals 1.2m tonnes a year; the west European market is more than 5m. Products based on mineral oil are poorly biodegradable, only about a third of their content being absorbed into the environment over the accepted 21-day test period. Lubricants based on plant oils and their derivatives break down almost entirely. 'Up to 40 per cent of the volume of lubricants goes into the environment after use,' says Mang. Most of this is deliberate. The dispersal is part of the process in which the oils are used, as with so-called total loss lubrication in which equipment is fed with oil to keep bearings running smoothly. Companies are unlikely to switch to non-mineral oil products for love of the environment. Such products are more expensive. Also, they are not usually subject to a specific ban, the Austrian law being an exception. 'Concern for the environment is not going to be enough,' believes Mang. 'We have to find other arguments.' Fuchs, a world leader in the development of plant oil-based products, stresses instead the costs that can be incurred if lubricants accidentally pollute environmentally sensitive areas. In Germany, one litre of spilled hydraulic oil can spoil one cubic metre of soil. Cleaning this up costs around DM1,500 (Pounds 600). Storage can also be cheaper for lubricants made with rapeseed, oils such as sunflower oil, or from esters (organic compounds) derived from them, since no special precautions are needed to prevent these entering the water table. At the simplest level, as with chain saw oil, rapeseed-based lubricants can cost up to 30 per cent more than regular lubricants. But beyond this, the costs soar. For more complex hydraulic lubricants, the price can be double that for products based on mineral oil. In very specialised cases, this may not matter. Some aviation oils are based on esters, not because of their environmental properties but for technical reasons. For most applications, however, the price difference is important. Mang says companies are gradually more willing to consider plant oil-based products, 'but price is a limiting factor'. An important stimulus to their wider use is the attitude of the authorities. Most German forests are state-owned and their administrators have laid down that biodegradable oils must be used for mechanical work there. Public authorities are also taking a tougher line on types of oils used on construction sites for their new buildings, and the Bundesbahn (federal railways) is testing plant-based oils for greasing its track. As this awareness spreads throughout industry in Germany and elsewhere, Mang sees a growing market for non-polluting lubricants. 'I'm convinced it's only a question of time before it develops in other countries like France and the UK.' He also sees prospects in the US and Canada, especially for wood-processing machinery and possibly later in South America. Clearly, official pressures will have a strong influence on the speed and extent to which plant oil-based products made by Fuchs and other companies are taken up. In Germany, the country's Blue Angel label for ecologically sound products - awarded by a panel of government, consumer, industry and environmental representatives - has been applied to chain saw and total loss lubricants and Mang expects it to be extended to hydraulic oils. At present, around 70 per cent of Fuchs' non-polluting lubricants are rapeseed-based, the rest being made from synthetic esters derived from rapeseed or other natural fatty acids. But the more demands that are put on the lubricants, the more reliance is likely to be placed on esters. If price were no object, around 90 per cent of lubricants could be made with plant oils or esters, reckons Mang. But even in his wildest dreams he does not see this happening, especially with recession causing companies to look hard at costs.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Labour steps up its protest over clearing The Labour party is pushing ahead with its campaign to reduce delays in cheque clearing by Britain's banks and building societies amid growing concern about the way in which retail customers are being treated. Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer minister, yesterday said building societies had been making up to Pounds 300m a year by delaying the clearing of cheques and investing the cash overnight in the wholesale money markets. He said that the societies were taking up to 10 days to clear a cheque when it should take two days to do this and deduct the money from the signatory's account. He called for an end to the practice, which he said costs customers tens of millions of pounds a year. Since Labour stepped up its campaign, two high street banks - Midland and National Westminster - have announced that they will shorten their clearing cycle for cheques to two days. Barclays Bank has a long-standing policy of paying interest on retail deposits three days after they are made. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said that there was a difference between the amount of time taken by societies to clear cheques and the point at which they began paying interest to customers on those cheques. If societies were making a profit on those transactions, he said, 'then that means that the interest rate they are able to pay savers is higher than it otherwise would be'. Mr Griffiths is also angered by a poll showing that a growing number of customers are concerned about the way they are treated in general by the banks. The poll, conducted by the Independent Banking Advisory Service, found that the practices of high street banks led to marriage break-ups, family rows and insecurity. The service questioned 1,860 people who contacted it during a four-month period and found that one in three - 34 per cent - said they were left desperate or depressed by problems with their banks, while 14 per cent said they had been driven to the brink of suicide. 'This report makes me wonder whether banks did not treat their customers better in the 1890s than they they do in the 1990s,' said Mr Griffiths. The picture painted by the survey's findings was vigorously disputed by the banking industry.</p>

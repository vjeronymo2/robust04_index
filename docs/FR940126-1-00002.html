Under current regulation, fiduciaries recognized by VA are not required to divulge non-VA income and assets that the fiduciary may be holding on behalf of incompetent VA beneficiaries. These amendments will permit implementation of the law, allow for a greater degree of protection of the income and estates of incompetent VA beneficiaries and reduce the incidence of waste, fraud and abuse of VA benefits by certain Federal fiduciaries, and court-appointed fiduciaries. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before March 28, 1994.

All written comments received will be available for public inspection at the above address only between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday (except holidays) until April 6, 1994. Any person visiting Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office in Washington, DC for the purpose of inspecting any such comments will be received by the Central Office Veterans Services Unit in room 170. Such visitors to any VA field stations will be informed that records are available for inspection only in Central Office and furnished the address and the above room number. A copy of any comments that concern information collection requirements should also be sent to the Office of Management and Budget at the address contained in the Paperwork Reduction section of this preamble. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Ronald Weaver, Program Analyst, Fiduciary and Equal Opportunity Staff, Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;2091. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 99&hyph;576, section 505 amended 38 U.S.C. 5502(b) (formerly 38 U.S.C. 3202(b)) to permit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to require a fiduciary to disclose, as part of the accounting process, any financial information which is available to the fiduciary concerning the non-VA income and assets of an incompetent beneficiary of VA benefits. The particular regulations to be amended deal specifically with the responsibilities of Federal fiduciaries and court-appointed fiduciaries, and the authority of the Veterans Services Officers at VA Regional Offices to request an accounting from a fiduciary. Each regulation would be amended to include the requirement that non-VA income and assets be subject to inclusion in VA requested formal or informal accountings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These changes will greatly enhance VA's ability to prevent waste, fraudulent use or abuse of the VA benefits of an incompetent beneficiary by the VA recognized fiduciary. The changes will permit VA to formalize a procedure that has only been informal and unenforceable in the past, namely the request for a total accounting of income and assets managed by a fiduciary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulatory amendments contain new information collection requirements as VA will be requiring fiduciaries to provide a type of information which we have not previously required. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request that it approve this information collection requirement. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments for consideration by OMB on this proposed information collection requirement should address them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Joseph F. Lackey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulatory amendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of &sect;&sect;603 and 604. The reason for this certification is that the additional information fiduciaries are being asked to provide is that which they already have but have not previously provided, requiring no additional data collection. In addition, the number of fiduciaries who will be reporting additional income to comply with the proposed change is expected to be only 1% or approximately 300 of the approximately 30,000 fiduciaries who submit accountings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

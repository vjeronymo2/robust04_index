			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Glazovskaya and Oleg </F> Lukin]    [Text] Ashgabat February 24 TASS -- Turkmenistan is to  supply this year 3 billion cubic meters of natural gas to  Azerbaijan. An agreement to this effect was concluded during  the recent vivit by Azerbaijan's official delegation to the  Central Asian republic. The document was signed between the  Turkmennebitgasexport organization and the Azerigas state-run  company.    The agreement provides for clearing payments in hard  currency. The contracting sides settled the price at the level  of 80 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas, transport carges  inclusive. Azerbaijan is to supply Turkmenistan with industrial  equipment, consumer goods and foodstuffs for the sum equivalent  to the value of gas supplies.    As for gas supplies to Ukraine, Turkmen Oil and Gas Minister  Nazar Suyunov [title as received] confirmed they had been fully  discontinued because of unpaid debts. However, it does not mean  that Turkmenistan rejects any counter proposals, he stressed.  The republic is ready to consider them on any positive basis.  Suyunov noted Ukraine's commercial structures are willing to  cooperate but they cannot do this bypassing state-run  organizations resolutely determined not to pay off their debts.  Once, the minister explained, Turkmenistan offered clearing  settlements to Ukraine, but the latter turned down the offer.  Now it also refuses to honour its bills.    According to the Turkmen minister, such an approach is  rather  surprising, to say the least. However, Turkmenistan is still  ready to search for mutually acceptable solutions, which is  proved by its agreements with Georgia and Azerbaijan, Suyunov  said.</p>

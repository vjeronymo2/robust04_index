			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> SAN JOSE SCHOOL STRIKE IS LIKELY  </P> <P> A strike loomed for the 29,000-student San Jose school district as contract  talks between district officials and teachers' representatives broke down.  Supt. James Baughman said the district had rejected the latest demand from  teachers for a 10% raise this year and a retroactive raise of 6% for last year.  The district is offering 6% this year with a 1% salary bonus. Teachers are  expected to strike when school opens Tuesday, but district officials said they  will try to keep classes operating.  </P></p>

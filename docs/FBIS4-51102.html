			<p>BFN     [Text] People's courts of Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan,  Jinzhou, Chaoyang, and Dandong cities respectively held open  trials a few days ago to pronounce judgment according to law to  a number of felony criminal cases, including murder, robbery,  rape, stealing, and arson cases, and more than 100 criminals  were declared guilty. Of them, a number of criminals sentenced  to death were executed by shooting with the approval and ruling  of the provincial higher people's court.    Of these cases, most were aimed at illegally occupying  public  and private property. Some criminals made a reckless move and  defied the law for money and property, thus seriously  endangering the society. Of the five criminals sentenced to  death by the Dalian city intermediate people's court, four were  guilty of robbing and killing a taxi driver. In league with Li  Chaogang (male, 21 years old), Li Wei (male, 19 years old), and  Yan Jingxin (male, 18 years old), Ding Yu (male, 21 years old)  fled to Dalian on 18 January this year after committed the crime  in Changchun city. Being planned beforehand, these four  criminals cheated the taxi driven by Cui Wenyan to Changsheng  Street in Shahekou District in the name of renting the taxi.  Ding Yu stabbed the victim directly on his neck with a dagger,  and Li Wei and two other criminals stabbed him with daggers in  his chest and back for more than 40 times, thus stabbing him to  death. Then, these four criminals robbed some 200 yuan in cash.  The Dalian city intermediate people's court sentenced Ding Yu,  Li Chaogang, and Li Wei to death and deprived them of lifelong  political rights. At the same time, Yan Jingxin was condemned  to death with the sentence suspended for two years and was  deprived of his lifelong political rights. With the  verification and approval of the provincial higher people's  court, Ding Yu, Li Chaogang, and Li Wei were executed by  shooting.</p>

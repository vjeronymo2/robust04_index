			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Anatoliy </F> Krasnov]    [Text] Moscow 29 April TASS -- In the talks being held  between South Korean Defence Minister Yi Pyong-tae and various  Russian officials, the Russian side has issued a new proposal  concerning the creation of a collective security system in the  Asian-Pacific region. Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev  spoke to reporters after meeting with his South Korean  colleague, saying that the proposal would be examined in Seoul.  He noted that a special group of experts might be formed in the  near future to work out a conceptual framework of security in  the region.    The two defence ministers also discussed problems concerning  North Korea. Grachev expressed Russia's worry over North  Korea's nuclear programme, saying that it would be best if the  Republic continued to adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation  treaty. He reported that the two sides discussed various ways  of putting pressure on North Korea so that it did not abandon  the treaty, in order to avoid creating additional security  problems for the Korean peninsula and other areas as well.    In November 1992, President Boris Yeltsin travelled to  Seoul,  where he signed an agreement on principles of relations between  the Russian Federation and the Republic of South Korea. This  document has determined the further development of their  bilateral relations, Grachev pointed out.    During the current negotiations, the two sides agreed on the  necessity of continuing close military cooperation between  Russia and South Korea on a higher level, announced Yi  Pyong-tae. He said that the talks had revealed a common  determination to not permit a worsening of the situation on the  Korean peninsula or in North-east Asia as a whole.    The danger in this direction comes from North Korea's  position on the nuclear question, he declared. "We believe that  North Korea should adhere to the Nuclear Non-proliferation  Treaty and become a full and responsible member of the  international community," the South Korean defence minister  stated.    The military ties between Russia and South Korea will serve  as confidence- and security-building measures both between the  two countries and on the Korean peninsula, stressed Yi  Pyong-tae. If the security of the Korean peninsula is ensured,  that will contribute to the security of the whole world, he  declared.</p>

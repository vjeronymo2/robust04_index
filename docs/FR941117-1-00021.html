			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The certification of need process for PRTF care is described in &sect;441.152 (a) and (b). We are proposing to establish the requirements for PRTFs in &sect;&sect;483.210 through 483.224 of the regulations in subpart F of part 483.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PRTF would be an additional optional setting for States that choose to provide this inpatient benefit. States that do not include PRTFs as providers under the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit would still have to provide this type of care when determined to be necessary by an EPSDT screen. If such a State does not have freestanding PRTFs, a section of a general hospital or psychiatric hospital that has been certified as a PRTF can provide these residential services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any State that elects to provide the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit would be required, at a minimum, to provide these services in a psychiatric hospital or in a psychiatric unit in a general hospital and to have PRTF services available at least when required under EPSDT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The maintenance of effort provision in section 1905(h)(2) of the Act is implemented in &sect;441.180 of the regulations. The Medicaid statute provides that a State's maintenance of effort computation, which would demonstrate that the State continues to provide the same level of funding for these services that it did before it began to receive FFP, is to be based on data from 1971, the year before this provision was enacted. We recognize that the statute is obsolete in this regard and we have requested a technical amendment to update this provision, but the current regulatory maintenance of effort requirement must remain in effect until a statutory amendment is enacted. It is not necessary, however, for States that currently offer the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit to again demonstrate maintenance of effort if they wish to modify the State plan option to include PRTFs and/or hospital psychiatric units as providers of the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would add a new &sect;441.160, Payment, that would specify the condition of payment for the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit. For payment purposes, we propose to add PRTF services to the long-term care facility services definition in &sect;447.251(c). In addition, we propose to apply the payment principles specified in &sect;447.250 (a) through (c) to all providers of the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

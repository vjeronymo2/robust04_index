			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: PWA deficit climbs LOSSES at PWA, the holding company of Canadian Airlines International, climbed 17 per cent in the first quarter, despite a 3 per cent rise in revenues and improved load factors. The Calgary-based company, which is trying to ensure its survival by negotiating a partnership with the US carrier, American Airlines, acknowledged that a return to profitability was unlikely this year. Canadian's main rival, Air Canada, which is also in the red, said it was cutting another 350 jobs as part of an effort to return to an operating profit within the next 12 months. The job losses include 10 per cent of the airline's management positions. PWA suffered a first-quarter loss of CDollars 74.9m (USDollars 62m), or CDollars 1.56 a share, up from CDollars 63.8m, or CDollars 1.70, a year earlier. The lower per-share loss is due to a larger number of outstanding shares. The airline ascribed the higher loss to fierce fare-discounting, despite a rise in its passenger load factor to 64.8 per cent from 59.5 per cent. Air Canada suffered a CDollars 218m loss last year, but said it aimed for a CDollars 300m turnround by the end of 1993.</p>

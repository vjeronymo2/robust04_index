			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "President Clinton's Support for the Sikhs' </F> Rights"]    [Text] U.S. President Clinton has supported the rights of  the Indian Sikhs and stressed the need for a peaceful settlement  of their problems. The Indian Government has strongly protested  President Clinton's letter to the Khalistan Council and warned  that the U.S. pronouncements may have a negative impact on  bilateral relations.    The international community has now begun to feel strongly  about the shameful treatment meted out to the non-Hindu  minorities, especially the Muslims and the Sikhs, in India in  the name of secularism. That is why the international media has  started to focus attention on the armed struggle for freedom in  occupied Kashmir and the repression against the Indian Sikhs,  and a voice is also being raised in their favor at the  international level. A handful of higher caste Hindus have made  the lives of all non-Hindu minorities in India extremely  difficult.    The Sikh minority had backed the Hindus in the struggle for  independence and had rejected great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah's  request for support to the Muslim League and his offer of a  separate homeland for the Sikhs. They, however, realized their  political mistake soon after independence. For the past 10  years, the Indian Sikhs have been waging a struggle to establish  an independent Khalistan state and, presently, there is not a  single Sikh family in Indian Punjab from which at least one  person has not been killed at the hands of the Indian forces and  the police. The manner in which the sanctity of the holiest  seat of the Sikh faith, the Golden Temple, was trampled upon  during the Indira Gandhi regime is glaring proof of the  prejudice of the Hindu mind against the holy places of the  non-Hindu minorities.    The call made by President Clinton for a peaceful settlement  of the issue of the Sikhs' independence is appropriate and  justified in every respect. Besides the Sikhs, the Indian  Muslims, the untouchables, the Nagas, and other oppressed  sections also reserve the right to demand independence from  India for their survival.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Gridlock fear for London's airports A group of aviation, business and tourism bodies are urging Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, to increase capacity at airports in the London area before the region reaches gridlock, Andrew Baxter writes. Demand at airports in the south-east will exceed the capacity of existing and proposed airport development early in the next century, says a letter sent to Mr Mawhinney. The letter is from the chairman and other senior executives of the British Air Transport Association, the Chartered Institute of Transport, the Air Transport Users Council, the Confederation of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce, the London Chamber of Commerce, the British American Chamber of Commerce and the Association of British Travel Agents. They warn that traffic lost to the UK would be to the gain of 'our near European neighbours'. The options they propose include 'complementary facilities' - which are understood to mean satellite feeder airports close to Gatwick or Heathrow - and second runways next to existing ones.</p>

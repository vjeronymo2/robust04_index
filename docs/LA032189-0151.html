			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUSTICES GIVE CREDITORS OF FAILED S&amp;LS GO-AHEAD TO SUE FOR FUNDS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court ruled today that creditors of failed savings and loan  associations may sue those institutions without first waiting for any action  from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.  </P> <P> In a significant victory for the thousands of creditors owed billions by failed  S&amp;Ls nationwide, the court said federal courts may hear such lawsuits  before the bank board, the federal agency that regulates the industry, takes  any action.  </P> <P> The 9-0 ruling rejuvenated a $113-million federal court claim made by a Texas  land deals group against an Arkansas-based S&amp;L.  </P> <P> In an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court said federal courts --  and not the Federal Savings Loan Insurance Corp. -- have the initial authority  to review disputes between failed S&amp;Ls and their creditors.  </P> <P> "We hold that Congress did not grant FSLIC such (exclusive) power and that the  creditors of a failed savings and loan association are entitled to . . .  consideration of their claims in court," O'Connor said.  </P></p>

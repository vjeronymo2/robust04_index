			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Observer: Yet another The last thing seemingly needed by Britain's biggest venture capitalist 3i is another chartered accountant. The place is crawling with the selfsame species already. Hence the appointment of Alan Wheatley, Price Waterhouse's senior London partner, as next chairman of 3i looks unlikely to inspire punters to back what is going to be a difficult stock market flotation later this year. While Wheatley is big in the profession and has sat on the boards of Cable and Wireless and British Steel, he has spent more than three decades climbing his way up the Price Waterhouse tree. He is certainly not in the same sort of league as previous 3i chairmen such as Lords Sherfield, Seebohm and Caldecote. Admittedly, he is still only 53 and Price Waterhouse is a much bigger business than 3i. So he may yet turn out to be an excellent choice. However, the success of eminent accountants in turning from professional practice to running businesses is less than compelling. For example, Ian Hay Davison has still to prove his mettle at Storehouse, and the mixed records of company chairmen on the lines of John Darby (ex-Arthur Young) scarcely justify certainty about the wisdom of Sir John Cuckney's choice.</p>

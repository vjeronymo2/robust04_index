			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Two Hodder directors resign Two directors of Hodder Headline, the independent publishing company, resigned yesterday. Mr Patrick Wright and Mr Tom Biggs-Davison were leaving by mutual agreement, said Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, chief executive of the group which was formed in June when his Headline company took over Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Mr Brian Steven, managing director of the education division, and Mr Richard Stileman, managing director of Edward Arnold (Academic and Professional Division), will be appointed directors from September 1. Mr Hely Hutchinson said the board changes contributed to the group's overhead reduction programme and clarified the management structure. Earlier this month Hodder made 72 staff redundant following the merger. Further redundancies will follow when Hodder's distribution centre near Sevenoaks is closed.</p>

			<p>Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Very Day" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to President Reina's private secretary  [not further identified], Discua Elvir's opinion on voluntary  and educational military service does not represent the military  institution's position.

[end recording]    The conflicting statements clearly show, however, at the  very  minimum there is a lack of clear communication between the heads  of the executive branch and Armed Forces.    [Begin secretary recording] Especially if they say how the  country will stand on an issue which is of general interest,  particularly for young people; this is easily resolved, however.

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIBUTE TO VETERANS COMES NEARLY 40 YEARS AFTER CONFLICT;  </P> <P> KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL DESIGN UNVEILED  </P> <P> In a White House ceremony as hot and humid as a rice paddy in July, Korean War  veterans Wednesday saw the unveiling of the winning design for a memorial to  their war of nearly 40 years ago -- a representation of a 38-man platoon  advancing in battle column through trees.  </P> <P> Mopping his brow, President Bush hailed the memorial as an overdue tribute to  an "American victory," a term not usually associated with the conflict more  frequently described as a stalemate in which a U.S. attempt to defeat Communist  North Korea ended with the peninsula still divided.  </P> <P> "We succeeded and built a stable peace that has lasted more than 35 years,"  Bush said. "In retrospect, the policy of containment so exemplified by the  Korean conflict created the conditions for the tide toward democracy now  changing and uplifting our globe."  </P> <P> The presidential view of history was backed by retired Marine Gen. Raymond G.  Davis, whose four rows of medals were topped with the starred blue ribbon of  the Congressional Medal of Honor won in Korea for a heroic rescue mission.  </P> <P> "Many people called it a draw," Davis told reporters after the ceremony. "But  if you look at it as the salvaging of the freedom of a people which enabled  them to become one of our foremost allies in that part of the world, in that  sense it was a victory."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need $2.8 Million  </P> <P> Retired Army Gen. Richard G. Stilwell, chairman of the memorial advisory board  appointed to help the American Battle Monuments Commission carry out the  $6-million project, pledged a "fast track" campaign to raise the $2.8 million  still needed to complete construction by June 25, 1991, the 41st anniversary of  North Korea's attack on the south.  </P> <P> The $20,000-design competition winners, Don Leon, Eliza Oberholtzer, John Lucas  and his wife, Veronica, all from Pennsylvania State University, said they were  attempting to show the movement of a war that surged the length of the  peninsula before its final entrenchment along the 38th Parallel, the original  line of demarcation after World War II.  </P> <P> The 38 8-foot-high figures include a Korean porter and three "Katusas," members  of the South Korean army who fought with U.S. units. At the point where the  platoon would emerge from the trees into an open, sunken area, a retaining wall  will honor the 33,629 killed in battle and depict the air, naval and  noncombatant aspects of the war.  </P> <P> The dramatic design, chosen by a 10-member jury of Korean War veterans, will  encompass about two acres in a grove of trees southeast of the Lincoln  Memorial, directly across the reflecting pool from the Vietnam Veterans  Memorial.  </P></p>

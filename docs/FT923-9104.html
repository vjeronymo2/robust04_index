			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Bush calls on UN to sanction use of force in Bosnia PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday urged the United Nations to pass a resolution authorising the use of force, if necessary, to ensure humanitarian aid reaches war-torn Bosnia. The US would extend full diplomatic recognition to the former Yugoslav republic, he added, as well as to Croatia and Slovenia, two other breakaway Yugoslav states. Mr Bush was responding to growing international pressure for action to stop the fighting in Bosnia and to increasing condemnation of Serbia's role in the Yugoslav conflict. But he voiced extreme reluctance at the idea of intervention in 'blood feuds'. He pointedly referred to the use of force only for the purpose of getting supplies through to civilians, avoiding any suggestion of air strikes against Serb irregular forces or other military action to end the ethnic conflict. Pressure for UN-authorised action has been fuelled by media reports of alleged atrocities in detention camps in Bosnia and an escalation of fighting in and around Sarajevo, the republic's besieged capital. Some British journalists have just been allowed to visit Serb-run detention camps holding Croats and Moslems. They saw emaciated figures and heard allegations of violence, which they could not verify. The European Community condemned what it called 'repulsive and despicable' Serb camps to detain Bosnian civilians. A statement issued by the British EC presidency demanded that the Belgrade government press Bosnian Serbs to let international observers, especially from the Red Cross, into the camps. Member countries of Nato agreed to draw up contingency plans for possible use of western military force to make sure humanitarian aid gets through to Yugoslav republics. The plans will include the possibility of opening up a land corridor to Sarajevo for armed relief convoys. In his latest response to the growing crisis, Mr Bush condemned what he described as 'the vile policy of ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia. He did not specifically identify Serbia as the prime culprit but added that its government had to understand it would pay 'a real price' for aggression. In an article in the New York Times, Lady Thatcher, former British prime minister, called for military action against Serbia: 'A clear threat of military action would force Serbia into contemplating an end to its aggression.' Mr John Major again ruled out military intervention. 'All the advice I have tells me that we cannot use force . . . without disproportionate risk to the lives of civilians and our armed forces,' he told Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who earlier in the week advocated some form of military initiative in Bosnia.

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Trio search for trump card in a rough game: Leyla Boulton explains a new alliance between Russian banks The unprecedented alliance between three Russian banks, announced this week, is a logical response to the country's glaring need to consolidate its banking sector. Russia has nearly 2,000 banks, with 100 accounting for two-thirds of all banking business. Most of the rest are badly under-capitalised, and the central bank has tried to get them to merge with bigger banks by raising minimum capital requirements. This week, Izvestia newspaper revealed that the central bank had suspended the operations of 22 troubled Moscow banks with names such as Kredit-Consensus and Glory Save-Bank. It is no surprise, then, that the central bank has welcomed the planned alliance between Bank Imperial, Yugorsky Bank and Rossiisski Kredit, three of the stronger fledglings. Some of the impetus for consolidation may have come from an injection of foreign competition. The central bank this summer granted licences to half a dozen foreign banks to create Russian subsidiaries. But Mr Sergei Rodionov, the chairman of Bank Imperial, denies that the proposed alliance is in response to foreign competition. 'I welcome the arrival of foreign banks. They will be bored here because they will have nothing to do,' he told the Financial Times. 'But they will disseminate western banking culture, which, like a woman's perfume, will make it more pleasant to work here.' The new accord - under which the three banks will pool their financial resources into a 'single credit institution with common management' - falls short of a merger because each will retain a separate legal identity. But the main aim is to combine the complementary strengths of the three banks, while reducing their overheads and tax bills. The combined assets of a group specialising in two of Russia's most lucrative markets, energy and foreign exchange, total about Rbs2,000bn (Pounds 1.05bn). The biggest shareholders in Imperial, a wholesale bank for some 400 clients in the energy business, are state-owned energy companies, such as Gasprom, the gas-producing monopoly which is also a client of the bank. Yugorsky Bank is owned by big state-controlled oil producers and finances oil projects. The attraction of Rossiisski Kredit, which makes most of its money from various forms of arbitrage on Russia's distorted foreign exchange market, is its retail network. 'One of our clients, for instance, wanted to open bank accounts for their employees working abroad so they could receive salaries in hard currency here, but Imperial does not want to mess around setting up 3,000 private bank accounts,' explains Mr Rodionov. The alliance will inevitably strengthen the participants against any increased competition that may result from creeping restructuring of the Russian banking sector. Imperial also has a banking presence in the west. It holds a 36 per cent stake in Luxembourg's East-West Bank, with another 51 per cent held by the Russian Central Bank, after the Luxembourg authorities said that Imperial could not hold the majority stake. Some Russian banks are preparing for increased competition by organising alliances with foreign banks. Russia's biggest bank, Tokobank, is planning to set up a joint venture bank with Turkey's Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi. Other Russian banks, particularly those that fear their prized hard currency deposits will be 'stolen' by foreign banks, have preferred to lobby for protection against them. But the dissolution of the Russian parliament, which had threatened to ban foreign banks from taking deposits from Russian customers, deprived them of a crucial ally. Mr Rodionov, however, dismisses Russian banks' fears of foreign competition as 'an artificial problem'. He says foreign banks will not succeed in encroaching on his market share because they are totally 'unfamiliar with our economy'. 'They are used to lending money to companies which have been audited and so on. But auditors here will approve any balance sheet, no matter what is written on it. Our country is one big trust. Everything depends on whom you know.' A former head of the Russian central bank's supervision department, the 32-year-old Mr Rodionov is adept at working around tax and foreign currency regulations which he describes as self-defeating. A gamekeeper turned poacher who is perfectly at home in the murky world of Russian business, he recognises the need for improved banking supervision. There are serious gaps in Russian banking legislation - for instance, there is no effective limit on industrial and commercial companies taking stakes in banks, or on clients becoming shareholders in their banks. Nor are the authorities tackling visible problems such as fraudulent advertising by banks. But while welcoming new central bank rules providing for uniform accounting standards, Mr Rodionov says the central bank's 'draconian' foreign exchange regulations only encourage capital flight. Taxation is so high that banks, including his own, have no choice but to avoid it as best they can. 'I have many ways of keeping my shareholders happy without showing such a high profit. I can for instance increase the interest rates paid on their deposits.' His candour is a sign of just how far Russian banks have become a 'state within a state'. One reason for this state of affairs is the authorities' inability to protect bankers from extortion rackets. At least 10 bankers have been killed this year. Mr Rodionov says that 60 of his 160 staff are security people. Many banks are connected to mafia-style organisations. Mr Rodionov said that the supervision chief at the central bank had his hand smashed and his country house set on fire after he tried to conduct an investigation into a 'major Moscow commercial bank'. 'The investigation stopped there,' he said. This illustrates the scale of the challenges facing the central bank, which has lost much of its best staff, including Mr Rodionov, to the commercial sector where pay and morale are incomparably higher.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The San Diego fairy shrimp occurs in San Diego County from San Marcos and Ramona south to Otay Mesa and at Valle de Palmas in northwestern Baja California, Mexico. All known localities are below 700 meters (2,300 feet) and within 50 kilometers (30 miles) of the Pacific coast. Five other branchinectid fairy shrimp occur in southern California. Only one of these species,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Branchinecta lindahli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is known from San Diego County (Simovich and Fugate 1992).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. lindahli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a habitat generalist and may occur in ponds or ditches. The only other branchinectid fairy shrimp in southern California that is similar in appearance to the San Diego fairy shrimp is the vernal pool fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. lynchi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which occurs in adjacent Riverside County. Male San Diego fairy shrimp may be separated from males of other species within the genus by the shape of the second antenna. Female San Diego fairy shrimp are distinguishable by the shape and length of the ovisac and egg and by the presence of paired dorsolateral spines (Fugate 1993). The San Diego fairy shrimp is a habitat specialist and is restricted to vernal pools. This species occasionally occurs in ditches and road ruts, but only if these depressions are in degraded vernal pool habitat (D. Hogan, San Diego Biodiversity Project,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1992; Marie Simovich, University of San Diego, pers. comm., 1993). This species appears to prefer cool water temperatures ranging from 10 to 23 degrees centigrade (Fugate and Simovich 1992). The prehistorical distribution of this species is uncertain. The majority of the vernal pools in this region were lost prior to 1990. However, based on historical collections (some originally identified as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. lindahli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) the San Diego fairy shrimp was known from at least 15 locales within San Diego County (Balko and Ebert 1987, Fugate 1993). The fairy shrimp presently occurs in fewer than 70 vernal pools within 11 vernal pool complexes in coastal San Diego County (Hogan 1992). Three of the San Diego County populations of this species are on Federal land (all on Miramar Naval Air Station). Two others are, in part, on public land (Del Mar Mesa Vernal Pool Preserve and Mission Trails Regional Park). The San Diego fairy shrimp has also been reported from Isla Vista in Santa Barbara County, California, but the identification of the single female individual is unconfirmed (Michael Fugate, University of Oregon, pers. comm., 1993). Directed surveys of vernal pools in Isla Vista for fairy shrimp have not located any additional San Diego fairy shrimp individuals (Marie Simovich, pers. comm., 1994). The vernal pools in south coastal Santa Barbara County have been significantly reduced in number by the same factors that have reduced the number of vernal pools in San Diego County (Ferren and Pritchett 1988). The Santa Barbara County vernal pools are now isolated from those in San Diego County by agricultural and urban development in Ventura, Los Angeles, and Orange Counties.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 24, 1992, the Service received a petition to list the San Diego fairy shrimp as endangered. Petitioners were Dave Hogan of the San Diego Biodiversity Project in Julian, California, and Denton Belk of Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas. The Service finds that substantial information was presented in the petition to indicate that the requested action may be warranted. This finding is based on a detailed narrative justification in the petition for the recommended action, including information about the distribution, decline, and threats to this species over a significant portion of its range. This proposed rule is the first Federal action on the San Diego fairy shrimp and constitutes the final 1-year finding on the petitioned action that the action is warranted, as required by section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the San Diego fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Branchinecta sandiegoensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fugate) are discussed below.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The natural plant communities of coastal San Diego County and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, have undergone significant changes as a result of both direct and indirect human-caused activities. The rapid urbanization of this region has already eliminated a significant proportion of the vernal pool habitat for this taxon. The remaining patches of habitat are frequently isolated, degraded, and/or fragmented by agricultural practices, streambed channelization and other hydrological alterations, and grazing. Vernal pools have undergone an extraordinary reduction in number and have nearly been eliminated in southern California. In San Diego County, over 97 percent of vernal pool habitat had been lost by 1986 (Bauder 1986). While it is uncertain how many of these pools were occupied by the San Diego fairy shrimp, the species was known to occupy a number of vernal pools that have since been disturbed, destroyed or lost (Bauder 1986, Balko and Ebert 1987, Fugate 1993). In San Diego County, the San Diego fairy shrimp occurs within vernal pool complexes that have been and continue to be impacted by urbanization and agricultural conversion (Bauder 1986, Hogan and Belk 1992, Nancy Gilbert and Ellen Berryman, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). Nine of the 11 known populations of San Diego fairy shrimp in San Diego County are declining because of vernal pool destruction (Bauder 1986; D. Hogan, in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992; Marie Simovich, pers. comm., 1993). At least two populations of the San Diego fairy shrimp occur on Otay Mesa in San Diego County. A minimum of 37 proposed Precise Plans and Tentative Maps for development have been filed pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for this area. These plans encompass about 80 percent of the undeveloped portion of the mesa within the jurisdiction of the city of San Diego and virtually all but four of the remaining vernal pool complexes. Several of these projects will impact the San Diego fairy shrimp. At least one major transportation project has been proposed for Otay Mesa and could potentially impact vernal pools that are occupied by the San Diego fairy shrimp. The San Diego fairy shrimp is found on Federal lands managed by the Navy. The species occurs on Miramar Naval Air Station. These lands are used, in part, for military training activities that involve off-road vehicle maneuvers that adversely impact the species (Hogan and Belk 1992).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: WMC plans USDollars 400m issue WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian metals producer, has filed a shelf registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an issue of up to USDollars 400m in notes. A company statement said yesterday that proceeds from the proposed raising, through WMC's wholly-owned subsidiary, WMC Finance (USA), would be used for working capital and to retire debt. The statement coincided with a warning from Standard and Poor's, the US ratings agency, that WMC's credit rating could be lowered if expansion plans did not improve the efficiency of the company's nickel operations. Standard and Poor's assigned a preliminary A rating to the shelf registration, but said WMC's general ratings outlook was negative. Goldman Sachs has been appointed lead manager to the issue, with Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley as co-managers. Suncorp, the Australian financial services group, has announced a 3 per cent lift in pre-tax profit from ADollars 129m to ADollars 132m (USDollars 85m) for the year to June. Total assets grew from ADollars 6.5bn to ADollars 7.3bn in the year.</p>

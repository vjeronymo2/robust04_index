			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valentyn Smaga, news editor: "Bureaucratic Feast </F> During Environmental Famine, or, Melancholy Reflections on the  Fact That the Ukraine Environment Ministry Should Not Be  Reshuffled Again"]    [Text] Hot facts    I confess. In over 20 years of work in the Ukrainian press I  have often caught myself being prejudiced against some agencies  and organizations. Except for one, which I have served  faithfully for a number of years. Not the office itself, of  course, but its underlying idea, which, unless fully  implemented, would make life in Ukraine impossible.    This organization used to be called the UkSSR State  Environmental Committee; now its title is the Ministry for the  Protection of the Environment of Ukraine. But I would like to  call it the Ministry of Survival, because unfortunately the  direst forecasts are coming true. On the population growth chart  of Ukraine, the curves measuring live births and deaths came  together in 1990 at a very tragic point, at which our nation has  begun to die out physically.    I found that chart in the National Report on the State of  the  Environment in Ukraine, which, in accordance to the law, the  ministry must submit annually to the Supreme Council. I will  discuss these reports--there have already been two of them, for  1992 and 1993--below. Now, let us cite the axiom: the  environmental crisis is global in character and it can be  resolved only by mankind in its entirety and, on the state  level, by the authorities at the highest level. In other words,  our chances for survival depend on the level of authority of the  country's highest environmental protection entity.    What kind of organization was the UkSSR State Environmental  Committee is painful to recall. Officials in oblast and rayon  committees, hired for minuscule wages, had one responsibility  only: to rubber-stamp decisions harmful to the environment  issued by higher authorities. I have been friends with many of  them and understand very well how difficult it is to oppose  bureaucratic demands. One must have tremendous courage to defend  from a hare-brained project a national landmark, the Khortytsya  island in Zaporozhye oblast, for example, or to fight the  Danube-Dniepr canal, or to oppose the construction of the Crimea  nuclear power station.    For articles on this issue, written with the help of my  trusted assistants from the State Environment Committee, I won a  number of top awards of the late USSR. Then, the empire began to  crumble. Before its collapse, the command-administrative system  of the Union tried making cosmetic changes when it issued the  resolution "On Fundamental Restructuring of Environmental  Protection in the Country," which caused a major bout of musical  chairs to be played at environment protection agencies. The  Committee was changed into a ministry, but the power over our  land remained in the hands of monopolies. That was the full  extent of the achievement.    Later, at the time of the so-called perestroyka, on the wave  of popular outrage over the Chernobyl disaster, a powerful  environmental protection movement emerged in the country. I was  one of the founders of the Green World. I left it because  politics started to grow in influence there. I believe that it  is a deadly sin to make a career out of a severe national  ecological disaster, and that the public must concentrate all  its efforts on creating a powerful state environmental  protection agency that would be equal to, for example, the  Prosecutor General. Unfortunately, careers are being made but  the cause does not advance.    Then came the sacred light of independence, and a generally  progressive law "On the Protection of the Environment" which for  the first time in our history established a system of ecological  security for the people. Serious, calm and responsible people  were placed at the head of the ministry and old painful problems  began to be addressed.    And what now? Nothing. An adequate environmental protection  system, which barely began to be formed in the country, has been  dealt a typical, and I fear mortal, blow. And it was done  cleanly. Based on the presidential decree on government service,  the ministry is being cut by 30 percent, apparently along  definite lines. The attestation process is already underway;  then there will be a reshuffle of agency personnel, wasting  valuable expertise gained by experienced employees.    I agree that many existing ministries can be easily cut back  by as much as 50 percent. But the Ministry of Survival should  have its staff tripled, and its authority considerably extended.  Everyone who attentively follows current processes in Ukraine  will notice that every stupid action by the authorities is  extremely rational from the point of view of the private  interests of its authors. Take just two of Ukraine Cabinet of  Ministers resolutions, No. 18, dated 13 January 1992, and No.  373, dated 7 July 1992. They effectively destroyed the  painstakingly built system of fines for polluting the  environment. It turns out, then, that a powerful environmental  ministry with real economic power and influence is not needed?  It is a rhetorical question. The answer is obvious. For a good  10 years, I have been repeating in the press that a state  environmental protection agency can only be effective if its  independence from executive power is fully guaranteed. As that  of the parliament, the prosecutor and the press is in all  civilized states. This is one of the main conditions for the  survival of the people and, hence, the country.    Perhaps we should not frighten the readers with the  comprehensive picture of the destruction of nature contained in  the National Report on the State of the Environment in Ukraine  for the last two years, which the Environment Ministry sent to  the country's parliament. Our chamber of representatives, having  suspended the moratorium on the construction of nuclear power  stations, has, in my opinion, clearly demonstrated its true  attitude on this major problem in the life of the people.    The report is a major effort by a large group of  specialists.  Last year's document is distinguished by greater depth and a  broader conception compared to the one drafted in 1992. It not  only presents data on the condition of the ground, the water and  the air and on the impact of pollution, including radioactive  pollution, on the health of the population, but also proposes a  program for what in my opinion is the most important issue:  environmental protection reform in Ukraine.    This reform will be comprised of three stages. The first  will  consist, primarily, of establishing an effective environmental  protection system of ecological security and of drafting a  number of legislative acts to ensure it. The second stage will  be to develop and implement comprehensive programs to solve  priority problems to balance the level of environmental  pollution with nature's ability to regenerate itself. Finally,  the third stage will be to build a system of managing  environmental resources and regulating the technological impact  on them at a level where the resolution of such problems would  become the foundation for steady development of society.    We have conquered nature. Now, thank God, we have realized  that we have been stupidly fighting our own mother and will  survive only if we make peace with her and subjugate the life of  society to this peace.    Perhaps we should not recount journalistically this enormous  analytical work. But the final chapter of the National Report  for 1993 contains the following recommendation for this year:  "Due to the uncertainty of changes taking place in the Ukrainian  economy, it is important to ensure qualitative and quantitative  changes to improve the environmental situation in Ukraine."    This is how we live. The environment is hostage to the  economy. The latter, in turn, is fully dependent on politics.  But will the future Ukrainian parliament be willing to heed the  dire warnings contained in the National Report? Meanwhile, the  bureaucratic feast during the environmental famine which is  taking place today is certain to curb the fighting spirit of the  Environment Ministry further. This is why I do not hide the aim  of my article: supporters of environmental protection must make  themselves heard and to try to stop cuts which so resemble a  slaughter.</p>

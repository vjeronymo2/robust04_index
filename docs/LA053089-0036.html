			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> LIZARDS ON BORDERLINE  </P> <P> The battle against illegal drugs and aliens has left unexpected casualties near  the Mexican border: flat-tailed horned lizards flattened by off-road U.S.  Border Patrol vehicles. Bureau of Land Management officials allege that Border  Patrol agents not only kill the lizards but disregard off-limits signs and  barriers, destroying archeological finds up to 10,000 years old in the Yuha  Basin. The Yuha area, 25 miles north of the Mexican border, is one of four  desert areas where the lizards live. The lizard, which grows to be five inches  long, is a protected species under California and federal law. Border Patrol  officials say too much fuss is being made over the reptiles. "Is the plight of  the flat-tailed horned lizard so critical that it overrides the prevention of  potential loss of lives or the scourge of drugs being introduced into this  country? I think not," said Dale Musegades, El Centro's chief patrol agent.  </P></p>

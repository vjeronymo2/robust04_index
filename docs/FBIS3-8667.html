			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias concluded his  talks in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on  the Bosnian issue. After their meeting, Mr. Papoulias described  the talks as successful and expressed the hope that the crisis  will be overcome. He further noted that his meeting with Mr.  Milosevic was very useful and announced that the European  Union's [EU] plan for the settlement of the Bosnian crisis  remains the nucleus of talks.    Responding to a question if Greece would change its stance  and become involved in the Balkan crisis if Turkey became  involved in the crisis, Mr. Papoulias said: Greece's position  remains that the Balkan peoples should not be involved in this  crisis. However, if this principle is violated then a new state  of affairs is created and our country should make new decisions  in accordance with its own interests as well as the region's  interests.    The foreign minister also added that in our capacity as EU  presidency, we should convince, as he put it, others on the  examination and decision, in principle, on lifting the trade  embargo against Yugoslavia. If the lifting of the embargo will  contribute toward a peaceful process then these questions must  certainly be addressed. Mr. Papoulias further noted that he  discussed with Slobodan Milosevic the situation in Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and the  intervention in the Balkan crisis by forces that are not related  to the region. Mr. Papoulias made it clear that the moves by  other, non-Balkan countries for a peaceful solution of the  problem are welcome, without this meaning involvement in the  problem.    Mr. Papoulias is now attending a working luncheon being  hosted in his honor by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    The two-day visit to Russia, which Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias was to begin today, has been postponed because of his  Russian counterpart's departure for Israel.</p>

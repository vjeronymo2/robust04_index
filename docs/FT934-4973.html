			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Verson reduces loss to Pounds 2.87m Verson International, the Midlands-based capital equipment manufacturer, reduced losses in the half year to end-July, but its prospects for returning to the black by the end of its financial year depend crucially on the future flow of royalty payments. The company yesterday announced a pre-tax loss for the first half of Pounds 2.87m, against a deficit in the comparable period of Pounds 5.61m. The 1991-92 full year loss was Pounds 3.27m. The half year deficit translated into losses per share of 1.96p, against losses of 3.95p in the comparable half. There is no dividend payment. Turnover expanded from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 49.4m, reflecting the acquisition last year in the US of Niagara Machine and Tool Works and of Clearing International. Verson Wilkins, Verson's lossmaking pressing company, has been merged into Clearing and, while the two are operating at a loss, their position is improving on the back of buoyant US orders and an increase in UK demand. Verson's first half profits were hit by a fall in royalty income to Pounds 667,000 from Pounds 3.9m in the 1991-92 first half. The group is now negotiating new royalty agreements. If these can be concluded in the second half they would help the group back to profit this year. If not, a return to profit is likely to be delayed until next year.

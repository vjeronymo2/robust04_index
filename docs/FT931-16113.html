			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Norway issues CDollars 750m Eurobond THE Kingdom of Norway launched its 1993 international borrowing programme yesterday with a CDollars 750m 10-year issue through Goldman Sachs International, one of the largest Canadian dollar Eurobond issues to date. Norway, like Finland and Sweden, needs to borrow to replenish foreign currency reserves after last year's currency crises, although its requirements are lower due to current account surpluses generated by oil and gas exports. Foreign currency reserves stand at around Dollars 10bn today, compared with Dollars 12bn-Dollars 13bn a year ago, and it can afford to borrow at an almost leisurely pace, says Mr Sigurd Klakeg, deputy director general at the Norwegian ministry of finance. Norway will borrow up to Dollars 6bn internationally this year, compared with Dollars 5bn in 1992. The kingdom is understood to have a funding target of 20-30 basis points below Libor, and is thought to have swapped the proceeds of the issue into floating-rate US dollar notes. The bonds were priced at 45 basis points over the benchmark government bond. The large volume of Canadian dollar bonds this week has prompted fears of over-supply. Goldman Sachs said half of yesterday's issue had been sold by the end of the day, with interest good in the Far East but not as strong as expected on the Continent. The European Investment Bank continued its active start to the year with two further issues, in part reflecting its need to borrow an extra Ecu5bn to meet the spending commitments agreed at last December's Edinburgh summit. Its Pounds 400m of 10 1/2 -year bonds through Samuel Montagu followed a Dollars 250m 10-year collared floater arranged by Kidder Peabody earlier this week and were launched almost simultaneously with a L200bn seven-year issue. The sterling issue was described by a number of bankers as very expensive, but benefited, they said, from strong international demand for Eurosterling assets. Samuel Montagu said it had detected strong demand for a liquid sovereign or supranational 10-year benchmark that could be traded at or below par. The EIB is still in the process of finalising its 1993 borrowing strategy, but before the Edinburgh summit was expected to borrow 10-12 per cent more than last year's Ecu13bn. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs said the response in Europe to the World Bank's Dollars 1.25bn 30-year global, priced at 28 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, far exceeded expectations and that the spread tightened to 26. The Republic of Finland increased its seven-year issue to DM3bn, making it one of largest D-Mark issues yet seen. The terms of the increase continue the tightening of spreads enjoyed by Finland. Lead manager Dresdner Bank said the increase was launched at a spread of 50 basis points over German government bonds, three basis points lower than the spread on the original DM2bn of bonds, and was holding that spread in trading.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prime time for private funding Sir, Your editorial comment ('Private finance', February 25) says that private finance for public capital projects has yet to show any real progress. Institutional investors prefer stock exchange securities with proven track records. A former president of the Institute of Actuaries and chief actuary to the Prudential, Frank Redington, said, in a lecture on April 19 1977: 'The net amounts passing between industry and long-term savings are small. To give teeth to the point, in the 11 years 1965-75, industry raised Pounds 6bn in new long-term capital, but it repaid Pounds 5 1/2 bn in cash acquisitions (takeovers, trade investments, etc). The net requirement of Pounds  1/2 bn compared with the growth of Pounds 24bn in institutional funds over the same period.' The Pounds 23 1/2 bn went into the purchase of already existing stocks and shares. It could not affect the income-earning potential of the underlying companies at all. If this money had gone into public capital projects, the country could have had new road and rail systems, the second Severn Bridge, etc. The institutions would have had the income from all these projects. A similar situation exists today. There is no time to lose in investigating the position. As the Labour party document points out, 'there are plenty of competing capital projects at home and abroad' (my emphasis). Ivor Kenna, 72 Compton Street, London EC1V 0BN</p>

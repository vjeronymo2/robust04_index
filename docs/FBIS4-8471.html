			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Colonel (Res.) Purvan Tonev: "Defense </F> Minister's `Bayonet Charge' Against Cabinet"]    [Text] Mr. Aleksandrov has now been in office for 15  months. Therefore it was impossible not to admit that he  contributed to the absurd inflating of the payrolls of the  Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. Supposedly, it is  only now that the defense minister has understood that dozens of  colonels with or without trouser stripes, were carrying files  from one room to another and did not know what to do all day.  For a whole year DEMOKRATSIYA has been writing about the  arbitrary rule of the Defense Ministry leaders and the lack of  prospects for the honest Bulgarian officers. Although somewhat  late, the gentleman who filled our ears with talk about cardinal  and fundamental changes comparable to those in the most modern  armies finally understood this.    The balance is more than sad: dilapidated equipment,  obsolete structures, a paralyzed General Staff, insecure  military personnel, unprecedented corruption, lack of realistic  reform ideas, and infighting within a group of Aleksandrov's  friends and neighbors, called, God knows why, "the leadership of  the Defense Ministry."    It is not a secret that the minister failed in his attempt  to  assemble a team capable of proposing ideas and advancing the  changes. He also failed to give a personal example with his  morals. On the contrary, he introduced threats and penalties,  endless talk to a selected group of journalists, demagogy, and  theatrical effects. Is the dismissal of the 87 office colonels  not a cheap gesture? It is obvious even to the colonels  themselves, that the Army does not need them, but where were the  minister and the chief of General Staff until now? Is it only  87 colonels in the two Defense Ministry buildings that are  expendable?    The recent statements of the defense minister about early  elections indicate not only his tactic of turning to the  direction in which the wind blows, but also prove the well-known  thesis that this cabinet is becoming dangerous for the country's  security.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / News at Ten move 'still on agenda' ITV LAST night signalled its renewed determination to move News at Ten to an earlier slot. Mr Marcus Plantin, ITV network director, indicated at the Edinburgh television festival that he would be taking on politicians, including Mr John Major, the prime minister, who said in June that they wanted the programme kept in its present 10pm slot. Mr Plantin said: 'News at Ten is still very much on the agenda and we must be able to make ITV scheduling more dynamic by being able to switch programmes around.' Politicians opposed an earlier slot because the programme, made by ITN, would not have the opportunity to react to late-breaking news from around the world. Mr Plantin said of Mr Major's intervention: 'For a moment I thought he wanted my job.' After the intervention it had been thought the programme would not be moved but its future is to be discussed by the ITV board next month. The ITV companies say they can sell more advertising and attract more viewers by screening big films unbroken, rather than splitting them round a news slot at 10pm.</p>

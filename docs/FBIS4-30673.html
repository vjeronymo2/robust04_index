			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA June 28 -- A sea vessel named Truong Sa-10  has been launched recently by the Ha Long shipyard.    The 70.75-metre-long and 11.8-metre-wide ship has a design  capacity of 1,000 tonnes and is provided with modern equipment.    This transport ship was specially built in service of the  Truong Sa archipelago [Spratlys].

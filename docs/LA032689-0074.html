			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATIONAL TOURING  </P> <P> Every year about this time the Mature Traveler column tells us what community  tours offers for the summer in the way of overseas professor-led tours. So far  I have been on four. They are wonderful tours and I plan on my fifth this  summer -- the one to the Soviet Union. We have great socials and lectures  before we leave and those reunions after the tours are really a lot of fun. I  have made many friends from all parts of the United States through these trips  and I thank you for the information.  </P></p>

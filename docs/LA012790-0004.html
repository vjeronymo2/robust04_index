			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WIFE ACCUSED IN SLAYING USED 2ND GUN, POLICE SAY  </P> <P> A prosecutor said Friday that a Tarzana woman who claimed to have mistaken her  husband for a burglar before shooting and killing him attempted to "finish him  off" with a second gun.  </P> <P> Carole Evelyn Mellinger was charged Friday in the death of her millionaire  husband in the couple's exclusive hillside home.  </P> <P> James A. Baker, assistant head deputy in the Van Nuys branch of the district  attorney's office, said Carole Mellinger allegedly shot her husband, Brainerd  Lee Mellinger, four times with a handgun in the den of their home and then  apparently attempted to use a shotgun to "finish him off."  </P> <P> Three unfired shotgun rounds were found near Mellinger's body, and a shotgun  was found nearby with one round in the chamber, Baker said.  </P> <P> "She probably tried to finish him off with a shotgun but did not know you had  to take the safety off," Baker theorized.  </P> <P> Another shot was fired into the ceiling of the home in the 19700 block of Komar  Drive, Baker said.  </P> <P> Carole Mellinger then called a relative who called police, Baker said. Her  husband was dead by the time police arrived.  </P> <P> "Physical evidence at the scene" and "inconsistencies in her statements"  prompted detectives to arrest her, said Los Angeles Police Detective Rick  Swanston.  </P> <P> Both guns were recovered at the home and there was no sign of forced entry, he  said.  </P> <P> Mellinger, 48, pleaded not guilty to the charges Friday in Van Nuys Municipal  Court. Her preliminary hearing was set for Feb. 6. She was being held without  bail.  </P> <P> Although there was no immediate motive for the murder, police said Carole  Mellinger had been drinking before the shooting and the couple, married for 23  years, apparently had marital problems.  </P> <P> Her husband, owner of a Woodland Hills import-export firm, had appeared in  several cable TV commercials for establishing a similar business.  </P></p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Upturn in Brazilian economy GROWTH figures released in Brazil yesterday showed a sharp upturn in the economy, strongly suggesting the country's four-year recession may be over. According to the Federal Statistics Institute, the economy grew 4.36 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the last quarter of 1992, the biggest increase in a single quarter in 13 years. The growth was attributed to bumper harvests and an unexpected revival of domestic consumption, partly because of lower interest rates but also because of fears that the government would freeze financial assets. Statistics Institute officials predict gross domestic product growth for this year of 4 per cent, the highest since 1986. The government was given a further boost by figures showing car production has hit a record monthly rate of 124,000. But the Fipe index of Sao Paulo university registered 29.14 per cent inflation for May, slightly up on the previous month. Other indices have been registering inflation rates of above 30 per cent since April.</p>

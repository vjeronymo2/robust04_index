			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 22 April Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] The DPRK (North Korea) has softened its hardline  stand on the nuclear issue by notifying the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) that it will allow IAEA inspectors to  observe the replacement of fuel rods in an experimental reactor.  Commenting on the North Korean proposal, Tsutomu Hata, deputy  prime minister and foreign minister, said at a news conference  on 22 April after a cabinet meeting that "this is something we  have to welcome." At the news conference, the foreign minister  also reiterated, "It is important for North Korea to explain  things candidly [about its suspected nuclear weapons program] to  the international community."</p>

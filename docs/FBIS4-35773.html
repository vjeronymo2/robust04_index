			<p>BFN     [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, June 3 (AFP) -- A Hizballah  guerrilla was killed and a Fijian peacekeeper wounded in a  pre-dawn clash Friday in south Lebanon, the spokesman of the UN  Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] said.    The fighting broke out when Hizballah guerrillas refused to  have their vehicles searched for weapons at a Fijian checkpoint  in the Tyre region near Israel's self-declared "security zone"  in south Lebanon, Timor Goksel told reporters. Shooting broke  out during which a Hizballah guerrilla was killed and a Fijian  soldier wounded, he added.    Sporadic gunfire also targeted three other Fijian positions  in the Tyre region but there were no casualties, the spokesman  said.    Correspondents in south Lebanon also reported intense  Israeli  reconnaissance flights over the region overnight and until the  early morning hours.    Heightened tension has gripped south Lebanon after  Thursday's  devastating Israeli air raid on a Hizballah training base in the  Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley, in eastern Lebanon, which  prompted retaliatory rocketing of northern Israel. Israeli  soldiers and their proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) was on red  alert in the security zone and residents of northern Israel  spent the night in bomb shelters. The Lebanese army and  anti-Israeli guerrillas in south Lebanon were also on alert.    The air raid on a tent camp near the Syrian border killed 26  guerrillas and wounded 40 others, according to Hizballah.  Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bwwayz put the death toll at 45  and hospitals officials in the Syrian-controlled eastern  al-Biqa' Valley town of Ba'labakk said they were treating as  many as 85 injured.</p>

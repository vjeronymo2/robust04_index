			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOGGER ATTACKED IN CENTRAL PARK TO GO HOME FOR HOLIDAY  </P> <P> The woman who suffered brain damage when she was gang-raped and beaten in  Central Park has recovered so well that she is planning to have Thanksgiving  dinner with her family in the Pittsburgh, Pa., area, a court source said.  </P> <P> The 29-year-old investment banker, who was left for dead after she was attacked  while jogging on April 19, has been recovering at a dramatic pace at Gaylord  Hospital in Wallingford, Conn.  </P> <P> "She leaves the hospital frequently, returns to Manhattan and visits her  apartment," the source said. "She's going to be with her family on  Thanksgiving." The woman is originally from the Pittsburgh area.  </P> <P> She is eager to testify at the trial of six teen-agers charged with raping and  attempting to murder her, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  But she will be allowed to do so only if family, doctors and prosecutors think  it is in her best interests.  </P> <P> The woman owes her life to the puddle of cool mud in which her attackers left  her, the source said.  </P> <P> "The mud acted as a cool compress. It prevented excessive swelling and damage  of the brain," the court source said.  </P></p>

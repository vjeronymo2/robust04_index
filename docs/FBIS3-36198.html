The representative of the Russian Space Agency, who took  part  in the talks, told INTERFAX that the talks are proceeding with  difficulty. He said that the issues associated with the sum of  compensation for the use of launching sites and the coordination  of the system of the legal regulation of relationships among the  cosmodrome personnel were postponed for the last day of talks,  Wednesday.    The Russian Space Agency's representative said that during  the talks Russian experts named the sum of the lease, which  Russia is prepared to pay, and offered its feasibility studies  (he refused to name the figure). He told INTERFAX, however,  that the Kazakh side has made no response.    Russian experts tend to explain the passiveness of the  Kazakh  delegation by the ambiguity of its stance. According to  information obtained by INTERFAX, Kazakhstan, despite the  understanding reached in Almaty in mid-January on giving up the  idea of creating on the Baykonur basis an international  joint-stock company, still gives it much emphasis, for example,  within the framework of the bilateral meetings with U.S. experts  (an American 13-member delegation recently visited the  cosmodrome at the invitation of Kazakhstan).    Russian experts believe that Kazakhstan's uncertainty should  go away after President Nazarbayev discusses issues of the U.S.-  Kazakhstan outer space cooperation (including the U.S. possible  involvement in the use of Baykonur) during his visit to  Washington scheduled for mid-February. Experts believe that the  future of the Russian-Kazakh agreement on leasing the cosmodrome  depends directly on the results of the talks in Washington.    The agency spokesman following the three-day talks in Moscow  said the two sides will sign a list of concrete problems on  which they agree or disagree.</p>

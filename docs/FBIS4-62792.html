			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nelli Grigoryan] </F>   [Text] Yaroslavl May 15 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy promised on Sunday to solve all economic,  social and criminal problems facing Russia, provided the  would-be victory of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) enables  him to form a one-party cabinet.    Speaking to residents of the ancient Russian city of  Yaroslavl in the overcrowded hall of local cultural centre at  what he called a regional conference of the LDPR, Zhirinovskiy  reiterated that only his party is capable of leading Russia of  the crisis [sentence as received]. He criticised severely  Communists and Liberals, called them "weak teams" but said all  disputes should be solved peacefully, through elections.    In the field of economy, Zhirinovskiy said, his party  advocates a combination of socialism and capitalism. He called  to impose a tax maximum at the rate of 40 per cent, to curb the  conversion of defence industries, and to halt ruining the state  sector in industry and agriculture.    Zhirinovskiy did not support the idea of restoring the  Soviet  Union but said that if the former Soviet republics have to pay  their debts in full, they will volunteer to rejoin Russia  themselves.    Paying tribute to his usual eccentricity, Zhirinovskiy  promised to sack the local authorities for inadequate treatment.  The Yaroslavl administration decided against red-carpet  reception of the notorious politician limiting its services to  providing premises for his performance and ensuring his security.</p>

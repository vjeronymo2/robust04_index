			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ratners sells Watches of Switzerland for Pounds 23.2m RATNERS GROUP, the struggling jewellery business, has sold its Watches of Switzerland chain for Pounds 23.2m cash, helping to ease its strained working capital position. The buyer is Asprey, the luxury goods group centred on its flagship jewellery store in London's Bond Street but which also includes Garrard, the Crown Jewellers, and Mappin &amp; Webb. Watches of Switzerland, which operated as an upmarket stand-alone business within the Ratners portfolio, has experienced tough trading and saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 2.69m to Pounds 887,000 last year on sales of Pounds 21.7m. At February 1, it had net assets of Pounds 19.2m. The chain has 25 stores throughout the UK and will help Asprey's strategic aim of broadening its geographic coverage. It was brought into Ratners with the acquisition of the H Samuel business in 1986. Mr Jim McAdam, Ratners chairman, said he had achieved a 'fair price' for the chain - although it is believed to have been far less than the company was originally seeking. Ratners will retain its interest in Watches of Switzerland's headquarters in Aylesbury and may be able to benefit from recovery of past years' corporation tax taking the value of the deal to Pounds 24m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', member of the </F> Palestinian National Authority, in Tunis, by Sa'id Mu'addi in  the studio; date not given; from the "With the Events" program  -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray', Abu-al-'Ala', member  of the Palestinian Authority, good evening:    [Quray'] Good evening.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', when will the Palestinian  National Authority meet? What is on the agenda?    [Quray'] Meetings started yesterday. Meetings will discuss  a big agenda to fill all vacancies in administrations and  distribute missions and responsibilities to members of the  Palestinian National Authority. Meetings will discuss the  setting up of a bureau for auditing and financial and  administrative supervision, to coincide with the start of the  work of this authority, and to underline the principle of  accountability and openness to the masses of our people. Also,  the agenda includes the subject of following up the negotiations  and setting up the committee charged with following up  negotiations in the civil, security, and economic fields. All  these issues have been addressed. Discussion will continue  today. The meetings' agenda includes setting a date for the  return of the Palestinian leadership and the members of the  Palestinian National Authority to Gaza and Jericho.    [Mu'addi] When will Yasir 'Arafat arrive in Gaza, or  Jericho?    [Quray'] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat will soon arrive at  the head of the Palestinian National Authority.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', have all members of the  Palestinian National Authority been appointed?    [Quray'] Almost. The number appointed is enough to assume  all responsibilities and tasks. There will be consideration of  some brothers. We think these names will be complete soon.    [Mu'addi] How many members have been appointed thus far?    [Quray'] Around 18 people have been appointed thus far.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', many challenges are facing the  new Palestinian Authority. What are the priorities?    [Quray'] Two issues constitute the principal challenges to  our people. A third issue constitutes the major challenge  regarding Israel. With our people, we are required to achieve  security in a democratic, healthy, and sound atmosphere in order  to provide the stability needed for development. The second  challenge is to create job opportunities, and the economic  development projects that can provide job opportunities and  achieve the prosperity our people seek. These are two issues we  must tackle for the sake of our people. The third issue  concerns completing the preparations for the negotiations for  the next phases, since the agreement stipulates phases and  gradual action, and so we can complete one phase and move to the  next after we have established ourselves in a correct and sound  way and created some confidence with the other party.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', the Palestinian Authority will,  as of next month, start dispensing the wages of the employees in  Gaza and Jericho and the wages of the members of the Palestinian  police. Do you have any money in the coffers?    [Quray'] In fact, the coffers are still at the hands of the  Civil Administration and the Israeli Government and the Israeli  Finance Ministry. The money has not been received by the  Palestinian National Authority. This is undoubtedly an Israeli  responsibility, and also a responsibility of the world and the  World Bank. This authority should not be dealt with in  accordance with the old Arab proverb: He threw him in the water  and then told him, careful, careful, do not get wet. This  authority has major and difficult responsibilities. It is the  responsibility of the world community to help it. It is  Israel's responsibility to fulfill its commitments. The dues  remaining from the taxes and tariffs, as well as other old dues,  must be transferred immediately so that this authority can  fulfill its tasks without trouble. The Authority cannot  possibly stand by idly without being able to pay wages or pay  for its own expenses.    [Mu'addi] One last question, Mr. Abu-al-'Ala': It has been  reported that Yasir 'Arafat recently fell ill and was admitted  to the military hospital in Tunis. What is Mr. 'Arafat's health  condition these days?    [Quray'] I can confirm that these were very normal tests.  He is in very, very good health. I can confirm this.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray', Abu-al-'Ala', in Tunis, thank  you very much.    [Quray'] Thank you.</p>

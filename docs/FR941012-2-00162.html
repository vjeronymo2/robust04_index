			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority Foreign Country Practices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of the review under Executive Order 12901 and the results to date of intensive negotiations, the Trade Representative has decided not to identify any priority foreign country practices at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have had serious, long-standing concerns regarding access to the Japanese market for flat glass. We have reached agreement with Japan in principle concerning access to the distribution system and access to the public and private construction markets for flat glass in Japan, and have also agreed to work to finalize that agreement within the next thirty days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Other Practices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. The following practices may in the future warrant identification as priority foreign country practices: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Japan market access for wood and paper: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the 1990 U.S.-Japan Wood Products Agreement, Japan agreed to substantially reduce tariffs, to reduce subsidies, to speed up product certification, and to adopt performance-based standards and building codes. Progress has been made, but new or existing barriers continue to impede market access. Tariffs, although reduced in the Uruguay Round, remain a significant impediment. Adoption of performance-based standards and building codes has been slow and Japan maintains a parallel unliberalized set of building standards for housing loans. Subsidies to the wood products industry appear to have risen. We seek further market opening through the elimination of these remaining barriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In April 1992, Japan agreed to take GATT-consistent measures to increase substantially market access in Japan for foreign paper and paperboard products, to realize the objective in the January 1992 Bush-Miyazawa action plan of January 1992 ``to substantially increase market access for foreign firms exporting paper products to Japan.'' Four consultations have been held under the agreement. In the Uruguay Round, Japan agreed to join a Quad country consensus to cut tariffs on paper to zero over 10 years. However, Japan has failed to provide detailed information on the degree to which Japanese government agencies are implementing provisions which obligate them to actively encourage use of foreign products by end-users in key market segments. We seek a full accounting by all appropriate entities within the Japanese government on their implementation of the agreement, as well as other measures to augment the agreement and make it more effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The following foreign country practices were determined not to be appropriate for identification because they are already being addressed by other provisions of United States trade law, existing bilateral agreements, or in trade negotiations with other countries and progress is being made toward their elimination. They do, however, remain significant trade negotiating objectives for the United States. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _European Union Utilities Directive: Under the European Union's Utilities Directive, which took effect on January 1, 1993, telecommunications utilities in 8 EU member countries now penalize bids by U.S. suppliers containing over 50% non-EU content and May reject such bids completely. In May 1993, the U.S. implemented sanctions against the EU under Title VII of the 1988 Trade Act. These sanctions ban the purchase by the U.S. government of certain goods and services from these 8 countries. We will continue to seek removal of the discriminatory aspects of the Directive through negotiation with the EU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Canada dairy and poultry measures: In implementing the Uruguay Round, Canada intends to convert its existing import quotas on dairy products, chicken, turkey and eggs to tariff-rate quotas, and raise its bound tariffs on these products. Canada has also stated its intention to apply these tariffs on imports from the United States. We believe such an action would reduce our access to the Canadian market. If it becomes appropriate, this matter could be addressed through the NAFTA process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> REFORMERS TAKING A NEW LOOK AT 20-YEAR-OLD IDEA: YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: IT EASES OVERCROWDING AND IS COST-EFFICIENT. LACK OF AIR  CONDITIONING AND CONFLICT WITH SOME EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES LIMIT ITS  SPREAD.  </P> <P> Jennifer Rainey's assessment of summer vacation used to be that it was three  long, boring months.  </P> <P> That was before she transferred to Fairmount Elementary School, where students  attend class year-round and summer break is replaced by four minivacations that  fall just when a sixth-grader needs them.  </P> <P> "It gives you something to look forward to," said Jennifer, 11. "You think:  'Hey, a couple more weeks of this and then I get three off.' I like it this way  because it seems like you get more time off."  </P> <P> Jennifer's is the nation's longest-running year-round school. Francis Howell  School District, just west of St. Louis, pioneered the concept in 1969 in an  effort to solve overcrowding; but, today, education reformers think the idea  may be just what the country needs to improve its educational system.  </P> <P> "We're asking schools to do more and more, but we're keeping the clock and the  calendar the same. You can't fit 10 gallons into a 5-gallon can," said Ernest  L. Boyer, former U.S. commissioner of education and now the head of the  Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in Princeton, N. J.  </P> <P> Students spend the same number of days in class, but, instead of a summer  vacation, they get shorter breaks throughout the year. More and more schools  are scrapping traditional schedules in favor of the more efficient year-round  ones, and no one seems to be complaining.  </P> <P> "I'm convinced that a longer school year is inevitable because of the need to .  . . meet the changing work and family patterns of the nation," Boyer said.  </P> <P> This year, an estimated 475,000 students in 19 states -- less than 1% of the  nation's students -- attend year-round schools, said Charles Ballinger,  executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round Schooling.  </P> <P> But that's twice as many as five years ago, he said.  </P> <P> Ohio has the longest school year, with 182 days, and Minnesota has the shortest  with 170, according to the Education Commission of the States.  </P> <P> Missouri's state Board of Education plans to ask the Legislature to increase  its 174-day year -- the nation's second-shortest -- to 200 days by the year  2000. Thirty-four states use 180-day school years.  </P> <P> Even if the school year is not lengthened, many educators say, a year-round  schedule makes sense. Some say it improves learning. Others say it helps ease  overcrowding and puts school buildings to work full time.  </P> <P> "The traditional, agricultural calendar has no value to us any longer," said  Norman Brekke, superintendent of the K-8 Oxnard School District in Ventura  County, Calif.  </P> <P> "As a matter of fact, the nine-month calendar and the fact that schools are out  for three months of the year is a costly extravagance, which I don't believe  our society should accept."  </P> <P> Brekke said that his district saved $16 million -- the cost of two new schools  -- by converting to year-round classes in 1976, and test scores have improved.  </P> <P> Supporters of year-round schooling include the Missouri branch of the National  Education Assn., which recently issued a task force report recommending that  all of the state's schools consider year-round programs.  </P> <P> In California, state law requires districts to file a feasibility study on  year-round schools or have a program to be eligible for some building funds.  </P> <P> Utah also has provided incentives for consideration of year-round plans, and  some inner-city districts must have year-round schooling by the 1990-91 year.  </P> <P> However, some educators say that, although they like the idea, it is not always  workable.  </P> <P> In St. Louis, for example, Supt. Jerome Jones said that the buildings are not  equipped for year-round instruction: Most are not air-conditioned, and the  district already is strapped for money to pay for paint and plaster.  </P> <P> "Personally, I think it's desirable," Jones said. "If it were possible, I would  explore it."  </P> <P> Even the Francis Howell district has found that it is not workable at the  secondary level. An experiment with a junior high school failed because of the  problems presented by extracurricular activities like sports.  </P> <P> Another group that is not exactly thrilled is the summer camp industry.  </P> <P> "People are very concerned about what could happen, but, at the moment, the  impact hasn't been significant," said Shirley Walch, who heads the American  Camping Assn.'s Southern California section. "Some of our camps can accommodate  and adapt, and then there are some that could be devastated by it."  </P> <P> Administrators at Fairmount in St. Peters say their system is supported by  students, teachers and parents.  </P> <P> "It's a system that's worked very effectively," Principal Larry Smith said.  "The burdensome part is developing the schedule, staffing the building and the  movement of students and teachers in school."  </P> <P> Fairmount students are split into four cycles and attend class for nine weeks,  then get three weeks off. The start of each cycle is staggered so that, at any  given time, three cycles are in session and one is off. Classrooms are always  filled.  </P> <P> The system is not without some drawbacks, though. Teachers say the biggest  headache is moving.  </P> <P> "A classroom teacher rotates with her students, so, when you go off cycle on  your three-week break, you move out of your classroom so another teacher and  class can move in," teacher Chris Guinther said. "So, you end up having to pack  up your teaching materials and supplies. Logistically, it's a problem."  </P> <P> Ideally, when overcrowding is not a factor, a year-round school has only one  cycle and teachers don't have to move.  </P> <P> For working parents, the biggest concern is arranging for child care when their  vacations do not coincide with their kids'. Some children use the time to visit  grandparents or enroll in YMCA or other activities.  </P> <P> When the schedules do coincide, Fairmount Assistant Principal Pat McCoy said,  "Then it's an advantage because you can take your kids to Disneyland in  September or October and you don't have to take them out of school, and you  miss all the crowds."  </P></p>

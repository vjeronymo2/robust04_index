			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Defenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule specifies that a regulated party may rebut the presumption of liability by demonstrating (1) that it did not cause the violation, (2) that the product transfer documents account for all the gasoline in question and indicate that the product complied with all applicable standards, and (3) that the party conducted an acceptable quality assurance program of periodic sampling and testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a non-complying product is found at a facility operating under a refiner's brand name, the refiner must also demonstrate additional elements for a valid defense. This includes a showing that the violation was caused by a party in violation of a contractual understanding imposed by the refiner to prevent such action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The defenses available to regulated parties to rebut the presumption of liability are closely patterned after those adopted for other motor vehicle fuel regulatory programs under 40 CFR part 80, including the gasoline volatility program. The presumption of liability is rebuttable, including the imposition of vicarious refiner liability for violations detected at branded facilities. This regulatory structure is fully consistent with the relevant judicial decisions in this area.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Amoco Oil Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Environmental Protection Agency, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  501 F.2d 270 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (``Amoco II''), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  supra.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, carriers not acting as refiners or oxygenate blenders will not be deemed presumptively liable for violations found downstream of the carrier facility, unless EPA shows that the carrier caused the violation. Accordingly, such carriers will not be required to present a defense to such downstream violations. However, where a violation is found at a carrier's facility, the carrier must meet the defense elements in order to avoid liability. Note that EPA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion to permit a carrier to rely on a properly conducted quality assurance program undertaken by the product owner to satisfy the quality assurance program defense element.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter observed that the proposed regulations fail to account for carriers making consecutive deliveries to reformulated gasoline and conventional gasoline markets. Such carriers may appear to have complying and non-complying product on board, according to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue raised by this commenter applies not only to carriers, but potentially to any party who transports gasoline (e.g., a distributor or reseller). EPA does not consider the transportation of both reformulated and conventional gasoline in the same vehicle to be a violation provided that the destinations of the different products are proper and documented, and the products are properly segregated. Obviously, any party in such a situation should use care that the gasolines are not mixed and are properly delivered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

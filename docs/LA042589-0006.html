			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Social Security trustees pronounced the program financially sound well into the  next century, able to pay benefits for the next 57 years. An annual report to  Congress by the Social Security trustees projected that income to the Old Age  and Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds will exceed benefits paid  out for the next three decades. After that, the combined trust funds will run a  deficit until funds are exhausted in 2046. "However, the expected accumulation  of the trust funds during the next 20 to 30 years provides ample time to  monitor the financial status of the program and to take corrective action at  some time in the future," the report said.  </P></p>

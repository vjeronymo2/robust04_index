			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evin Goktas: "The General Staff Supports the </F> Memoradum on Secularism"]    [Text] Ankara--The Turkish Armed Forces have welcomed the  "statement on secularism," which was issued at the end of the  meeting that was held by the chief prosecutors and prosecutors  of 76 provinces and eight districts under Minister of Justice  Seyfi Oktay in Antalya. The chief prosecutors of eight State  Security Courts also attended the meeting. General Dogan Gures,  chief of the General Staff, called Seyfi Oktay to congratulate  him on the joint statement. Gen. Gures said that he also  congratulated all the chief prosecutors and prosecutors who  signed the statement. He said: "I am very pleased by the  issuing of such a statement by the prosecutors at such a time."    Seyfi Oktay said that he was very pleased by Gen. Gures'  call. He said: "The Turkish Army is one of the leading  institutions in which the reactionary forces have been unable to  infiltrate. Therefore, Gen. Gures' message has made us very  happy."    Seyfi Oktay described Gen. Gures' call as "an indication of  the Turkish Armed Forces' sensitive stance on the question of  secularism."    Yusuf Kenan Dogan, under secretary of the Ministry of  Justice, thanked Gen. Gures for his sensitive approach to the  matter. He said: "As the members of the judicial system, we  are convinced that Gen. Gures will be successful in the struggle  he wages against acts of terrorism to defend our homeland. We  wish to stress that we shall always support him."    Dogan said that the prosecutors must maintain an impartial  stance on all the problems, except on matters related to the  safeguarding of the state's indivisible integrity and the  Republic's secular system. Recalling that the Republic's  prosecutors met in Antalya for the first time, Dogan said that  everyone approved the Justice Ministry's effort to maintain the  independence of the courts and the judges. Stressing that the  pro-Ataturk and secular nature of the courts have been restored,  Dogan said: "People who act with common sense do not wish to  even consider that Turkey will move toward a dark era once  again."</p>

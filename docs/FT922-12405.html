			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Property: Framed in oak for custom-built living - Clive Fewins talks to a builder who believes that new barns are better than than old conversions IF YOU ask Roderick James, of Carpenter Oak and Woodland, at Colerne in Wiltshire, why he likes building new oak-framed barns for his clients to live in, he will say it is because there is more chance of making the oak timbers visible inside. 'New barns have more potential. The countryside is full of barns badly converted into homes. We are really specialists in the use of oak for all purposes,' says Mr James. His latest project, besides a mass of restoration work, is to quote for roof trusses, rafters and oak win dow frames for the new Pounds 2m Coin Street Site D housing development near the National Theatre on the South Bank. His company will build you a barn of any shape or size, provided it has a green oak frame. If you happen to have bought a plot with an existing dwelling on it - a small bungalow, say, in a ruinous state - the new barn can be erected over it while you live in the bungalow almost until it is demolished. Roderick James has done this on several sites - and there has been no difficulty in obtaining permission to build an oak framed barn and demolish the bungalow. In most cases the barn has been more suitable for the site and to the architectural vernacular of the area. Of course this cannot happen every time. But James uses his 'bungalow-eating' concept to demonstrate the advantages of houses supported by giant frames of green, or unseasoned, oak - in particular the speed with which a frame can be erected. 'Oak has great warmth and strength,' he says, 'Its smell and colour appeal to the senses, and it weathers beautifully. People looking for old buildings have often decide that a new barn frame suits them best.' Adaptability is partly the reason for this. You can add to what you have got, and if the frame shifts, or needs more support, you can modify or strengthen it fairly easily. You can also extend a house built in this way: a high proportion of this company's work is providing oak frames for extensions to existing buildings. Of course, our forefathers knew all about the framing method. There are few areas of Britain where, for several hundred years until the late 18th century, oak, elm, and other hardwood framing ('half timbering,' to some) was not used in building. Those old crooked buildings from the past add character to many old towns and villages. Although Roderick James and Charles Brentnall, his co-director, are keen to dispel any myth that they have a slavish regard for the past (they are keen to incorporate modern hi-tech features into the interiors of their buildings), the methods used are essentially traditional. Each frame, designed for the individual client, is cut from oak which is still 'green' - that is, used within two to three years of being felled. Although there is no shortage of oak for building, they have a renewal policy. Through the company, you can buy a 'parcel' of felled green oak for seasoning, as an investment. Carpenter Oak and Woodland also plants two new oaks for every 15 cubic feet of oak used: for an average sized barn it will plant between 20 and 30 new trees. All the buildings are prefabricated, like their 16th, 17th, and 18th century predecessors (usually in the village sawpit), and transported to the site, to be erected in between four and six days on a base already prepared by a sub-contractor. The company also custom-makes smaller buildings such as garden structures and adaptations of barns - like the oak-framed studio being built for Andrew Parrott, the conductor, in the grounds of his Oxfordshire home: a free standing structure some 10 yards from Mr Parrott's 17 century farmhouse, connected to it by a glazed, oak-framed walkway. All the outside framing is of oak, which will be visible from the inside on completion. The roof contains exactly the same sort of jointing and windbracing that you will see in a 17th century barn. Not far away, in the village of Little Wittenham, on the Thames near Dorchester, Charles Brentnall and his team will shortly erect the oak roof of an accommodation block and study centre for a group of ecology and conservation volunteers, and a separate building with a double oak jetty. Another interesting scheme is on the site of the former Victorian village school at Appleshaw, near Andover, where Patrick Bogert is acting as project manager for a new Carpenter Oak frame which will act as an extension to the old brick and flint building which will be the family home. Oak is also also suitable for modern schemes such as the Coin Street development. Architect Alex Lifschutz plans that all 11 houses and 16 flats will have oak rafters and roof trusses as visible features. The cost of the oak frame is not a high proportion of the total cost of a Carpenter Oak house. Building costs usually average about Pounds 50 per sq ft, James says, but architects' fees are likely to be high.

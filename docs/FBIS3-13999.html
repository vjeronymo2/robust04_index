			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bharat Bhushan: "Divergent Discourses"] </F>   [Excerpt] Several recent U.S. actions have created an  impression bat not only is America not keen on improving  relations with India, but that it seeks to play a partisan role  on sensitive issues such as Kashmir. Levels of mutual suspicion  are high, stray foreign policy pronouncements are magnified and  the arena of diplomatic discourse appear to be shrinking.    Missives from the White House and an apparent softness  towards state sponsorship of terrorism by Pakistan make it  difficult to take Washington's claim of being even-handed in  South Asia at face value. There are other indications, although  by no means definitive as yet, that the U.S. may be getting into  a special relationship with Pakistan.    It is not known what kind of sop was offered to Pakistan  when  the U.S persuaded it to withdraw the resolution on Kashmir in  the UN General Assembly last year. If it was the withdrawal of  the Pressler Amendment, as some observers believe, then clearly  the U.S. has not been able to deliver. It remains to be seen  where the US stands on Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir at the  meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights at Geneva later  this month.    Pakistan seems adamant on moving the resolution to embarrass  India. But it could be embarrassing for the U.S. also, if it  were forced to abstain from voting on an issue apparently  concerning human rights. If the U.S. persuades Pakistan to  desist once again, then it will not be without Pakistan  extracting a price. If, however, the U.S. votes with Pakistan,  it can kiss goodbye to any hope of improving ties with India.    For the time being, it appears that Indo-U.S. relations are  being impelled by the momentum of daily reactions and  counter-reactions to stray signals from Washington. While the  Indian establishment seems to have been hijacked by media  reaction, the Americans have become prisoners of their own  verbiage on human rights.    It is unrealistic to expect that a Democratic administration  would give up its public stance on human rights in Kashmir  especially when abuses continue to occur. But there are severe  problems with the way this administration views Kashmir and its  attempts at engaging India on human rights issues to the  exclusion of other aspects of Indo-U.S. relations.    For a start, arms of the U.S. foreign policy establishment  are yet to understand the difference between annexation and  accession when it comes to Kashmir, e.g. the U.S. Central  Command Chief General Joseph P. Hoar's comments on how India  "annexed" Kashmir in 1947. The Americans talk breathlessly about  taking the, opinion of the "Kashmiri people" into account. But  Pakistan has changed the demographic profile of the area  occupied by it since 1947 to such an extent, that donkeys would  decide about the future of horses if there were anything akin to  a plebiscite.    The U.S. also does not understand the consequences for the  rest of India if Kashmir were to become independent. Given the  existence of a large and scattered Muslim population, there  could be a thousand Bosnias in India itself. Happenings in  Europe and Central Asia should be warning enough against a blind  faith in self-determination for nationalities.    Kashmir and nuclear proliferation are no doubt important  issues and must engage the attention of India. But day-to-day  provocations have meant that the U.S. is either deliberately or  by default letting Pakistan set the agenda for Indo-U.S.  relations. On its part, lndia has also failed to project its  foreign policy agenda in the U.S. beyond these issues. This  either shows a lack of understanding of Washington or an  inability to orchestrate its various arms.    The U.S. foreign policy establishment is not a monolithic  self-conscious entity. U.S. foreign policy is formed through a  multiplicity of discourses. The range cannot be covered  adequately by the blanket term "American point of view". The  State Department, Commerce Department, Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative, Pentagon, White House and Congress all have a  say in foreign policy formulation. In addition, U.S. foreign  policy is also influenced by powerful business lobbies,  think-tanks and special interest groups including NGOs  [Nongovernmental Organizations]. [passage ommitted]    India is not very high in the priority list of the U.S. It  hardly receives any aid and private investment is not coming to  India out of charity. Nor is there any prospect of GIs landing  in Kashmir at any future date. Indian diplomacy, inasmuch as  there is a need to carry on an economic and political  relationship, can attempt to work around the drum-beaters of  Clinton's global agenda instead of hoping for a good chit from  the U.S. like an eager schoolboy.  *</p>

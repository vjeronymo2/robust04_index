			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Jian (6392 0256): "Wang Hanbin Believes </F> There is Great Potential for Economic Cooperation and Trade  Between China and the United States"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wang Hanbin,  vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, told a visiting  delegation comprising famous U.S.-based Chinese entrepreneurs in  a meeting that there is great potential for economic cooperation  and trade between China and the U.S. and that much can be  accomplished by overseas Chinese residing in the States in  promoting Sino-U.S. relations.    Wang gave his guests a detailed account of China's economic  development over the last few years, especially the reforms with  respect to the fiscal and taxation system, foreign exchange,  foreign trade, and prices. He said China has put into effect  more reform measures than ever this year, adding that facts show  the situation regarding economic operations has been good. If  these reform measures prove finally successful, this will mean  that China has taken a decisive step forward toward the  socialist market economy, he added.    Wang said: China will continue to develop steadily and open  wider to the outside world. With the economic development,  China has great market potential. Many big companies in the  world, including quite a few U.S. companies, are interested in  exploring the China market, while China is also in great need of  U.S. funds and technology. The two sides can intensify  cooperation to their mutual benefit.    Wang emphasized: China and the United States have a common  duty to safeguard world peace, including peace in the  Asia-Pacific region, and this is in their common interest.  Improved Sino-U.S. relations will be beneficial to both  countries and to peace and development in the world, including  the Asia-Pacific region.    Wang said the large numbers of Overseas Chinese constitute a  valuable opportunity for China's development. He hopes Overseas  Chinese and Chinese-Americans in the United States will  contribute to promoting Sino-U.S. relations, help China to  develop into a prosperous and powerful country, and help develop  the U.S. economy.    The visiting delegation comprised seven members: Chen  Hsien-chang, senior adviser to the Illinois Springfield [chun  tian 2504 3944] City CTI Scientific and Technological Advisory  Company; Chen Sulian, chairwoman of the board of the In Flight  [fei xiang 7378 5046] Airline Food Company Limited and her  assistant; Liao Tzu-kuang, chairman of the board of the Liao  Tzu-kuang Investment Group; Yao Chien-min, chairman of the board  of the Asian Integrated Industrial Company Limited; Yao-Chin  Yi-li, president of the Hawaii Pioneer Deposit Bank; and Li  Ching-tao, president of the Billion Asian International Company  Limited.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 28 (CTK) -- Czech Finance Minister  Ivan Kocarnik said last night he did not share Slovakia's  optimism that the old bloc claims and liabilities between the  Czech Republic and Slovakia were far lower than estimated by the  Czech Industry and Trade Ministry. Speaking to journalists after  his return from the spring session of the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, he was reacting to a statement  made by Slovak Deputy Premier Brigita Schmognerova made during  their meeting in Washington.    Schmognerova indicated that the method of settling the  "old-bloc claims" had "still to be considered," Kocarnik said.  He added that Schmognerova, however, did not say how the  government wanted to solve the situation.    On Tuesday [26 April] Kocarnik told CTK in Washington that  the Czech and Slovak Governments had agreed on March 25 to  convert the liabilities into ECUs using the exchange rate in  effect before the currency split. The claims would be  transferred to the new bloc and the old would be abolished, he  added. Under the old bloc, the 1-1 ratio is applied for  payments related to trade deals concluded before the currency  split on February 8, 1993. The new bloc uses ECUs.    Kocarnik also pointed out that the Czech Government had  approved an amendment to the Czech-Slovak payments agreement to  this effect two weeks ago. He stressed last night that it was  in Slovakia's interest that a settlement reached as soon as  possible because Slovakia was the loser. Both parties agreed it  was now necessary to verify the volume of old claims and  liabilities, he added.    Kocarnik pointed out that until September Slovakia's steps  would be influenced by the elections slated to take place on  September 30- October 1. It will therefore be difficult to  distinguish between economic rationality and election-motivated  politics.</p>

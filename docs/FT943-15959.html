			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Socialist MEPs pick UK leader Mrs Pauline Green, a former British policewoman, was yesterday elected leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the dominant bloc in the increasingly powerful assembly. Leadership of the group has been the most influential position in the parliament, which was re-elected last month. Under the Maastricht treaty, the Parliament now has powers to veto laws passed by EU governments in the council of ministers, and can reject the new European Commission the Twelve are struggling to find a president for, in succession to Mr Jacques Delors. Mrs Green, who previously led the UK Labour group (with 62 members now the largest national group), said last week that the parliament's approval would depend on the new Commission president's attitude towards Europe's jobs crisis. Yesterday she received overwhelming backing from Socialist MEPs, who number 199 out of 567. She won 169 votes out of 175 ballots cast.</p>

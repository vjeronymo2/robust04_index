			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / BA faces strikes in cabin crew pay row BRITISH AIRWAYS services in the UK and Europe face disruption after cabin crew on short-haul flights voted to strike over pay cuts for employees in UK regions. The TGWU general workers' union said a ballot among 2,900 cabin crew members had produced a two-to-one majority for strike action. BA's proposals would mean cuts of Pounds 2,000 for employees operating European and UK routes from Birmingham and Manchester who the company says earn Pounds 12,000 a year. Next year they would receive a pay rise only if inflation was above 4 per cent. In addition they would lose holiday pay supplements. BA said pilots and ground staff had agreed to similar proposals. The effects of the cuts would be softened by such methods as phasing them in over an 18-month period. Mr George Ryde, TGWU national secretary, said cabin crew would not tolerate wage cuts while Lord King, BA chairman, and other BA bosses were 'handing each other huge increases', and the compnay was reporting its second-highest profits. The TGWU would not say how many people voted in the ballot. BA managers believe that might signify a low turnout, especially among London cabin crew.</p>

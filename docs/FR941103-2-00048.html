			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> DOMA was incorporated in the state of Texas on May 31, 1973, and was headed by Don Martin, President. Its crude oil trading activities, during the audit period, were based in Abilene, Texas and consisted primarily of purchasing and reselling crude oil (without substantially changing its form) to purchasers other than ultimate consumers. DOMA was, therefore, a reseller as that term is defined at 10 CFR 212.31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 13, 1979, ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation (NOPV) alleging that during the audit period DOMA committed violations of DOE regulations in its sales of crude oil. On February 7, 1984, ERA issued an Amended Proposed Remedial Order (APRO) Case No. 6A0X00111. The APRO alleged that both DOMA and Martin charged prices in excess of the maximum legal selling price; purchased uncertified barrels of bottoms oil and sold them as new or stripper oil; and miscertified various petroleum products as new or stripper crude oil in violation of the following statutory provisions: 10 CFR 205.202, 210.62(c), 212.10, .93, .131.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Office issued the APRO as a Final Remedial Order to DOMA and Martin on July 25, 1985. See Final Remedial Order at 29. DOMA and Martin have remitted $5,982.32, plus interest, to the Office of Controller, of the Department of Energy. These funds are available for distribution through Subpart V and currently are being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> II. Jurisdiction and Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify the persons who were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 9 DOE &para;82,508 (1981) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> III. The Crude Oil Refund Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> A. Crude Oil Refund Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The monies remitted by DOMA and Martin will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases (MSRP).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). This policy has been utilized in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986) (the August 1986 Order).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the MSRP, 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be refunded to the federal government, another 40 percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may initially be reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The MSRP also specified that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid will be disbursed to the federal government and the states in equal amounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See, In re <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> :  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement) for a more detailed discussion of the MSRP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous comments received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). This Notice provided guidance to claimants that anticipated filing refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. In general, we stated that all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, crude oil price control period; and (2) prove they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. End-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry would be presumed to have been injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges and would not be required to submit proof of injury.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See City of Columbus, Georgia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 16 DOE &para;85,550 (1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> B. The Proposed Decision and Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On November 12, 1992, OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute the crude oil violation amount that had been obtained from DOMA and Martin. The amount of money covered by the PDO is $5,982.32, plus accrued interest. OHA tentatively concluded that the funds should be distributed in accordance with the MSRP and the April Notice. Pursuant to the MSRP, OHA proposed to reserve 20 percent of these funds ($1,196) for direct refunds to applicants who claim that they were injured by the crude oil violations. We stated that the remaining 80 percent of the funds would be distributed to the states and the federal government for indirect restitution. After all valid claims have been paid, any remaining funds in the claim reserve would also be divided between the states and the federal government. The federal government's share ultimately would be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PDO proposes evaluating claims for the DOMA and Martin crude oil refund proceeding in exactly the same manner as OHA has evaluated claims submitted in other crude oil proceedings. Claimants generally will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. The PDO proposed that the refunds be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount which has been calculated in accordance with the description in the April Notice. We further stated that the crude oil overcharges were presumed to have been absorbed, rather than passed on, by applicants who were (1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Price and Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751&hyph;760h. In order to receive a refund, end-user claimants need not submit any evidence of injury.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See Shell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 17 DOE at 88,406.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We provided a period of 30 days from the date of the PDO's publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  in which the public could submit comments regarding the tentative refund procedures. More than 30 days have elapsed, and OHA has received no comments concerning the proposed procedures. Accordingly, the OHA will finalize the PDO as set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of the MSRP, 80 percent of the crude oil violation amounts subject to this Decision or $4,785.86 in principal, plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government for indirect restitution. Accordingly, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to transfer one-half of that amount, or $2,393.00, plus interest, into an interest bearing subaccount for the states, and one-half, or $2,393.00, plus interest, into an interest bearing subaccount for the federal government. In accordance with previous practice, when the amount available for distribution to the states reaches $10 million, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to make the appropriate disbursement to the individual states. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds allocated to each state is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements that apply to any other crude oil funds received by the states in accordance with the Stripper Well Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Main parties all seek changes in accountancy ALL THREE main parties would consider changes to the structure and operation of accountancy after the election, it emerged yesterday. Mr John Redwood, the minister for corporate affairs, said he would contemplate 'tip-off' legislation to encourage auditors to inform regulators of any fraud if the existing voluntary arrangements were judged to be failing. He said it was too early to assess whether the self-regulatory mechanisms for auditors set up late last year would work. He said he had no reason to believe they would fail, but did not rule out more direct parliamentary intervention if they were not effective. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's official voice on the City, said she wanted to review the legal definition of fraud. She is also considering requiring auditors to comment publicly on the quality of a company's internal controls, and for compulsory audit committees filled with non-executive directors. She ruled out any requirements for auditors to a company to be 'rotated' periodically, or to prevent them carrying out other work for their audit clients. She said that would reduce the profession's ability to attract high-quality recruits and might harm its competitive advantage in Europe. However, she said she would consider a requirement for partners working on any one audit client to be changed periodically to bring a fresh perspective to the job. Mr Alex Carlisle, trade and industry spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said he would support an Office of Fair Trading investigation of the profession. He said the recent mergers between firms had reduced the number too far, and suggested that liability cases threatened the survival of those which remained. 'Accountancy is now concentrated in far too few hands,' he said. He also said the law governing auditors' liability in detecting fraud should be reviewed.

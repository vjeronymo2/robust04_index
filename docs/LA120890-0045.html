			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME FEAR EXTENSIVE TRAVEL HURTS BUSH'S PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> President Bush's hectic travel schedule, which has included visits to Europe,  the Middle East, Mexico and South America in the last three weeks, is stirring  serious concern among some longtime advisers that it is adversely affecting his  performance at a critical time in his presidency.  </P> <P> With the United States on a virtual war footing with Iraq and congressional  critics openly blasting his Persian Gulf policy while he is away, some of the  President's own advisers have said privately that there has been a lack of  long-range planning on the crisis.  </P> <P> "The guy's never in the United States," said one political consultant who has  worked with Bush over the years. "The theme song of this Administration is 'On  the Road Again.' "  </P> <P> And, said a former Bush staff member who still advises the President: "I  sometimes think he substitutes travel for really coping with serious problems."  Noting that the agenda for the South America trip was more symbolic than  substantive, this adviser added: "I worry that it's hard to keep him focused on  major problems."  </P> <P> Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the President has been on the road  for 70 days, at times arriving at stops looking drawn and tired. His extensive  travels during the military standoff with Iraq also have put him in the awkward  position of spending time addressing less immediate issues while major  developments were breaking in the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> While Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was in Baghdad Thursday announcing the  release of hostages, for example, Bush was at a press conference in Santiago  answering Chilean reporters' questions about Latin American issues.  </P> <P> But White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in Caracas, Venezuela,  the final stop on the President's current tour of South America, that Bush has  not been isolated from events in the gulf during the trip. "The President's got  all the communications he needs. The President's on top of it. We have no  second thoughts or concerns," he said.  </P> <P> "The situation's under control. (Secretary of State James A.) Baker and the  President have talked. All the decisions have been made that needed to be  made," he said. But he said Bush had not spoken in recent days with any allied  leaders because he "hasn't found a need to yet."  </P> <P> Some of the President's advisers have blamed travel fatigue for occasional  gaffes. After tacking a flight back to Geneva onto the end of his already  crowded trip to Europe and the Middle East last month in order to visit with  Syrian President Hafez Assad, Bush stunned his aides by allowing himself to be  photographed in a smiling, animated pose with a cheerful-looking Assad.  </P> <P> White House staff members considered the resulting front-page photos of Bush  and Assad a public relations disaster. The Syrian is a dictator whose country  harbors terrorists and who many consider as evil as Iraq's Saddam Hussein --  the dictator the President called "worse than Hitler."  </P> <P> "That would not have happened if he hadn't been tired or if he had had someone  like Jim Baker there to protect him," one adviser said.  </P> <P> The incident reminded the adviser of the time in June, 1981, when a weary Vice  President Bush arrived in Manila after an arduous journey and told Philippine  strongman Ferdinand Marcos that "we love your adherence to democratic  principles and to the democratic processes." Opposition leaders, meanwhile,  were condemning the Marcos government's human rights violations.  </P> <P> Concern about Bush's constant traveling, especially his marathon overseas  journeys, date to the earliest days of his presidency. Shortly after his  inauguration, Bush traveled overnight to Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor  Hirohito. He then flew on to Beijing, and, after meetings there with Chinese  leaders, flew, again overnight, back to Washington, stopping briefly en route  in Korea for a speech.  </P> <P> The schedule drew an expression of concern from National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft, who cautioned the President that his frantic pace was exhausting his  staff and setting up the possibility that jet-lagged aides could make  potentially damaging errors on sensitive foreign policy issues.  </P> <P> Bush brushed the objections aside and has continued to ignore advice that he  should go at a more measured pace.  </P> <P> More recently, sources have reported that White House physicians suggested that  the President slow down and curb his travel. "Doctors have warned him, but he's  just jet-propelled," one adviser said.  </P> <P> "The more he goes, the more he goes. Somebody said he's a type A personality  but he's not a type A. They hate what they do. He loves it," the adviser said.  </P> <P> Dr. Lawrence Mohr, deputy White House physician, refused to confirm or deny the  report, declaring that "any advice of this nature would be confidential between  the President and his physicians."  </P> <P> But Mohr said that Bush is in good physical shape, "tolerates travel very well  and is able to sleep and even take a shower on the new Air Force One."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said that Bush has not been given medical advice to rest, "although  the doctor is always telling him to slow down."  </P> <P> In September, the President did begin traveling in a new $181-million Boeing  747 fully equiped with a bedroom and a shower. It clearly makes his journeys  more comfortable, and aides say that he is able to get a good deal of sleep on  the plane.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, some advisers worry that his overseas journeys involve traveling  through so many time zones in such a short period that it's almost impossible  for his biological clock to adapt fully.  </P> <P> "It has to take a toll," one veteran adviser said, "and, when he gets in  trouble, it's usually because he's too busy and tired. It was when he was going  at such a frenetic pace during the 1988 campaign that people said he looked  goofy."  </P> <P> Bush has traveled far more extensively than any other chief executive at this  stage of his presidency. In less than two years in office, he has logged more  than 225,000 miles, traveling to 28 foreign countries and all but six of the 50  states. And there's no end in sight.  </P> <P> After his 17,000-mile trip to Europe and the Middle East last month, he  returned briefly to Washington before traveling to Mexico, a visit one adviser  said had such a thin agenda "it could have been taken care of with a telephone  call."  </P> <P> As for the 11,930-mile journey he is completing today in Caracas, "there  doesn't seem to be a particular need for this trip," one White House official  said.  </P> <P> He returned briefly from Mexico before starting his current six-day trip to  South America. Next month, he plans to travel to Moscow, perhaps other cities  in the Soviet Union, and Greece and Turkey. Plans are also being made for a  trip in February to Australia and probably one or two other countries.  </P> <P> Normally, a President is accompanied on foreign travels by his secretary of  state. But Baker, the President's longtime friend, has caught what one mutual  friend described as "a case of Bushitis" and has been so busy with his own  travel schedule that Bush has had to do without his advice on some recent  trips.  </P> <P> Some of their mutual friends have said that they think both Bush and Baker are  traveling too much to think clearly. "You can't run a country from a plane and,  when you're working and moving, you can't think clearly," one of them declared.  </P> <P> Baker has traveled so extensively, especially in connection with the Persian  Gulf crisis, that he frequently has appeared exhausted from jet lag. He  apparently does not rest as well as Bush during plane trips and frequently  takes Halcion, a prescription drug, as a sleeping aid, according to sources who  travel with him.  </P> <P> Medical authorities say that Halcion, a hypnotic drug, is an effective sleeping  aid and has a wide margin of safety in therapeutic doses. But the 1989 edition  of "The Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs" cautions that possible risks  include "minor impairment of mental functions ('hangover effect')" and  "habit-forming potential with long-term use."  </P> <P> Bush and Baker often joke with each other and with reporters about their  extensive traveling. When Bush took his maiden flight on the new Air Force One,  he smiled at reporters and said: "Have plane, will travel."  </P> <P> But it's no joking matter to some of the President's longtime friends and  advisers, who think that the White House needs to curb his travel and slow him  down. "It's awfully disconcerting," one veteran adviser said. "Somebody needs  to take a careful look at his schedule and persuade him to spend more time in  Washington."  </P> <P> Staff writers Jim Gerstenzang and David Lauter contributed to this story.  </P></p>

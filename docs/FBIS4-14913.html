			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Not the End Yet"] </F>   [Text] Deputy registration was conducted at the regular  meeting of the oblast electoral commission for elections to the  oblast soviet of deputies. The entire list of 34 deputies was  considered and officially registered.    The next issue on the agenda was to schedule the dates for  the elections in those 15 districts where they had not been  held. Commission members had various proposals. Having weighed  all the pros and cons, they decided upon the date of 30 October  of this year. More candidates will be nominated, signatures  will be collected, and there will be registration. Campaigning  will begin on 1 October.    The district commissions could possible have the same  members; the statute on elections allows this. When solving the  problem of district commissions all circumstances will be taken  into account. It cannot be ruled out that the composition of  several of them will be changed.    Complaints from candidates and their authorized agents (not  a  single voter sent a written complaint to the commission)  received after the election were considered at the meeting. A  number of complaints were dismissed since they had already been  thoroughly discussed. On that day members of the commission  began to check out several statements. In the opinion of those  who were asked, with respect to one or two districts the oblast  electoral commission might possibly have to make an additional  decision, that is, the elections could be declared null and void.</p>

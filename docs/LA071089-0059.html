			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> President Francesco Cossiga gave Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti a mandate to  create Italy's 49th post-World War II government. Italy has been without a  government since May 19, when Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita resigned after  criticism of his leadership by the No. 2 party in the governing coalition, the  Socialists. Andreotti, like De Mita, belongs to the Christian Democrats, who  have dominated Italian politics since World War II. The De Mita coalition  apparently fell because of jockeying by the Socialists, led by former Prime  Minister Bettino Craxi.  </P></p>

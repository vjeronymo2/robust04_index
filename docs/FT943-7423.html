			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodman sets date to face music  -Australian institutions are calling for boardroom changes Goodman Fielder, the beleaguered Australian food company, yesterday said it would hold an extraordinary general meeting on October 13, at which shareholders would be able to vote on boardroom changes. The meeting was requisitioned last week by Agrifood Investments, controlled by Mr Doug Shears, a Melbourne-based businessman, plus three big institutional investors. The board met at the weekend to discuss its response. The unhappy investors are recommending the reappointment of two executive directors at Goodman - Mr Barry Weir, chief executive, and Mr Michael Brown, finance director - but suggesting that separate votes be taken over the removal of seven other directors. Four replacement candidates, all of whom have previous food or consumer products industry experience, have been lined up. While the setting of an EGM date may take a little heat out of the Goodman situation, it seems unlikely that any temperature change will be permanent. The problem at Australia's largest food company is one of poor profits performance, and a share price which has gone nowhere for about five years. Measured against the Australian stock exchange food and household goods index, Goodman shares have underperformed by 55 per cent since January 1989. At one level, this looks like another saga of a 1980s corporate creation felled by the harsher climate of the 1990s. For while Goodman is the leading food company in the Australasia region, boasting revenues of over ADollars 4bn (USDollars 2.9bn), it was put together through a flurry of acquisitions and mergers in little more than a decade. Companies incorporated into the group ranged from Davis Consolidated Industries, best known for its gelatine products, to New Zealand's Wattie Industries. One of the last acquisitions, in 1992, was Uncle Toby's, a Melbourne-based manufacturer of cereal-based products whose products range from Vetta pastas to cake mixes. Uncle Toby's executive chairman was Mr Doug Shears and, as part of the deal, he acquired a 3.5 per cent interest in the larger group. Two years ago, a chunk of the Goodman empire was shed when the Wattie operations in New Zealand were bought by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Heinz group for ADollars 428m. Nevertheless, Goodman today comprises a diverse bag of businesses - from food ingredients, poultry, and some Dutch bakeries, to a large domestic milling and baking division, and a smattering of Asian subsidiaries producing mainly baked goods or margarine/oils. A fair portion of these interests are at the commodity end of the food industry, where low-cost production becomes all-important. Some of Goodman's larger divisions - such as poultry and bakeries - have faced intense price competition in recent years. And the group has admitted that more emphasis on innovative marketing and product development may be necessary for a sustained upturn. In the meantime, earnings have stagnated. Operating profit before abnormals stood at ADollars 117.2m in the last full year to end-June 1993, compared with ADollars 124.8m in 1988-89. Earnings per share were 10.4 cents, compared with 12.7 cents five years earlier. Gearing remains fairly high - a legacy of the acquisition trail. The ratio of net debt to equity, excluding goodwill, at end-1993 was about 75 per cent. In spite of this - and in the face of persistent stock market speculation - no bidder has emerged to take over, or dismember, this assortment of interests. Management was changed last year, but the current chief executive, Mr Barry Weir, has suggested that improvement will only come through a overhaul of the individual businesses. The group, he told shareholders in a letter earlier this year, was capable of making a 9 per cent to 10 per cent return on sales across its various operations. But he warned: 'The problem is not so simple we can solve it through the straightforward cutting away and disposal of one or two of our major business groups'. This has done nothing for the Goodman Fielder share price which sagged to ADollars 1.25 two months ago and closed yesterday at ADollars 1.47. Mr Shears was issued his shares at ADollars 1.70. Institutional investors are justifiably dismayed. One of the trio supporting the EGM call put the case bluntly yesterday: 'What is needed is a strategy in place for Goodman Fielder which the market can have confidence in, and which puts some support into the share price'. A second aspect to the Goodman saga is the role which three institutions - the AMP, Bankers Trust, and the State Authorities Superannuation Board - have played. While it has become common practice in the US and UK for institutional fund managers to manoeuvre directors in and out of office at poorly performing companies, it is a rare sight in Australia. A number of local fund managers admit they are anxious to see the Australian market shed its low-quality reputation. Last year, institutions fought and won a battle over Rupert Murdoch's plan to introduce differential voting rights at News Corporation. Now there are plans by the Australian stock exchange to introduce corporate governance rules, along the lines of Britain's Cadbury report. So should the Goodman episode be seen as another example of this stepped-up vigilance? And should it carry a warning message to other lacklustre companies? 'Yes and no', said Ms Elizabeth Bryan, general manager of investments at State Superannuation Corporation, one of Goodman trio. 'No one wants to reach a point where this sort of action is necessary. It is unusual, but we have a duty to ensure a company has strategies that engender profits and support for the share price.'</p>

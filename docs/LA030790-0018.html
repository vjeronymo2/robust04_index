			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE EXECUTIONS  </P> <P> As a registered Democrat who is opposed to capital punishment, I am saddened  and disappointed by the treatment of this issue by the three candidates for  California governor. On one side is Democrat Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, a  self-proclaimed opponent to the death penalty who has allowed his political  ambitions to turn him into a hypocrite calling for a renewal of executions in  the state.  </P> <P> On the other side are Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete  Wilson, both strong advocates of the death penalty on the grounds that it will  make California safer from criminals.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, there is no evidence to support the idea that capital punishment  is a deterrent, and in fact there is strong evidence to support the theory that  it serves only to brutalize society and make us more tolerant of violence. I am  sickened and appalled by cowardly or ignorant politicians who continue to take  advantage of growing public frustration about crime to encourage  state-sanctioned killing in order to obtain votes. Having to choose between  three such candidates in the upcoming gubernatorial elections is truly  disheartening.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN M. BROWN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: Too-high camp starting late because of the London Underground bomb scare - and, because I was among the many who missed its first minutes, I want to give it what credit I can. Mainly credit for its strange nerve. To turn a Ruth Rendell mystery into a musical is a surprising idea; yet, that is only for starters. You are told who did what to whom at the start, and even why (kind of). The rest of the action is a social-interest run-through of events leading up to the mass murder. Since all the characters are more or less stock types, they are all treated with a heavy dose of satire. One actor keeps stepping in and out of character to narrate, several characters sometimes stand on the sidelines and speak comments into microphones, and the murderess steps out of character to address us in her final song. All this makes it a deliberate deconstruction of the Ruth Rendell type of whodunnit. But do not get the impression that writer Neil Bartlett and composer Nicolas Bloomfield have planned this as an intellectual show. Actually, it's just camp. The worst factor is the music. Bloomfield attempts a variety of genres to suit the various situations - music hall, operetta, hymn, etc. - and all of them rob the characters of spontaneity and credibility. Worst, the vocal lines are written too high for every member of the cast, and lead them up into shouts, yelps and falsetto. Beverley Klein has to zigzag between narration and playing the scandal-mongering village postmistress. Either mode enables her to play broadly to the audience; she isn't subtle, and her vibrato is corrugated, but she is the liveliest thing on stage. Sheila Hancock, as the unlettered housekeeper-cum-murderess, gives a physical performance of marvellous inarticulate intensity and detail, but sounds like a re-run of her several Cockney roles each time she opens her mouth. The members of the victim Coverdale family are cast in a operetta-to-Sondheim mould. The daughter Melinda has to manage tricky upward leaps of a ninth in midword in her big number; Maria Kesselman, the purest singer in the cast, handles this with ease. As the parents, Elizabeth Brice sings like an out-of-tune English rose and Emile Belcourt brays and bleats in long phrases and an inappropriately Canadian accent. Their big, limp love duet sounds as if it would burst into I'd Give Anything from Oliver if only it had the energy. A Judgement in Stone, Lyric, Hammersmith, until July 4.</p>

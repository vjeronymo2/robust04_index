			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Appeal on County Hall plan rejected AN APPEAL against the government's decision to approve the conversion of London's County Hall into a hotel, residential and conference complex was rejected in the High Court yesterday, John Willman writes. The appeal was lodged by Lambeth Borough Council in an attempt to oppose the change of use of County Hall, which formerly housed the Greater London Council, now abolished. Lambeth argued that Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, was under a duty to preserve the Grade II listed building in its historic local-government role. Mr Justice Pill said there was nothing unreasonable about the stance taken by Mr Heseltine and he ordered Lambeth to pay the costs of the secretary of state, the London Residuary Body which proposed the development and the County Hall Development Group, the Anglo-Japanese consortium which is in liquidation. The next step in the battle remained unclear last night. A planning application to move the London School of Economics into County Hall is due to be heard on February 19. The council has 21 days to appeal against the High Court decision. An appeal would almost certainly postpone a final decision until after the general election. If Labour wins the election it may make County Hall the headquarters of its planned Greater London Authority.</p>

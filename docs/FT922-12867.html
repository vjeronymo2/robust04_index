			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firm RATES firmed slightly across the board, despite sterling's steady climb against the D-Mark. The markets were increasingly pessimistic about the prospects of a rate cut and marked the key three-month interbank rate up from 10 3/8 per cent yesterday to 10 1/2 per cent. 'Even though the currency continued to strengthen . . . the market will wait until sterling is closer to the central rate (of the EMS) before it goes bananas about a rate cut,' said one trader. The June short sterling contract on the futures exchange held steady at its opening level of 89.81, implying a base rate of 10.19 per cent. This was a touch higher than the rate implied by the 89.85 level at last night's close. The rates were pushed firmer, partly by the large shortage left in the market at the end of the day. Market players had opposing views as to the motives behind the shortage. Some suggested the Bank of England had deliberately refrained from generous market operations to dampen Monday's brief enthusiasm over a rate cut. However, those in the discount houses said the Bank had been prepared to take all the paper that was offered. The problem had been that traders were either not prepared or unable to sell the bills. One suggested that market players might be holding on to bills to get maximum profits from the forthcoming four-day Easter weekend, when the Bank might have to hold on to paper for a bit longer. The initial forecast for a shortage of Pounds 1.65bn was revised to Pounds 1.75bn. The central bank made an early round of offers with Pounds 249m taken up by the market. The Bank purchased bands one, three and four bills, and band four local authority paper at rates of 10 3/8 , 10 5/32 , and 10 1/16 per cent. Later dealings resulted in Pounds 264m assistance, comprised of band one and four bank bills at 10 3/8 and 10 1/16 per cent. A nominal repurchase agreement of Pounds 14m falling due on May 5 was pitched at 10 7/16 per cent. The Bank took just Pounds 491m of the shortage out after lunch, while late assistance of Pounds 360m left the market with an estimated Pounds 390m shortage. In Germany, call rates held firm at 9.65 per cent despite the injection of emergency funds by the Bundesbank. In the US, Federal funds traded at 3 3/4 per cent, on par with the new presumed target.</p>

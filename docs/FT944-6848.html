			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Rewind your body clock - Health in the air / tablets might control the jet-lag, but BA aims to save passengers from themselves As a regular traveller and news junkie, I am an avid fan of Cable News Network and the BBC World Service. Usually, the first thing I do on arriving in a hotel room after a long flight is switch on the television and catch up with what has happened while I was airborne. The problems begin when watching television becomes an enforced alternative to sleep. Flipping through the channels while sitting bolt upright in an unfamiliar bed in the small hours is not my idea of a good time. Battling against a wall of fatigue the next day is even worse. Over the years, such torment has led me to search systematically for a jet-lag cure that really works. Apart from regimes which involve fasting for several days before a flight - a remedy as painful as the affliction - I think I have tried almost everything. Going easy on food and alcohol and drinking plenty of mineral water in-flight helps a bit. So does Dioralyte, a rehydrator which restores body fluids removed by cabin pressurisation. Arnica, a homoepathic treatment for shock, can also make a difference. Camomile tea induces bed-time drowsiness without the morning-after effects of sleeping tablets. But all are only partial solutions. It was not until last summer that I came across something which really seems to attack the causes of the problem. Called melatonin, it comes in the form of tablets which you dissolve under the tongue at bedtime, starting three days before a flight and continuing for three days after. I have used melatonin so far on two trips to the far east and one to the US. It has done the trick each time, enabling me to sleep soundly for several hours during the flight and adjust quickly to the local time-zone on arrival. So much so that after a recent 19-hour journey from Seoul via Hong Kong, which landed at Heathrow at 5.30am, I was able to enjoy a friend's birthday party that evening and do a full day's work the next day. What is melatonin's secret? According to Clive Cookson, the FT's science editor, it is a natural substance and its efficacy is scientifically based. It works by supplementing the hormone which sets the human body clock and is normally produced only during hours of darkness. Melatonin is sold by health stores and is not a registered pharmaceutical. It has therefore not undergone extensive laboratory testing. As one of its first guinea pigs on the FT, I am being closely monitored by sceptical colleagues waiting for me to turn green or suddenly go bald. So far, I am happy to report, there has been no evidence of side-effects. It is also reassuring that melatonin is widely used by scientific researchers into jet-lag. Anyway, any adverse symptoms would have to be pretty bad to equal the ordeal of severe jet-lag. Melatonin is available from Revital Health Stores, 3a The Colonnades, 123/151 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1 W9RZ</p>

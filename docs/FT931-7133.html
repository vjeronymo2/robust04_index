			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Storm clouds gather over global economy: The G7 must find a rapport tomorrow OFFICIALLY, it will be a 'get to know you' session, with no decisions or communique planned. But tomorrow's meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors in London could turn out to be one of the more important gatherings of the policy-making group - as well as giving Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new US Treasury secretary, and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the recently-appointed Japanese finance minister, a chance to meet G7 colleagues. The ministers - from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - will be meeting in extremely difficult circumstances. Europe's economy is causing particular concern, with output in Germany and France falling and threatening to pull the rest of the continent into recession. Japan is facing one of its most serious economic crises since the second world war and its trade surplus is growing. Protectionist pressures, encouraged by difficult economic conditions, are again emerging as a threat to world trade and welfare. Currencies are under renewed strain with the yen testing new highs against the dollar and sterling and the lira fluctuating around historic lows against the D-Mark. Of the G7 industrialised democracies only the US has a politically strong administration. Mr Brian Mulroney's resignation this week as Canadian prime minister has come hard on the heels of corruption scandals and a cabinet reshuffle in Italy. France's Socialist government is facing defeat in next month's National Assembly elections. The centre-right coalition in Germany has so far failed to produce convincing answers to the economic and social problems caused by unification. Japan has a weak government. Since sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last September, the government of Mr John Major has been among the west's walking wounded, with the Tory party divided over Europe and unable yet to declare an end to the longest recession since the second world war. The US, by contrast, appears to have returned to growth with a charismatic young president and a programme to break years of budget gridlock in Washington. But in terms of international economic policy, President Bill Clinton's administration is very much an unknown quantity. Other G7 members will be looking to Mr Bentsen for clarification. Mr Bentsen has said that he wants to revive the G7 as a forum for co-operation, putting a recent history of bickering in the past. But nobody has a clear idea of his plans while some of the new US administration's actions over trade and currency have unsettled America's partners. The Japanese have come away from preparatory talks with the US feeling wrong-footed on currencies. US officials first gave private assurances that Washington was not seeking an increased value for the yen to combat Japan's growing trade surplus only for Mr Bentsen to say last Friday that he favoured a higher yen. Efforts have since been made to play down Mr Bentsen's remarks. Indeed, the US Treasury line is to support Mr Hayashi and plans for fiscal stimulus in Japan. Mr Bentsen may simply have made a mistake and spoken out of turn, but his comments have left uncertainty in the air. Recent US moves against imports of steel and leisure vehicles and President Clinton's adverse comments about the European Airbus programme are difficult to reconcile with the president's pledge to put a 'real effort' into completing the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks. The UK hosts of the meeting think that the US administration will support the multilateral trading system and that its trade grumbles concern 'specifics'. It is clear, however, that the new US administration will put America first as part of its policy to revitalise the economy. Mr Bentsen pushed hard for tomorrow's meeting, suggesting that the US will seek support from its allies through action to boost growth and combat unemployment. The German delegation can expect to be questioned over the Bundesbank's monetary stance. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, will seek to reassure his partners that the Bonn government is pressing ahead with its solidarity pact, with its provisions for curbing the budget deficit and controlling wages. There may even be discreet hints of an early cut in Bundesbank interest rates to ease the pressure of Germany's tight monetary policy on its ERM partners. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, will point to the UK's expansionary fiscal policy and the substantial easing of monetary policy since September as evidence that Britain has 'done its bit' for global growth. Japan may outline a new fiscal package. But the atmosphere of the talks will be as important as the substantive discussions. Numerous economic problems are looming beyond the G7's boundaries, with near hyperinflation in Russia topping the list. The big industrial powers need to establish a rapport among themselves if they are to deal effectively with such difficulties. If they achieve that in London, the G7 meeting will have been a success.  -----------------------------------------------       INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS  -----------------------------------------------       Optimism indices for expected sales         in first quarter of each year  -----------------------------------------------                     89    90    91    92    93  ----------------------------------------------- Japan               na    80    57    12   -19 US                  68    59    36    40    55 UK                  60    -2   -19     7    17 Europe              57    44    30    27     7 World               60    47    21    26    31  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Dun &amp; Bradstreet  -----------------------------------------------</p>

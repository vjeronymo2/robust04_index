			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (17): Visitors presented with a wider choice - Where to stay / The recent increase in the number of hotel rooms on offer has brought with it competitive prices and discounts for groups MORE than a year later than planned, the Hotel Arts, housed in one of twin towers of the Olympic Village development, is due to open under the management of Ritz-Carlton. Since the developer's financial problems have been resolved, the work has restarted and last month 4,500 hopefuls were interviewed for the 300 staff jobs in the huge conference hall below ground, where they were served with refreshments and entertained by a string quartet. Ritz-Carlton has prudently avoided setting a date for its opening except to state that it will be before the end of the year. When it is open it will offer visitors to Barcelona something new: a five-star hotel on the beach, in the former Olympic village, five stops on the metro from the centre and a short walk from the old centre and the port. Barcelona is a low-rise city, and so the advantage which the Hotel Arts can claim is the range of views. The one looking back over the city, straight back up the Avinguda Carles I to Gaudi's Church of the Sacred Family is particularly impressive. The main drawback is that although 70 per cent of the flats in the Olympic Village have been sold, far fewer have been occupied and so the hotel's immediate surroundings, except for the restaurants of the Olympic port next door, appear deserted. A complete contrast to this is a hotel in the heart of the old part of the city - the Hotel San Augustin, just off the Carrer Hospital in what is colloquially known as the Barri Xines or Chinatown. The city council has been transforming this district, which has faced the usual inner city problems of crime and lack of investment, with a radical rebuilding plan. The San Augustin is an example of a small, three-star hotel which has been modernised without losing its 19th century character. As a result of the increase in the number of hotel rooms in the past few years and the slowing of the economy, the prices in Barcelona are generally soft, and so it is worth asking for concessionary rates, especially for groups. As a rough guide starting prices for a double room in a three-star are Pts 14,000, going up to Pts 20,000 in a four-star and to Pts 24,000 and upwards in a five-star hotel. In the centre is a choice of family-run hotels such as the five-star Claris, one block away from the Passeig de Gracia, whose owner, Jordi Clos, is Barcelona's foremost Egyptologist, as can be seen from the works of art in the hotel. The four-star Hotel Regente is a another small, family-run hotel on Rambla de Catalunya, an upmarket version of the more famous Las Ramblas into which it runs. Some of the top rooms have patios with excellent views, and a tiny open air swimming pool sits on the roof terrace, a blessing in midsummer. Other four-star establishments include The Gran Hotel Havana on Gran Via - an example of how modern, stylish Barcelona design has brought an old building back to life - and the Avenida Palace further along the same street which has never lost its traditional atmosphere, complete with liveried staff. But the most impressive location can be claimed by the newly-expanded Comtes de Barcelona directly opposite Gaudi's La Pedrera on Passeig de Gracia. Of the new hotels, two have been built specifically to serve the Fira or Exhibition Centre. The Barcelona Plaza is a large, grey-stone faced block overlooking the Placa Espana, with a spacious and colourful interior. Behind the Fira at the foot of the Montjuic mountain is the Feria Palace. Both of these are brand new modern four-stars with a touch of style. But the most prominent addition, apart from the Hotel Arts is the five-star Hotel Juan Carlos I, located on the way out of the city inland about 1km from the Placa Francesc Macia on Diagonal. The inconvenience of being this far out of the city is balanced by the extra space the hotel offers. The lobby is a huge atrium reaching up to the top of the building, prestigious tennis and polo clubs are next door and the hotel has its own jogging track and children's playground. For those who would like to get away from the city in the evening, Sitges, a former fishing village which still retains much of its original character, is well within reach being only half an hour away by train south along the coast. There, the four-star San Sebastian Playa, completed in 1990 but blending in unobtrusively with its surroundings overlooks a small, sandy bay, and can seem much further away from Spain's second largest city than it is.</p>

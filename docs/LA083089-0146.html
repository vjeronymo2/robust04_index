			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> KINGDOM GETS GOLD, MISSES RECORD  </P> <P> Roger Kingdom won the gold medal in the 110-meter hurdles today at the World  University Games, but cold weather and stiffness prevented the two-time Olympic  champion from challenging his own world record.  </P> <P> Americans also won three gold medals in relays on the final day of the games,  tying them with the Soviet Union for the lead with nine.  </P> <P> "I was very stiff this morning, and I was concerned about that," Kingdom said.  "I just didn't have enough." Kingdom won easily, but his time of 13.26 was well  outside his 2-week-old world record of 12.92.  </P> <P> "I wanted to break it again," he said. "I felt pretty good yesterday. (In the  heats) I was hitting quite a few hurdles, and today we had the wind in front of  us, which is good because I ran well against the wind. But I just wasn't able  to break the record."  </P></p>

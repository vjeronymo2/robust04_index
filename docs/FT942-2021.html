			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Venezuela rating may fall Standard &amp; Poor's may lower the Republic of Venezuela's double-B minus debt rating, which applies to the country's Dollars 2bn-worth of eurobonds. The country's Brady bonds, consisting of Dollars 20bn of debt issued as part of its 1990 commercial bank rescheduling agreement, are not rated. The rating was placed on CreditWatch with negative implications due to 'the disarray in the Caldera administration's economic policies (and) the deepening crisis in the financial sector'. The move comes at a time when other Latin-American countries, such as Mexico, are hoping that their ratings will be raised.</p>

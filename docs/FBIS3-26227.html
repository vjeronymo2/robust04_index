Song Jian, state councillor and director of the Environment  Protection Committee of the State Council, made the remarks here  today at the closing ceremony of a national conference on  environment protection work.    Song said his committee will focus on inspecting how well  the  environment laws and regulations are observed this year.    "Those who break the environmental laws and regulations,  irrespective of their positions, will shoulder the legal  responsibility," Song said.    Song said the government officials will not only be judged  in  terms of economic results but also their achievements in  carrying out the environmental laws and improving the  environment.    What he termed "major and important cases" of destruction of  the environment will be fully investigated and handled according  to law, Song said.    The state councillor said the environment pollution has been  more and more severe in some areas, and disputes on environment  pollution emerge from time to time.    Song said the National People's Congress and the State  Council will jointly inspect the environment protection work in  a dozen provinces this year.    Some of the polluters found will be obliged to improve  substantially within a set time, others will be shut down, he  said.    Especially rural enterprises will be further checked, he  added, since some of them lack the money and expertise to  control pollution, and thus bring more damage to the environment.    Song Jian said the role of mass organizations should also be  brought into full play to protect the environment.    They should be encouraged to participate in this drive  themselves, as well as to supervise the governmental work on  protecting and improving the environment, he noted.</p>

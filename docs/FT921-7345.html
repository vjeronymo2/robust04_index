			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / LA on track for a new rail era: The car is no longer unchallenged in California IS THE CITY of Los Angeles pouring billions of dollars into a hole in the ground, or have its city planners finally seen the light? Nearly 30 years after Los Angeles' last trams and commuter trains stopped running, depriving the city of any semblance of a public transport system apart from the occasional bus, it is building a metropolitan rail system linked to two new commuter train networks. When this ambitious 30-year, Dollars 150bn system is completed, Los Angeles' mass transit rail network, covering 350 miles, will be the largest in the US after New York's. The very idea of mass transit may seem anathema to a city which, in the modern American mind, is even more closely associated with the car than Detroit. But it is interesting to recall that, in the 1930s, Los Angeles boasted the nation's longest metropolitan rail system, with more than 1,200 miles of track. As recently as 1945, Pacific Electric's Big Red cars ferried 109m passengers each year. However, the construction of the Pasadena Freeway in 1940 spelled doom for public transport, with the rise to supremacy of the car aided by General Motors, which bought up the city's transit systems, removed its streetcar rails and put in its own buses, which the company said were more profitable. Los Angeles became a model for the futuristic city and a transport-planning blueprint for much of the western US. But, while it took decades for the experiment of a trainless city to sour, the city's residents no longer relish choking on polluted air. Moreover, Los Angeles County's streets and highways can no longer cope with a population that has multiplied three times to today's 9m from 3m in 1940. The freeway speed limit is 55 miles per hour, but the actual average speed is only 36mph, falling fast and estimated to drop to only 17mph by 2000. It is this congestion which the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is hoping will lure large numbers of commuters to its trains. More than 80 per cent of the funding is coming from local sources - mainly taxes voted in specifically for the project. Most of the remainder is coming from the federal government. The commission also plans to attract customers in more sublime ways: about Dollars 100,000 per station has been set aside for art works. The aim is to keep the stations in character with their surroundings, which in Los Angeles leaves more than a little scope for the imagination. At the underground station at Hollywood and Vine, once the heart of old Hollywood, a yellow brick road will lead riders to ticket booths. Downstairs, passengers will wait for trains on star-studded floors under columns decorated with palm fronds while watching old movies projected above the tunnel entrances. The platform at El Segundo overground station near the city's aerospace companies will have a giant hand holding a paper aeroplane. Meanwhile, the project has been dogged by controversy, over construction problems as well as cost. Underground construction has been plagued by fire, accidents and leaks. The latest battle is over the Hollywood Boulevard portion of the system. Local residents are worried that construction will stall the area's recent revival. When the downtown segment was built, big trenches in the streets disrupted the flow of traffic. However, the paramount problem will remain whether Angelenos can be lured in numbers away from the safe isolation of their cars. Critics maintain that the new system is little more than a very expensive public relations ploy on the part of local politicians. Mr Peter Gordon, a professor of urban planning at the University of Southern California, believes that the city would do better to pay a lot more attention to highway management, charging drivers the full cost of parking, pollution and congestion. 'Rail was a good idea when most people went downtown,' he said, 'but most people go from suburb to suburb, not downtown.'</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLACING THE BLAME FOR THE CONDITION OF ROCK 'N' ROLL  </P> <P> Calendar received nearly 40 letters on Robert Hilburn's July 15 cover story,  "Is Rock Running on Empty?" Here are seven in addition to the dozen published  July 22.  </P> <P>  Blaming rock's bankruptcy of originality on radio programmers and a complacent  audience missed the mark like a Gerald Ford golf shot.  </P> <P> The blame rests on the record companies and their A&amp;R people.  </P> <P> These "fat cats" have ridden the crest of rock's monetary success for years by  perpetuating clones of the latest fad. As soon as a label comes out with a new  artist, every other label's A&amp;R robots go out and sign a similar act in an  effort to stay "current." No wonder the poor radio programmers have changed FM  radio from what once was a mecca of musical originality into a Top 20 joke! And  as for MTV programming, ditto!  </P> <P> JOSEPH NICOLAU  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

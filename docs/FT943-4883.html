			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: BAe-Matra missile divisions nearer to merger deal - Farnborough Air Show Matra, the French missiles group, said yesterday that it expected negotiations with British Aerospace over the merger of their missile interests to be completed by the end of this year. Mr Noel Forgeard, head of Matra Defence and Space, said that such deals were a practical way for the European defence industry to respond positively to the consolidation of US companies. Speaking at the Farnborough Air Show, Mr Forgeard said that all operational and strategic issues had been resolved. However, he added that several technical problems remained, including those over differing accounting standards. It is thought that BAe and Matra have agreed to form a 50-50 joint venture of missile operations. However, as Matra's order book is larger than BAe's, the British company will have to pay to gain an equal shareholding in the joint company. Strong disagreements over the size of the payments are also thought to be blocking the deal, which has been under discussion for the past 18 months. Mr Forgeard said that unlike some defence industry leaders he thought that Europe had to respond to the consolidation and cost reduction currently going on in the US industry, but that Europeans also had to be realistic and accept that there were greater barriers to consolidation in Europe. Companies should accept that pooling interests into joint ventures, as with BAe-Matra, was a sensible next step, and that greater efforts had to be made to cut costs. Speaking at Farnborough, Mr Forgeard attacked Sweden's recent decision to buy medium-range air-to-air missiles from Hughes of the US rather than Matra. He contradicted official Swedish reports which said that the French missiles were less capable and more expensive than the US alternative.</p>

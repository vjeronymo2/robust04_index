			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn to a delegation of visiting Israeli </F> Arabs offering condolences on the death of the queen mother, at  the Royal Court in Amman on 12 May -- recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. Dear brothers; you are our kinsfolk. You have  our appreciation for holding fast to your dear and precious land.    You have come to commiserate with us on the death of my  mother, may her soul rest in peace. The Hashemite family has  always had the privilege of being close to Palestine, its  people, its cause, and their rights. The next generations will,  God willing, follow the same path. If I say that, for us, you  are family and brothers, I am stating a fact. I, and all of us  here, thank you and appreciate your gesture. When you are in  Amman, you are at home. I thank you for the kind words I heard  from you. Please convey to all Arab brothers our love and  appreciation. I hope we will be able to see you here among us  more often. I beseech God that we are at the threshold of a new  era under which the Palestinian people enjoy their rights on  their national soil and in which all parties live in peace, so  all concerned can lead secure, dignified, and free lives and  build for the benefit of future generations what we have been  deprived of. We take pride in our brotherhood. We will always  be there for you. You are most welcome here. Give my  greetings, love, and appreciation to all the kinsfolk and  brothers on whose behalf you are visiting us to cheer us in our  grief.    In any case, such is life. What has befallen us is God's  will and our fate. Thanks be to God, a lucky human being is one  who leaves behind the memory of his good actions. We pray to  God that we will have been among those who reached out and were  generous toward others, so we may have a clear conscience and  serve our kinsfolk and do all that we can to help both present  and future generations. Once more, I thank you; May God's peace  and blessing be upon you. I wish you a happy stay here among  your kinsfolk and brothers.</p>

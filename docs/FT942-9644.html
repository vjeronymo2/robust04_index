			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Barlo Barlo Group, the Dublin-based radiator and packaging company, announced doubled annual profits as it continued to draw benefit from acquisition and rationalisation. On turnover ahead from IPounds 49.7m to IPounds 97.3m (Pounds 95.4m), including IPounds 19.5m from acquisitions, pre-tax profits for the year to end-March emerged at IPounds 7.78m (IPounds 3.9m). Directors attributed the profits growth to expansion of the radiator activities, bolstered by the restructuring of IRG and a maiden nine-month contribution from Belgium-based Veha, acquired in July 1993. Net borrowings at the year end amounted to IPounds 4.87m (IPounds 6.34m) representing gearing of 11 per cent. Earnings per share improved to 5.11p (3.65p); a final dividend of 0.6p doubles the year's total to 1p.</p>

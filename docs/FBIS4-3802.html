			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Tsutomu Hata was  elected Japan's prime minister here this afternoon in both  houses of Parliament.    He won 274 votes in the 511-seat lower house, and 127 in the  252-member upper chamber.    Hata, head of the second-largest party within Japan's ruling  seven-party coalition, was thus chosen to succeed Morihiro  Hosokawa, who stepped down because of a financial scandal on  April 8.    Hata, 58 and foreign minister in Hosokawa's cabinet, is  expected to form a new cabinet tonight, the second coalition  government since last August.</p>

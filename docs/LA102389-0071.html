			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRET SYSTEM OF RAIL LINES, TUNNELS REPORTEDLY CONNECT KEY BEIJING SITES  </P> <P> China's hard-line leaders have built secret rail tunnels under Beijing that  could be used in crushing resurgent protests or to enable officials to flee in  a crisis, according to a program to be broadcast today.  </P> <P> A former Chinese civil servant, who fled to Hong Kong after troops crushed  pro-democracy demonstrations in June, told the British "World in Action"  television program that the tunnels link leaders' homes, government buildings,  the central bank and an army base.  </P> <P> "We built up this network over 40 years as a defense against a foreign invader  . . . but now they could use such means to escape from China or to deal the  last blow against the people," he said, according to a transcript of the  program.  </P> <P> Rumors of a secret rail line and an interlinking honeycomb of passages have  circulated in Beijing for many years, but there has never been any  confirmation.  </P> <P> The informant said there is a station under the Great Hall of the People and  another station at the government residence compound, Zhongnanhai.  </P> <P> Still another line goes to the Bank of China, allowing security forces to  evacuate gold reserves in a crisis, he said. There is also a line to the Xi  Shan military base, carved into the side of a mountain to the west of the city.  </P> <P> The program did not reveal the name of the former civil servant, saying only  that he was a junior official in his 20s with access to high-level information  and close contact with leaders.  </P></p>

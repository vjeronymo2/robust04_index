			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC APPARENTLY VOTES TO SECEDE  </P> <P> Slovenes overwhelmingly voted Sunday in favor of their republic's secession  from Yugoslavia, according to unofficial results.  </P> <P> They voted despite federal threats of armed intervention.  </P> <P> The turnout was reported to be 85% of 1.5 million eligible voters.  </P> <P> Initial unofficial results of the plebiscite said that, with 55% of the ballots  counted, 94% of the vote was for Slovenia to secede from Yugoslavia and 5% was  against. One percent of the ballots were invalid.  </P> <P> Thousands danced and cheered and some uncorked champagne on the streets of the  Slovenian capital of Ljubljana upon hearing the early results.  </P> <P> "This is a historic night. We have waited for it for 1,000 years," Slovenian  Prime Minister Lojze Peterle said.  </P> <P> Demands for Slovenian independence have been growing since last April, when the  republic voted to end Communist rule, in force for 45 years.  </P> <P> Three other Yugoslav republics have also ousted the Communists, leaving only  two republics under Communist rule and helping to push Yugoslavia toward a  political crisis that diplomats say could end in its disintegration.  </P> <P> Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade said Slovenia's plebiscite was tantamount to  unilateral secession, and they threatened reprisals against the republic.  </P> <P> Although Slovenian leaders have described secession as a final option, the huge  vote for independence could encourage them to push for a complete break with  Yugoslavia.  </P></p>

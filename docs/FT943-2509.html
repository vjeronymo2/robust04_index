			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Belief in the wrong factor Sir, The Conservatives' belief that tax cuts will restore their party's standing is wrong. Job security is far more important. The feel good factor will not return until the country stops reorganising and downsizing. Who these days feels that their job is secure? Who does not know someone who has been made redundant? Not until companies start growing again and the public sector stops reorganising will the country feel good. M C Frampton, Meikleholm, 30 Smithbarn, Horsham, West Sussex RH13 6EB</p>

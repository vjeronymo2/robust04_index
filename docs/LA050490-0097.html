			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> $3 MILLION PER POUND;  </P> <P> ARTIFACTS: THE WORLD'S LARGEST PEARL ARRIVES IN STUDIO CITY.  </P> <P> The famed Pearl of Allah arrived in Los Angeles Thursday, not by flying carpet  or atop a white steed, but in an armored truck, under a firestorm of flashing  cameras.  </P> <P> The 14-pound convoluted pearl looks rather like a petrified white brain and  appeared better suited to a home in formaldehyde than on satin. But it retained  an aura of romance as it was installed in a Studio City vault and briefly  exhibited for photographers from around the world.  </P> <P> "I am very proudly a part of this priceless and remarkable artifact," co-owner  Peter Hoffman said as he placed the pearl on a display stand draped in black  velvet and gold lame. "It has a wonderful history and some remarkable legends  to it."  </P> <P> Considered the world's largest pearl, its flamboyant arrival in the San  Fernando Valley marked the latest turn in a fanciful, 2,500-year history and  the end of a nine-year legal battle as twisted as its hard, white furrows.  </P> <P> Hoffman said the pearl had been appraised at $42 million by the San Francisco  Gem Laboratory.  </P> <P> It is destined for sale, possibly to a foreign collector, Hoffman said. The  proceeds will settle a number of debts before Hoffman and his partners see any  profit, according to Matthew I. Berger, a Beverly Hills attorney who represents  one of the creditors with a claim on the pearl's sale proceeds.  </P> <P> Hoffman, a second-generation jeweler who grew up in West Los Angeles, declined  to discuss the pearl's legal history. But Berger said his client, the  Trans-Exchange Corp. of Texas, filed suit in 1981 in U.S. District Court in Los  Angeles after Hoffman and a partner failed to pay off a $200,000 promissory  note.  </P> <P> The loan covered the purchase price of the pearl in 1980 from the estate of  Wilburn Dowell Cobb, a San Francisco archeologist who obtained it in the 1930s  and met Hoffman in 1977, three years before his death.  </P> <P> After Trans-Exchange Corp. won a judgment for repayment in the mid-1980s and  sought assets to seize, the pearl could not be found, Berger said. It was  finally located in Colorado Springs, Colo., where Hoffman's partner in the  pearl's purchase had used it as collateral for another loan, Berger said.  </P> <P> Hoffman had it brought to Los Angeles so that he could supervise its sale.  </P> <P> Hoffman -- who owns a third of the pearl and must see it sold to cover the  debts he and his partners owe in its purchase -- said he would like it bought  by a private collector who will ensure its public display.  </P> <P> "It's like a great masterpiece, like a Van Gogh," Hoffman said earlier this  week, adding that the pearl had changed him.  </P> <P> "It has made me a very spiritual person," Hoffman said. "Everything I do I look  at from a spiritual point of view instead of from a material point of view."  </P> <P> Wrapped in layers of plastic foam and bubbles, the pearl rolled into Los  Angeles from Denver Thursday morning. About two dozen photographers waited  while the Loomis Armored Inc. truck positioned itself in front of American  Vault's main entrance off Laurel Canyon Boulevard.  </P> <P> According to legend, the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu had his nephew  implant a small amulet depicting the faces of Buddha, Confucius and himself  inside a clam. His hope, according to a press release, was that the resulting  pearl would be "transplanted into ever-larger clams" and "handed down from  generation to generation" as "an enduring symbol of peaceful coexistence  between all peoples."  </P> <P> According to this legend, the philosopher's descendants settled in the  Philippines, where the pearl was reimplanted in a giant tridacna clam offshore.  It was lost during a Ming Dynasty-era typhoon but rediscovered in 1934 by a  Philippine diver, who drowned in the process.  </P> <P> The Muslim chief who obtained the pearl thought it looked like the turbaned  head of Mohammed and proclaimed it the Pearl of Allah. A few years later, Cobb  received the pearl as a gift after he saved the chief's malaria-stricken son  with modern medicine, Cobb later told reporters.  </P> <P> As cameras clicked Thursday, Hoffman pointed out what he said were likenesses  of the faces of Lao-Tzu toward the bottom, Buddha in the center, and Confucius  on the left of the great pearl.  </P> <P> Then the Pearl of Allah was whisked away to the vault, where a cast was to be  made for replicas that will be shown to prospective buyers.  </P></p>

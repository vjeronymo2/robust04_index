			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa may visit the United States possibly later this month  or early July for talks with U.S. officials, government sources  said Wednesday [15 June].    Kakizawa is considering making the trip after the budget for  fiscal 1994 passes the Diet around June 23 or 24, the sources  said.    He is expected to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.    Kantor has reportedly been urging Kakizawa to visit the U.S.  to promote talks on bilateral trade framework negotiations.    Japan and the U.S. agreed last month to resume the trade  framework talks, which broke down in February when President  Bill Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met in  Washington.    The two countries have been holding working-level talks  since  then and are scheduled to hold vice ministerial talks in Tokyo  on June 22 and 23 between Deputy U.S. Trade Representative  Charlene Barshefsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi.    Kakizawa is also likely to discuss North Korea's alleged  nuclear development with Christopher along with measures to be  taken by the United Nations, the sources said.</p>

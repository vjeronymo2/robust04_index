			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Banks form alliance for sell-offs: Kleinwort Benson and BZW in joint bid for electricity sale work An alliance between Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, and BZW, the investment- banking arm of Barclays bank, in bidding to become the government's adviser on the next stage of electricity privatisation, could mark the start of a trend in joining forces to win such work. BZW confirmed yesterday that it had teamed up with Kleinwort to bid for the task of selling the government's remaining 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen, the two electricity generators. The sale is expected to raise more than Pounds 4bn. Both banks will be involved in giving advice and in placing the shares. Kleinwort Benson advised on the original privatisation, while BZW was lead financial adviser to the government over the sale of the Scottish electricity companies, and advised Northern Ireland Electricity over its privatisation. Written presentations have already been submitted, and the competing banks will present in person to the Treasury today. Warburgs, which advises PowerGen, is not seeking the task, and other merchant banks would also face conflicts of interest in applying: Schroders, for example, advises National Power. 'The government is faced with quite a difficult task in finding in one house the range of advisory and distribution skills they're looking for,' one banker said yesterday. 'It wouldn't be surprising if a number of alliances were being forged.' Another banker pointed out that it was more commonplace elsewhere for banks to join forces. 'We could be seeing the start of a trend that has come across the other side of the Atlantic,' he commented. Last year, for example, First Boston teamed up with Merrill Lynch to win the mandate to act as global co-ordinators in privatising YPF, Argentina's national oil company. The timescale for the sale of the government's residual stake in the generators remains uncertain, although the Treasury is keen to get the proceeds in the 1994-95 financial year. The decision not to refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission removed one possible obstacle to going ahead in the autumn. But the delay in reaching a price-capping agreement with the electricity regulator could contribute to putting back the sale until February 1995.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another comment stated that consent should be sought from those persons whose names and telephone numbers have been placed on an inmate's telephone list. For several reasons, the Bureau disagrees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, requiring each recipient's prior consent would impose an administrative burden resulting in delayed processing of inmate telephone lists. Specifically, obtaining prior consent would require the Bureau to send each potential recipient a form asking if the recipient wanted to receive an inmate's calls. If the potential recipient wanted to receive the calls, he or she would then have to return the completed form back to the institution before the number could be entered on the inmate's telephone list. During the weeks or months to complete this process, the inmate would be unable to place non-emergency calls to this potential recipient. This anticipated delay was a matter of concern to some commenters and is avoided in the final rule by discontinuing the use of the form requesting prior consent from potential recipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, to the extent that non-inmate commenters were concerned about receiving unwanted calls from inmates, the Bureau believes that this concern is substantially alleviated by sending a notice letter to potential recipients other than an inmate's immediate family and persons on the inmate's visiting list. In the event a recipient subsequently notifies us in writing that he or she does not wish to be contacted, the recipient will be removed from the inmate's list. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A letter will not be sent to an inmate's immediate family and persons on the inmate's visiting list because the Bureau assumes that these individuals would not object to receiving telephone calls from the inmate. Of course, if these individuals do not want to receive calls from an inmate, they may simply notify the Bureau in writing and the Bureau will remove their numbers from the inmate's telephone list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the final rule contains other provisions that seek to protect the public from harassing or unwanted inmate calls. First, the rule provides that the inmate shall acknowledge that, to the best of the inmate's knowledge, the person or persons on the list are agreeable to receiving the inmate's telephone call and that the proposed calls are to be made for a purpose allowable under Bureau policy or institutional guidelines. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(1). Inmates who violate this provision may be subject to discipline. See 28 CFR 540.100(a). Also, the Bureau may deny a proposed telephone number if it determines that the inmate's ability to call that number would pose a threat to the public. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Bureau's compiling of inmate telephone lists to effectively manage a debit-billing telephone system does not violate any Fourth Amendment privacy rights of the recipient. This information is voluntarily provided to the Bureau by inmates who seek to make telephone calls and there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in this information. A person's telephone number is known by the telephone company and the people who call the number, as well as by the person to whom the number is listed. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Smith  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Maryland,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 442 U.S. 735, 61 L.Ed.2d 220, 99 S.Ct. 2577 (1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the monitoring of inmate telephone conversations (other than properly placed calls to attorneys) is a matter of public record. See newly designated 28 CFR 540.102 (formerly &sect;540.101). A number of courts have upheld this practice as permissible under federal wiretap statutes (See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paul,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 614 F.2d 115 (6th Cir., 1980),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 446 U.S. 941) and not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. (See, e.g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carlson,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 645 F.Supp 1430 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). This fact further undermines any possibility that a recipient of inmate calls can have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the information on inmate telephone lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Several commenters claimed that the proposed regulations violate their Sixth Amendment right to counsel. One commenter noted that ``in this policy there are no guidelines for legal calls.'' Some commenters claimed that the proposed regulations prevent or in some manner limit legal calls. We disagree. The amended telephone regulations do not affect an inmate's access to unmonitored telephone conversations with his or her attorney.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

A consultant of this commission Valeriy Menshikov explained  that in the international convention "On Prohibition of  Development, Production, Storage, and Exploitation of Chemical  Weapons and its Destruction" signed on January 13, 1993 Russia  indicated that there were about 40,000 tons of chemical weapons  in its arsenal, stored on 7 bases, 6 -- in Russia's European  part and one -- behind the Ural Mountain Range.    However, as Menshikov says, there were several cases of  secret destruction of chemical weapons and poisonous gases in  the summer and autumn 1993.    Given the fact that official destruction of chemical weapons  should be carried out under the supervision of international  controllers, now, as before Russia possesses 40,000 tons of  chemical weapons. According to Menshikov, this means that by  the moment the convention was signed the amount of these weapons  exceeded the announced one.    Menshikov failed to answer the question whether this means  that there are military bases with chemical weapons which were  not announced officially and if by now the number of the  chemical weapons has been brought in correspondence with the  announced number.    Menshikov specially stressed that destruction of chemical  weapons in accordance with the signed convention is an important  step but "not a sufficient one." In his words, in order "to put  an end to the possibility of chemical war and its threat" it is  necessary to make public all data about the production, storage,  testing, and destruction of chemical weapons in the past and to  thoroughly investigate and, if necessary, to decontaminate the  regions where it was stored.    In the adverse case, Menshikov believes, the effects of  chemical weapons earlier dumped on the territory of this nation  and in the nearby seas will still be felt for some decades to  come.</p>

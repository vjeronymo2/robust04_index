			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): New name for the 'one-stop shop' - In a Nutshell Business Link has been chosen by the UK government as the brand name for Britain's network of one-stop shops, advice centres which bring together the skills and information bases of Training and Enterprise Councils, chambers of commerce and enterprise agencies. The Department of Trade and Industry is known to have been unhappy about the down-market image created by the term 'one-stop shop'. The government has also approved a seventh pilot scheme, in Leicestershire. There are plans to establish a set of accreditation criteria to ensure the centres provide a high-quality service.</p>

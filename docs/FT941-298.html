			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (4): Revolution has been orderly and cautious - The Banks as Brokers On a sultry July morning last year, Mr Atsuyoshi Yatsunami took the short walk from his office at the Industrial Bank of Japan to the offices of the brand new IBJ Securities, and opened a chapter in Japanese financial history. Mr Yatsunami is the president of the fledgling broker, one of the three subsidiaries of banks to open that day and the first to conduct securities business in Japan's domestic market. Although he believes that the reform will in time represent a radical change in the way financial markets work, he regrets the fact that it is far from complete. The opening up of the securities market had been legislated in April 1992, despite heated opposition from the existing 200 or so brokers, for whom life was tough enough already. It was the latest breach in the dam of tight financial regulation that has been eroded since the early 1980s. But in typical Japanese style, the revolution has so far been orderly and cautious. The Ministry of Finance permitted three companies to start last July; IBJ Securities, and LTCB Securities, both subsidiaries of long-term credit banks, and Norinchukin Securities, a subsidiary of the agricultural bank. They were joined later in the year by subsidiaries of two trust banks  -Sumitomo Trust and Mitsubishi Trust. This month the Ministry of Finance gave permission for the powerful city banks to enter the market later this year. The business of the new securities companies is severely circumscribed. They may underwrite bonds and equities, but may only trade in straight bond markets. They are not permitted to trade in equity-related secondary markets  -equities, convertible bonds or warrant bonds. Since the secondary bond market is still - despite recent deregulation there too - in the words of Mr Shigeaki Katagiri, president of LTCB Securities, 'miserably small', the new brokers rely heavily on bond underwriting business. They might have regarded that as a blessing. Equities have not been providing the established brokers with a high life of late and the banks' subsidiaries would have had a hard time eking out a living on the stock market. But the tiny plot they have been allowed to cultivate has been a fertile one. In their first six months, IBJ SEcurities were involved in 26 domestic bond issues, 20 as a manager. They lead-managed two samurai bond issues and managed nine others. LTCB Securities were involved in 16 domestic issues and several samurai bond issues. Although these are small beer in comparison with the near-oligopolistic shares of the Big Four, they represent a gradual encroachment on the territory of the existing brokers. The limits on the activities of the banks may seem more stifling if, as some suspect, the current buoyancy in the fixed income market proves transitory. The last year has been an exceptionally strong one for bond issues. Having increased by 60 per cent in 1992-3, the total value of new bond issues looks set to double in the financial year 1993-4, to nearly Y7,000bn. Some brokers, however, put that down to weakness in equity markets and see the pace of corporate bond issuance tailing off if equities recover. But such a setback would probably be short-lived. There is a growing trend in Japanese markets towards direct borrowing by corporations. LTCB's Mr Katagiri says: 'Currently only 20 per cent of Japanese corporate borrowing is through the bond market, compared with nearly 80 per cent in the US. We only need that proportion to rise slightly in the next few years to bring about an enormous increase in our business.' Strict fire walls are enforced by the regulators - at LTCB and IBJ Securities, the staff even wear different-coloured uniforms from their parent's employees. Under pressure from the established brokers, the Ministry of Finance ruled that broking subsidiaries were forbidden from lead-managing issues for companies whose main bank was the subsidiary's parent. Despite this, the banks' primary advantage over the competition is their client relationships. At IBJ, the entire staff of the subsidiary was seconded from the parent bank. Last month the fruits of the links with bank customers were realised when IBJ revealed that it was, for the first time, lead-managing a bond issue by Nissan; the most significant feather in its cap so far. The arrival of the banks has stung the brokers into action. On the day the subsidiaries opened, Nomura announced a cut in its commissions, and fees are expected to fall further. Senior Nomura officials, although troubled by the competition, believe the real threat is still to come. Nomura says that the current participants - the long-term and trust bank subsidiaries - are not a significant challenge. Their clients tend to be very large companies who already exercise considerable choice in their selection of brokers. The city banks, who arrive later this year, have clients who are smaller and much more likely to cling to the bank's skirts when venturing into the stockbroking business. The established companies' response has been two-pronged: hold on to their existing market domination by developing ever-more-sophisticated products for their clients, and retaliate by encroaching on enemy territory. To this end the Ministry of Finance has relaxed the rules on the type of products they may offer. Some funds they sell look increasingly like bank deposits: more and more liquid and an important source of competition for bank deposits. The new firms have little more than the narrowest of niches in the overcrowded securities business. If deregulation is pursued further, there is little doubt that they pose a severe threat to many of the middle-tier brokers, already stricken by the excesses of the bubble years. Their capital strength and strong client base will mean they can survive all but the worst vicissitudes of the market. But the finance ministry is clearly in no hurry to complete the revolution. The new players, although pleased with their performance so far, feel that the strait-jackets they occupy are too tight. Their current business amounts to a small fraction of that of the Big Four brokers. When the city banks join the fray, their pleas for more deregulation will become harder to resist. But until then, the banks must continue to compete on a playing field that, as one analyst says, is tilted at an angle of about 45 degrees against them. Or, as Mr Yatsunami puts it: 'We are like an aircraft with one wing. We can't really be said to be functioning properly until we acquire a second.'</p>

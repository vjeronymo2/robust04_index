In addition, the  demand in real estate for industry, tourism and commercial  services will also be very big. Various kinds of development  zones at state and provincial levels will become new keen areas  for investment, more and more foreign businessmen will engage in  this sector.    Third, the country will see an increase of about 150 new  cities and 3,000 new towns by the year 2,000. Urban  construction and old cities' renovation will speed up.

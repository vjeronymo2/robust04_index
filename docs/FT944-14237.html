			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Orion pushed into liquidation - Dutch insurer can cover its commitments at London subsidiary Nationale-Nederlanden, the Dutch insurer, said yesterday it had sufficient provisions to cover its commitments at its UK subsidiary, Orion, the London-based insurance company which was pushed into provisional liquidation on Friday. Nationale-Nederlanden, which is part of the Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch financial services company, halted its cash support to Orion and its subsidiary, Overseas Insurance, on Friday morning, prompting the London-based companies to apply to the UK High Court for provisional liquidation. Orion, which pulled out of writing new business two years ago, is one of a number of companies which have underwritten specialised commercial insurance in the London market, often participating in contracts alongside syndicates at Lloyd's of London. Like Lloyd's, these companies have been hard hit by claims stemming from pollution and asbestos-related awards in the US and by a string of poor results in other sectors. Mr Paul Evans and Mr Richard Boys-Stones of Price Waterhouse, the provisional liquidators, said they had not yet examined the financial position of either Orion or its Overseas subsidiary but noted that gross liabilities 'might be of the order of Dollars 1.5bn'(Pounds 940m). Nationale-Nederlanden declined to comment on the liquidators' gross figure but said that Orion and Overseas Insurance could expect to recover funds from their own reinsurance claims. The operations of the two companies were deconsolidated from the accounts of ING in 1993. The liquidation of Orion should have no effect on the profit and loss account of Nationale-Nederlanden - or ING - as the company is convinced that existing provisions will prove to be sufficient. The company would not give a figure for the expected reinsurance recovery. On Friday the statement from the provisional liquidators helped push ING's shares down on a generally lower Amsterdam stock exchange. Nationale-Nederlanden bought Orion in 1970. Claims on policies written by Orion before August 1970 and by Overseas Insurance before March 1969 are not the liability of the Dutch company.</p>

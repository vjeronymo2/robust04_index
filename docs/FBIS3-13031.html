			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evelyn Gordon] </F>   [Excerpt] Had planned security measures been properly  implemented, the Hebron massacre could probably have been  prevented, Acting OC Central Command Maj.-Gen. Dani Yatom told  the commission of inquiry into the killings yesterday.    However, he said, five of the six men -- one soldier, three  border policemen and one policeman -- who were supposed to be on  duty inside the Tomb of the Patriarchs were missing. The border  policemen hadn't been awakened in time -- which had never  happened before -- while the soldier had been sent to replace  someone else.    Because of the missing forces, Yatom said, no one saw Baruch  Goldstein enter the Isaac Hall. It is still not known which of  the three entrances he used.    Goldstein's presence during the dawn prayer meeting,  however,  was normal, and therefore aroused no comment, he said.    Yatom also said the army had not prepared for the  possibility  of Jewish terror, because past experience had not led anyone to  believe this was a problem.    Yatom's testimony, part of which was given behind closed  doors, was the main event of the first day of hearings, though  several other army officers also testified.    Today, the commission will tour the Cave of the Patriarchs,  and tomorrow it will continue to hear testimony from the Israel  Defense Forces.    The commission will begin hearing Palestinian testimony next  week, after the end of Ramadan, according to Supreme Court  President Me'ir Shamgar, who heads the commission.    The other commission members are Supreme Court Justice  Eli'ezer Goldberg, Nazareth District Court Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-Zu'bi, Open University President Menahem Ya'ari, and former  chief of general staff Moshe Levy.    Al-Zu'bi repeatedly asked why Jews were allowed to bring  weapons into the cave, instead of leaving them at the entrance  -- which, Goldberg pointed out, is the custom at all other  public places. Though the ammunition must be removed from the  weapons upon entry, it can be replaced within a second, Shamgar  noted.    "What is the logic of letting someone go among a crowd of  worshipers with an automatic weapon?" al-Zu'bi demanded.    In reply, Yatom stressed that the history of the past years  has been one of Arab terror against Jews, not Jewish terror  against Arabs. Therefore, he said, this is where the army  focused its efforts.    "Hundreds of attacks by Arabs against Jews -- that's the  history of the past few years," Yatom said. "I look at the  overall picture of Arab attacks against Jews and Jewish attacks  against Arabs, and on the one side there are hundreds, while on  the other, a few isolated incidents... We came to the  conclusion that taking the Jews' weapons away would endanger  their lives."    "A crazy act like this isn't something we expected in light  of our accumulated experience," he added, noting that even at  the start of the intifada, when Jewish-Arab relations were much  worse than they are now, Jews had not committed retaliatory  murders.    There have also been no intelligence warnings of planned  attacks by Jews, only of planned attacks by Arabs, Yatom said.  This was repeated by all the other officers interviewed.    The idea of a massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs would  have seemed particularly far-fetched, he added, because there  were so many places not guarded by the army where it would be  easier to commit mass murder. Furthermore, there has never been  a murder attempt there in 27 years, and while there have been  Jewish-Arab confrontations, these generally occur when both are  using the Isaac Hall. This was not the case that morning.    For all of the above reasons, no one ever raised the  suggestion that Jews should leave their weapon at the entrance,  nor has the army ever discussed the possibility of Jewish  terror, Yatom said.

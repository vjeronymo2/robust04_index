			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just received a special telephone statement  by Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic for Bosnia-Herzegovina  Radio and Television.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We have just ended, five  minutes ago, a meeting with the European troika: European Union  Chairman Papoulias of Greece; Kinkel; and Claes, who was the  previous EU chairman. Some other European statesmen were also  present, Van den Broek among them. Some 20 of them attended the  meeting. We discussed -- I am talking about things that have  not been made public today because they happened just now -- we  discussed the promotion of peace in Sarajevo, the reconstruction  of Sarajevo, the appointment of EU administrators for Mostar and  visions regarding the reconstruction of these cities. In all,  what could I add to what I said today and what you have already  heard?    I wish to say that it is very important that the first  results of these talks are tangible; they are evident. They  have become evident in many parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina where  people are no longer being killed and where we had been fighting  until recently. Convoys are now passing freely there, lives are  no longer being lost in those regions. Life is returning in a  way -- a ray of life -- to Mostar, the old part of Vitez. They  are perfectly aware of this in Sarajevo. What is important is  that the results of this are being felt. That proves this is a  real change. This is not what we used to call a change on  paper. I believe we have good reason to look to the future with  optimism.    A significant change has occurred in the balance of forces  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. I do not believe we should take advantage  of that to prolong the war, but I think that this increased  strength should be used to achieve a just peace. This is our  right, it is our right to do this, and this we shall do.    Washington was, so to speak, the center of the world today  --  not to say that it is not otherwise -- because a large number of  statesmen assembled here today to take part in this event. This  added weight to this event, which goes to show that we are not  the only ones who are directly involved, who are vitally  interested, but many other responsible people in the world are  also involved who feel that something is changing. Of course,  we should all try to contribute to this process as best we can.  We, our government, will do all we can in this respect. I  cannot help recalling that, unfortunately, people in Maglaj,  Bihac, Brcko, and in some other places have sensed relief.  Fighting is still going on there, lives are being lost, but it  seems that better days are at hand. [end recording]</p>

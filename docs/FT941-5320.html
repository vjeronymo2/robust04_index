			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: London Gilts traders are hoping that this week the market will recover some poise. Although there was precious little UK economic news last week, the market was battered by reports of increased price pressures in the US and rapid money supply growth in Germany. Hopes of an imminent UK rate cut are diminishing. Although there is no official word on the outcome of last week's monetary meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England, most analysts assume the duo decided to keep their powder dry for another month. The main focus of domestic interest this week will be tomorrow's manufacturing output and industrial production figures for January, which are expected to show an upturn after December's falls. Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, said official economic statistics have been lagging behind survey data from the likes of the Confederation of British Industry. The market is expecting month-on-month increases of 0.3 per cent to 0.4 per cent. Most analysts believe the sell-off in gilts has been overdone, particularly in the light of news on UK inflation. But if the US Federal Reserve tightens policy further, this may turn out to be another week when UK economic fundamentals take a back seat to international influences.</p>

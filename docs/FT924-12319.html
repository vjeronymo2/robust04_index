			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Hammerson There is nothing much wrong with capitalising interest or booking profits from property trading in a bull market. But, as dividend cuts from Slough Estates in August and now Hammerson illustrate, they encourage a false sense of security when times get tough. Those investors who calculated cover on the basis of stated earnings in earlier years were, frankly, deluding themselves. Trading profits are now virtually extinct, and, as Hammerson's action yesterday effectively acknowledges, the growth in future rental income (needed to offset the impact of higher financing costs as the development programme comes to an end) is highly uncertain. That said, Hammerson deserves credit for following up last year's big New York write-downs with a realistic approach to the dividend. There are also signs of efforts to change the portfolio mix. On the face of it, the shares look cheap at a 60 per cent discount to prospective net assets. Perhaps old valuation techniques, though, are as dangerous as some traditional accounting principles.</p>

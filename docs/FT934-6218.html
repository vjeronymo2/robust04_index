			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / South Korea to permit 20,000 foreign workers South Korea bowed to cries for help from struggling small manufacturers and announced yesterday it would admit 20,000 foreign workers to fill unskilled low-paid jobs that locals shun, Reuter reports from Seoul. A Justice Ministry official said the workers would be permitted to stay for periods of up to two years. The ministry also announced it would extend the limited amnesty for illegal guest workers for another six months. Some 15,000 of the estimated 60,000 illegal foreign workers in South Korea registered for the six-month amnesty in June. They were originally required to leave the country by December 15.</p>

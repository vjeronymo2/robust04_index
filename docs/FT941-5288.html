			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Poland and Hungary step up pressure Hungary and Poland yesterday stepped up pressure to be made members of the European Union and to force the EU to open its doors to eastern Europe by the end of the decade. Hungary said it would submit a formal application to join the Union next month, with the goal of starting accession talks in 1997. Poland raised the possibility of immediate 'partial membership' of the EU, through full participation in the EU's foreign and security activities, as well as justice and home affairs. The diplomatic moves followed inaugural 'association councils' between foreign ministers of the 12 and their Polish and Hungarian counterparts. These councils are the new vehicles for co-operation between the EU and the six 'associate' EU member states: Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Foreign ministers also agreed to an Anglo-Italian plan for formal co-operation at international conferences and 'joint foreign policy actions' with the associate EU members. But more work is needed on justice and immigration. The Anglo-Italian initiative is part of a broader reassessment of EU policy toward central and eastern Europe which began at last June's European summit in Copenhagen. At that time, EU leaders agreed to the principle, but not the timing, of EU membership for the six ex-communist countries. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Polish foreign minister, pressed his EU counterparts yesterday to consider 'partial membership'. This would involve a delay in Poland taking on full economic commitments while allowing immediate participation in other areas.</p>

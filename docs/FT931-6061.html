			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Pensions at risk MANY PRIVATE sector employers have long regarded the company pension fund as a profit centre. Now, it seems, the government has cottoned on to the game: it has a beady eye on the pension funds of the remaining nationalised industries, which are worth a great deal more than the industries themselves. The Department of Transport's proposals for dealing with British Rail's pension funds after privatisation look a better deal for the public finances than for the pensioners; and trustees of other public sector pension schemes, including those of British Coal, are increasingly worried that present and future pensioners could be deprived of significant rights and benefits. In most of the bigger privatisations accomplished to date, existing employees have had the option of remaining in a fund where pension benefits, including inflation-proofing, and improved benefits in the event of future surpluses, were no less favourable than the arrangements before privatisation. This will be true of existing employees of British Rail. But for most of British Rail's 200,000 or so current and deferred pensioners it is another matter. Either they can put their pensions nest egg into a closed fund, where they take on the risk of a reduction of benefits if investment performance is poor. Or they accept a government offer to buy out their funds in exchange for the equivalent of an investment in index-linked gilts. At first sight, the second option - which, bizarrely, entails the pension fund being nationalised while the rail industry is privatised - appears attractive, since it guarantees continuing inflation-proofing for pensions. Yet, historically, index-linked gilts have tended to underperform equities, which form the bedrock of a normal pension fund portfolio. Moreover, the railmen have, under their present scheme, enjoyed a share of pension fund surpluses. Unlike private sector schemes, where the employer pays the balance of the cost of meeting pension liabilities after a fixed contribution from the employees, many nationalised industry funds operate on shared costs. Employer and employee have contributed in a fixed ratio, and the surplus has been shared, with employees enjoying contribution holidays as well as the employer, and the less well-off pensioners receiving uplifts in benefits. As for the first option, the prospect of benefit improvements would be poor, because trustees would have to adopt a cautious investment policy in a closed fund with no new income coming in - not an enticing swap for people who have hitherto enjoyed both security and improved benefits. The government's proposals may not be the most ruthless example of pension fund stripping. But benefits are being diluted. This will do nothing to enhance confidence in a pensions system that has suffered gravely from the activities of the late Robert Maxwell. The government should think again and offer BR pensioners a deal that is genuinely no less favourable than the status quo.</p>

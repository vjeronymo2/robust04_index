Nigeria's military  leader, General Sani Abacha told a French delegation that his  country had always maintained a police post in the disputed area  and conducted population census there. An official statement  after a closed-door meeting in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, quoted  Abacha as saying his government's concern is the security of  Nigerians who form 96 percent of the residents of the area.    The four-man French Government delegation was led by Bruno  Delaye, special adviser to President Francois Mitterrand. The  team met with Cameroonian President Paul Biya in Yaounde Monday.    France has also sent 30 paratroopers to Cameroon under a  defence pact following reported clashes between Nigerian and  Cameroonian troops on 18 and 19 February. Abacha said that the  presence of Nigerian soldiers in the area was to forestall  communal clashes between Nigeria's communities in the  south-eastern states of Akwa Ibom and Cross River. He said  Nigeria has no territorial ambitions.    He restated that the dispute could be resolved amicably  without external assistance. "The two peoples are brothers from  time immemorial and were only separated by colonial boundaries a  few years ago," the statement quoted Abacha as saying.    Abacha said a machinery had been put in place to implement a  suggestion by the French delegation that Nigeria and Cameroon  should discuss the problem during a scheduled meeting between  their two leaders. The statement quoted Delaye as telling  Abacha that French paratroopers were in Cameroon only to honour  the defence pact between the two countries.    He said that France wanted the two neighbours, both of whom  have cordial relations with France, to resolve their differences  amicably. Speaking to State House correspondents after a  closed- door meeting, the French envoy said "we are here to help  and not to create problems."    Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Baba Gana Kingibe, told  reporters there was determination and commitment on both sides  towards resolving the issue through dialogue. "We are looking  forward to the proposed summit of the two heads of states. The  sooner it takes place the sooner we find our way forward towards  finding a solution", he said. He said the presence of French  delegation here in Abuja is in no way an indication of their  involvement in our on-going negotiation with Cameroon.    Kingibe warned on Monday that French military intervention  could escalate the conflict.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Six O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Violeta Chamorro and Presidency Minister  Antonio Lacayo have only told U.S. Congressmen Cass Ballenger  and Robert Torricelli that more effort will be made toward  compensation payments. Chamorro and Lacayo have not said  anything new. They are still offering the same they did three  years ago. They repeated the same old argument -- that the  privatization of the Nicaraguan Communications and Postal  Services Institute will be used to back the payments. This is a  clear sign that the government has no intention of returning  those properties the Sandinistas divvied up.    U.S. Congressmen Robert Torricelli and Cass Ballenger are  leaving today. Torricelli, Ballenger, and Nicaraguan Blanca  Perez Macias -- formerly Bianca Jagger -- came last week to  discuss several topics with the government, including the issue  of confiscated properties and the need to return them to their  true owners. They discussed political topics and U.S.  investment in Nicaragua with military leaders, Cardinal Obando y  Bravo, the private sector, and others. Although the congressmen  were rather brief at the end, they clearly conveyed to the  government that aid to Nicaragua might be stopped if properties  are not returned to those Lacayo called the Nicaraguan caitudos  [pejorative term for some Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S.  citizens]. The caitudos are claiming their properties as U.S.  citizens.    [Begin recording] [(Roberto Basalli), president of the  association of U.S. owners of confiscated properties] We know  that from now until the end of July, it is impossible to  entirely resolve the property issue, which is highly  complicated. Our goal is that if the Nicaraguan Government  shows enough progress, then aid will be given for a year.  According to the amendment, the Secretary of State must, each  year, confirm any progress made in countries where properties  have been seized from U.S. citizens.    Consequently, if Nicaragua shows enough progress, it must  receive aid for a year so that it has the opportunity to  continue and finish resolving the problem. We are very aware  that the problem cannot be resolved in 90 days.    [Unidentified Reporter] The first 30 days have already gone  by [words indistinct]. Do not you think they might have used  some sort of strategy to avoid resolving this problem?    [Basalli] We do not know precisely what the Nicaraguan  Government is doing or plans to do. Thus far, there have been  no results. However, we must give the Nicaraguan Government the  benefit of the doubt because they might be preparing to make a  move regarding this issue.

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (15): Battle of converging industries - US cable companies have bold plans US cable television companies, which have enjoyed spectacular growth over the past 20 years, now plan to compete for telecommunications business with telephone companies, as the characteristics of the two industries converge. To take one example: in the city of Rochester, in upstate New York. Time Warner, the local cable television company, intends to offer a telephone service as early as next year in competition with Rochester Tel, the existing telephone monopoly, which is voluntarily opening up its market. Technological breakthroughs mean that customers will soon be provided with interactive multimedia communications services, delivered down the wires which each company runs into US offices and homes. The cable companies, therefore, want to expand their current range of broadcast offerings to include interactive services - such as home shopping  -and telecommunications services, which may include forms of wireless communications as well as wired ones. For their part, the telephone companies want to invade the cable companies' entertainment territory. Late last year this convergence of interests led to several merger proposals  -with a lot of ballyhoo - between cable and telephone companies. Notable among these was a scheme to enable Bell Atlantic, the regional telephone company, to take over Tele-Communications, the leading cable company, in a deal that could have been worth up to Dollars 22bn. However, the Bell Atlantic deal fell apart. So did a less ambitious alliance between Southwestern Bell and Cox Enterprises. The companies concerned laid the blame on the Federal Communications Commission, the regulatory agency, which has forced the cable industry to cut the rates it charges for basic services by 17 per cent. It is now uncertain whether the two industries will compete head-on, rather than co-operate, to provide America with new multimedia services, or whether alliances will make a comeback, albeit on a less grandiose scale. A mixture of both seems likely. In recent years, the cable companies have been nibbling away at telephone business traffic, because they own several so-called Competitive Access Providers - companies in metropolitan areas operating highly efficient fibre optic networks which cream off corporate bulk traffic. But full telecommunications competition, across a broad range of customers and services, still faces considerable regulatory and business hurdles. First, the local telephone companies have long been cosy, state-regulated monopolies: regulators allow them to make a decent return on their investments, so long as they fulfil an obligation to provide a 'universal service', enabling anyone to have a telephone at home at reasonable cost. Competition is beginning to break down this system, but there is still a long way to go. In Rochester, Time Warner's way to enter the market was smoothed by Rochester Tel itself, deciding that it was in its own best interests to create competitive local conditions. Rochester Tel recently won approval to split itself into two: a closely regulated transmission business and a less regulated service operation. It agreed to interconnect its own system's customers and those of Time Warner, and to stabilise its prices for seven years. Other local telephone companies are hardly rushing to copy Rochester, although Ameritech, the large Chicago-based company, has offered to open up its market (provided it is allowed to enter the long-distance market from which it is currently barred). But much of the pressure for change is likely to come from the cable industry. For example, in Montgomery County, Maryland, which encompasses a large suburban swathe of Washington DC, the local cable company is seeking regulatory approval to start offering a telephone service in competition with Bell Atlantic, the local telephone company. There is an additional twist here: the Montgomery cable company is itself owned by a large 'Baby Bell' local telephone company, Southwestern Bell. It would be the first time a Baby Bell local telephone company had competed with *something in here (HP) * one of its siblings. Regulatory restraints apart, many cable companies face capital constraints in building the modern, sophisticated systems required to operate a fully interactive entertainment and telecommunications network. The industry is up in arms over the 17 per cent rate rollback demanded by the FCC, which is estimated to have cut some Dollars 3bn from the sector's Dollars 20bn revenues. At the same time, the much larger regional telephone companies are in the throes of huge capital investment programmes to advance the information highway. Bell Atlantic recently said it would spend Dollars 11bn on network improvements in the next five years. Mr Reed Hundt, the new chairman of the FCC, denies that the price cuts will delay building the information super-highway. He says the agency will closely monitor the effects of cuts on the sector and make adjustments, if necessary. The industry also complains that the FCC has taken away its incentive to add new channels to its systems - although a large number of television production companies have planned new networks focused on subjects as varied as golf, antiques and health. In order to encourage new services, the FCC says cable operators can take a 7.5 per cent profit when they add a basic cable channel to their system, in addition to recouping their costs. But the cable companies, which use to have more scope to raise consumers' bills when adding channels, say the FCC has offered too little to make additions financially worthwhile. As a result, they are now more interested in unregulated services, such as pay-for-view films, home shopping, or 'a la carte' channels, which the viewer selects and pays for in addition to the basic cable service. But despite the current gloom in the cable industry - which contrasts sharply with the euphoria at the time of last autumn's Bell Atlantic deal - the sector seems certain to play an important role in the multimedia revolution by virtue of its programming skills and technological base. The local telephone companies may be less ardent suitors, but it is possible that cable companies will link up with large long-distance operators - AT&amp;T, MCI Communications and Sprint - which are all keen to expand their tentacles into the local arena. They would be formidable rivals to the regional phone companies.</p>

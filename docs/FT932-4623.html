			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE derivatives sector opened quietly but came to life at mid-morning, driving the underlying equity market ahead for a brief period. Overall, however, traders commented that business was thin and that investors remained unconvinced of the outlook for domestic interest rates and for share prices. Attention was switching towards the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which will take over this month from the June contract as the market's chief driving force. At one stage the June contract, now at an effective nil premium against fair value, was strong against the cash market, but trade was two-way and there was not enough volume to enable the best levels to hold. At the close the June contract was on offer at 2,850, but it began to drift off later as Wall Street made a slow start and trading volume in London died away. Business in traded options was reduced to 26,069 lots from Friday's 28,691, with the FT-SE 100 option decreasing its contribution from 8,796 contracts to 6,319. Among the individual stock options, British Gas stood out with 3,955 contracts transacted, with Marks and Spencer on 3,650 close behind. British Steel was also in demand, recording 2,300 contracts, although this reflected no significant interest in the underlying stock.</p>

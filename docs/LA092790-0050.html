			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN ARRESTED AFTER PRE-DAWN RAMPAGE ON AVENUE IN VISTA  </P> <P> A 29-year-old man is in custody after going on an early-morning rampage Tuesday  in downtown Vista, smashing windows in 13 businesses and destroying a computer  in one of them.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department investigators don't know why the man, armed with a pipe,  broke the windows in businesses located in an eight-block area of South Santa  Fe Avenue, said Detective Don Phelps from the Sheriff's station in Vista.  </P> <P> Although still undergoing treatment at San Diego General Hospital for numerous  cuts to his arms, Joseph Scata of Vista, has been booked at the County Jail in  connection with a variety of felony and misdemeanor charges.  </P> <P> About 5 a.m. Tuesday morning, Sheriff's Deputy W. Anderson got a radio call  about a man vandalizing businesses near the 500 block of Santa Fe Avenue,  Phelps said.  </P> <P> When Anderson arrived, he saw a man carrying a pipe.  </P> <P> The man allegedly started to rush the deputy but at the last minute turned and  ran away, Phelps said. The deputy chased the man for a few blocks before  catching him.  </P> <P> During his rampage, the man apparently sustained severe cuts to his arms and  was bleeding heavily.  </P> <P> "The guy had lots of blood on him from when he was breaking all those windows,"  Phelps said. "(The deputy) was having a hard time keeping a grip on him."  </P> <P> A couple of other deputies eventually responded to the scene and they were able  to handcuff the man.  </P> <P> He was booked on assault with a deadly weapon on an officer, second-degree  burglary, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony vandalism and 12 counts of  misdemeanor vandalism, a jail spokeswoman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> A Sept. 27 arraignment has been scheduled for Scata, who is being held on  $17,040 bail.  </P> <P> Phelps didn't know if anything had been stolen from the businesses that were  vandalized, but he said Scata is facing a burglary charge because he allegedly  entered one of the business and caused thousands of dollars in damage to  computer equipment.  </P> <P> All six front windows at J. B. Maintenance were shattered along with a computer  monitor and keyboard that were ruined, said Heidi Mueller, a clerk at the  company in the 100 block of Santa Fe.  </P> <P> The monitor of another computer was dented but not broken.  </P> <P> It will cost more than $6,000 to replace the windows and computer, said the  company's owner Ali Soltan.  </P> <P> Vista Superior Court records show that Scata was sentenced to four years'  probation in 1983 after pleading guilty to possession of cocaine and marijuana,  a court clerk said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The Rash Act by War Maniacs"] </F>   [Text] War preparations are being accelerated in a  full-fledged manner in South Korea these days. They are making  such rows as checking shelters everywhere and checking water  pumping facilities. At the same time, they are conducting  shelter-taking and fire-extinguishing exercises one after  another.    Amid these rows, the puppets held the so-called 15th civil  defense consultative meeting on 13 June. Repeating the  stereotyped allegation of the North's so-called nuclear issue,  they issued an instruction that the civil defense organization  should be rechecked to prepare for an emergency, that the  maintenance of the underground shelters, water-supply  facilities, warning facilities, and emergency equipment should  be completed by the end of this month. They also stated that  they would expand the emergency summons exercise in order to  ascertain the manpower to be mobilized in case of emergency.    In the meantime, a large-scale war exercise is being  conducted in South Korea participated in by millions of civil  defense unit members, puppet armed forces, and U.S. imperialist  aggressor forces in South Korea. This is a phenomenon that one  can see only on the eve of a war, and shows well how desperately  the puppets are engaged in the maneuvers for a war of northward  invasion.    The puppets rave that these war maneuvers are aimed at  coping  with someone's nuclear issue, but this is nothing but a  sophistry to hide the danger of their maneuvers for a war of  northward invasion.    The North's nuclear issue is the outcome of antisocialist,  anti- DPRK maneuvers persistently pursued by the United States,  and is a fiction invented to crush [apsal] our republic.    Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists are massively assembling  the aggressor forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas  under the pretext of the North's so-called development of  nuclear weapons, raving that they have no alternative but to  fight with us and that a preemptive attack on North Korea is an  option. In so doing, the U.S. imperialists are watching  thirstily for an opportunity to provoke a war.    Moreover, the Kim Yong-sam ring, the filthy war servant for  the U.S. imperialists, not only placed the entire puppet armed  forces in an emergency alert posture in order to put them into a  war of northward invasion at any time, but is committed to a  major suppression campaign against democratic forces, thus  attempting to suppress and obliterate all the forces which stand  in the way of their implementing the war policy.    The war preparation maneuvers being waged concurrently  across  South Korea show that the puppets are accelerating at a final  stage the preparations for the provocation of the war of  northward invasion which the puppets regard as a set course of  action.    Moreover, not to be overlooked is the fact that the puppets  are intensifying the so-called checking of shelters, rechecking  of the civil defense organizations, and shelter-taking exercise  at the same time when the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] adopted an absurd resolution on the suspension of the  IAEA cooperation with our country and when the possibility of a  UN sanction is being discussed.    In view of the international alliance which the puppets have  pursued and the war preparations which they accelerated, we  cannot but conclude that they are taking advantage of the  present opportunity to light the fuse of a war of northward  invasion.    The Kim Yong-sam ring is comprised of extremely vicious war  fanatics who take no account of their fellow countrymen or the  well-being of the nation. They are the filthy cat's paw of a war  of the U.S. imperialists, and filthy and vicious national  traitors.    Because of reckless war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists  and the puppet clique, an urgent situation is created now on the  Korean peninsula in which a war could break out at any time, and  the people of the world are expressing great worries over it.  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's war maneuvers are the foolish  rash acts of those who lost reason and whose future is doomed.    We have already warned that there is no mercy in war. If the  Kim Yong-sam ring undertakes the road of adventure by  downgrading us, it will be their own destruction. The puppets  should squarely see that all they gain from the war maneuvers is  nothing but their own ruin, and they should act with discretion.</p>

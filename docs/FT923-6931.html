			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Riot police called in to quell jail violence RIOT police were yesterday called into prisons across France to quell outbreaks of violence by inmates on the third day of industrial action by French prison officers. Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice minister, will this morning resume talks with the officers' unions after they failed yesterday afternoon. The prison officers, protesting against the murder last weekend of one of their colleagues by an inmate at Rouen jail, are demanding higher staffing and better protection. Over 100 of France's 150 prisons have been affected by the dispute which started on Tuesday with strikes and go-slows by prison officers. Conditions in the jails have fast deteriorated as inmates have protested against the loss of exercise periods, recreational activities and visits. Prisoners at Baumettes jail near Marseilles set fire to tyres and blockaded corridors until riot police arrived to restore order. Riot squads stopped an outbreak of violence at Mulhouse jail after a prisoner died in a fall from the roof during a protest. Similar scuffles occurred at Toulouse, where prisoners rampaged round the jail in protest at being deprived of lunch, and at Ploemeur in Morbihan. Prison authorities at Nanterre and Bois-d'Arcy drafted in riot police to stop the daily routine being disrupted by the strike. The French government, which had hoped to paint a picture of political stability in the run-up to September's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, is anxious to end the prison officers' strike as quickly as possible to prevent a repetition of last month's embarrassing lorry drivers' dispute.</p>

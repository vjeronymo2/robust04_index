			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Managers lack finance skills, says survey MIDDLE AND senior managers in big UK companies have only a minimal understanding of corporate finance and more than half admit they are not happy with their own level of financial proficiency. A survey by KPMG Management Consulting among 120 managers, drawn from some of the country's largest businesses, highlights widespread lack of knowledge over fundamental aspects of financial management. Mr Edward Cook, a KPMG Management Consulting partner, said: 'In recessionary times the general lack of understanding about financial matters is extremely worrying.' Respondents did not include managers with formal training in accountancy, economics or finance. Asked why profitable companies ceased to trade, 43 per cent of the managers cited lack of cash, 28 per cent insufficient investment, 11 per cent loss of key managers and 9 per cent poor or bad management. Among the findings: Cashflow: Only 42 per cent of managers considered cashflow could be a problem if a company achieved a sales growth of 50 per cent in one year. Thirty-four per cent cited cashflow problems specifically while another 8 per cent mentioned overtrading. The survey's authors noted that the dangers of coming out of a recession and achieving volume growth did not seem to be recognised. Nearly one in five managers said they could foresee no difficulties. Profit and Loss: Managers did not appear to understand the basic purpose of a profit and loss account. One in three managers, and 42 per cent of senior managers, believed that a profit and loss account showed an organisation's true worth at a point in time. Working Capital: Although the management of working capital is a vital part of financial control, a high percentage of managers did not understand what comprised working capital. Almost half (48 per cent) thought reserves formed part of working capital, 38 per cent identified sales and 27 per cent cited overheads. Only 38 per cent correctly identified just cash, stock and debtors. KPMG Management Consulting, 8 Salisbury Square, London EC4.</p>

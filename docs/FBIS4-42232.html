			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["-ann"-attributed report: "Jochimsen Worried About </F> Financial Policy"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 26 May -- The fact that the German  national economy is overstrained by the state has not changed,  so that the improvement of the economic development does not  permit any secure prospects of growth, either. Rather, the high  deficits in financial policy and the enormous state expenditures  and tax quotas are putting a lasting strain on recovery. The  bank loans to the public budgets are still expanding more  quickly than those to domestic companies and private persons;  this also inflates the money supply. The unbalanced situation  of financial policy overstrains monetary policy. "I, too, am  very worried that this might lead to potential inflation." This  was said by Professor Dr. Reimut Jochimsen, president of the  North Rhine-Westphalia Land Central Bank, in discussions with  journalists.    At the same time, Jochimsen expressed the hope that the  difference between interest rates for short-term and long-term  loans achieved meanwhile will stimulate the formation of  monetary capital and will thus dampen the growth of the money  supply. The opportunity for the discussion was provided by the  results of the latest Land Central Bank study on the situation  of in the land's most important industrial branches, which were  presented and commented by Jochimsen. The poll shows that the  economic situation in North Rhine-Westphalian industry is  improving thanks to strong increases in foreign orders and  stabilized domestic business, which has recently improved  tremendously.  <H5>  Only 3 Percent Remain Pessimists </H5>   Compared with the reference period in 1993, at the lowest  point of the recession, the volume of orders to companies in the  processing industry has increased by 2 percent during the first  quarter of 1994; for the first time since the beginning of the  downward slide in autumn 1992, the comparison with the previous  year is positive again.    In particular, the mood has changed in the largest German  land. Only one-third of the polled companies describe the  current business situation as "bad"; in the two preceding polls  of autumn and spring 1993 this was stated by about half of the  companies. The other two-thirds assessed the situation as  "good" or "satisfactory." Four out of 10 companies expect a  further improvement in the next six months; only about 3 percent  expect a further deterioration of the situation.  <H5>  Steel Boom as in the Past? </H5>   In particular, the steel industry is experiencing a strong  upswing, it received one-fifth more orders than a year ago; here  the sudden recovery of demand in road vehicle construction is  having an effect. As Jochimsen stressed, steel production has  almost achieved the level of summer 1992, before the beginning  of the recession. Price increases are announced and already  implemented.    Following the structural changes, Jochimsen no longer rules  out that the first bottlenecks in capacity might soon be felt in  the steel industry. The plans for changes in the European steel  industry, which failed half way through, can also be interpreted  in this manner.    Since road-vehicle construction, which benefits, among other  things, from the economic recovery in Great Britain and in the  United States and from the expensive yen, a key industry of  German economy is starting to move again, the stimuli should  soon be felt also in other sectors, Jochimsen added.  Machine-building is also gradually overcoming its worst crisis  of the postwar period. The same goes for the electrical  industry. Here, however, there is still a lack of domestic  demand.  <H5>  Consumer Goods Continue in Shadows </H5>   The consumer-goods industry continues to lie in the shadows,  where, in particular, the continuing structural problems of the  textile and clothing industry have an effect, which entails  constant shifts of production to cheaper foreign locations.  After a slightly lower output last year, the construction  sector has moved onto a course of growth again in 1994, driven  by the boom in housing construction.    Because of the usual lagging behind the orders, industrial  output is gaining speed only gradually. The majority of the  polled companies does not yet see any reason to declare an end  to the current programs for cost reduction and restructuring,  even if there are signs of a change in the way of thinking and  the current forecasts for unemployment have been revised  downward. Jochimsen: "Nothing would be more problematic than if  now a more favorable economic development were misunderstood as  a structural all-clear signal."  <H5>  Alliances for Asia </H5>   A special part of the poll referred to the gradually  increasing involvement of North Rhine-Westphalian companies in  the promising markets in eastern and southeastern Asia, where  the land, together with Baden-Wuerttemberg, is trying to pave  the way, in the form of the German Industrial and Trade Center  in Singapore, which was suggested by the Association of German  Machine-Building Enterprises and is supported by Southwest Land  Bank and West Land Bank. The companies see great opportunities,  particularly in China, without overlooking the political and  economic policy difficulties; in view of the dimension of this  challenge, market plans and strategic alliances across  companies, also with foreign partners, are taken into  consideration, Jochimsen stressed. Among other things, North  Rhine-Westphalia has started a cooperation initiative with the  leading Chinese coal province of Shanxi, which is to open up  more the new fields of business for the mining subcontractors  represented there.</p>

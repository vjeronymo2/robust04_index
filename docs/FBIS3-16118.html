			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Ivan Ivanov and </F> Vladimir Mostovets]    [Text] Helsinki, 11 Mar -- Russia does not intend to adopt  sanctions of any kind against the Baltic countries, or does it  intend to keep its troops in them. Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin stated this at a short news conference on  the results of Russian-Finnish intergovernmental talks held  today.    Answering journalists' questions, he stressed that the  Russian leadership "is not considering imposing sanctions"  against Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania.    At the same time, he stated emotionally that these countries  should fulfil their obligations to observe the human rights of  all people, without exception, living on their territories. "We  will not allow Russians in the Baltic countries who were born  and who have grown up there to be treated in the future as they  are being treated now. After all, we do not set any conditions  for Estonians, Latvians, or Lithuanians living in Russia," he  stressed.    The head of the Russian Government categorically rejected  the  presence of a "territorial problem" in Russo-Finnish relations.  He stressed that Russia would like to have "transparent"  borders with Finland, and a number of intergovernmental  agreements signed today are aimed toward this. "We are not  thinking about how to redraw the borders, but about simplifying  the mechanism for trade in border areas, and about creating free  economic zones," he added.    Chernomyrdin believes that the accords reached today between  Russia and Finland lay the foundation for increasing trade and  economic cooperation. Expressing his concern at the significant  reduction in the trade balance between the two countries in the  last five years, the premier said that Russia and Finland now  have every opportunity not only to equal the balance figures of  the mid-1980s, but also to surpass them.    Answering questions from Finnish journalists, the chairman  of  the government stressed that Russia intends to pay off gradually  its existing debts to Finland, partly with arms deliveries.  Esko Aho, who also took part in the news conference, noted in  this connection that this is a "reasonable" approach. "We could  consider the possibilities of paying off some debts not only  with deliveries of Russian military equipment, but with other  goods as well."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Semih D. Idiz] </F>   [Text] Ankara -- Serious doubts are being expressed about  the true nature of the much publicized recent Azeri advances  against positions occupied by Armenian forces within Azerbaijan.  There are increasing suggestion [as published] that the latest  Azeri onslaught was ill-timed and that it may be providing the  opportunity for Armenian forces to get reinforcements from  Armenia, to regroup and to prepare for a serious  counteroffensive in the spring.    The TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] has been told that the Office  of  the Chief Staff in Ankara also has serious concerns and  reservations about the current military operations in western  and southwestern Azerbaijan.    Reports reaching Ankara from Turkish officers training the  Azeri army apparently indicated from the start that the current  onslaught ordered by President Geydar Aliyev was not just  ill-timed but also badly planned and executed.    Azerbaijan's Ambassador to Ankara Mamed Aliyev Novruz Ogly,  who was contacted on the subject by the TDN, strongly denied  these reports and said that they were simply attempts at  undermining President Aliyev in his moment of success. "Our  troops are not the attacking side. They have not embarked on a  new onslaught. They are merely trying to liberate their lands  from invading Armenians who have mercilessly pounded our towns  and cities with artillery shells," Novruz Ogly said. On the  question of timing, he added that the Armenians were threatening  their big cities which necessitated immediate operations by the  Azeri army to protect these cities. The fact that the training  of Azeri soldiers had not been fully completed before this  latest onslaught, has led to excessive casualties in return for  small gains on the battlefield, according to sources informing  the TDN. These sources also referred to "clear indications"  that the Russian military is playing a "double game" in the  Armenian-Azeri dispute by training Azeri troops on the one hand  and reinforcing Armenian troops in Azerbaijan on the other.  Sources have said that not just Turkish advisers, but President  Geydar Aliyev's own military advisor, Gen. Nureddin Sadykhov,  also exhorted the Azeri president to postpone the military  operation until better weather conditions prevailed and the  training of Azeri soldiers was completed.    Gen. Sadykhov, who is said to be in close contact with the  Turkish chief of staff's office, reportedly even threatened to  resign if his advice was not taken.    But President Aliyev's political considerations are said to  have outweighed military considerations, leading him to order  the offensive in the middle of winter.    "It is true that there have been advances by Azeri forces.  But most of these have been on open terrain and low ground with  scant resistance from the Armenians. The Armenians may have  pulled back from the low ground but they still retain all the  strategic points on the high ground in and around  Nagorno-Karabakh," one source said.    He confirmed that the town of Goradiz had been liberated  from  invading Armenians. But he said this was achieved at a cost of  2,000 casualties on the Azeri side, which was advancing on the  low ground, while the casualties among the Armenians, holding  the high ground before they retreated, were considerably less.    As for the recently, much reported "imminent liberation" of  the strategic Azeri towns of Agdere [Mardakert] and Kelbadzhar,  this source claimed that "nothing was further from the truth.    "Azeri forces have not managed to come closer than 30  kilometers of Agdere, the gateway to Kelbadzhar, and have only  entered minor villages on its extreme outskirts" he said.  Agdere is immediately east of the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh  while Kelbadzhar is to its west, near the border with Armenia.  Both towns fell to Armenian forces in their offensive against  Azerbaijan last year.    "Even if a serious advance is secured against Agdere, taking  Kelbadzhar under present climatic conditions is almost  impossible, as any military official who is familiar with the  region and its terrain would confirm," this source said.    Questioned on these claims as well, Ambassador Novruz Ogly  characterized them as "lies."    He said Azeri troops were within 300 meters of the town of  Agdere and were forcing the outskirts of Kelbadzhar.    "My concern -- and this concern is shared by Turkish  advisers  in the region -- is that the Armenians, who still retain the  high ground, are allowing the Azeris to advance in the low  ground. This way it will be easier to ensnare them in a major  counter offensive, which would be launched under better climatic  conditions" the source informing the TDN added. This source  also said there was strong evidence to suggest the Armenians  were being reinforced and were regrouping for a new offensive in  the spring, just a few weeks ahead.    He referred to 5,000 troops that had been moved in from  Armenia through the Lachin corridor to the outskirts of  Khankendi (Stepanakert), the administrative center of  Nagorno-Karabakh, the predominantly Armenian enclave in  Azerbaijan.    The Lachin corridor, which connects Nagorno-Karabakh with  Armenia, was opened by the Armenians in 1992 and has been the  main artery supplying the enclave from Armenia.    This source also said that two regiments of Russia Cossacks  from the 7th army, and two Armenian regiments had been moved in  to reinforce the Fizulinskiy region of Azerbaijan which is  adjacent to the Iranian border and which is still held by the  Armenians.    "This, among other things also indicates that the Russians  are playing a double game here, because while they are helping  the Armenians in this way, their military advisers are training  Azeri troops in the Ganja region of Azerbaijan" he added. Other  sources informing the TDN indicated that the optimal time for  the Azeri onslaught for liberating its invaded lands would have  been in March or April.    They said the military operation would have stood a better  overall chance of success then, not just due to better climatic  conditions that would have better facilitated such an onslaught,  but also because the training of the Azeri army -- still  continuing under Turkish, U.S. and British as well as Russian  advisers -- would have been closer to completion.    "It is true that the minor advances achieved by Azeri troops  has buoyed the public in Baku and led to a new sense of  confidence. But these advances are also playing into Armenian  hands because if they decided to use their important strategic  advantages and regain the low ground, given Russian support and  their better training, their apparent victory will seem twice as  important as it really is," one such source argued.</p>

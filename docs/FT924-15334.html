			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Observer: Poet's pointers As tomorrow's 100th anniversary of the death of the poet Tennyson coincides with the opening of the Conservatives' annual conference, Observer has combed the bard's works for pointers to help the Tory delegates in their debates. Only three have emerged, the balance being in favour of the Euro-sceptic persuasion - particularly this extract from an ode on the opening of parliament on February 3 1852: As long as we remain, we must speak free, Tho' all the storm of Europe on us break; No little German state are we . . . More sinister, for John Major at least, may be the couplet in the poem Hands All Round, which reads: That man's the true Conservative, Who lops the moulder'd branch away. As for the premier's supporters, all there is to encourage them is a single line from Locksley Hall: Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.</p>

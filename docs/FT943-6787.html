			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Gold underpins S Africa South African equities finished mostly firmer but off highs as profit-taking pared early gains. A stronger Wall Street and better gold price underpinned the market and brokers said they expected shares to firm again today in follow-through support from outstanding orders. The overall index added 19 to 5,916, after earlier hitting an all-time high at 5,937, industrials rose 12 to 6,662 and gold 11 to 2,295. Traders said investors shrugged off bond market nervousness and took in their stride Reserve Bank governor Mr Chris Stals' warning that monetary policy could be tightened. Anglos ended down 175 cents at R261.50 after shedding earlier gains, and De Beers dropped 25 cents to R109. Among gold shares, Vaal Reefs added R5 to R424 while Kloof shed 50 cents to R67.</p>

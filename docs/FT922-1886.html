			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Rise in lending points to upturn THE second successive monthly rise in lending by banks and building societies has provided further signals of a modest upturn. Lending by those groups to companies and individuals rose by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3bn last month, after a Pounds 5.1bn increase in April, the Bank of England said yesterday. The message about increased demand for credit was supported by the British Bankers' Association, which said that its nine member banks increased lending by an adjusted Pounds 2.2bn in May, after Pounds 2.6bn in April. Any hopes about a strong uplift were dampened by other figures for growth in the money supply, which indicated weak overall demand for goods and services. The Bank's figures for so-called M4 sterling lending to the private sector came after a net repayment of Pounds 394m in March. M4, or broad money, is private-sector holdings of notes and coins plus bank and building society deposits. The figures indicate that much of the extra lending by the association's constituent commercial banks was to financial companies, rather than manufacturers. The association said that as most of the increase in the past two months had been due to seasonal factors, it was 'difficult to point to where the demand is coming from'. Unadjusted for seasonal variations, lending to financial groups increased in May by Pounds 583m, while manufacturers repaid Pounds 200m of debt. Individuals borrowed Pounds 462m. Figures for money supply growth indicated only sluggish demand. Narrow money, or M0, which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent last month to give a 2.5 per cent increase for the year. M0 growth in the year to April was 2.3 per cent. M4 rose by 0.3 per cent last month, bringing the year-on-year growth rate to 5.2 per cent. That is the lowest year-on-year rate since the Bank started records in 1976. In April, the year-on-year rate was 5.7 per cent. Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the figures were consistent with moving slowly out of recession. 'We may be seeing a pick-up from the bottom,' he said. Over the past year, expansion in the money supply as well as in lending generally has been subdued as consumers and businesses have concentrated on paying off debts.</p>

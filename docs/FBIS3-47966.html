			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Osaka, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Sanyo Electric Co. said  Monday [17 January] it will boost production of optical pickups,  a key component for compact disc (CD) players, to meet rapidly  rising demand.    Optical pickups are used to read digital signals for optical  disks.    The Osaka-based consumer electronics company will raise  overall production in Japan and overseas for its business year  ending in November to 24.9 million pickups.    Optical pickups are in strong demand due to wider use of  minidiscs and compact disc read-only memories (CD-ROMs).    Sanyo is churning out the high value-added electronic  component in Japan, China and South Korea, with combined output  coming to 14.7 million in the year which ended last November.    Currently, the company holds a 25 percent share in the  global  market, in which Sony Corp. commands the lion's share of about  60 percent, according to industry analysts.    They say total sales are expected to gain 20 percent to 72  million pickups in the world marketplace.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Paris austerity budget on way The French government will this week unveil an austerity budget for 1995 which banks on stronger economic growth next year to prune the central government deficit and bring France closer to European criteria for monetary union. Most of the planned reduction in the budget deficit - from FFr300bn (Pounds 36bn) this year to FFr275bn next year - is due to come from the automatic increase in tax revenue that is expected from 3.1 per cent growth in the French economy next year, and from refusing to let public spending rise more than next year's expected inflation rate of 1.9 per cent. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said last night that growth next year would be supported by consumption and an increase in investment of just below 10 per cent. He said the budget predictions envisaged a reduction in the number of unemployed of about 150,000. The number of French unemployed currently stands at about 3.3m. Senior government officials expect the budget, to be unveiled on Wednesday, to win plaudits from the international markets. As one said: 'It shows that we are mastering our spending while still continuing our structural reforms to encourage employment', with the state shouldering more of the welfare taxes currently borne by companies. But another proposed 'structural' reform has stirred an outcry from the Patronat employers' federation. This would reduce the rebate that companies get from the central government on the 'professional tax' which they pay to French local authorities and which is levied on their capital assets and payrolls. The threshold at which the state would start paying its rebate would rise from the first 3.5 per cent of the tax to 4 per cent. The change would save the government, and cost the companies, FFr4bn. Mr Francois Perigot, the Patronat president, last week called the measure 'counter-productive' because it would discourage both employment and investment, thanks to the way the tax is calculated. Employers say they are dismayed to see a conservative prime minister - Mr Edouard Balladur - reverse the steady trend over the past decade, mostly by Socialist governments, to reduce the corporate tax burden. But Balladur aides counter that French companies are now sufficiently flush with cash and committed to planning for economic recovery to be now deterred from hiring or investing by the minor tax increase. French companies should recognise that their 'Balladur balance sheet' is positive, said one aide, because they gained a cash injection from faster value added tax reimbursement last year and will be relieved of FFr17bn in family allowance charges this year and next. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, yesterday claimed that the increased burden of the 'professional tax' would fall only on large businesses and would not affect companies with annual sales of less than FFr50m. The CGPME, the industry association which represents small and medium-sized businesses, said it was reassured by the minister's statement. Mr Balladur's budget may spark some dissent within his conservative majority in parliament, where some deputies would like to see cuts in income tax as well as welfare charges while others may take up business complaints. But such concerns are unlikely to drive them into the rival presidential camp of Mr Jacques Chirac, who has been urging the government to pay more heed to social concerns - a point Mr Balladur hopes to blunt in his budget by giving the biggest spending increase to the labour ministry. This year's squabbles between ministers over whose departmental budgets should bear the brunt of austerity were described by a Balladur aide as 'a harder battle' than last year, when spending for public housing and works was increased to counter recession. But ministers were said to have been unanimous on the need for overall restraint on current budget spending, out of recognition of the other two looming problems of servicing a greatly increased state debt and of plugging the social security deficit. Other measures in the budget include tax rises of 4 per cent on leaded, and 6 per cent on unleaded, petrol. The government has felt able to abandon recent practice of fiscally favouring the unleaded variety, because its increasing use is mandated by European environmental rules anyway. The government has also hit on a ruse of gaining more money from tobacco without upsetting 'the smokers' vote' next year. The tobacco companies are to said to have made a 'spontaneous' decision to raise their prices by about 7 per cent, a move that should bring an estimated FFr4bn in extra tax receipts.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bulmer to axe soft drinks side HP Bulmer, the Hereford-based cider maker, yesterday confirmed plans for further restructuring including a withdrawal from the soft drinks market in order to focus on its cider and beer activities. The move follows a strategic review of the group's production and distribution activities and is expected to lead to the loss of up to 300 jobs. Bulmer's soft drinks operations include distribution agreements for Volvic, the second largest mineral water brand after Evian, and Orangina, which is manufactured under licence. Its own soft drink brands include Kiri sparkling apple juice, which will be sold. Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said the planned reorganisation represented the final step in strategic repositioning of the group which had involved it pulling out of small, low-margin businesses. Last year the group disposed of its pectin operations and had previously withdrawn from the US apple juice market and the wine and spirits distribution business in the UK. The move will result in a Pounds 7.8m restructuring charge in the results for the year to April 30 which are due to be announced on July 13. However, the group said that the restructuring, when complete in 18 months' time, will result in annual savings of about Pounds 6.5m a year. Some of the savings are expected to be reinvested in the group's brands which include the three cider market leaders, Woodpecker, Strongbow, and Scrumpy Jack. Meanwhile, the company said yesterday that the UK cider market continued to perform well and grew by more than 8 per cent in the year to March. It added that in an increasingly competitive market the strength of its brands had substantially insulated it from the effects felt by others in the industry. As a result the board said it was confident that the results for the year to April 30 'will be in line with market expectations'. Analysts had been forecasting profits of up to Pounds 21.5m compared with Pounds 19.6m a year earlier. The shares closed up 8p at 397p.</p>

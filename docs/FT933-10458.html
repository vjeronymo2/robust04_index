			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television Gunsmoke began in the US on CBS Radio in 1952 with William Conrad (now best known as 'Cannon' the fat detective) playing Marshal Matt Dillon. When CBS decided on a TV version they asked John Wayne to play the part but, not wanting to commit himself to a weekly television series, Wayne suggested a relatively unknown young friend for the role: James Arness. The first TV episode was screened in 1955 and Arness, even taller than his mentor at 6 ft 7 ins, went on to make hundreds of episodes: there were 512 before the show ended in 1975, by which time it had inspired and outlasted dozens of other Western series. On BBC2 at 6.50 Arness stars in the episode 'Gunfighter, RIP'. Reporting from Zambia, On The Line (8.30 BBC2) considers the position of the World Cup squad in a soccer-mad nation whose national team was killed in an air crash in April. Radio 4 begins a series called Accidents Will Happen which looks at the more metaphysical aspects of seemingly haphazard events: coincidences of the sort which most people have experienced and so many feel to have been more than mere chance (8.45).</p>

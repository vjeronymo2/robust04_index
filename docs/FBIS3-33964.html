An anonymous caller for the so-called Al-Awja Palestinian  organisation told Al-Safir that his group was "opposed to the  establishment of peace with the Zionist enemy (Israel)."    "All traitors, wherever they may be, will meet the same fate  as the Jordanian diplomat," 'Umran Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah who was  shot dead by a gunman outside his Beirut home on Saturday, the  caller with a fake Palestinian accent said.    He also "threatened strikes on Norwegian interests in the  Middle East if Palestinian-Zionist meetings continue to be held  on Norwegian territory," the daily added.    For several months Norway hosted secret talks between Israel  and the Palestine Liberation Organisation which led to the  signing in Washington on September 13 of a limited autonomy  accord.    Jordan, which is also engaged in peace talks with Israel  along with the PLO, Lebanon and Syria, has blamed opponents of  the Middle East peace process for Ma'aytah's killing.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pounds 763,000 pay-off for ex TSB chief Mr Don McCrickard, the former TSB Group chief executive who resigned in August last year, received a payment of Pounds 763,432, it has been disclosed in the bank's annual report, writes John Gapper. The bank said that Mr McCrickard received the sum because he was on a three-year rolling contract which entitled him to a severance sum worth three times his final salary, plus an amount to compensate for benefits. Mr McCrickard's total emoluments in 1991 were Pounds 252,200. Mr Peter Ellwood, who succeeded him as chief executive, received Pounds 373,407 last year and was the bank's highest paid director. The bank said yesterday that its directors were now all on one-year rolling contracts.</p>

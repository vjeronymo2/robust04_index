			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Change in rulings will devalue p/e ratios IS THE p/e ratio dead? The introduction of Financial Reporting Standard 3 will make fundamental changes to the way earnings per share are calculated, and will therefore affect the p/e, often regarded as the most important investment ratio. Once items formerly treated as extraordinary, and therefore not included in eps calculations, are moved above the line, the FRS 3 eps number is likely to be more volatile than in the past. The Accounting Standards Board's main aim in producing FRS 3 was to reduce the importance of the single eps number - which has become less meaningful as companies have found ways to fudge the figure. Under FRS 3 investors will be given, and indeed forced to look at, more information on which to base their valuations of companies. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, says that, 'in a way it should be easier for analysts because they will be given all the numbers to work with.' He points out that US companies and analysts have worked with a similar accounting system to FRS 3 for years. While 53 per cent of UK companies are likely to have an extraordinary item in any one year, only 5 per cent of US companies do. Analysts are fairly sanguine about the changes, although they admit that there will be discontinuity and confusion to start with. Many claim that they were already adjusting published eps numbers for items which they regarded as not part of the continuing business. Further they stress that the p/e is only one measure of a company, and most analysts also look at yield, cash flow, asset value, balance sheet strength and make more subjective judgments such as on the quality of management. The Institute of Investment Management and Research, the investment analysts' industry body, is working on a report expected to produce a recommended method of producing a 'normalised' eps figure showing what a company has earned from its continuing operations. Analysts could use this as a base for making earnings forecasts. This method could become an industry standard, and companies might even come to produce an IIMR eps figure. Meanwhile, many stockbroking firms are working on their own versions of normalised or ongoing eps figures. Mr David Gray, of brokers James Capel, agrees that the p/e has in the past been emphasised because it provides a simple message to put across to investors. He, like others, does not expect a move to a ratio based on cash flow, but says people will be pushed to use a wider range of yardsticks. At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Mr Richard Hannah agrees that the arrival of FRS 3 will 'force analysis beyond the eps level'. However, he is concerned that analysts may latch on to an 'ongoing' p/e. That is likely to be a flattering number if losses from discontinued activities, for example, are excluded. And it is often a reflection on a company's management if a subsidiary has to be closed, and relevant to its dividend paying ability if a loss on an investment has been sustained. If not dead, the p/e will at least be devalued with FRS 3, but that may not be a bad thing.</p>

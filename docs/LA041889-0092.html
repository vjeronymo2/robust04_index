			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Calling it "the season without reason" and "the dreariest program development  yet," FCB/Telcom released its annual outlook Monday on what the TV networks  will be serving up come fall. The consensus: "This year's class of network  programmers simply recycled the output of their predecessors . . . and came up  with essentially the same mind-numbing sitcom premises with different titles  and players. And the drama development is basically forgettable, except that  several series conjured up vivid images of past failures. Are we exaggerating?  Fervently we do wish we were," the report said. While there were "a few  individual pieces of work that one could feel warm about," the impression is  that "all of the broadcast networks are in various degrees of trouble because  of too little emphasis on the product side by management." Some comments: ABC's  development crop is "pure vanilla"; CBS' "long on 'rah-rah' and short on  substance"; NBC has "some weaknesses that will have to be shored up," and Fox  has a " 'guts ball' approach to networking." In all, 135 programs are covered  in the report. FCB/Telcom is the TV programming division of Foote, Cone &amp;  Belding advertising agency.  </P></p>

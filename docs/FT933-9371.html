			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / The struggle of the dispossessed: Michael Skapinker examines a Polish woman's fight to win back property confiscated by the Nazis In her central Paris apartment, Mrs Ewa Szpicberg sits composing letters to finance ministers, company chairmen and bankers, demanding support in her battle against the occupiers of her land in the Polish port of Gdansk. Her principal targets are Saur, the French water company, and Orbis, the Polish state tourist organisation, which, she alleges, operate on land confiscated from her family by the Nazis in 1939. There are, in her eyes, other villains too. Chief among them is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is considering funding further Saur projects. in Gdansk. For Mrs Szpicberg, a 70-year-old Jewish grandmother, the emotionally charged letters in English, French and Polish are an attempt to gain one small victory on behalf of her younger brother, Marek, and other family members who died in the Holocaust. To the recipients of her letters, her struggle highlights the hazards of doing business in eastern Europe. Property owners and their heirs, dispossessed by the Nazi or communist authorities, can emerge to upset the most carefully considered investment plans. Mrs Szpicberg's campaign began in January last year when she saw a small item in a US news magazine quoting a Polish official who said the country would return property confiscated from Jews during the second world war. She asked Mr Jerzy Lipski, a Gdansk lawyer, to investigate what had happened to two properties that her father, a Warsaw timber merchant, had purchased in 1922. Mrs Szpicberg and her brother inherited the Gdansk properties when her father died nine years after he acquired them. As the site of two apartment blocks, the properties provided the family with a rental income until the war. With the Nazi occupation of Poland, the Szpicbergs were split up. Mrs Szpicberg and her mother evaded capture by posing as non-Jews in different parts of Poland. Marek died in the Warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943. After the war, Mrs Szpicberg made her way to Paris, where she was reunited with her mother. Mrs Szpicberg has never returned to Poland. It did not occur to her to reclaim the land until she saw the US magazine article. Mr Lipski reported that the apartment blocks were gone. The properties had been nationalised after the war. The first property, a 136 sq m site, was now covered by part of the high-rise Hevelius hotel, operated by Orbis, which had acquired a lease on the site in perpetuity from the Gdansk provincial government. The second property, covering 333 sq m, was now owned by the city of Gdansk and formed part of the local waterworks. It was the discovery that the city of Gdansk was busily attracting foreign finance to upgrade its water system that set Mrs Szpicberg off on her letter-writing campaign. Why should foreign companies profit from land confiscated by the Nazis, she asked. And shouldn't guests at the Hevelius be aware of the history of some of the land under the hotel? At the beginning of last year, Gdansk transferred the management of its drinking water and purification system to a company controlled by Saur, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bouygues, the French construction and engineering giant. Saur was granted a 51 per cent stake in a company called Saur Neptun Gdansk, which had the right to operate the water system for 30 years. The remaining stake was held by the city of Gdansk. Mrs Szpicberg accepts that it would be impractical for the water company to return her land. Her aim is to receive compensation. She wrote to the city authorities, telling them that part of the joint venture's facilities were on her land. The city brushed aside her request for compensation. Ms Maria Malkowska, a member of the Gdansk city governing board, says there is no prospect of the municipality meeting Mrs Szpicberg's demands. She says: 'We are simply not considering such claims.' Mrs Szpicberg wrote twice to Bouygues. Last November she received a reply from Mr Bernard Devalan, Saur's director general, saying she should go back to Gdansk municipality, the only authority competent to deal with her claim. Mr Jacques Sennepin, Saur's deputy managing director and the head of the company's foreign operations, says: 'It's an awful case. Unfortunately, there are many cases like this. But we have no power to do anything.' Last December, Mrs Szpicberg read in Les Echos, the French newspaper, that the EBRD and a group of Scandinavian companies and government organisations were planning to help finance the upgrading of Saur Neptun's water purification system. Over the next seven months she wrote six increasingly fraught letters to Mr Jacques Attali, then the bank's president, asking how the EBRD could fund a company in possession of land confiscated by the Nazis. She asked him to withhold bank money until Saur Neptun had settled with her. Mr Attali replied twice. His tone was sympathetic but his message was clear: the bank could do nothing. He wrote: 'I understand the sentiments which drive you . . . I would particularly like to avoid answering so personal letter as yours with the coldness of a bureaucratic response. 'However, the financial participation of the bank in the reconstruction of the water purification system of Gdansk does not permit it to intervene on your behalf with the municipality, the only body competent to settle your dispute.' The EBRD says that the replies to Mrs Szpicberg from Mr Attali, who resigned earlier last month after criticism of lavish spending at the bank, remain its policy. Mr Josue Tanaka, deputy director of the bank's infrastructure department, says he does not think the project, an Ecu68m investment in waste-water collection and treatment, was on Mrs Szpicberg's land. He says the bank's legal advisers said it could take no action on Mrs Szpicberg's behalf. This is because its funds would go to a company set up to finance the project rather than to the operating company. Mr Tanaka expects the bank to finance 20 per cent of the cost of the project. Other investors are expected to be Saur, the Gdansk local authorities and a group of Scandinavian investors headed by the Kruger Group, the Danish environmental protection and energy company. Kruger wrote to Mrs Szpicberg last April saying it could not help her, as the company's involvement in the project would not give it any control over her property. The other Scandinavian investors are expected to be the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation, which is funded by the governments of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland, and two Danish government bodies. The three organisations say they cannot comment on Mrs Szpicberg's case. Mrs Szpicberg wrote five times to Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister and former chairman of the EBRD board of governors. Yesterday she received a reply from Mr Waigel, saying that while he regretted what had happened to her family under the Nazis, he was no longer chairman of the EBRD governors and was unable to help her. Mrs Szpicberg dismisses the argument of the EBRD and its fellow-investors. She argues that, as the bank's founding agreement commits it to respect human rights, it should not provide funds to a company in possession of land acquired as a result of earlier human rights violations. She has made some progress with Orbis. Earlier this year she wrote to Mr Paul Dubrule, chairman of Accor, the French hotel group, asking for his help. Accor has no connection with the Hevelius. Orbis, however, runs six hotels in Poland under franchise from Accor. Accor also runs a small tourist company in Paris jointly with Orbis. Mr Dubrule instructed some of his senior executives to see what they could do. Last April, Mr Michael Flaxman, the regional director responsible for Poland, wrote to Orbis saying Accor hoped a solution could be found. On May 4, Mr Lipski was told by Orbis that the organisation hoped to present proposals for a settlement in two weeks. Orbis has still not presented its proposals. Ms Maria Warchol, Orbis's legal counsel in Gdansk, says the organisation 'is conducting an investigation which would clarify the exact legal position as to the status of the land'. Ms Katarzyna Gontarczyk, the organisation's spokeswoman in Warsaw, confirms that Orbis hopes shortly to reach a solution acceptable to both sides.</p>

"Yes," Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri said, "1,000  soldiers will go to Calabria and 500 will be deployed in Naples.  We made this decision at a meeting of the national committee  for public order. I also raised the issue of guarding the  polling stations, a task that has been entrusted to the Army.  Italy and Greece are the only two countries in Europe that use  the military to guard polling stations."    [Nese] Do you mean that on 27 March there will be police and  Carabinieri guarding the polling stations rather than soldiers?    [Fabbri] Maybe we will not have time to change anything  before the 27 March elections. Starting with June's European  elections, however, the soldiers should have been replaced.  Guarding the polling stations requires a good 28,000 soldiers.  When you consider that we sent some divisions to Somalia,  others to Sicily, and now more to Calabria and Naples, it is  becoming difficult to maintain our commitment for the elections.    [Nese] You say that 1,000 men will be sent to Calabria.    [Fabbri] Yes, they are light infantrymen from the Garibaldi  Brigade who had been scheduled to go to Somalia. They will be  involved in guarding high-risk targets. In this way, police and  Carabinieri will be freer to concentrate on truly investigative  tasks. We have called it Operation Riace, and it will have the  same features as the Sicilian Vespers operation that produced  very encouraging results. At the meeting, Police Chief Parisi  said that, thanks to the presence of the soldiers, Sicily has  recorded a 35 percent drop in the number of homicides. That is  not all. The forces of order have been able to channel their  energy into the fight against major crime, with excellent  results. Therefore it was decided that 5,200 soldiers will  remain in Sicily.    [Nese] The deployment of the military was controversial.  Some people have said that our towns are not Mogadishu.    [Fabbri] These objections were above all raised with respect  to Rome. I, however, was against putting soldiers onto the  streets of Rome. As a matter of fact, we have abandoned that  plan -- the mayors, judges, and the cardinals asked me to. The  soldiers will be used to man the garrisons of the government  buildings and important headquarters. In Calabria, spring and  summer military camps will be set up. Moreover, starting next  spring, the 360-strong mounted Carabinieri regiment will go on  exercises in Aspromonte, and another 600 Carabinieri cadets will  arrive there next autumn.    [Nese] Soldiers will be arriving in Naples, too.    [Fabbri] Mayor Bassolino requested it for the garrison of  the  new court and a few unauthorized buildings currently patrolled  by the municipal police. Finally, we will keep 300 troops on  the frontier with the former Yugoslavia.</p>

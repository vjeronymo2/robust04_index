			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The basis for this requirement is the concern that AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw could put it in the position of being the only interexchange carrier with the ability to offer prospective customers of wireless interexchange service the option of receiving a single bill for both cellular and interexchange services. Given AT&amp;T's already dominant position in this segment of the interexchange market, this added advantage could be sufficient to further increase AT&amp;T's ability to increase prices or exclude interexchange competitors by virtue of its control of a cellular duopolist. The language used in Section IV.D.1 was adopted in preference to a simple nondiscrimination requirement out of a concern that, given its position as a possibly major provider of billing services to McCaw, arrangements that could be workable for AT&amp;T could be totally uneconomic for other interexchange carriers. Thus, it might not be practical for smaller interexchange carriers to perform all of the rating and processing of local cellular calls if they only provide interexchange service to a relatively small number of McCaw customers. The chosen language was intended to assure that sufficiently refined billing information was provided to such interexchange carriers that they could readily incorporate it with their interexchange bills with a minimum of additional processing and programming required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV.F. permits AT&amp;T to act as McCaw's agent in marketing local cellular services and in jointly marketing local cellular, interexchange and other services on specified conditions. These conditions, which basically track those the United States has recommended for the Bell Companies if they should be permitted to provide wireless interexchange service, are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> first, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  if AT&amp;T engages in marketing local cellular service for McCaw, it must advise actual or prospective subscribers of their right to resubscribe to the interexchange carrier of their choice;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> second, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  AT&amp;T must state the price, terms and rate plans for local cellular and interexchange service separately, meaning that it cannot sell bundled offerings of local cellular and interexchange service; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> third, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  AT&amp;T is enjoined from selling interexchange service at a price, term or discount that depends on whether the customer obtains local cellular service from McCaw, and McCaw and McCaw Cellular Systems are enjoined from selling local cellular service at a price, term or discount that depends on whether the customer obtains interexchange service from AT&amp;T. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, AT&amp;T may, without separately stating the charges for interexchange service and terminating local cellular service, offer a ``calling party pays'' service for calls made to a cellular telephone. Ordinarily, the cellular subscriber receiving the calls pays for the cellular airtime. Section IV.E.2 would permit AT&amp;T to charge a single price for the interexchange portion of such a call and the terminating airtime (paid by the caller, not the called party), under the following conditions:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  AT&amp;T must obtain the underlying local cellular service used to terminate the call at a generally available rate which, to prevent against artificially high transfer prices,is no higher than the rate offered to resellers of local cellular service; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> second, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  this rate must be disclosed to other interexchange carriers and be described in the Equal Access plan to be filed for approval by the United States. These conditions will allow a potentially useful new service to be provided while assuring that AT&amp;T's competitors will have a fair opportunity to compete with AT&amp;T in providing this service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV.G provides that if the United States certifies, upon a showing by AT&amp;T, that there is insufficient demand by interexchange carriers for access to McCaw Cellular systems within any Local Cellular Service Area, McCaw Cellular Systems may provide new services in which access is provided to interexchange carriers at centralized points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV.H permits McCaw to hand off cellular digital packet data transmissions (as specified in Section II.F) to interexchange carriers at centralized points. The United States understands that the transport cost for packetized data, especially that using the Internet Protocol, is small in comparison to other elements of the service, and, thus, this service could be economically justified more easily (in more locations) if providers did not need to implement switching or routing points in each local Cellular Service Area. In addition, since transport across the Internet does not involve distance-sensitive charges, it will not make any difference to users where their messages are transfered onto the Internet. Finally, the Internet protocol does not have any position for indicating a customer's choice of access provider and thus it would make use of the CDPD service less convenient and probably more expensive for such users if they were required to include addressing for separate access providers in addition to the customary Internet address normally employed by such users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cellular systems in which McCaw has voting interest of fifty percent or less and does not have the right, power or ability to control are defined in Section II.U as ``McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems.'' These systems are not subject to most of the equal access requirements of Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment, but are subject to the non-bundling requirements of Section IV.F. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Section IV.E provides that if AT&amp;T or McCaw obtains control of a cellular system after entry of the proposed Final Judgment, it will be converted to equal access within one year (or within 21 months after the commencement of this action, whichever is later). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Some of the cellular systems in which McCaw has an interest are deemed ``Bell Companies'' under the MFJ and are subject to the MFJ's equal access requirements. The United States has proposed an order to the MFJ Court that would impose certain requirements in order to protect the provision of equal access by those systems. Whether these systems are also McCaw Cellular Systems, or are McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems, depends on whether McCaw (as well as the Bell Company) controls the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

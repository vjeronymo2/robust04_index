			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Trinidad and Chile 'top list for US links' Chile and Trinidad and Tobago are the countries best prepared to take on free trade and investment agreements with the US, according to a report released yesterday by the Washington-based Institute for International Economics. Of the countries seeking trade pacts with the US, Chile and Trinidad and Tobago head a list which includes Barbados, Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia. The US administration has stressed that Chile is at the head of the queue for free trade agreements, although Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados are also considered excellent candidates. Policymakers have yet to decide whether the trade agreements should be entered on a bilateral basis or through accession to the North America Free Trade Agreement. The report 'strongly' recommends the Nafta route. With bilateral talks, the authors say, there is the risk that Nafta members would feel they were being played off against potential new US partners, it says. The report, by Mr Gary Hufbauer and Mr Jeffrey Schott, is the IIE's contribution to the current debate in the Clinton administration. Economic integration in the hemisphere is now a goal to which the administration has gradually committed itself; the best means to achieve it are under discussion in the US and between US officials and their Latin American counterparts. The authors say integration within the Americas will proceed more slowly than it has in Europe and without the transfer of funds - or cohesion - between the rich EU countries and their poorer brethren. As the US debate over Nafta showed, labour and environmental standards will be more contentious than in Europe. 'When income disparities and social conditions between trade partners are great, the trauma of economic integration is bound to be large,' the report says. 'The economic playing field looks distinctly slanted and, for different reasons, each country feels threatened by the economic standing of its partners.' To measure a country's readiness for free trade, the authors have devised a set of indicators based on price stability, budget discipline, external debt, currency stability, market-oriented policies, reliance on trade taxes, and functioning democracy. Strong commitment to economic liberalisation policies is preparing many countries for the shock of freer trade. Thus the potential of Argentina, which now stands at only 2.6 on the Hufbauer-Schott scale of 5.0, is considered greater than it seems because 'its low scores on price stability and external debt will jump sharply if the reforms are maintained.' Brazil, which is pushing economic integration within South America, scores only 2.3. Chile and Trinidad and Tobago are put at 4.4. Just before it joined Nafta, Mexico was at 3.9. In preparation for the Summit of the Americas, to be held in Miami in December, the US administration has been consulting its Latin partners and eyeing various roads to regional integration. All of such partners would gain by freer trade and investment ties throughout the hemisphere, says the report. US exports could gain by about Dollars 36bn (Pounds 23bn) in 2002; its imports would be about Dollars 28bn. 'Our emphasis will be on 'building blocks' of various types, in advance of free trade agreements,' said Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, recently in Buenos Aires. 'These can include intellectual property agreements, bilateral investment treaties, understanding on disciplines that we recognise are broadly supported by the private sector. . . The Nafta's disciplines will serve as a model in many respects.'</p>

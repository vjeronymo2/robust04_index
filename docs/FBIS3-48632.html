In this way, he indicated his strong resolve to  come to grips with the political reform at the risk of his  political future.    [Begin Hosokawa recording] If the political reform is not  carried out, I have no intention of hanging on to the post of  prime minister at all. If the political reform, which has  repeatedly been debated in the past five years, is left buried  because of minor differences, we will probably not have an  opportunity again to carry it out. Now, both the ruling and  opposition parties are holding a joint committee meeting of both  houses of the Diet and I intend to call on President Kono of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party to hold a top-level meeting  with me to discuss ways to handle a package of political reform  bills.

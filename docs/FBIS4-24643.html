			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "State Urges Stepping Up of Price </F> Monitoring"]    [Text] The government intends to continue nationwide price  monitoring to ensure stable living costs, a top economic  official said yesterday.    Officials once more will target key commodities which have  greater impact on the price level, and are closely related to  people's daily lives .    Prices of daily necessities such as grain and cotton will  receive top priority, State Planning Minister Chen Jinhua told  the three-day national working conference on price inspection in  Beijing.    The inspection will also cover such key items as chemical  fertilizer, power supplies for rural users, steel, petroleum  products and service charges.    Chen said that while the country takes measures to scale  down  investing in fixed assets and issuing currency, it should  simultaneously implement policies designed to encourage grain  and cotton harvests.    Meanwhile, reform of modern enterprises should be pursued to  increase commodity supplies.    "These steps will help to create a favourable condition for  curbing inflation," the minister said.    He also urged officials to speed up price legislation and  draft price laws and other regulations to ban illegal  monopolies, profiteering and cheating on commodity prices.    Chen urged that the last two months progress in nationwide  price monitoring be consolidated.    Price inspectors have, during the two months from March 10  to  May 10, uncovered more than 190,000 cases of price violations,  involving some 400 million yuan ($46 million) in illegal price  charges.    The meeting was told that 100,000 of these cases have been  handled by fining violators 88 million yuan ($10 million).    "The inspection drive helped the local government leaders as  well as producers and retailers to realize that prices can not  be raised arbitrarily." Chen told the meeting.    Monitoring also helped implement State price control rules,  including a grain risk fund at both central and provincial  levels, and requiring all shops to put price tags on all  commodities .    According to a recent People's Daily report, Shanghai has,  since last year, set aside 400 million yuan ($46 million) as  cash reserves for storing such daily necessities as grain and  edible oil. The action has effectively curbed the market prices  of these basics in the city.    However, Chen warned that some local officials have not paid  enough attention to price inspection and made little progress in  curbing inflation in their area.    "In some places, greater effort is needed to deal with  illegal price increases," the minister said.    The minister anticipated improvements, however, following an  announcement that those who hinder price inspectors face severe  punishment.</p>

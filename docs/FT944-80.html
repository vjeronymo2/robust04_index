			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Mladic almighty - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers) When reading Bosnia's tea leaves, analysts tend to ask two questions. Where is General Ratko Mladic and what does he think? As much as he detests western observers, the Bosnian Serb commander does not appear to have much time for local politicians either. He appears to enjoy keeping them guessing. This may be the most innocuous of his pleasures. Over the past 32 months of war, Mladic has gained a reputation for brutal genius, masterminding the Serb campaign to carve out an ethnically pure state in Bosnia-Hercegovina. His frequent disappearances have fuelled excited rumours of his death, and raised the hopes of his outmanoeuvred Bosnian Moslem and Croat foes. Even western newspapers have jumped the gun, carrying banner headlines reporting the 'murder' of Mladic. In his brash and crudely mischievous manner, the 52-year-old general shrugs off the reports, making impromptu appearances, usually somewhere on the front. Amid intense speculation about his split with his leadership last April, Mladic played a flamboyant chess match with his political counterpart, the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, on the frontlines near Gorazde. Mladic thumbed his nose at the outside world, which was focused on Nato air strikes against Serb targets attacking the Moslem enclave. Nine months earlier, in flagrant defiance of a UN no-fly zone, he had flown in a helicopter touring Serbian positions on strategic heights besieging Sarajevo. Adored by the Bosnian Serbs, especially by soldiers for his hardline stance, the short and stocky Mladic regularly visits the frontlines. 'We'll never hand over land for which Serb blood has been spilled,' he pledges by way of explaining his refusal to meet international demands to roll back current Serb holdings from 70 to 49 per cent of Bosnia. Described by a UN official as a 'soldier's soldier', Mladic has spent long evenings over dinners and rakija, home-brewed brandy, with his UN opposite numbers in the Serb stronghold above the Bosnian capital. This cameraderie with the man who has been named by the US as a potential war criminal has stirred bitter comment in Sarajevo. But the ruddy-faced general appears not to care. Earlier in the war he was overheard ordering his men to pound Sarajevo with the largest calibre artillery the Serb forces had. Personal tragedies seem only to have hardened his resolve to 'completely defeat the Moslems'. His mother was killed in the beginning of the war in a mortar attack on the outskirts of Sarajevo. Last April, his beloved daughter Ana, a 23-year-old medical student, committed suicide. The Serbian commander appeared dressed in black mourning clothes during marathon negotiations aimed at defusing the crisis round Gorazde. Long before, Mladic was primed to seek revenge. The battle lines in 1991 gave him the chance to avenge his father's death in the second world war. Born in the village of Bozinovici, in traditionally Serbian south-east Bosnia-Hercegovina, Ratko was two years old when his father, a communist partisan fighting against the Croat Ustashe fascists and the Germans, was killed in an attack on the native village of the Ustashe leader, Ante Pavelic. As soon as the Serbo-Croat war broke out in 1991, Lt-Colonel Mladic was transferred, appointed corps commander in Knin, which would be the heart of the Serb armed rebellion against Croatian independence. In this remote region, the loyal communist officer, who once vowed never to remove the red star from his cap, underwent a transformation into a Serb nationalist hero, wearing the uniform of Serbian royalist generals from the first world war. But the cruel soldier occasionally wants to bestow what he sees as his gift of life on Moslems or Croats. 'When I guarantee something it is the same as the word of the Almighty,' he often says. During the mass exodus of Moslems from the eastern enclave of Srebrenica, a man of military age was discovered hiding among hundreds of hysterical Moslems jam-packed into a lorry. Mladic told the terrified man: 'I will spare your life, but just remember who did it.'</p>

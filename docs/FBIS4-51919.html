			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, the U.S.  imperialists conducted on 2 May, along with the puppets, a  provocative aerial war exercise aimed at launching an aggression  on the North by introducing fighter planes into South Korea from  U.S. Pacific area bases.    Prior to this frantic war exercise, F-15 fighter-bombers,  FA-18 pursuit-assault bombers, E-3 early warning planes, which  had taken off from overseas bases, had been deployed for mobile  operations in the bases of the U.S. occupation Air Force in  South Korea.    This war exercise was frantically conducted in the air over  Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Koesan areas under the command of E-3  early warning planes--which are called aerial flight command  post. Put into this exercise on a large scale were aircraft,  which had flown into from overseas bases, and the  fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes,  reconnaissance planes belonging to the U.S. occupation Air Force  in South Korea and to the puppet Air Force.    This gunpowder-reeking war exercise was aimed at studying  the  actual conditions of the command of E-3 early warning planes  over the aircraft of various types and at increasing the  capability of launching a surprise strike of aggression on the  North for an actual war.    On the same day, the P-3 anti-submarine planes, which took  off from a Japanese base, carried out espionage activities over  the areas along the coast of the northern part of the Republic  and the seas while moving around the east and the west for a  long time. At the same time, they ran amok in an exercise of  launching strikes against submarines with various mines,  torpedoes, and depth charges.    In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran wild in  conducting helicopter operations and firing firearms exercises  in the areas near the DMZ in front of our nose.    On 2 May, about 20 armed helicopters and transport  helicopters, which went into action over the areas near the DMZ  in the areas of Paju, Yonchon, and Chorwon, South Korea's  Kangwon Province, ran wild in the exercises of launching missile  strikes and ground support, and airborne operations in  low-altitude and very low-altitude flights.    On the same day, the puppet Army tank group, which was  deployed for mobile operations in the areas of (Kumsari), Paju  County, fired about 30 rounds of tank gun fires at the bank of  the Imjin River. The large-caliber artillery groups, which held  firing positions in areas of Hapsuri and Majolli, Yonchon  County; (Kupori), Paju County; and Naedaeri and Tongmangli,  Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea, displayed their  war frenzy by firing about 80 rounds of shots at areas near the  DMZ of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL].    Also on the same day, the puppet Army armed rascals, who  held  combat positions in areas of Yulili and Naepori, Chorwon-up,  Chorwon County in South Korea's Kangwon Province; Sinjongli,  Inje County; and Songgongni, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province,  fired at random several hundred rounds of large-caliber machine  gun fires while launching an attack in the direction of the MDL.    This reckless maneuver of playing with fire fully displayed  the war-loving nature of the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppets as warmongers.</p>

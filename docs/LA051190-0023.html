			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> RARE WORKS AT SEASON'S END  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's final program of the current season -- this  reviewer attended Wednesday's performance, the first of two at Ambassador  Auditorium with a third offering scheduled for Royce Hall Sunday -- found guest  conductor Helmuth Rilling leading two rarely heard works: Bach's "Hunting"  Cantata, BWV 208, and Mozart's incidental music to "Thamos, King of Egypt," K.  345.  </P> <P> Bach's youthful secular cantata is a celebration of the hunt, the principal  pursuit of the Saxon duke for whom it was written.  </P> <P> Bach's characterization in the recitatives is particularly sharp, but the  ensuing arias tend to be commonplace -- with a single exception. Still, the  listener could delight in the expert handling of their tortuous pitches and  endless fioriture by a crack team of vocalists: sopranos Henriette Schellenberg  and Ibolya Verebics, tenor Jonathan Mack and baritone Daniel Lichti. High marks  too to the floridly imaginative harpsichord continuo of Patricia Mabee.  </P> <P> The exception previously referred to is the justly popular aria known in  English (the entire program was sung in the original German) as "Sheep may  safely graze," delivered with exquisite poise and purity of tone by  Schellenberg accompanied by the sweetly tootling recorder duo of Lisette  Rabinow and Scott Wilkinson.  </P> <P> If Bach had the evening's big tune, Mozart walked off with overall musical  honors for his "Thamos" choruses and orchestral interludes, brimming with  harmonic invention, thunderous drama and thematic prefigurings of "Die  Zauberflote," whose plot also bears resemblances to that of "Thamos."  </P> <P> Rilling led the score with blazing conviction while his pickup chorus (prepared  for the occasion by Gordon Paine) sang with admirable strength and clarity of  tone.

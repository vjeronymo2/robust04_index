			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's position has always been and will continue  to be the following: the armed conflict in Bosnia and  Herzegovina can be resolved "not by force, but only at the  political negotiation table," Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin said after talks with the Tajik government  delegation on Wednesday.    The premier believes that an unlimited amount of time can be  spent finding out who of the opposing sides "is to blame or not  to blame" in the escalation of the conflict in the Balkans," and  whether attacks of American planes on positions of the Bosnian  Serbs in the region of Gorazde have been coordinated or not.  But it is absolutely clear that in the world "there are forces  who need all this and whose ambitions are the reason why this  all happens."    Chernomyrdin noted that Russia's position remains the same:  "an immediate end of bloodshed without the use of force."  Otherwise, he thinks, sanctions against Yugoslavia "will not be  lifted," although "the people who are reaping all these fruits  of political intrigues have nothing to do with this."    The premier is convinced that the sanctions imposed by the  UN  will not be lifted "not because Russia wants or does not want  this," but because the countries neighboring to Yugoslavia "will  not let cargoes of any of the warring sides through their  territories in order not to fan the Balkan fire, and they will  be right to do so."</p>

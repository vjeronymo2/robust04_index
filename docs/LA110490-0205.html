			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CLAREMONT;  </P> <P> SEWER FEE INCREASE STUDIED  </P> <P> Homeowners and apartment dwellers could face an increase from $6 to $31.50 in  their annual sewer service fees under a proposal before the City Council  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Business and industrial users would pay $55 a year under the proposal, up from  $6 for businesses and $12 for industrial users.  </P> <P> The proposed increases would go toward establishment of a fund to finance  maintenance of the city's sewer system and repair and replacement of sewer  lines.  </P> <P> Craig Bradshaw, associate civil engineer for the city, said the proposed  increases are in line with fees charged by neighboring cities. La Verne, for  example, charges $66 a year per dwelling unit and Pomona, $60. Only Montclair's  fee of $21.60 is lower, and that is being investigated as a result of  Claremont's inquiries, Bradshaw said.  </P> <P> Tuesday's public hearing on the sewer fee increase was postponed until Nov. 15  because it was at the end of a long meeting and only two people remained in the  chambers.  </P></p>

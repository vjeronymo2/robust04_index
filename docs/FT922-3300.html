			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Growing demand is part of the furniture: Saleroom A NEO-CLASSICAL bureau plat made by Jean-Francois Leleu in Paris in the early 1770s sold for Pounds 1.21m at Christie's in London yesterday. It was part of the collection of Barbara Johnson, who married into the American baby-powder family. She is selling some furniture to raise money for commercial projects in her native Poland. In 1981 at Christie's she paid Pounds 330,000 for the bureau, which carried an estimate yesterday of Pounds 750,000. The furniture auction underlined the international demand for top-quality items and raised Pounds 5.67m, with 18 per cent unsold. The Ashburton cabinet, made by Pietro Piffetti, cabinet maker to the kings of Sardinia, around 1765, sold for Pounds 770,000. It had been in the Ashburton family since the mid 19th century but was only recently identified as the work of the Italian master. Another important piece from an English stately home, a Louis XV lacquer commode, which had been at Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire, sold for Pounds 660,000. A pair of tables stamped MA, the initials of Marie Antoinette, made Pounds 57,200. They were the work of Jean-Georges Robierscky and were probably supplied to Marie Antoinette in the months after the start of the French Revolution in 1789. A Faberge imperial Easter egg, commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II for his wife Tsarina Alexandra in 1905 to celebrate the birth of his heir, Alexei, sold for Dollars 3.095m (Pounds 1.74m) at Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday. It set an auction record for a Faberge egg. In all, 54 imperial eggs were produced by the workshop of the St Petersburg jeweller in the 30 years after 1885, but this is only the fifth to appear at auction in the past 50 years. The last was sold in 1985 to Malcolm Forbes of Forbes Magazine for Dollars 1.76m. The Forbes collection was one of the largest of Faberge eggs and there was concern at Sotheby's that his death last year had removed the biggest enthusiast. But an anonymous buyer has filled the gap. The price was spot on the Sotheby's estimate.</p>

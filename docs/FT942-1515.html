			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Paribas seizes Stoltzenberg's Perkins stake Banque Paribas has seized a 17.5 per cent stake in Montreal-based Perkins Papers, a sizeable North American paper towel and toilet paper manufacturer, from Mr Wolfgang Stoltzenberg, the German-Canadian financier whose property empire collapsed two years ago. But the French bank, which is due to take formal possession of its shares today, is embroiled in a dispute over a voting trust between Mr Stoltzenberg and a US west coast family which is Perkins' biggest single shareholder. The disagreement means that almost two-thirds of Perkins' shares cannot be voted. Unable to muster a quorum, Perkins has delayed its annual meeting, which was due to be held yesterday, for at least a month. Mr Rocco Bramwell, Perkins' chief executive, said that the dispute does not affect day-to-day operations and that he expects the voting trust issue to be resolved in the near future. Perkins' has annual sales of CDollars 117m (USDollars 84m) and employs about 800 people. Mr Stoltzenberg, who lives in London, pledged his Perkins shares to Paribas' Swiss subsidiary as collateral for a loan to one of his private companies. The market value of the shares is currently just under CDollars 6m, but they were worth as much as CDollars 19.4m before the recent recession. The crux of the dispute is Paribas' claim that it is entitled to the three seats formerly controlled by Mr Stoltzenberg under the voting trust on Perkins' seven-member board. Paribas is also among the leading creditors of Montreal-based Castor Holdings, the top company of a tangled international property syndication group led by Mr Stoltzenberg which collapsed in 1992 with debts of CDollars 1.4bn. According to the bankruptcy trustee, Castor's affairs are still 'years away' from being wound up. Creditors have been warned that they are unlikely to recover anything, barring the discovery of a large chunk of missing funds. The trustee is still trying to get to the bottom of Castor's far-flung and intricate affairs. Besides investigations in Canada, the probe has been widened to Curacao, Ireland and Switzerland, among other places. The Canadian police have been called in, but no criminal charges have so far been laid.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets: Don't be rushed by Budget hype - Serious Money The timing of this week's base rate cut is a salutary reminder that chancellors (and governors of the Bank of England) like to surprise us. Everyone was expecting the cut to be announced on Tuesday as a counterpoint to tax increases in the Budget. So, if that was a surprise, chancellor Kenneth Clarke probably has more unexpected measures up his sleeve. Before the last Budget, I do not recall anyone forecasting the changes which Norman Lamont made to the taxation of dividends. All this should emphasise the dangers of rushing out and making investment decisions on the basis of expected Budget measures. One possibility is that tax relief on personal pensions could be limited to 20 per cent. This has a certain logic, in that the government has reduced other reliefs (such as those on mortgage interest) to the 20 per cent level. It might, thus, seem sensible for higher-rate taxpayers to make some quick single premium payments into personal pension schemes. But implementing the proposal would run counter to the government's obvious desire to encourage a greater shift away from state pension provision. And even if Clarke did make such a shift, it might well not come into force until the start of the next tax year. Investors would then have plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of a pension contribution in the light of hard news rather than rumour. It seems highly plausible (although I confess the chancellor has not confided his plans to me) that the thrust of any Budget change will involve the personal tax allowance (Pounds 3,445 this year). Tax relief on the allowance will be limited to 20 per cent (a measure which will cost a higher-rate taxpayer Pounds 689 a year), but the chancellor will give some of the money back by extending the 20 per cent band. If he widened the band enough, he could declare it to be the basic rate of tax, thereby meeting a long-standing Conservative tax-cutting pledge while raising taxes at the same time. If such a change does occur, then the various tax-free schemes (Peps, Tessas etc) will become more important for top-rate taxpayers. But investors will have until April to make their decisions. * * * Regular readers will know I am a fan of indexed funds, so it is good to see the launch of a new indexed investment trust. The Fairbairn European Smaller Companies index trust has the added advantage of opening up a new area for indexation; to date, most funds have been either UK-based or devoted to major overseas indices such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. James Capel, which is launching the fund together with Providence Capitol, has developed a new European smaller companies index which covers 17 countries and 1,000 stocks. The investment trust will buy a basket of 350 stocks designed to replicate the capital performance of this index. The managers believe there is an identifiable investment opportunity in European smaller companies. In both the US and the UK, smaller company shares have rebounded as the national economies moved out of recession. In Europe, the recession appears to be bottoming and smaller companies have had a long period of underperformance; a turnaround could be due. It could be argued that indexation is less appropriate in the field of smaller companies. One key argument in its favour is that stock markets are efficient, so that it is impossible for active managers to beat the index consistently. But small company shares are followed much less and the markets are much less efficient so, accordingly, the active manager ought to have more scope to outperform. The managers contend, however, that if there is a opportunity for profit, why take the risk that an active manager will underperform the index? It is true that the Fairbairn trust is also likely to underperform the index's total return; in view of dealing costs and the managers' 0.7 per cent annual fee. But the charges will be taken from income and the end result should be fairly close to the capital growth of the index. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 and the trust is Pep-qualifying. * * * The European smaller companies offer is dwarfed by a rival issue, the Mercury World Mining Trust. This has already raised a staggering Pounds 380m from institutions, making it the largest investment trust issue ever. It is tempting to believe that, when managers can raise Pounds 380m for a commodity trust, it is the sign of a bull market gone mad. In fact, apart from gold, base metals prices are severely depressed, having fallen 42 per cent since 1989. Some of those investing in the trust will be 'gold bugs' backing manager Julian Baring; others will be taking the view that metals prices have been down for so long that the only way forward is up. Contrarianism seems, paradoxically, to get ever more popular. But some commentators believe we have entered a long deflationary phase in which competition from emerging markets will exert a continual downward pressure on prices. If their view is right, then the correct investment is not commodities but a heavy weighting in bonds, with the main equity exposure in emerging markets. Only if you believe that world inflation will return with a vengeance, does a mining trust make sense, and even then index-linked gilts are probably a more sensible option.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo Shaping a single exploration entity from the ungainly mixture of Lasmo's and Ultramar's assets was always going to be a long job, if only because it looked as if the unwanted parts would be hard to sell. Judging by yesterday's settlement with the vanquished Ultramar board, Lasmo is meanwhile making a good enough fist of cutting the group's costs. Granted, two Ultramar directors have still to agree terms, so an already steep Pounds 8.1m severance charge will rise further. A provision at the year end for middle management redundancies could further spoil the picture. But the market was braced for the boardroom pay-offs alone to cost nearer Pounds 20m, so at this stage the deal looks comparatively cheap. Lasmo also appears in recent weeks to have talked down expectations of the sale price for Ultramar's downstream businesses. A halved figure of Pounds 700m for the Wilmington refinery in California and the US and Canadian retail operations looks realistic given the continued weakness of the market for oil assets. While Lasmo will have to warehouse the businesses for the foreseeable future, it could conceivably benefit when a buyer eventually emerges. Until then, the assets will at least be self-supporting. The more important trick of persuading investors to be patient in the short term may prove rather harder. But if Lasmo can pull it off, its shares should at least continue to hold their own against the market.</p>

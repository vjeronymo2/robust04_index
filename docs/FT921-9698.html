			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Management (In A Nutshell): Backing for buy-outs Ever optimistic, the management buy-out community is forecasting an upturn in activity, at least for smaller deals. Lower interest rates and a large number of over-borrowed companies which need to raise cash make for parallels with the buy-out scene in the early to mid-1980s but the priorities for deal-making have changed, say accountants Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y). To help managers contemplating a buy-out, E&amp;Y has published a new handbook, Management Buy-Outs: A Practical Guide. *From Edna Mills, E&amp;Y Corporate Finance, Becket House, 1 Lambeth Palace Road, London SE1 7EU.

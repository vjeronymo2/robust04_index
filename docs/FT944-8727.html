			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Britain, France and Europe Defence and security issues are expected to dominate today's Franco-British summit in Chartres. During the later decades of the cold war those issues divided the two countries, as France was outside Nato while Britain was its most unconditionally loyal member. But as the cold war fades, they find that this is the area where they have most in common. They are the two countries in western Europe for which military power has retained some of its old glamour, and some of its old relevance as a means of defending national interests far beyond the national territory. This gives them a stronger attachment to the tradition of national sovereignty than is felt by some of their European partners, and therefore makes them - or at any rate makes the conservatives now in power in both countries - more suspicious of supranational European blueprints. It also makes them more sensitive to the implications of the US's diminishing commitment to European security and transatlantic co-operation, symbolised most recently and graphically by its unilateral decision to stop enforcing the Bosnian arms embargo. The French reaction has an element of 'I told you so', since France has been warning since the days of Charles de Gaulle that 'a European Europe' should aspire to be independent of US tutelage. On the British side there is more sorrow than anger, but the practical conclusions are beginning to converge. Present in the minds of both sides, if usually unspoken, is the thought that for military purposes it is vital to canalise German political resurgence into a strong multilateral vessel. The less credible Nato looks, the stronger the argument for making that vessel a European one. These thoughts point to two types of co-operation. One is a closer bilateral liaison between the two countries' armed forces, at this stage especially their airforces, and, where economically efficient, between their defence industries. The other is a joint initiative for the 1996 intergovernmental conference, aimed at strengthening the EU's 'defence component', the Western European Union. Both types of co-operation have their logic, but they need to be carefully related to each other. The proliferation of ad hoc bilateral or even multilateral military arrangements involving different combinations of EU members could easily become an obstacle to a coherent common defence for the Union as a whole. It would make better sense if the Franco-German Eurocorps as well as the proposed Franco-British air planning unit were brought within the WEU structure. It must also be questioned how credible the WEU will be so long as it depends on American logistical and air support and intelligence assets. To make Europe independent in these respects would be expensive, but military credibility is seldom cheap. Also essential is a competitive internal market for defence contracts. For the French, the immediate test of the UK's commitment will be its willingness to join in building the Future Large Aircraft. This should be considered sympathetically, but chosen only if the cost is not prohibitive. In the longer term, Britain's ability to take the lead in a common defence will also be related to its willingness to join in other aspects of European integration. Among these, Sir Leon Brittan argued last night, the creation of a single currency at the end of the century remains all but certain. If he is right, France and Germany may be unwilling to entrust a leading role in their defence to a country perceived to be on the fringes of their economic union.</p>

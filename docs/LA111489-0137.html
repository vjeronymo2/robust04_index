			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WALL REJECTS PRESSURE TO QUIT AS TOP S&amp;L REGULATOR  </P> <P> Embattled savings and loan regulator M. Danny Wall refused to resign Monday and  said President Bush "wants to hear the other side of the story."  </P> <P> Bush said in an interview published Saturday that he is considering whether to  dismiss Wall, who is under fire for his handling of the investigation of  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.  </P> <P> But Wall, after testifying at a congressional hearing Monday, said the  President "knows that one is innocent until proven guilty." He said he had  acted properly in handling the case of Lincoln, which suffered a financial  collapse that may ultimately cost the taxpayers $2 billion, making it the  biggest single thrift failure.  </P> <P> "We knew far less than people think we did," said Wall, who rejected a  recommendation by federal regulators in San Francisco in 1987 that the Federal  Home Loan Bank Board seize Lincoln then. Instead, the bank board seized Lincoln  in April of this year, after its losses had mounted substantially.  </P> <P> "We had insufficient basis to take the actions" sought by the San Francisco  regulators, Wall said. He was chairman of the bank board then and is now  chairman of its successor agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision.  </P> <P> The Lincoln issue has become politically explosive because of efforts by five  senators, including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), to intervene with federal  officials on Lincoln's behalf.  </P> <P> Wall said Monday that Cranston's calls to him in 1987 and 1989 were "perfectly  appropriate." In 1987, Wall said, Cranston urged a prompt decision on a pending  regulatory review of Lincoln, and in 1989 Cranston asked for a rapid decision  on whether the government would permit the sale of Lincoln to outside  investors.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said Monday that the Senate  Ethics Committee is conducting a serious inquiry into the actions of the five  senators: Cranston, Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), John Glenn (D-Ohio), Dennis  DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.).  </P> <P> All five senators received significant campaign contributions from Lincoln's  owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., the Arizona financier who controlled Lincoln's  parent firm, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix. The inquiry is designed to  determine if the panel should conduct a full investigation of the five senators  with the help of an outside counsel.  </P> <P> "The matter is being investigated," said Mitchell. "The fact that the Ethics  Committee does not put out press releases does not mean that it is not  investigating the matter very seriously."  </P> <P> All five senators have been asked by the committee to respond to the charges  that they improperly influenced the federal regulators' dealings with Lincoln.  </P> <P> House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), who has been  holding hearings into the Lincoln debacle, has said Wall systematically misled  the committee about the extent of the nation's failing S&amp;L problem and  mishandled his regulatory duties. He has asked the President to fire Wall.  </P> <P> Wall responded Monday that the committee has not yet given him a chance to  provide his version of events. "Many questions should be asked and answered in  a timely fashion," he said.  </P> <P> Wall is now scheduled to testify to the House Banking Committee next Tuesday.  The hearings resume today with the testimony of Securities and Exchange  Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden, who will discuss his agency's inquiries  into the activities of Lincoln and American Continental.  </P> <P> Wall's comments Monday followed an appearance before a special House Banking  Committee task force that is monitoring the S&amp;L bailout. The hearing dealt  with the Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency created to shut down insolvent  S&amp;Ls and dispose of their assets such as real estate acquired when  borrowers were unable to repay their loans.  </P></p>

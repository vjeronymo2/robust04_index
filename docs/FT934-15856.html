			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Acas talks in Tube dispute EFFORTS TO avert possible strikes next month by 10,000 staff on London Underground will begin on Monday when RMT, the rail union, meets Acas, the conciliation service. The dispute is over London Transport's decision to fire two RMT members on the Central line for indiscipline. The members were later re-hired for different jobs. The union held a strike on the Central line on Thursday and is planning two more one-day strikes on October 14 and 21. A strike ballot of all underground members is also to be held.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: S African glass group advances A strong performance by offshore operations helped Plate Glass and Shatterprufe Industries, South Africa's largest glass company, to a 71 per cent increase in after-tax profits for the year to March, to R207.9m (Dollars 58m) from R121.9m. Attributable income more than doubled to R158.6m from R79.1m, and a dividend of 56.8 cents was declared, up from 37.1 cents in 1993. Mr Ronnie Lubner, chief executive, attributed the results to offshore subsidiary Belron International, which serves the automotive glass replacement industry in 11 countries, and which contributed 36 per cent of earnings. Belron benefited from a strong showing from Autoglass in the UK. Continental Europe (except Germany and Italy) and Australia also did well. Mr Lubner was particularly pleased with the group's American operations, Windshields America. Group turnover increased by 17 per cent to R3.2bn from R2.77bn while net financing costs dropped to R28.5m from R32.6m on strong cash flow. Mr Lubner was 'cautiously optimistic' about the South African economy in the new political climate.</p>

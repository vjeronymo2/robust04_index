			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Israeli warriors to fore at summit Veteran soldiers of wars against Jordan, relatives of the war dead, and the few Israelis with any links to Jordan largely made up the delegation Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, brought to Washington for yesterday's historic summit. At a time of peace, the emphasis on battlefield losses may seem strange. Yet it is a peculiar tradition of Mr Rabin's to emphasise throughout the Middle East peace process the memory of Israel's sons who sacrificed their lives to defend the existence of the Jewish state in the face of Arab aggression. Mr Rabin, as chief of army staff, was responsible for the Israeli victory in the 1967 Six Day War and the occupation of Arab lands. The warrior turned peacemaker never completely shed his professional soldier personality, and feels much more comfortable surrounded by military men. Among the delegation are reserve Maj Gen Dani Matt, who was a commander in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and was taken prisoner by Jordan in the bloody battles at Gush Etzion and paraded through the streets of Jericho on his way to Amman; Dr Sharon Regev, the eldest son of Colonel Arik Regev who was killed in 1968 during operations in the Jordan Valley against Palestinian guerrillas infiltrating into Israel from Jordan; and Shimon Kahaner, one of the paratroopers who fought successfully in 1967 to capture the old city of Jerusalem from Jordan. Mr Rabin also invited the few Israelis who were involved in early political talks with Jordan including Mr Avraham Deskel, the 89-year-old director of a power station. Mr Deskel knew King Abdallah, the grandfather of King Hussein who was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1952 by extremists opposed to his peace overtures towards Israel. Mr Rabin's preference for soldiers and relatives is at the expense of Israeli politicians. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister who has done so much to make the Middle East peace process a success, was only invited by Mr Rabin to attend the summit at the last minute, reflecting a decades old personality and power conflict between the two men.</p>

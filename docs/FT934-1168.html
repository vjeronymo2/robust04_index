			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Technology: Homing in on a new market - Microsoft's plans for PCs in the house Microsoft wants to get into your home. The world's largest personal computer software company has announced an ambitious strategy to accelerate its participation in the home computer market and to change the way computers are used in the home. The company has launched a new brand to handle this task - Microsoft Home - and says that the home computer products to be sold under the brand already contribute Dollars 200m (Pounds 134.2m) in annual revenues to Microsoft. The company's chairman and co-founder Bill Gates predicts dramatic further growth in this sector. He cites a recent survey by the Connecticut-based Inteco Corporation - which revealed that more than 27 per cent of US homes already have at least one PC, and that 31 per cent plan to buy one. In homes where children are of school age the percentage jumps to 62 per cent. These figures also show that 5.5m homes plan to buy a PC in the next year. All this is fertile ground for Microsoft, which has until now only toyed with the home market through a diverse range of products. The company currently has some 35 software titles for home users, but plans to expand that to more than 100 within the next year. Microsoft has formed partnerships with banks, educational institutions and even parent-teacher associations to develop and promote new applications for home computers. In the short term, the most important of these will be what Microsoft calls 'edutainment' packages - which teach children new skills, introduce them to new ideas and help them to absorb information by playing games and creating stories and pictures. Such software includes electronic encyclopaedias, reference works about everything from dinosaurs to Beethoven, and children's creativity applications. A vital technological key to the success of these developments is Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD-Rom). This is a storage medium based on the same compact disc technology as used in stereo equipment, but storing huge amounts of computer data (up to 600Mb - or about 400 times the amount available on the average computer floppy disc). It allows software producers a low-cost way of offering 'multimedia' applications that can hold hundreds of pictures, film clips, spoken words and music. Gates estimates that within 18 months, all popular makes of computer will be shipped with CD-Rom drives and sound capabilities and predicts that more than one million similarly equipped PCs will have been sold by the end of this year. Gates predicts that home computers will be more than just study aids for children and has negotiated agreements with several financial services companies to offer home banking services. Users will gain access to the services through the Microsoft Money financial management software package. All these products and services, however, are a prelude to the realisation of a much broader vision of home computing that Gates has often outlined. Microsoft is a stong proponent of the development of interactive telvision and the so-called 'digital highway' under discussion in the US. Gates suggests that as more homes use computers, and hook up to digital information links, it will be only a matter of time before the computer, telephone, television and on-line information services converge into a single system for handling all home entertainment, education, information and communication needs. Microsoft could, however, face an uphill battle. To start with none of its ideas on home computing are particularly new. Microsoft also faces competition. California-based Intuit, for example, has also made an agreement with the many US banks that have links to Visa. And telecommunications giant AT&amp;T has announced that it, too, is entering the home software business with plans to license home shopping software.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chairman of the Commission for Constitution, </F> Standing Orders, and Legislature Tereza Ganza-Aras by Zdenko  Duka; place and date not given: "This Is Indeed a Parliamentary  Crisis"]    [Text] The attempt to replace Josip Manolic in the  Chamber of Counties brought the Commission for Constitution,  Standing Orders, and Legislature -- whose chairman is Tereza  Ganza-Aras -- into focus. We therefore asked Tereza Ganza-Aras  when she intended to convene the Commission.    [Ganza-Aras] I will convene the session as soon as I receive  a request that will satisfy both the material and formal terms  as foreseen by Article 50 of the Chamber of Counties Standing  Orders. The request of a group of deputies, whose signatures  were illegible, demanding that the session be convened urgently,  should have specified why the request was made and exactly what  they meant by "urgent," and it should have explained the reason  for this urgency.    [Duka] No valid requests have been made recently?    [Ganza-Aras] No. The above-mentioned article of the  Standing Orders that the group of deputies refers to, specifies  that one must state the topic that is to be discussed at the  session. I acted in accordance with the Standing Orders and  thereby protected the dignity of the Commission and of the  Chamber of Counties. The president of the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] Club used expressions like "we demand," as  if this was a party directive that I had to obey without  objection.    [Duka] Is it difficult to figure out who is behind this  request?    [Ganza-Aras] Yes. Names and surnames should have been typed  next to signatures in order for it to be seen whether they are  members of the Commission. When I find out exactly what problem  is to be evaluated by the Commission, then I will use the  possibility provided by the Standing Orders and consult experts.  There are lawyers in the Commission, but it would not be  harmful to hear the opinion of professors of law. If I had  satisfied the "demand" of the president of the HDZ Club, it  would have been pure voluntarism.  <H5>  30-Day Deadline </H5>   [Duka] You have mentioned a deadline of up to 30 days for  convening the session. Is that according to the Standing Orders?    [Ganza-Aras] The Standing Orders say that the duty of the  president of the Chamber of Counties is to submit agenda  proposals within 30 days. The other rule says that presidents  of working bodies have the rights and obligations toward their  bodies that apply to the president of that chamber. Therefore,  the longest deadline is 30 days. However, according to a  Standing Orders article, there is a possibility of shortening  deadlines, so, since this request is urgent, I will convene the  Commission as soon as I get everything necessary for the regular  course of the session.    However, the date for which I will convene the session will  depend on when I get the material and when I get assessments.  Notice of a session is sent to members eight days before the  session takes place.    [Duka] Still, even without professional opinion, do you  think different interpretations of the Standing Orders are  possible? Was it legally possible to replace Manolic last  Friday?    [Ganza-Aras] I think his interpretation was valid. All  lawyers I met in those long recesses in the corridors of the  parliament house share my opinion. There was a state of general  consternation due to attempts to impose a party model on the  work of the parliament.    [Duka] Professor Smiljko Sokol says this is not a  parliamentary crisis. What is you opinion?    [Ganza-Aras] I think he is wrong. I do not know what else  could be called a parliamentary crisis if not replacing the  president of a chamber of the parliament?! Secondly, the  Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Counties are  obviously dependent on each other, and the Chamber of  Representatives will not be able to begin a new session until  this interrupted session of the Chamber of Counties is brought  to a close. For a certain group of bills it is obligatory to  first get the so-called previous opinion of the Chamber of  Counties, and there are such bills at every session.    And in order to alleviate the crisis, I will try to convene  my commission as soon as possible, but even that opinion is not  reliable. Again, the Chamber of Counties will alone decide  whether it will accept that opinion or not.   <H5>    What Kind of Ballot? </H5>   [Duka] At the session of the Commission, there will probably  be outvoting. What is the party structure of deputies?    [Ganza-Aras] All commissions are composed so that HDZ  members have an absolute majority. Commissions have 17 members  each, four of which are liberals, one member of the Social  Democratic Party, one member of the Istrian Democratic Congress  -- Sosic is formally a member of the Croatian Party, but he is a  member of the HDZ Club -- and one member of the Croatian  Peasants Party. There are eight HDZ members -- nine with Sosic.  I suppose they will all come to the Commission session so that  there will be outvoting, as usual.    [Duka] If Manolic is replaced, they will vote for a new  president. In case there are several candidates, there will be  a secret ballot.    [Ganza-Aras] Yes, but only as a rule. For, if seven  deputies demand an open ballot, then an open ballot will decide  whether there will be an open or a secret ballot. The Standing  Orders are composed so as to disable the opposition as much as  possible. The president of the Chamber has absolute power and,  now, in the case of Manolic, it recoils on the HDZ. People say  that a stick has two ends. Therefore, it is best not to have it.    [Duka] In early Fall, one began working on new standing  orders for both chambers. This work was particularly aided by  Mesic and Manolic. However, in the end, it was all stopped.    [Ganza-Aras] We completed the Standing Orders in November  last year. During a year and a half of work of the Chamber of  Representatives and a year of work of the Chamber of Counties,  many Standing Orders solutions appeared vague, so new Standing  Orders regulated many matters more precisely. However, when  they were already copied and ready to be sent to deputies for  approval, everything was stopped.  <H5>  Who Stopped Standing Orders? </H5>   [Duka] Who stopped them and why?    [Ganza-Aras] I can only guess. Prominent HDZ spokespersons  raised the issue. Among other things, the secret ballot was  emphasized as a problem. Those standing orders explicitly  demanded a secret ballot when making decisions about people.  They tried to introduce more order in deadlines for composing  the agenda. However, it seems that the ruling party wants to  have incomplete standing orders so as it can interpret them as  it likes.    [Duka] Now we see that Professor Sokol is not satisfied with  these standing orders. Therefore, he too might be replaced  after this case.    [Ganza-Aras] Yes, he is not only dissatisfied with the  Standing Orders but also with the constitutional definition of  the Chamber of Counties, and we know that he and Mr. Seks were  those who wrote this Constitution.    Sokol, for instance, says that the president of the  parliamentary chamber must enjoy the trust of most deputies in  the chamber or must step down. No one disputes that. But, the  session of the Chamber of Counties began on Wednesday, continued  on Thursday, and there were demands for Manolic's replacement on  Friday, and in two days of the session, the president of the  chamber [Manolic] did not come into conflict with any deputy.  It seems that 36 deputies remembered overnight, after full two  days of session, that they no longer trust their chamber  president.    The opposition wanted to continue and conclude this session.  HDZ deputies finally suggested interrupting the session. The  demand for replacement could have been put on the agenda of the  next session of the chamber. Furthermore, Sokol concluded that  the constitutional position of the Chamber of Counties must be  changed. All parliamentary opposition parties think that the  Constitution must be amended exactly with regard to the position  of the parliament.</p>

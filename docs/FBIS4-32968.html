			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign capital is prompting an excess supply of  money which destabilized the country's economy, says the Banamex  [National Bank of Mexico]-Accival financial group. The  financial group added that this could lead to considerable  devaluations of the peso with regard to the dollar and to  interest rates, as well as to disproportionate increases in the  Mexican Stock Market and other assets.    The financial group said that in the beginning, the influx  of  cash will not decrease rates (for the withdrawal of bills and  coins and sterilization), it will keep the exchange rate low and  raise the stock market index. Later on, there will be  reactions, first in the exchange rate and then in interest  rates, and the situation will change. Supply will become  increasingly moderate and demand will once again increase  through private financing.    In examining Mexico's economic situation in May 1994,  Banamex's Department of Economic Studies stated the economy's  low rate of growth is temporary because the economy has not lost  it's solidity and because the general consensus is that  stability is an essential requirement to achieve greater  development.    Nevertheless, the Department also mentioned that recovery is  not yet clearly visible and notes that it could be delayed or  limited by certain salient factors. "At present, there are  other reasons for uncertainty which, perhaps, may prompt a  deferment of investment plans. We are also beginning to note an  increase in manufacturing production, but this increase is not  echoed by sales." The Department also pointed to the  possibility that inventories may accumulate and later weaken  production.    The Department likewise underscored that conditions do not  yet exist for steady progress in private spending. A higher  unemployment rate and the fragmentation of the labor sector have  limited domestic spending power and made the decision to spend  more selective, which can be attributed to individual over  indebtedness.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Shirayama set to win fight for County Hall as LSE bid fails THE acrimonious battle over the future of London's County Hall appeared to have been won yesterday by Shirayama, the Japanese developer, after the government rejected the rival bid from the London School of Economics. Shirayama said it would now apply for planning permission to convert County Hall, the Thames-side former home of the Greater London Council, into a 600-bed hotel to open by 1996. However, it referred to the 'adverse economic factors' surrounding the deal, which would necessitate 'an extremely cautious and cost-conscious approach' to the development. 'We must rebuild the confidence and enthusiasm amongst the various people concerned, including the financial community,' it added. Yesterday's decision has not, therefore, put County Hall's future beyond doubt. Shirayama's scheme for County Hall may also run into trouble with the London borough of Lambeth, planning authority for the site. But given his support for the Shirayama bid, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, can be expected to override any planning difficulties. The LSE, Britain's leading social science university, had wanted to relocate to County Hall from its cramped premises in Aldwych, in central London. Its director, Dr John Ashworth, said he was 'dismayed' by the decision, which puts on ice his plan to double the LSE's graduate numbers within three years. The LSE is particularly annoyed that the Universities Funding Council, a government appointed body, refused to support its proposal. The UFC said it was concerned at the financial viability of the LSE's Pounds 65m bid for the site. On the basis of a report by Touche Ross, the consultants, the UFC said the deal might load the LSE with a cumulative Pounds 40m deficit over eight years - whereas the LSE had projected the deficit as persisting for half as long. The LSE's bid enjoyed strong cross-party support.</p>

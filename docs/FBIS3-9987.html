			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 24 Feb (EFE) -- The Bolivian Armed Forces  today asked for clarification about alleged relations between  traffickers and outstanding Bolivian politicians. They affirmed  that the democratic system is guaranteed by the military  institutions.    General Fernando Sanjinez, the Armed Forces commander in  chief, today pointed out the need for a detailed investigation  to see if trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez's charges are true.    The arrested trafficker leveled charges during his  declaration to Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) and a La Paz  judge. "Meco" Dominguez, who has Chagas disease, could not  finish his declaration in view of his poor health condition.    He linked former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora and the  leadership of his party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left  (MIR), to the top Bolivian drug traffickers who allegedly  provided financial support and transportation during their  electoral campaigns.    Amid ever increasing dissatisfaction of their fellow party  members, the MIR leaders today resumed a confidential meeting to  analyze the charges of their alleged links with drug trafficking.    Acting MIR President Oscar Eid was challenged by some  factions which plan to "save the party," while other factions  urged Paz Zamora to break his silence and isolation, "guide the  party," and "face the situation" now that his leadership is  under discussion.    Meanwhile, newspapers published new photographs of Paz  Zamora  and Isaac "Oso" Chavarria -- who was arrested by the FELCN in  January during one of the largest antinarcotics operations -- as  well as a copy of one Guillermo Capobianco's handwritten letters  dated 13 July 1987.    In the letter he congratulates Chavarria on his birthday. It  begins: "Dear Oso: I will not be able to accompany Jaime and  Oscar at the big celebration." The letter is signed by  Capobianco, who was then an important MIR leader in Santa Cruz.    Other MIR leaders said that in 1987 "no one knew Mr.  Chavarria was linked to drug trafficking."</p>

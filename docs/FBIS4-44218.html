			<p>BFN     [Text] The main objective of the visit paid to the Peoples'  Republic of China by Spanish Industry Minister Juan Manuel  Eguiagaray was to increase trade. Eguiagaray is on a tour of  the Far East, which now takes him to Hong Kong. This is what  Juan Manuel Eguiagaray had to say to our radio station:    [Begin Eguiagaray recording] I have signed a memorandum of  understanding with the Chinese Minister for Electricity [as  heard]. It could lead to building electric power stations as  well as to working together in the areas of nuclear energy,  renewable sources of energy, and in all that concerns our own  experience in building up a strong electricity industry and  running it.    To give you a better general idea, we did not only speak  about electricity. I met six ministers who deal with topics  ranging from telecommunications to the electronics industry as  well as machinery and the chemical industry. I also met those  responsible for the State Planning Commission.    In most of these areas there is interest in more Spanish  involvement in a country where there is still a lot to be done.

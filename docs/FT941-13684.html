			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / US pledges backing for Bosnia action The US and France yesterday sought to play down divisions in western policy towards Bosnia with a pledge by the US that it would join in possible air strikes in Bosnia in support of United Nations efforts to protect and feed refugees. After meeting his French opposite number, Mr Alain Juppe, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said: 'It is now understood the US is prepared to carry out its commitment at Nato to use air power.' The meeting, which had ostensibly been called to 'clarify' the French and US position towards Bosnia, came as confusion over the threatened air strikes risked reopening divisions within the alliance over Bosnia. Two weeks ago the Nato summit had warned of possible air strikes if UN forces were thwarted in opening the Bosnian airport of Tuzla to aid and in relieving peacekeepers in Srebrenica. using Mr Juppe said: 'We are going to try to do this, and if anyone tries to stop us we will use air power.' In Washington, however, President Bill Clinton took a more pessimistic view, doubting that international action could stop the carnage in Bosnia until the Serbs, Moslems and Croats 'make up their own mind to quit killing each other'. He implied that the allies, in consultation with the UN, were still not agreed when and where to deploy air strikes. On the diplomatic front, French President Francois Mitterrand told Mr Christopher that France would soon put forward new proposals relating to the war in Bosnia, but did not give any details. Earlier Mr Juppe indicated his hope that a stronger US endorsement of the European Union proposal to carve Bosnia into three ethnic regions would increase the chances of it being accepted. The comments came as Britain, France and Canada stepped up their discussions over the possible withdrawal of the United Nations protection forces in Bosnia. Following the visit by Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, to Bosnia last week, he is to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in New York next Monday before going on to Washington for discussions with Mr Christopher. Meanwhile in Zagreb, General Jean Cot, the outgoing French commander of UN troops in former Yugoslavia, yesterday said reforms were under way to improve peacekeeping. He spoke after swearing in General Sir Michael Rose of Britain as the new deputy in charge of UN troops in Bosnia.</p>

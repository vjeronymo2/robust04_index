			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Lib Dems pledge retention of 'effective veto' The Liberal Democrats yesterday sought to gloss over the party's disarray over Britain's ability to block decisions in Brussels as Mr Charles Kennedy said it backed the retention of an 'effective national veto'. The Liberal Democrat president said the party's suggestion for a 'double majority' system for taking important decisions in the European Union's Council of Ministers amounted to such a veto. His remarks came less than 24 hours after Sir David Steel, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, said in Cornwall that the EU would be 'stultified' if it did not abandon the national veto in favour of qualified majority voting. The Tories last night seized on the apparent discrepancy, calling on Mr Paddy Ashdown to explain his party's position. Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, used an open letter to the Liberal Democrat leader to highlight Sir David's comments. He said the veto was 'the most crucial constitutional issue in these elections'. Earlier Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, acknowledged that in spite of the Conservatives' decision to make preservation of the veto the centrepiece of their campaign, the outcome of the June 9 elections would not affect Britain's ability to block controversial legislation. Mr Hurd accepted that the Strasbourg assembly had no remit to remove the veto and that other leading countries in the EU were as committed as Britain to retaining it. But any increase in the number of Labour or Liberal Democrat members in the parliament would over time give support to the case of some smaller EU members for a move to majority voting on constitutional issues, he said. In spite of his distaste for his own party's Euro-sceptics, Mr Hurd said the policies of the main opposition parties would undervalue 'the role of the nation state' in Europe. He refused to accept statements from Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, earlier this week that committed Labour to retaining a veto. Confusion over the Liberal Democrats' position was triggered on Monday when Mr Ashdown backed away from abandoning the veto. The party has been anxious to add a sceptical note to its pro-European stance to win Tory votes in southern England. According to Sir Norman's letter, Mr Ashdown said last December that his party wanted ministers to 'make decisions in public without single national vetoes'. The Liberal Democrat manifesto commits the party to working for an extension of qualified majority voting. But it avoids direct reference to the veto, suggesting that the system be reformed to require a double majority for 'particularly important issues'. This double majority would consist of three-quarters of member states and the votes of states representing three-uarters of the EU's population. A Guardian/ICM poll suggests today that the Conservatives could be left with only six seats in the European elections. The figures are: Labour 47 per cent, Conservatives 26 per cent, Liberal Democrats 23 per cent, SNP 2 per cent, Greens 1 per cent, Plaid Cymru 1 per cent. These voting intentions could leave Labour with 65 seats, the Liberal Democrats with 12 and the Tories six.</p>

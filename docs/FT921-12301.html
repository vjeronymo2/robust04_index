			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Tax takes its toll in Sweden Sweden's tax on carbon dioxide emissions, introduced last year as part of wider tax reforms, is being strongly opposed by industry, writes Robert Taylor. Already suffering under a recession, the country's industrial groups argue that the high energy taxes they face put them at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis international rivals. Among energy taxes, the carbon dioxide tax - aimed at stabilising the amount of carbon dioxide emissions at the 1990 level until 2000 - is the principal irritant. The charge was imposed on carbon dioxide emissions from petrol and diesel fuel, natural gas, liquefied petroleum and kerosene. The tax amounts to 4 cents per kilogram of CO, in effect a tax increase of 9 cents per litre (22p per gallon) of petrol. Peat, methanol, ethanol, waste-derived fuel and biomass have been exempted from the tax. It is estimated that the tax will raise as much as Dollars 2bn in its first year. The carbon dioxide tax has added substantially to costs for industrial consumers: the cost of a cubic metre of heating oil has risen by SKr720, an increase of 20 per cent; a tonne of coal now costs 40 per cent or SKr620 more; the cost of natural gas has risen by Skr535 per cubic metre, up by 30 per cent; and gasoline costs SKr750 a tonne more, a rise of 20 per cent. A recent parliamentary investigation into the impact of the energy taxes on industry recommended that the tax should be cut by as much as 80 per cent. The study said the tax was costing industry some SKr20bn a year in potential exports and had already led to the loss of some 10,000 jobs. But any sweeping reduction of the tax is likely to be resisted by the pro-environment Centre party, an important member of Sweden's coalition government. The government is expected to deliver its response to the parliamentary committee's recommendations by spring. But a compromise will almost certainly have to be thrashed out by then to satisfy the competing claims of industry and that of the Centre party. The Centre party, whose leader, Mr Olof Johansson, heads the environment ministry, believes the EC's proposed environmental package itself is not tough enough.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Choe Kyu-sik] </F>   [Excerpts] One of the few prominent politicians who have  been continually in the limelight since the inauguration of the  Kim Yong-sam administration is Blue House Secretary General Pak  Kwan-yong. His emergence in the limelight is particularly  conspicuous because he does not belong to the Sangdo-tong inner  circle, the center of power. He consolidated his position during  the reshuffle of the ruling hierarchy late last year which  reaffirmed President Kim's abiding trust in him. The reshuffle  was aimed at strengthening President Kim's governing in person  and placing people in the Sangdo-tong inner circle in key  positions. [passage omitted]    It is said that it was none other Pak who advised Kim to set  the strengthening of international competitiveness as the  foremost goal of state administration in the new year and to use  this goal as the cardinal criterion in selecting a new Cabinet.  He was not directly involved in the reshuffle of the government  and the party. Nevertheless, it is a common belief that he was  virtually the only one whom President Kim consulted.    Early this year Pak completed the reorganization of the  presidential secretariat to assist the president more  effectively in his second year of office, although the  reorganization fell short of his original intentions. The  reorganization will now free him to concentrate more on his  advisory role.    Unlike other veteran politicians in their fourth term in the  National Assembly, Pak has his own views on a wide range of  issues such as the unification issue and is reputed to be a  very rational and resilient person. Yet "not exceeding the  bounds" and knowing his place are the better known ingredients  in his character.    According to Blue House sources, Pak bore himself with  dignity in the past year despite his not belonging to the  Sangdo-tong inner circles, and his deportment must have given  President Kim a strong impression. In taking control of state  affairs in the early stage of his term in office, President Kim  may have found it necessary to choose as his Blue House  secretary general a person from whom he should keep a certain  "distance" rather than one of his retainer group whom he could  address by his first name except in public.    Pak's modest personality and smooth human relations played a  significant part in travelling the political road without a  hitch. He is on intimate terms with Yi Won-chon, Blue House  senior secretary for political affairs, who belongs to the  Sangdo-tong inner circle. [passage omitted]    Pak also has a friendly relationship with Hong In-kil, Blue  House senior secretary for general affairs, who belongs to the  Sangdo-tong inner circle. The two have worked together in the  Blue House in the past year. Of course, Hong is courteous to  Pak, his college senior, and plays the role of a "protective  shield" for him.    Clearly, Pak has become one of the handful of important  "pillars" which President Kim can use. As Kim's perception of  statecraft improves, he might need late this year or early next  year a secretary general who is more of a manager than a  political adviser, and it might become possible for him to  appoint former Assemblyman So Sok-chae. Even in that event, it  is generally speculated, Pak would be found "more useful" in  some other capacity.    One of those who know Pak well said: "It is a lie to say  that  politicians have no ambition. As far as Secretary General Pak is  concerned, quiet deportment has become a habit." It is said that  Pak sometimes hesitates to tell things straight to the president  or the intensity of his advise is somewhat weak. But Blue House  officials said, "a true adviser's role is to act quietly to  make an opening for solving an outstanding issue."</p>

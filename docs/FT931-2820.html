			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Japanese unearth perils of G7 summit: Domestic politicking and the Russian question are upsetting Tokyo's plans JAPAN IS desperately trying to defend the centrepiece of its political year, the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations due to be held in July. The summit is supposed to be a meticulously planned display of Japan's ability to command a larger role in international affairs. In the absence of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, the G7 is Japan's best hope of acquiring such a role. But Japanese diplomacy will be tested to the full if the summit is to mark a smooth beginning for Japan's wider role. A complicating factor is Japanese domestic politics. Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, is in failing health and had to go into hospital after a recent trip to the US. Mr Watanabe wants to use a carefully managed summit as a launch pad for his last attempt to become prime minister, replacing Mr Kiichi Miyazawa in Liberal Democratic party leadership elections in the autumn. The summit was always likely to be tricky because Japan is renegotiating its relationship with the US, which has guided its foreign policy for four decades. Japan's growing trade surplus will provoke further calls from the Clinton administration for a stimulus to the Japanese economy to boost demand for imports as well as measures to open up Japanese markets. Mr Miyazawa will visit Washington next month to mollify the Clinton team with an outline economic package. But that will be just the start of potentially fractious trade negotiations which could cast a shadow over the summit. As a senior diplomat put it: 'There is a crunch coming with the US on trade and we better wake up to that fact.' However, in the past two weeks the mounting Russian political crisis has threatened to wreck all of Tokyo's carefully laid summit plans. Tokyo's deeply ingrained sense of protocol has been offended by European calls, led by the French, for an emergency summit on the Russian crisis. Mr Yohei Kono, the cabinet secretary, yesterday bluntly told Paris to stop trying to hijack the summit. It was Tokyo's job to issue invitations, he said. Even if Japan's summit partners accept that an April meeting of foreign and finance ministers will suffice, it still risks becoming isolated if the Russian crisis gathers momentum. Japan has conspicuously failed to echo German and US messages of support for Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The unresolved dispute with Russia over the four islands off the northern tip of Japan, known as the Kuriles or Northern Territories, is only one factor behind Japan's reluctance. Japanese officials argue that the Russian economy is in such a dire state that further aid would be like pouring money down the drain. They say half the aid Japan has so far provided has not been disbursed, largely because of Russian bureaucratic chaos. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, remarked: 'We should fully disburse the Dollars 24bn aid agreed by the G7 last year before we agree more aid.' Japan's Export-Import Bank said yesterday it was disbursing a Dollars 100m (Pounds 70.4m) soft loan to help Russia buy food and medicines from Japanese companies, fulfilling a pledge made in December 1990, after receiving letters of guarantee from Moscow. Mr Yeltsin's sudden decision to cancel a trip to Japan last autumn, but then to visit South Korea and India, has merely hardened opposition to further help to him among the elderly upper echelons of the LDP. But even younger officials believe Japan should avoid taking sides in political disputes in other countries. As an international official in the Finance Ministry put it: 'A message of support for Mr Yeltsin would not be welcomed by Mr Khasbulatov.' Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Russian parliament, is Mr Yeltsin's rival for power. Japan's diplomats, led by the highly skilled Mr Hisashi Owada, the head of the Foreign Ministry, who is in Washington for talks, are trying to paper over the emerging cracks. But if they fail Japan faces the prospect of hosting a summit at which it appears to be isolated. At the least, Japan's stance on Russia may further distance it from Europe at a time when trade tensions with the EC are rising. At the worst, Japan may be accused of fumbling during a crucial phase of the Russian crisis, mishandling a golden opportunity to take an international initiative on Russia which would be widely welcomed, and once again showing that it often only acts when foreign pressure on it becomes irresistible.</p>

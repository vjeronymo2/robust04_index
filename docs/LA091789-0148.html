			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE-COLORED RETROSPECTION  </P> <P> Reviewing Barbara Ehrenreich's new "Fear of Falling" (Book Review, Aug. 20),  David Rieff states: "In the 1950s, as Ehrenreich demonstrates brilliantly,  American writers, academics and politicians all came perilously close to  agreeing with the college newspaper editor who remarked in 1957 that "All the  problems are solved." Even Arthur Schlesinger Jr. asserted that the problems of  poverty had been largely eliminated though there remained "enclaves where the  underprivileged still can be found, as in the Southern Alleghenies or the rural  Deep South.' "  </P> <P> This is a joke. No matter how many fantasy pronouncements were made at the time  -- or now in retrospect -- the fact is that this country faced an economic  recession in the late '50s when unemployment climbed above the "dangerous" 6%  mark . . and not just in the Alleghenies or the Deep South. Don't take my word  for it; just check the records.  </P> <P> Explanation for this schism is simple. Economists -- whether their names are  Ehrenreich, Schlesinger, Greenspan or Volcker -- all inhabit a different  planet, breathe different air, than do the rest of us. They're no more reliable  today than were their predecessors 60 years ago who preached that "The business  of America is business" and that prosperity was here to stay.  </P> <P> DAVID R.

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Books: Tales old and new pop up with pictures - Children as in life - the best ideas are often the simplest ones, striking the reader with the force of inevitability. The First Christmas (Frances Lincoln, Pounds 9.99) falls into this category, a picture book for the very young which brings together some of the great biblical paintings of the Renaissance from London's National Gallery and carefully chosen texts from the authorised version of the Old and New Testaments. It is a marvellous way of introducing great art - and the Christmas story - to young children. Other outstanding picture books of the autumn include The Story of the Creation (Orchard Books, Pounds 8.99) by Jane Ray, which is full of this exhilarating artist's luminous colour and primitive stylisations of birds and animals; Puss in Boots (Little, Brown, Pounds 8.99), retold by Lincoln Kirstein, one of the founders of the New York City Ballet, and illustrated with great panache and theatricality by Alain Vaes, a set-and-costume designer for that same company. For slightly older children, though still published in lavish picture-book format, there is an excellent re-telling by Vivian Werner of the story of the ballet Petroushka (Victor Gollancz, Pounds 9.95), illustrated by John Collier, one of America's most talented young illustrators. Cinderella and the Hot Air Balloon (Frances Lincoln, Pounds 7.99) by Ann Jungman is a racy, updated version of the Cinderella story illustrated with brio by Raymond Eyto, a young artist who, having absorbed many influences, past and present, is now beginning to look very visually distinctive indeed. The majority of pop-up books scarcely fall into the category of books at all, but there are a couple of outstanding examples this autumn that deserve a mention. The ever-inventive publishers of Winnie-the-Pooh have produced an excellent Winnie-the-Pooh Pop-up Theatre Book, (Methuen, Pounds 12.99) which manages to provide a toy theatre on every spread (together with moving characters) and a tantalising envelope at the back which opens to reveal free-standing figures that can be deployed at will or whim. And, for those parents who cannot resist the pressure from beneath to purchase Thomas the Tank Engine titles, there is a splendidly inventive piece of cardboard engineering entitled Thomas's Big Railway Pop-up Book (Heinemann, Pounds 9.99). The best of the traditional story collections for children of four and above is The Kingfisher Treasury of Stories for Children (Kingfisher, Pounds 12.99), edited by Edward and Nancy Blishen, which appeals by its excellent selection of stories, many of them written by such well-known writers as Arthur Ransome, James Reeves and Margaret Mahy, its generous format and simple though very appealing colour illustrations throughout. An intriguing variant upon old themes is provided in The Cloth of Dreams (Little, Brown Pounds 12.99), a collection of new fairy tales for young children. James Mayhew's lavish illustrations almost drown the text in colour. Children of five and above who are beginning to read on their own will enjoy some of the new titles from Hamish Hamilton's Cartwheels series: Goodnight, Monster by Carolyn Dinan, Mrs Simkin and the Groovy Old Gramophone by Linda Allen and SOS for Rita by Hilda Offen, all at Pounds 4.99. The majority of books published in series of this kind tend to be formulaic; Cartwheels manage to rise above that sort of thing. Children who are ready for the novel proper and who have moved beyond the need to be seduced by illustrations ought to sample that veteran storyteller Rumer Godden, whose new novel, Listen to the Nightingale (Macmillan Pounds 9.99) about a little girl who has twin yearnings to succeed at becoming a ballerina and to own a King Charles Spaniel almost overwhelm her. Other books highly recommended for the eight to 10 age group are The Puffin Book of Funny Stories (Viking, Pounds 9.99), edited by Helen Cresswell; an excellent (or 'thoroughbred' as the publisher describes it) anthology of horsey stories called, with maximum inventiveness, Horse and Pony Stories edited by Christine Pullein-Thompson (Kingfisher, Pounds 7.99); and Hands Off Our School] by Joan Lingard (Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 8.99), a novel which describes the fight to save a little Highlands school from closure. Older readers with a sophisticated taste for England's largely mythical past should read Merlin Dreams by Peter Dickinson (Gollancz, Pounds 7.99), a very compelling rehash of the Merlin legend, interwoven with medieval fantasy and much Celtic embroidery. Kids in pursuit of what it feels like to be an American teenager will enjoy Bingo Brown's Guide to Romance by Betsy Byars (Bodley Head, Pounds 7.99). And finally, for all those adults who wish to cure an itch to know what the great fairy tales were like in their first English versions - before, that is, they were bowdlerised and sentimentalised by the Victorians - should buy a copy a a great classic of children's literature that has just been reissued, The Classic Fairy Tales, researched and presented by Iona and Peter Opie (Oxford, Pounds 17.95). The pictures alone will give the browser a potted history of English children's book illustration.</p>

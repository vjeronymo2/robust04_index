			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Upjohn awaits Halcion rulings UPJOHN, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company, should soon know the fate of its Halcion sleeping pill. The company's final appeal of the drug's ban in the UK will be heard today. In the US, the advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to make its recommendations on the drug next week. When Halcion was first banned in the UK in October following charges that the drug was unsafe and caused memory loss and depression, the ensuing furore led to extensive re-labeling in the US and bans in some other countries. Sales of Halcion, which was once the most popular sleeping pill in the world, plunged 39 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Although the UK is a small market for Halcion, there is some concern that if the drug is not reinstated in the UK, other European countries will also ban Halcion. The final UK verdict is expected by mid-June. In the US, it is widely expected that the FDA advisory panel will recommend that lower doses of Halcion remain on the market. In November, the FDA approved a new package insert and smaller packaging of Halcion in addition to changes in labelling. Upjohn has vigorously denied that there were safety problems with the drug, when it is used as directed. The company has said it welcomed the FDA's review as a chance to show, in a scientific setting, that Halcion was safe and effective. Even if Halcion receives favourable decisions in the US and the UK, some analysts believe that the damage to its reputation, and to sales, may be irreparable. On Wall Street, shares in Upjohn slid Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 at mid-day.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / MoD wants reliability and flexibility on a tight budget RELIABILITY, flexibility and maintenance are the themes of the defence white paper as the Ministry of Defence stretches resources to meet commitments. They are part of what Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, writes in his introduction is 'a new and fundamental analysis of the way in which defence assets are, and will need to be, employed'. The starting point for this analysis is the three roles to be played by the UK's defence forces: Protection of territory. This ranges from patrolling territorial waters and the streets of Northern Ireland to maintaining a nuclear capability. Membership of Nato. This is to ensure against external threats to the UK and its allies. Promotion of wider interests. These include support for Nato, the Western European Union and United Nations operations in the former Yugoslavia. Each of these roles is then allocated personnel, equipment and budgets for the next three years on the premise that 'the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union now belong to history'. The paper says the result is a number of adjustments, both enhancement and reductions to force levels. 'The Navy's tasks can therefore be met by a force of 12 active submarines rather than the 16 previously planned. We have therefore decided to withdraw the Upholder Class of conventional submarine from service by 1995.' It adds: 'Project definition studies continue for the replacement of the assault ships Fearless and Intrepid, and we plan to invite tenders for the refurbishment programme for the landing ship logistic Sir Bedivere shortly.' Nuclear plans are practically unchanged 'to take account of the large nuclear arsenal Russia will retain even after the implementation of Start (Strategic Arms Reductions Talks) agreements'. Each Trident submarine will initially carry no more than 128 Warheads,' the paper says, although it says the figure may be reduced later. The service life of the WE177 free-fall bomb is being extended 'well into the next century' and a decision on its replacement postponed. There is a reduction in equipment levels in the Royal Air Force. 'With effect from 1 April 1994, a force of 100 Tornado F3 fighters will be fully capable of defending the United Kingdom's airspace and meeting our commitment to NATO's reaction forces - a reduction of 13 aircraft.' These will be reorganised into six squadrons rather than the present seven. The disappearance of the Warsaw Pact threat reduces the likelihood of bomber attack. Therefore 'there is no near-term requirement for a medium-range surface to air missile (MSAM).' The missile ws a Pounds 500m-plus contract for which British companies had tendered. But RAF transport aircraft and support helicopters receive promises of orders. 'Substantial further investment in these areas is planned. This includes the rolling replacement or refurbishment of about half the RAF's Hercules fleet. There is a need to procure additional support helicopters.' The Pounds 32bn Eurofighter 2000 project is regarded as 'keystone' of the RAF's future capability, although the future of the Tornado GR1 is less clear as the government continues to 'consider options for upgrading the Tornado GR1 aircraft with a mid-life update which will enhance their operational capability and allow their continued operation well into the next century'. Opponents of the abolition of some Army regiments received some good news. 'The previously announced amalgamations of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers, and of the Cheshire Regiment and the Staffordshire Regiment, will not proceed.' The reversal of the decisions to amalgamate these two regiments was made possible by 'reorganisation and efficiency measures (to) release a further 2,000 personnel'. But there are cuts in Army equipment. 'An indirect fire anti-armour missile should be provided through the procurement of an air-launched weapon for the RAF. This means that the United Kingdom will withdraw from the collaborative programme to develop a ground-launched version of such a weapon (MLRS III).' The effect of these changes will be 'more mobile, flexible armed forces. A central feature of all new programmes is increased emphasis on reliability and maintainability'. The paper adds that the cut in defence spending to 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product by 1995-96 leaves spending above the Nato average.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                 HOW THE MAIN FORCES COULD LINE UP  ------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Actual    Options                                      level       for      Current                                       1990     change      plan  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Royal Navy  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Nuclear-powered submarines             14         12        12 Conventionally-powered submarines      10          4         0* Destroyers/frigates                    44   About 40  About 35 Mine warfare                           38         34        25**  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Army  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Infantry battalions                    55         38***     40***  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Royal Air Force  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Tornado F3                             92        122       100 Hawk****                               72         52        50 E-3 Sentry (Awacs)                      0*****     7         6 Transport &amp; tanker aircraft            94         93        90  ------------------------------------------------------------------ *     Future of Upholder under consideration **    MCMV number will fall below this figure for a period       following the pay-off or redeployment of Ton &amp; River Class       minesweepers &amp; until new vessels come into service ***   After withdrawal from Hong Kong in 1997 ****  Aircraft in Air Defence role only ***** Successor to Shakleton in early warning role  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

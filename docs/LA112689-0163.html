			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FAN WHO WAS HIT BY FOUL BALL WINS LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Delbert Yates Jr. won a rare injury lawsuit against a baseball team when a Cook  County Circuit Court jury awarded him $67,500 for being hit in the eye by a  foul ball off the bat of the Chicago Cubs' Leon Durham in 1983.  </P> <P> The case of Yates, a 10-year-old from Valparaiso, Ind., revived the question of  how far a baseball club should go to protect fans.  </P> <P> "I'm happy about the whole thing because other people got injuries from foul  balls and nobody got anything out of it before," said Yates, now 16.  </P> <P> The boy's attorney, Mario Cirignani, said it is the first verdict of its kind  against a Chicago major league baseball team. He was seeking $75,000 in  damages.  </P> <P> Cub attorney William Cremer said the club would appeal the verdict.  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: The case for maintaining the D-Mark/franc parity - A view from France / Personal View At a time when the French currency is experiencing a new wave of weakness and the commitment to the European exchange rate mechanism is under question, it is useful to go back to both economic and political fundamentals. These fundamentals greatly support the maintenance of the current parity with the D-Mark. First, the French commitment to low inflation results from more than just the unavoidable consequence of a commitment to European construction, and removing the link with the D-Mark would be widely interpreted as a renunciation of this low inflation policy. Indeed, the French economy experienced, in the late seventies and early eighties, the absence of a trade-off between inflation and unemployment and the need for low inflation as a pre-condition to sustainable growth and job creation. Breaking the link with the best-managed currency over the last 40 years would partly mean giving up once again the fight against inflation, and would rapidly have economic costs, but also political costs. If inflation is not a cause for street demonstrations, the French are now used to price stability, and the prospect of an end to this stability in the context of a currency devaluation and worst compensation for savings would undoubtedly hit a large share of the population. Whatever the gravity of the unemployment problem, few of those people would be convinced that the losses they would endure were necessary to improve the job picture, and they would be right in thinking that way. Of course, French unemployment remains high and will continue to grow, hitting more than 12 per cent of the workforce at the end of this year. But core unemployment is mainly due to labour market rigidities, and monetary easing would be of little help in reducing it. What is needed are structural measures, which can be implemented and acted on slowly. The government began tackling the problem by reducing employers' social contributions on less skilled jobs and limiting the rise in the minimum wage to the minimum increase. The government's relative prudence so far in this respect, due to political constraints, may well be regretted. Second, France is not in a bad competitive position, as the records of its external balance tend to show, although it is, to some extent, helped by the contraction in internal demand. Since the last realignment in the ERM in January 1987, the competitive position vis-a-vis Germany has improved, especially if unitary wage costs are considered. Global competitiveness was naturally hit by the devaluations of the pound, the lira and the peseta (which together amount to roughly 20 to 25 per cent of France's competitors), but part of these moves were just a correction of overvaluations of these currencies over the last five years. Moreover, the impact of such devaluations is more or less offset by the rise of the dollar and the yen. Even if a depreciation of the franc would stimulate exports and contain imports, it is not the key to the present problems facing the French economy, which are a lack of confidence and excessive precautionary savings. France's success in curbing inflation over the last ten years has potentially led the EMS to ('two-anchor') equilibrium, as the D-Mark keeps the benefit of the long-term credibility of price stability the Bundesbank has built, even if Germany's latest performance is worse than that of France. The 'two-anchor' situation means that in the long run depreciations of one currency against the other are both equally likely and unlikely. As a result, interest rate premiums should disappear as the expected returns in assets of both countries should not be affected by foreseeable moves in exchange rates. However, such a situation may well prove an unstable equilibrium in the short term, in the absence of interest rate spreads. This disequilibrium will periodically put into question both the franc and D-Mark currencies on an alternate basis, and will be sustained by news of relatively little actual significance. In addition, this lack of stability is encouraged by the ease and inexpensive cost of switching from one currency to the other. Should progress be made on the future merger of currencies, we would be more comfortable to predict a lasting stability. A renewed prospect for monetary union, and a more concrete indication of the path to it, would help stabilise an otherwise weak equilibrium. This would require political progress. But even in its absence, the case for ending the ERM link is supported neither by economic nor political reasons.</p>

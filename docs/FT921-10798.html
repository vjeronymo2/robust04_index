			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Courage sells Ruddles to Grolsch COURAGE, the UK arm of Foster's Brewing of Australia, has agreed to sell its Ruddles real ale brewery and brands to Grolsch, the Dutch lager brewer. Grolsch will fund the estimated Pounds 40m acquisition out of its own cash resources. Mr Michael Foster, Courage managing director, said yesterday that the deal, which is subject to approval by the Office of Fair Trading, offered 'compelling benefits' to all three parties. The acquisition is another step in Grolsch's strategy of building a strong portfolio of premium beer brands in north-west Europe. It bought the Wickuler group in Germany just over a year ago. UK sales of Grolsch lager rose 20 per cent last year to about 165,000 barrels. The addition of Ruddles, which had a turnover last year of Pounds 30m, will give the group a foothold in the growing real ale market and a platform for expansion. The UK's premium lager and ale markets are together bigger than the total Dutch beer market of 8m barrels. Grolsch will retain the Ruddles staff of 127 but has no plans to brew its lager at the Langham brewery in Leicestershire. The Dutch brewer will take over responsibility for sales and marketing of the Ruddles brands in the take-home trade but under a five-year, non-exclusive agreement, Courage will continue to sell the beer to pubs and clubs, which account for 70 per cent of volume sales. The agreement with Grolsch allows Courage to sort out its extensive ales portfolio. The group has been reviewing its brands - which include Courage, John Smith's, Webster's and Wilson - and was expected to stop brewing one or two of them. Courage is also discussing with Grolsch possible arrangements for distributing Foster's lager in the Netherlands. Grolsch has little experience in handling imports into the Netherlands and has shown reluctance to get involved, but Courage said yesterday that the Dutch brewer's distribution network could be 'a valuable bonus' for Foster's growth in Europe. Foster's main European markets are Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and Italy.</p>

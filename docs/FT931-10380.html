			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Big stick from Rabin gets in the way of the carrot: Hugh Carnegy on the battered hopes of an era of conciliation under an Israeli PM with a vision of peace LITTLE more than six months after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took office proclaiming a vision of at last achieving peace between Israel and its Arab foes, the self-inflicted crisis over Palestinian expulsions has battered hopes of his presiding over an era of conciliation. Instead, many Israeli supporters of Mr Rabin's centre-left coalition fear that what they regard as his dictatorial style of government has led the country into an impasse in the Middle East peace talks which will be hard to resolve. From the Palestinian point of view, the expulsions and accompanying violence, such as the seven killings in the occupied territories over the weekend, have compounded anger over what they say has been a sharp deterioration in human rights abuses by Israel under Mr Rabin, in particular in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians express increasing scepticism about carrying on negotiations for self-rule that have so far yielded no tangible improvement in their lot. Last week, complaints about Mr Rabin from the left wing of his own Labour party burst into the open when Mr Hagai Merom, a Labour MP, attacked him in the Knesset. Mr Merom said Mr Rabin failed to consult his ministers and then suppressed criticism, first over the December decision to expel 400 alleged Islamic militants, and then over a compromise deal with the US to allow 100 to return. 'Recently, Mr Prime Minister, there is fear in the cabinet. It is not good that there is fear in the cabinet. I don't think a minister who disagrees should be attacked, especially if he is the justice minister,' Mr Merom said. He was referring to Mr David Liba'i, the minister of justice, who was given just 10 minutes notice of the December deportation orders by Mr Rabin. When he tried to raise his objections at a subsequent cabinet meeting he was abruptly overruled by the prime minister. There is a certain disingenuous quality to this criticism as every minister except Mr Liba'i, including the cabinet's most noted doves, voted in favour of the deportations when Mr Rabin informed them of his intentions. But Mr Rabin's critics say the diplomatic and political mess precipitated by the expulsions was the consequence of his preference for keeping decision-making firmly within a small circle of aides in the prime minister's office and the military establishment. Mr Rabin holds the powerful defence portfolio as well as the premiership. An important part of the miscalculation was the assumption that, at least privately, leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation would welcome tough action against their Islamic fundamentalist rival, Hamas, and would not stay away from Middle East peace talks in protest. This ignored the deep Palestinian fear of arbitrary expulsion that transcends narrower affiliations with political factions. The mass deportations also hit the Palestinians at a time when resentment against Mr Rabin's tough security policies was already running high in the occupied territories. A former army chief of staff, Mr Rabin has long been an advocate of wielding a big stick in concert with the carrot of peace talks. According to figures from Betzelem, an Israeli human rights group, Palestinian fatalities rose by 20 per cent in the first six months of Mr Rabin's rule to 76 dead, compared with 63 in the first six months of the year. The number of children under 15 years of age killed almost trebled to 18. Two-thirds of all deaths did not involve circumstances in which soldiers' lives were in danger, also a sharp rise over the preceding period. 'I think we have witnessed the worst period since Rabin was defence minister (up to mid-1990). People are being killed at a very high rate, houses are now being destroyed by anti-tank missiles and hundreds of people have been deported,' says Mr Saeb Erekat, a member of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. 'This is having a great impact. People are blaming the peace process for Rabin's actions - saying the talks give him the cover to do these things.' Mr Rabin responds to such criticism with characteristic disdain towards Israeli doves and Palestinians alike. He insists he has not retreated from his commitment to make compromises for peace and is anxious for negotiations to resume. But he has made no secret of his regret that he has not been able, due to a combination of political rivalries and Knesset mathematics, to bring right-wing parties into the government to balance the left-liberal Meretz coalition partner. 'He definitely has mixed feelings about (his coalition), but he is caught in a situation which he can't change,' says Prof Avraham Diskin, head of the political science department at Hebrew University. 'Part of his behaviour towards the doves in the coalition is because of that.' The question now is whether Mr Rabin can pull his government through the expulsions crisis and, assuming the peace negotiations can be rebuilt, retain the domestic political authority required to make the concessions demanded of Israel. Prof Diskin thinks he can. 'However you look at it, the government is weakened. It cannot afford many more errors. But after all Labour is still the pivotal party. It can still go forward.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 7 Jun (AFP) -- The government of  provisional Haitian President Emile Jonassaint (not recognized  by the international community) protested "vigorously" today  against a statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton that Haiti is  located in the U.S. "backyard."    "Untimely statements such as this violate the cardinal and  universal principles of sovereignty and self-determination that  govern relations among nations," a communique issued by the  provisional government pointed out. "The sacred land of Haiti  is not and will never be the backyard of any other state, not  even of the world's most powerful," the document added.    After reminding that the use of force remains among the U.S.  options for restoring democracy in Haiti, Clinton pointed out on  19 May, the United States has "significant interests" in this  country, which is located "in the backyard" of the United  States. He also commented on the problem of the Haitian refugees  and on drug trafficking.</p>

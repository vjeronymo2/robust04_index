			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>   [Text] The failure of shareholders to make the capital  investments required to undertake new projects and expand  others, and the management's inability to make the necessary  corrections to adapt to new market conditions are the main  causes of the deep crisis that has the basic enterprises in the  Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana (CVG) holding company on the  verge of collapse.    This assessment can be deduced from the report by an ad hoc  congressional committee that looked into the financial  statements of the enterprises from 1987 to 1992. The committee  was chaired by Deputy Ramon Jose Medina, who was accompanied by  Abdon Vivas Teran (the current minister president of the FIV  [Venezuelan Investment Fund]), Gustavo Marquez, Freddy Lepage,  Rafael Rodriguez Acosta, Amarilis Valor, Ildemaro Martinez, and  Margot Siso.    The study, which focused on the aluminum and iron and steel  industries, concluded that the CVG enterprises are in critical  condition, some of them technically bankrupt, such as Alcasa,  with liabilities more than double their assets.  <H5>  Properly Planned Privatization </H5>   The drafters of the report evaluate each of the six  enterprises in the aluminum and iron and steel industries  separately but offer overall conclusions and recommendations  that are valid for them all.    They blame the CVG, as the agency that promotes the region's  industrial development and as a major shareholder in the  enterprises, for having spurred new projects and expanded  existing ones without the capital investments by shareholders  needed to complete them.    Most of the time these funds were not forthcoming, according  to one of the conclusions, and other times they arrived  belatedly. As a result, the enterprises had to resort urgently  to short- and long-term borrowing, which in turn has meant huge  financial costs for them, with the resulting damage to the  industries' capital resources.  <H5>  Aluminum Sector in Danger </H5>   The report notes that the enterprises in the aluminum sector  are in a critical, perilous condition owing to the steady  decline in international prices, which has seriously disrupted  their operations. This, along with the failure to recognize the  industries' external debts and the sharp rise in international  interest rates, explains the magnitude of the crisis.    Maintaining operating efficiency until 1989 and closing down  inefficient, obsolete production lines were necessary steps.  Today they are indispensable.    In another regard, the report says that now that the  government has capitalized 60 percent of the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron  and Steelworks] debt, the iron and steel sector is in less  danger and its financial indices reflect reasonably good  performance; as a result, its problems are altogether manageable.    In conclusion, it states that privatization should not be  viewed dogmatically, arguing that although it is not a panacea  for the problems of the CVG enterprises, it should not be  regarded as harmful to the national interest either.  <H5>  Alcasa [Caroni Aluminum, Inc.] </H5>   This enterprise has structural problems, as reflected in the  fact that its manufacturing costs stand at some 18.06 billion  bolivars while its sales are around 17.6 billion.    It also faces a serious insolvency problem, as it has a  working capital deficit of 21.1 billion bolivars, which is  equivalent to more than 14 months of sales.    This enterprise, the report finds, is technically bankrupt  unless shareholders give it fresh infusions of investment  capital. In practice, Alcasa's creditors own it, and unless an  estimated $300 million in investments is forthcoming, the best  option is to close it down.  <H5>  Venalum [Aluminum Company of Venezuela, Inc.] </H5>   Venalum also has structural problems, as its manufacturing  costs stand at 97.3 bolivars for every 100 in sales.    Its debt amounts to 44.6 billion bolivars, with assets of  63.9 billion, a ratio of 0.7 to 1, which can be regarded as very  sound financially.  <H5>  Interalumina </H5>   Its manufacturing costs were equivalent to 83 percent of  costs in 1992, a very high ratio (it should not be more than 70  percent).    The enterprise is reasonably solvent, with working capital  of  around 7.7 billion bolivars, although the reducers have a 15  billion bolivar debt that they would seem unable to pay back in  the short run.  <H5>  Bauxiven [Venezuelan Bauxite, Inc.] </H5>   As of December 1992 this project required 23 billion in  investments, and only 4.5 billion was forthcoming. As a result,  it is beginning operations with a heavy financial burden and a  high indebtedness index.    It is failing to comply with the IDB and FIV financing  agreements.  <H5>  SIDOR </H5>   Its manufacturing costs have remained very high, reaching 90  percent of sales in 1992.    Its current ratio during the years under study can be  considered reasonable, and its working capital as of the end of  1992 was 27.5 billion bolivars.    The government's capitalization of its debt obviously  improved its debt ratio.  <H5>  Ferrominera </H5>   Its manufacturing costs rose from 50 to 60 percent of sales.  This means that cutbacks have to be made in order to reverse the  trend back to 40 percent, which would be acceptable for this  mining firm.    Its debt ratio stood at 2.69 in 1992, and the enterprise's  current ratio is slightly worse.</p>

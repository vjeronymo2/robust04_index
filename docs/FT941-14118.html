			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Carpetright rises to Pounds 5.51m - Market share advances from 6% at flotation to 9% and 20% is seen Carpetright, the retailer floated by Sir Phil Harris last year, reported interim profits of Pounds 5.51m in the 26 weeks to October 30, up from about Pounds 3m in the comparable 26 weeks of 1992 and Pounds 3.4m in the 28 weeks to November 14. The shares, which were floated at 148p, yesterday fell 7p to 270p. Sir Phil put the sharp rise in profits down to an increase in market share from about 6 per cent at the time of the float last June to about 9 per cent now, combined with a fast rate of new store openings. Sales through comparable stores had risen by 19 per cent even though the carpet market was dull, falling by an estimated 5 per cent. Carpetright's prices were 2 per cent or 3 per cent lower than a year ago, as the benefit of deals with suppliers was passed on to customers. Group turnover was Pounds 50.5m in the half year, compared with about Pounds 35m last time. The rise in volume led to an increase in net margins from 8.4 per cent to 10.4 per cent, while gross margins were unchanged at about 45 per cent. An interim dividend of 2.7p is declared, with earnings per share at 4.66p. Sir Phil said the split between interim and final would be 40:60. He was 'quite satisfied' with current trading, sales and profits in the January sales being above budget. He said the recently announced merger of Allied and Carpetland would allow Carpetright to increase its target of stores in the UK from 200 to 240. However, he said the faster than expected rate of opening stores, up from an annual 20-25 to 30-35, meant that the target would be reached over the same three year period. By then he expected to have about 20 per cent of the UK carpet market. Carpetright opened 13 stores in the first half taking the total to 127. By the financial year end there should be 147 stores. After the proceeds of the flotation were used to repay the preference shares, the group increased its cash from Pounds 7.99m in the May 1 balance sheet to Pounds 15.6m at October 30. Interest received was Pounds 264,000 in the half year. Sir Phil said eventually Carpetright would like to buy the freeholds of its shops, but these were currently too expensive. However, it planned to invest the cash in paying suppliers earlier in return for a discount. This would earn much more than keeping the cash in the bank, he said.</p>

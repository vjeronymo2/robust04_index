			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Scalfaro forces change in budget President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has forced the Berlusconi government to make two embarrassing last minute changes in the 1995 budget, affecting the Rai state broadcasting organisation and reform of pensions. In so doing Mr Scalfaro has once again been obliged to use his limited authority as ultimate guarantor of the constitution to correct the behaviour of the inexperienced five-month-old right-wing coalition. Yesterday, Mr Gianni Letta, head of the prime minister's office, sought to play down the incident saying: 'Too much weight has been given to the president's intervention. It was merely a procedural observation.' However, this contradicted Mr Scalfaro's own view of events. Although the budget was approved by the cabinet on Wednesday after an all-night session, the details were not available until late Friday. Indeed, the president complained he had only been given the complex and voluminous budget documentation to sign shortly before the September 30 midnight deadline. But he had already been made aware of budget proposals to raise the annual fee paid by the Rai from L40bn (Pounds 16m) in 1994 to L160bn in 1995. Although this effectively restored to 1993 levels the fee it paid for use of three television channels, it threatened to undermine the organisation's already parlous finances. The move also highlighted the discrepancy between the L1.2bn annual concession fee paid by the three channels of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest company which was negotiated as part of the late eighties political deal allowing the media magnate to dominate commercial television. On his own admission President Scalfaro had 'several' telephone conversations with Mr Berlusconi pointing out the measures would contribute to the Rai's financial ruin and appeared to be favouring his own networks. Mr Berlusconi then agreed to withdraw the proposal - portraying the proposal over the weekend as an unfortunate oversight. It is the second time in two months Mr Scalfaro has checked the government's hand over the Rai in the belief its behaviour was too partisan. The row also reflects the near continuous tension between the head of state and Mr Berlusconi over the latter's unresolved conflict of interest with his ownership of Fininvest. The other change concerned the way the government was seeking to present controversial reform of the state pensions system in the budget. The president refused to sign the budget until certain parts of the decree on pension reform were separated from the budget itself. He successfully argued pension reform required full parliamentary debate and therefore should not be subject to the automatic time limit of budget legislation that closes on December 31. As a result, several elements of longer term reform in the pensions system need not now be approved by parliament this year. The main provisions covered by this longer timetable are the harmonisation of the big differences in private and public sector pension practices; the separation of expenditure on pensions from that on general welfare payments; and new rules governing the operation of pension funds. The changes will not itself affect the 1995 budget numbers since the savings will come in freezes on early retirement benefits and indexed payments plus changes in the structure of pensions accruals. But it could encourage parliament to scrutinise pension reform more closely as well as play to the sensitivities of the trade unions who have called a general strike on October 14 against the budget.</p>

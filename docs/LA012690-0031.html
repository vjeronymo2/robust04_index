			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> TREASURY BONDS SLUMP AGAIN, WIPE OUT RALLY  </P> <P> Prices of Treasury bonds sagged again Thursday, reversing course at midday in a  drop that erased a modest rally.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which has fallen more than a point over  the past two sessions, lost another 9/16 point, or just over $5 for every  $1,000 in face value. It had been up more than 1/4 point in the morning.  </P> <P> Its yield, which rises when prices fall, advanced to 8.46% from 8.40% late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Bond traders had said the early rally effort was a reaction to the recent  selloff and didn't imply any fundamental improvement in market sentiment.  </P> <P> The market has been depressed all week by worries that U.S. investments may be  losing their allure for foreigners, particularly the Japanese. Rising interest  rates abroad are making foreign investments more attractive.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.188%, down from 8.375 late Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Is Mostly Lower; Gold Mixed  </P> <P> The dollar closed mostly lower as a variety of rumors heightened trader fears  about foreign investment in the United States. Gold prices were mixed.  </P> <P> The U.S. currency suffered its largest drop against the Japanese yen after  reports that Japanese institutional investors were selling large amounts of  dollars, said Robert Ryan, senior trader at Bank of New York Co.  </P> <P> Reports that the Federal Reserve was selling dollars against the yen also took  a toll, Ryan said.  </P> <P> The dollar slumped to 143.925 yen in New York from late Wednesday's 145.715  yen. In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar fell 0.50 yen to 145.30 yen, and in  London, it was quoted late in the day at 144.40 yen.  </P> <P> Ryan said the dollar was also hurt by a report that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan  was calling for a withholding tax on foreigners investing in the United States.  Such a move would discourage foreign investment in this country, and in turn,  foreign demand for dollars.  </P> <P> In fact, Greenspan cautioned Congress in testimony Thursday against placing any  new impediments on foreign investment, saying it would force interest rates  higher and "probably curb economic activity."  </P> <P> In London, the British pound rose to $1.6570 from $1.6555 late Wednesday. In  later New York dealings, the pound rose to $1.6600 from $1.65255.  </P> <P> Gold prices were mixed in New York. On the Commodity Exchange, an ounce of gold  fell $1.20 to $416, but Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $417 an  ounce, up 40 cents from Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Oil Prices Rally on Storm Fears  </P> <P> Oil prices rallied on fears that the worst storm to hit Britain since a 1987  hurricane may disrupt the flow of North Sea oil.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, wheat, corn and oat futures prices sank; sugar  futures were up sharply; pork bellies soared while livestock futures were  mixed, and precious metals were mixed.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange still  managed to close with a gain of 65 cents in the March contract, to $22.24 a  barrel.  </P> <P> February unleaded gasoline finished 1.22 cents higher at 60.60 cents per  gallon, and February heating oil regained some of its recent steep losses to  end 0.20 cent higher at 59.77 cents.  </P> <P> Wheat futures prices sank to four-month lows on the Chicago Board of Trade and  soybean futures reached their lowest levels since mid-October in a selloff  linked to wetter weather and slack demand for feed grains both domestically and  abroad.  </P> <P> Wheat futures settled 2 to 6 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in  March down 6 cents at $3.855 a bushel, the lowest settlement of a near-month  wheat contract since Sept. 20.  </P> <P> Soybeans ended 7.50 to 8.25 cents lower, with March down 7.75 cents at $5.5825  a bushel, the lowest daily settlement for near-month soybeans since Oct. 17.  </P> <P> Corn futures settled 1.25 to 2.25 cents lower, with March at $2.3925 a bushel;  oats were unchanged to 2 cents lower, with March at $1.37 a bushel.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D6  </P></p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate disclosure The UK debate on corporate disclosure is producing some welcome results. Not only does the proliferation of Christmas trading statements from retailers suggest the days are gone when the first analyst to reach the finance director got the bargain. Yesterday also brought an announcement from Thorn EMI that it is to start making quarterly trading statements. These will include a basic profit and loss account, probably with some divisional and geographic breakdown, though there will be no balance sheet. For the moment this seems a sensible compromise between the approach of those put off by the effort of disclosing full quarterly results and those anxious for more public disclosure. The case for more frequent statements has grown since LIG was censored by the stock exchange for warning investors selectively about a profits shortfall last year. Expectations are less likely to slip out of line with reality if companies are regularly in touch with the market. Thorn's approach certainly makes more sense than that of Inchcape which plans to hold collective analysts meetings ahead of its closed period, but only to discuss information already in the public domain. Inchcape does not expect to disclose any thing which would require a public statement. Thorn also intends to put figures on the table. The company's management accounting system means they can be assembled with minimal trouble. This underlines the need for companies to make more meaningful information available even if the tighter climate prevents them from disclosing it selectively. Thorn may need to develop its approach further, though. It only creates confusion about closed periods if information, basically available now to management, is not disclosed till the third week in February.</p>

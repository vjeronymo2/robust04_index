			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan leads way with 5% surge to 30-month high After the modest gains posted on Wednesday, Japanese share prices advanced further on small-lot buys from investment trust managers to end the final half-day session of 1993 in positive territory, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues gained 145.21 to settled at 17,417.24, its intraday peak, and 2.9 per cent higher over the year, after opening at the day's low of 17,309.23. The session's close represents the first time for three years that the key barometer has settled above the year-earlier level. The Topix index of all first section issues rose 10.04 to 1,439.31, while in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.27 to 1,188.45. With most stock market investors away for the winter holiday, trading volume languished at an estimated 120m shares, compared with Wednesday's final 215m. Advances led declines by 616 to 278, with 200 issues unchanged. Japanese brokers say that investors are relieved, judging that 1993 was the fourth straight year of a bear market and that it is now behind them. An immediate recovery for equity prices, they add, is unlikely, but hopes exist for a gradual rise in the Nikkei average in the first quarter of 1994, and for slight improvements in the overall domestic economy before the summer. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will still have a difficult time convincing stock market participants that 1994 will be a period of major gains during his traditional pep talk on the first day of trading. All available evidence suggests that there is no compelling reason for institutional and private investors to enter the market aggressively. The outlook for corporate earnings remains bleak, the domestic economy has dipped deeper into a slump, as revealed by the recent 2.8 per cent rise in unemployment, the worse figure in six years. And the Japanese government's steps to rescue the market may prove unsuccessful. The day's rise, however, did give a boost to some banking issues. Sumitomo Bank rose Y50 to Y1,950, Fuji Bank advanced Y40 to Y1,980 and the Industrial Bank of Japan climbed Y30 to Y2,830. Issues in the securities sector also settled higher. Nikko Securities rebounded Y20 to Y1,090, and Yamaichi Securities edged Y3 higher to Y595. Gains in gold prices, internationally, encouraged buying in non-ferrous issues. Sumitomo Metal Mining jumped Y24 to Y870, and Mitsui Mining and Smelting moved Y17 higher to Y398. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 136.25 higher to 19,221.72, in volume of 16.8m. Roundup The Pacific Rim remained in good heart, with further records set in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, Karachi, Bangkok and Jakarta. TAIWAN surged 5 per cent to a 30-month high on news that the economics minister, Chiang Pin-kung, had said the island should seek direct shipping links with China next year. The weighted index jumped 275.48 to 5,813.55, its highest finish since 5,900.70 on June 28, 1991. Turnover was a hectic TDollars 100.5bn against TDollars 83.0bn on Wednesday. HONG KONG overcame Wednesday's consolidation, surging 3.7 per cent to a fresh record on a new wave of Japanese and US buying. The Hang Seng index added 427.70 to 11,877.47, having peaked just short of the 12,000 level at an all-time intra-day high of 11,959.06. China's announcement that it would unify its exchange rates was also viewed as a long-term positive factor but it had little short-term effect. Turnover was a preliminary HKDollars 10.87bn against a final HKDollars 9.51bn on Wednesday. AUSTRALIA rose 1.3 per cent to a six-year high amid strong local and foreign demand in a market short of sellers. The All Ordinaries index closed 27.6 higher at 2,154.5, easily exceeding its previous post-1987 stock markets crash peak of 2,132.4 reached on November 1. KARACHI closed the year at a record high in a year-end buying spree which took the KSE 100-share index 20.50 higher to 2,164.26. BANGKOK was higher but off a morning peak as investors sold finance and brokerage shares to cash in profits before the long new year holidays. The SET index rose 14.22 to a record 1,682.85 after touching a high of 1,695.18 in early trade. NEW ZEALAND advanced 1.2 per cent in thin trade and the NZSE-40 index added 25.11 to 2,180.23, just 23 points short of its high for the year. SINGAPORE saw aggressive selling after three days on the upgrade and the Straits Times Industrials index dipped 36.24 points or 1.5 per cent from Wednesday's closing high, to 2,390.61. JAKARTA closed mixed, but still saw a final high although local investors took profits on the last trading day of 1993. The official index rose 0.88 to 588.77. KUALA LUMPUR underwent an early technical correction in response to recent sharp gains before bargain-hunting lifted the composite index from a day's low of 1,216.59 to finish 0.13 easier at 1,231.73. Gaming stocks were marked down in response to the imposition of higher gaming tax and betting and sweepstake duty from January 15.</p>

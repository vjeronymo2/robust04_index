			<p>BFN     [Text] Wiesbaden (DDP/ADN) -- Following the decision by  Schleswig-Holstein and Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse today decided  on a six-month deportation ban for Kurds. After the heads of  the state governments were unable to reach a joint solution last  night, Hesse Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (SPD) decided in  Wiesbaden to take this step. Kurdish offenders were to be  excluded from the deportation ban, the Hesse Interior Ministry  said.    The reason given by Guenther was that the situation of the  Kurds in Turkey had deteriorated to such an extent that no  responsibility could be assumed for the possible consequences of  deportation. Guenther said the efforts of the German Government  to make Turkey comply with human rights by means of a bilateral  agreement were increasing doubts that deportees were at present  dependent on the whim of government organs. Guenther called on  the Federal Government to exert pressure on the Turkish  Government to at last find a constructive, humanitarian solution  to the Kurdish problem in Turkey.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By C.L. Ou and Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Vienna, May 10 (CNA) -- Some 33.5 percent of all  power in Taiwan is generated by nuclear power plants, making  Taiwan the world's 12th largest user of nuclear power, according  to a report compiled by the International Atomic Energy agency  Tuesday [10 May].    The ratio put Taiwan behind Switzerland's 37.9 percent,  Bulgaria's 36.9 percent, and Spain's 36 percent, the report said.    Eight countries generate more than or nearly 50 percent of  their power with nuclear plants, including Lithuania (87.2  percent), France (77.7 percent), Belgium (58.9 percent),  Slovakia (53.6 percent), Hungary and Slovenia (43.3 percent),  Sweden (42 percent), and Korea (40.3 percent).    Meanwhile, the report said there are 18 countries in the  world whose nuclear power usage ratios surpassed 25 percent in  1993, including Taiwan, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany,  Japan, Britain, and Ukraine.    There are 430 operational nuclear power plants in the world  and 55 plants are under construction, the report said.    In 1993, nine new nuclear power plants began operations in  Canada, Mainland China, France, Japan, Russia, and the United  States.</p>

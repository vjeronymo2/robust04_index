			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Manila agrees terms to receive IMF loans THE Philippines yesterday agreed terms with the International Monetary Fund that should allow the resumption of a Dollars 900m (Pounds 503m) lending programme suspended last July when Manila failed to meet economic targets, writes Richard Gourlay in Manila. Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, said the two sides had agreed on a target for the central government's budget deficit which was the only unresolved issue from last week's IMF mission. Resumption of the programme is still dependent on the Philippines passing tougher revenue-raising measures. Only then will the IMF give its stamp of 'good housekeeping' on which a commercial bank debt rescheduling agreement and new international aid commitments depend. These measures, including the tightening of VAT legislation, have been passed by the House of Representatives but are yet to be approved by the Senate. They may have a rocky passage there as many of the incumbents are gearing up for elections in May. The government also has to push through with the second phase of a power price increase before the Dollars 400m remaining from the IMF facility can be drawn. The IMF agreed to allow a deficit of Pesos 9bn (Pounds 200m) this year compared to the Pesos 13bn Manila had sought and the Pesos 3.8bn the fund had targeted. The finance ministry hopes to have received the good housekeeping stamp by the end of February. The fund agreed the increase in order to meet additional spending demands around Mt Pinatubo, the volcano that erupted last year devastating parts of Luzon island, north of Manila. President Corazon Aquino also yesterday vetoed Senate proposals that would have limited the percentage of export earnings going to repay foreign debt.</p>

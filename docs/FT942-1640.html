			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Observer: Yankees out It's all change at the American University of Beirut where Richard Debs, the ex-New York Fed man and more recently Morgan Stanley hot-shot, has taken over as chairman of the board of trustees. The only problem is that Debs, plus his new vice-chairman, Occidental's Ray Irani, and Tom Morris, former chief executive of New York's Presbyterian Hospital, are not allowed to walk AUB's tree-lined squares. Three years after Lebanon's civil war, which brought bombs, killing and kidnapping to AUB, the state department still bars Americans from travelling to Beirut. 'I suspect we'll be able to go back in a year or so,' says Debs, who learnt his Arabic when he was a Fulbright Scholar in Cairo back in 1952. Until the state department decrees Lebanon safe, therefore, daily running of the oldest US institution in the Middle East remains in the hands of its now non-American staff.</p>

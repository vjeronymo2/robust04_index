			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Forte falls to Pounds 73m as hotels and restaurants feel the pinch FORTE, the hotels, contract catering and restaurants group, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 73m for the year ended January 31 1992, compared to Pounds 190m last time. Turnover rose 1 per cent to Pounds 2.6bn which, the company said, was wholly attributable to a 10 per cent sales growth in its contract catering business. A final dividend of 7.16p brings the total to an unchanged 9.91p. Earnings per share were 6p (18.8p), which meant dividend cover fell from 1.9 to 0.6 times. Trading profit in hotels fell 53 per cent to Pounds 75m on sales down 8 per cent to Pounds 835m. Profits from contract catering rose 18 per cent to Pounds 47m on sales up 10 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn. Forte said its business benefited from companies in the private sector attempting to reduce costs by bringing in contract caterers. Public sector work also rose with increased contracting out of catering in schools, hospitals and defence establishments. Profits from restaurants fell 15 per cent to Pounds 63m on sales down 1 per cent to Pounds 638m. Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wheelers had a difficult year, particularly in areas which rely on tourism for a large proportion of their income. Welcome Break motorway service areas were affected by a decline in traffic volumes. The Little Chef, Happy Eater and Harvester chains proved more resilient. The group said measures such as short-time working had saved Pounds 21m in variable costs. It had also made fixed-cost savings of Pounds 40m. Certain costs increased sharply, however. Business rates and the need to absorb increases in value added tax had cost about Pounds 25m in lost profit. Pre-tax profits at the Savoy Group for the year to end-December fell 78 per cent to Pounds 2.3m on turnover down 14 per cent to Pounds 79.2m. A tax credit of Pounds 2.7m arising from the writing-back of over-provisions for corporation tax in previous years and from a reduction in the provision for deferred taxation resulted in profits after tax of Pounds 5m (Pounds 8.2m). Earnings per A share fell to 17.5p (28.8p). The dividend is unchanged at 7p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- During its extraordinary  meeting to be held on 1 May, the Cuban parliament will study  recommendations made by workers to solve the problems affecting  the island's economy and people.    Ernesto Suarez, secretary of the National Assembly of the  People's Government, ANPP, today told GRANMA that the ANPP will  study the main topics discussed by the workers during the  so-called workers parliaments (approximately 800,000 meetings  attended by more than 3 million workers and which were held in  February and March).    Suarez said everyone understands that the ANPP will not  approve a capitalist-type "package of measures" aimed at solving  the country's problems. The ANPP secretary said the measures  adopted will be implemented gradually, as the government has  been doing since last year.    Ernesto Suarez said that even though the measures will be  implemented gradually, they will most probably represent some  sacrifice for everyone, but, Suarez stressed, no citizen will be  abandoned.    The ANPP will hold an extraordinary meeting to study and  approve work policies, ideas, guidelines, and plans to confront  the serious economic and financial problems Cuba is confronting.  These measures will be added to those already implemented.</p>

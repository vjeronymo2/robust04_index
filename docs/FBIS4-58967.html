			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with "Prime Minister" Haydar Abu-Bakr </F> al-'Attas, in Washington, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo; date not  given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Engineer al-'Attas: How do you view  developments in Yemen?    [Al-'Attas] It is regrettable to see such events taking  place  in Yemen. It is a war among brothers. Since the start of the  political crisis last year, we have repeatedly warned against  these events. We would like to emphasize that war is not the  proper option or the suitable way to remedy problems. War will  settle no issue; it will only spell destruction for the Yemeni  people, which will affect every citizen. During the political  dialogue, there has been an agreement in principle to define the  main points of consensus, not to resort to violence or take up  arms to tackle the existing problems, and to adopt political and  democratic dialogue as an alternative. Unfortunately, and  despite the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, the  brothers in Sanaa, particularly the leadership represented by  the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Reform Party, have  persistently prevaricated over this issue and avoided  implementing the Pledge and Accord Document. Instead, they  opted for military confrontation as an alternative to the  political and democratic dialogue. To enter a war is difficult.  To get out of it is even more difficult. War could break out  because of a thoughtless and hasty decision. But it is very  difficult to get out of it. The situation cannot be decided  militarily. There is indiscriminate bombardment by the brothers  in Sanaa. Perhaps you have seen on television villages,  children, and women being hit. I believe that serious action  must be taken to end the war and resume the dialogue to tackle  the problems facing Yemen.    [Al-Jundi] Engineer al-'Attas: Both sides, in the North and  South, have repeatedly voiced their support for Yemen's unity  and vowed not to give it up. Is the ongoing war between the  northern and southern troops for the sake of unity or is it a  war to end the unity?    [Al-'Attas] No war could be for the sake of unity. Military  action is always against unity, because it results in rifts and  problems and influences the political and moral elements that  sway the feelings of the masses. Thus we have stated that any  kind of military action is against unity and democratic  practices. Nobody is thinking of seceding; this is not on the  cards. The Pledge and Accord Document is the remedy that we  have reached after an extensive political dialogue. The  document remedies two basic points. The first is the current  problems, particularly the military and security problems, and  the second is the future of the regime and the state. But it is  clear that there was rejection of this document from the day it  was signed, despite the official signature on it and claims to  the contrary. All actions prove that they are against it. They  resorted to the military option by first striking at the 5th  Brigade in the area of [name indistinct] in February immediately  after the document was signed.    [Al-Jundi] Some observers say the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] started the political crisis in the first place, when Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid decided to stay in Aden. As a YSP  official, how do you see the issue?    [Al-'Attas] This is not true. The crisis really started from  the beginning of the unity, when the brothers in Sanaa  disregarded the unity agreements, the small issues agreed upon  to make this great Yemeni dream a reality. When these issues  were ignored and the model of the Yemeni Arab Republic [North  Yemen before unity] was imposed, the attempt to control  everything and keep everything centralized in Sanaa. [sentence  as heard].    [Al-Jundi] Some observers whisper that you, a prominent  official in the YSP, were in Washington when the war started and  that Salim Salih Muhammad, who is the YSP assistant secretary,  was in London, that is, both of you were out of Yemen. Is there  any significance in this?    [Al-'Attas] First, brother Salim Salih went on an official  mission to Arab countries and then stopped over in London. More  visits were scheduled on his program. He intends to follow the  program. As for me, I travelled abroad for treatment for acute  pain in my spinal cord, which affected my right leg and hand. I  attended the Cabinet meetings in Aden and in Ta'izz and took  part in the meetings of the dialogue committee while suffering  this extreme pain. Following the Ta'izz meetings, I left the  country on 12 April, that is, before the crisis broke out. On  27 April, the brothers in Sanaa decided to initiate a military  action when the president delivered a speech that day at the  (?al-Sab'in) Square, giving the signal to start the war. The  war started with a strike against the 3d Brigade, a southern  brigade, in the area of 'Imran. This was followed by an attack  against the Ba Suhayb Brigade in the area of (?Zamar). Despite  the efforts we exerted within the Cabinet, at every meeting we  faced problems obstructing the work of the Cabinet and  preventing it from making any decision to implement the Pledge  and Accord Document.    [Al-Jundi] After Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Yemeni  Defense Minister Haytham Qasim Tahir's dismissal, do you intend  to return to Sanaa or to Aden when you finish your medical  treatment in Washington? Will you take up your job as Yemeni  prime minister?    [Al-'Attas] First, the decisions made by parliament and the  president are invalid, unlawful, and have absolutely no basis.  This is because they disregarded the Pledge and Accord  Document, which represents the core of national consensus, as  well as everything else. Thus they are unconstitutional,  invalid, and null and void. The Constitution gives no one the  right to dismiss any person within the government. It gives  parliament the right to withdraw confidence from the government.  But this is not what parliament did.    [Al-Jundi] Parliament dismissed al-Bid.    [Al-'Attas] It had no right. There is nothing in the  Constitution that says parliament is entitled to dismiss people.  There is absolutely no clause in the Constitution that gives  parliament the right to dismiss any member of the Presidential  Council or government. Absolutely not. There is no such  provision. These decisions are illegitimate and secessionist.  They seek to consecrate the problem and the current military  situation and to militarize the state, the machine the Pledge  and Accord Document has tried to tackle. The document tried to  build a modern and civic state, disengage the state and the  military, and disengage the state and the tribes, so that a  modern state could be established with equal rights given to all  its citizens.    [Al-Jundi] We thank our guest Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-  'Attas on the line with us from Washington, where he is  receiving treatment. We thank him.    [Al-'Attas] Thank you very much.</p>

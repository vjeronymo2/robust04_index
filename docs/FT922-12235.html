			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (7): Highways to frustration - Transport is a problem in one of the US's most congested areas TRANSPORTATION and Seattle go hand in hand. The city, after all, has its origins as a port, servicing both the lumber business and the fishing industry. Today, its largest single employer is a manufacturer of aircraft. But familiarity breeds, if not contempt, a distinct lack of contentment. Talk to a Seattleite for any length of time, and comparisons with California inevitably crop up. Like many big Californian cities, Seattle is physically well-endowed, and - again like California - it has seen fairly explosive growth in recent times. What Seattleites seem to fear is that their city will develop all the debilitating urban problems which dog, say, Los Angeles. The result is a degree of overt 'protectionism' rarely seen in the US, coupled with a feverish desire to control development for several decades ahead. Nowhere does this paranoia surface more noticeably than over transportation issues. There is no doubt that the city has a physical problem. The downtown area, into which much of the daily commuter traffic feeds, is situated at the narrowest point of the isthmus, and the city is bounded by water on both sides. This natural handicap has been compounded by the fact that the inter-state highways - route 5 which runs north-south and the ubiquitous route 90 which divides the state east-west before going on to Boston - were laid down in fairly kamikaze fashion. They carelessly bisected communities and, to this day, produce ghastly interchange problems. (Locals have duly termed one particularly vicious portion of Interstate-5 passing through the city centre, 'the Mercer weave'). True, the traffic jams seem to pale in comparison with either New York or Los Angeles. Nevertheless, Seattle-Everett is usually ranked within the top half-dozen 'most-congested' areas in the US. Accordingly, given that for geographical and political reasons the supply of principal highways is probably fixed in the foreseeable future, efforts are being concentrated on 'demand' management. Most local planners stress that this should be seen in the context of Washington's 'growth management' strategy - legislation which was enacted in 1990, and which is designed to co-ordinate planning between different areas, and between land use and transportation. This broad backdrop is still evolving, and will continue to do so for many months ahead. Nevertheless, on the transport front specifically, some problems are pressing and initiatives have taken shape. One of the most prominent problems centres on car pooling. In itself, the idea is scarcely new - but Seattle is pushing the notion with rare ferocity. Last May, Washington's governor, Booth Gardner, signed into law a requirement that the most populated counties - including King, Pierce and Snohomish - develop trip reduction plans for single occupancy vehicles in conjunction with local employers. Employers must meet minimum goals for SOV (single occupancy vehicle) trip reduction set out in the legislation - namely 15 per cent by 1995, 25 per cent by 1997 and 35 per cent by 1999. This, of course, is easier said than done - and the practicalities of how such goals might be achieved and monitored at individual employer level are still being thrashed out. Less clear-cut is whether Seattle requires a new, comprehensive rapid transit system - and, if so, how much money should be devoted to such a project. At present, aside from road access, and a complex one-way street system within the downtown area, the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (METRO) operates fairly extensive bus-based services within the city and its suburbs. These range from waterfront streetcars to a free 'Transit' operation in the downtown area. The latter service makes use of a 1.3-mile tunnel under part of the city centre, and remains resolutely bus-oriented although rail lines were laid when the project was built. There is also a monorail operated by the City of Seattle, which links downtown with the Seattle Center. Nevertheless, given the transport constraints and the projected growth rates, planners have begun to focus on a major new rapid transit system in recent years. First thoughts centred on light-rail possibilities, a scheme which could have cost up to Dollars 11bn over three decades. This, under the 'Vision 2020' plan, would then be augmented by new 'high-occupancy' vehicle lanes on the highways for people car-pooling or riding buses, and an enlarged passenger ferry service. But this plan, in turn, has spurred vociferous debate over whether the money could be better spent, and whether part of Seattle's problem involves the lack of linkage between certain high-growth suburbs - which might invite different sorts of solutions. (Some planners note that the local transport problem is given an extra twist by the fact that Boeing is the largest employer in the city, and tends to move its staff to different production facilities as different aircraft get built. This, in turn, makes traffic flows somewhat unpredictable). So where does this leave the rapid transit scheme? The initial timetable suggested that the issue could come to a vote in late-1992, but that has certainly been pushed back. Some local observers believe that it may even be deferred beyond 1993. Looking beyond communications within the immediate area, issues are equally fraught. There has been much talk of 'bullet train' possibilities on the Vancouver-Seattle-Portland stretch of the West Coast. Again, while there is a good deal of travel between these points and many locals would like to see the amount of commuter air traffic reduced, the arguments are not clearcut. Critics point to the simple advisability of having a car in Vancouver and Portland - cities which are geographically spread - and note that the geography of the region would make construction of 'bullet track' a tough task. But contention over these issues pales in comparison with the furore of Seattle's air transportation facilities. Again, the region's growth coupled with some natural restrictions, have prompted fears that Sea-Tac Airport - operated by the Port of Seattle - could soon face a capacity crunch. At present, the airport handles more than 16m passengers a year. By 2000, runs the argument, that number could rise to 25m, and by 2020, 40m. If these forecasts are correct, capacity would be exhausted well before 2000. Advocates of expansion put their case another way, too. Flights in and out of the airport stood at around 355,000 in 1990, about 40 per cent being commuter flights. Once the figure tops 1,100 a day, bottlenecks tend to develop. At present, the average daily number is in the 900s. Just to compound the pessimists' worries, the two existing runways at Sec-Pac are parallel and close. This means that only one is usable in all weather conditions, while it is reckoned that 'poor' weather persists for about 45 per cent of the year. Accordingly, after years of angst, a preferred solution which has been proposed by the Puget Sound Air Transportation Committee, comprising three elements: The addition of a third, all-weather runway at Sea-Tac, by 2000; The use of an existing jet runway at Paine Field in Everett for commercial service by 2000, possibly making this the home for many of the commuter services; and The possible development of a smaller, 'reliever' airport in the southern Puget Sound area. Although the business community is broadly in favour of this plan, the public outcry has been angry and extensive. Objections range from the rational - suggesting that there are better alternatives - to the purely emotional. All, however, centre on fears about noise, pollution and secondary traffic problems which could flow from the plan.</p>

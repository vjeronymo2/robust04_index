			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets  staged a surprise strike exercise and gunfiring to invade the  North in the midst of electronic jamming. According to a  military source, the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets  staged a surprise strike exercise to invade the North in the  midst of electronic jamming on 31 March. F-15 fighter bombers,  FA-18 pursuit assault planes, EA-6 electronic jamming planes,  which arrived from overseas bases, and fighter planes under the  control of the U.S. Air Force occupying South Korea and the  puppet Air Force were committed on a large scale.    On the same day, electronic jamming planes, which hurled  into  the skies above Yongwol, Wonju, and Chunchon from a base in  Japan, caused electronic jamming in this area. Also, strike air  corps were called to frantically stage a surprise strike  exercise on the targets. Thus, a violent warlike atmosphere was  kicked up.    This war exercise was a commotion of playing with fire aimed  at enhancing the actual combat capabilities for a cooperative  surprise strike to invade the North through the electronic  jamming planes. In addition, the South Korean puppets were  running amuck in gunfiring and helicopter operation exercises at  the front line, right in front of our face.    On 31 March the puppet Army's large-caliber artillery groups  and heavily armed hooligans, who took firing positions  throughout the area of Naedae-ri and (Kwanu)-ri, Cholwon County,  South Korean Kangwon Province, and (Pangmok)-ri, Paju County,  and Majon-ri and Tanjung-ri, Yongchon County, Kyonggi Province,  kicked up a war frenzy by firing over 60 105mm shells and 1,000  large-caliber machine gun bullets near the Demilitarized Zone  along the Military Demarcation Line.    On the same day, the South Korean puppets deployed scores of  large-caliber guns around the area of Chupa-ri, Cholwon County,  South Korean Kangwon Province, and dragged in some 500 armed  hooligans into the area near Susan-ri, Inje County and  (Kangnae)-ri, Yonchon County. Also on this day, some 10 armed  helicopters and transport helicopters of the puppets were  running amok after being mobilized in the skies over Yonchon,  Pochon, and Cholwon, South Korean Kangwon Province, right in  front of our face, in support of ground attacks and airlifting  of war material.    At a time when the U.S. imperialists are applying  unreasonable pressure to implement nuclear inspections of our  Republic and are deploying, on a large scale, up-to-date weapons  to South Korea, what is becoming all the more serious is the  fact that all of these frenzy commotions of playing with fire by  the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets are driving the  situation of the Korean peninsula toward a dangerous phase.</p>

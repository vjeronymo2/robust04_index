			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Thirty thousand people packed a stadium in Minsk, capital of the Soviet  Byelorussian republic, in a public gathering of informal political groups, many  of which were earlier suppressed, the official Soviet news agency Tass  reported. The gathering was sponsored by the local government. Tass said  participants were given the chance to speak on democratization of the political  system, ecology, economic reform and cultural development. After several hours,  they adopted a series of resolutions, including one demanding an end to  nuclear-power plant construction in Byelorussia, which was contaminated by the  1986 Chernobyl disaster.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline of "Peace of the Massacres,"  AL-THAWRAH comments on the Israeli report on the massacre at the  holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. It says: We did not expect  that the Israeli judiciary, which is tailored to suit Israeli  foreign propaganda, would condemn Rabin's government or hold it  responsible for the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    The objectives of the Shamgar Commission's task are known.  They are designed to clear the Israeli government and its army  of responsibility for the blood of the victims of treacherous  Israeli terrorism, to improve the Israeli image, and to  eliminate the negative impact of the massacres on international  public opinion.    The newspaper emphasizes the danger signal that should draw  our attention, which is that the Israeli government -- which the  Shamgar Commission's report did not hold at all responsibile --  has warned, in a statement by Yitzhaq Rabin himself, that there  is no guarantee that another massacre can be prevented.    According to Rabin, terrorism and actions by mad people  cannot be controlled by his security organizations. In a  comment on the Commission's report, General Ehud Baraq, Israeli  chief of staff, literally said he cannot guarantee that such  incidents will not recur.    A thorough reading of Rabin and Baraq's statements,  AL-THAWRAH says, makes it apparent that Rabin and Baraq expect  more massacres in the future.    The newspaper says the report gives the green light to  settlers to commit more massacres. The report intentionally  covers the nature of the circumstances in which the crime was  carried. These circumstances urge Rabin and Baraq to emphasize  that other massacres are possible and claim that the occupation  army will not stop these massacres.</p>

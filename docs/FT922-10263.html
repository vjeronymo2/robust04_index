			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / ICI profits rise 7% to Pounds 212m after cost cutting IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK group, yesterday reported increased pre-tax profits for the first quarter, up 7 per cent to Pounds 212m from Pounds 198m in the same period a year ago. The results, achieved on turnover of Pounds 3.055bn against Pounds 3.052bn, were in line with City forecasts. However, some analysts were surprised by the poor performance of the life-science operations and resilience of the specialty chemicals and materials divisions. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said: 'It is still uncertain when the difficult trading conditions of the past 18 months will finally be behind us. There are, however, some signs of recovery in the US and the UK, particularly in the housing, consumer products, and textile markets.' The profits were helped by cost-cutting which added about Pounds 55m to the bottom line. There was also a net gain of about Pounds 20m from the disposal of the salt business. Profits at the pharmaceuticals division increased from Pounds 88m to Pounds 122m. New products such as Zestril, Zoladex and Diprivan grew sharply as the division's turnover increased to Pounds 386m from Pounds 324m. Sales of Tenormin were disappointing as generic competition in the US made inroads. The agrochemicals and seeds division reported trading profits of Pounds 48m down from Pounds 68m on turnover of Pounds 356m against Pounds 375m. Mr Colin Short, finance director, said this was because of pre-season selling in France and the US during December, and poor weather. Sales in March had been good. Profits at the industrial chemicals division fell from Pounds 35m last year to Pounds 31m on turnover down from Pounds 966m to Pounds 829m. Specialities reported profits at Pounds 15m from Pounds 7m on turnover of Pounds 320m against Pounds 309m; the paints division's profits were Pounds 20m (Pounds 19m) on sales of Pounds 397 (Pounds 362m); the materials division's profits were Pounds 5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 9m on a turnover of Pounds 495m (Pounds 507m); and explosives reported profits at Pounds 9m (Pounds 8m) on a turnover of Pounds 136m (Pounds 121m). Regional businesses fell from a Pounds 12m trading profit during the first quarter last year to a Pounds 1m loss. Earnings per share rose 17 per cent from 17.3p to 20.3p. ICI's shares fell 19p to 1362p. Lex, Page 16</p>

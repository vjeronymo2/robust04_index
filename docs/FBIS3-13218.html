"We demand the release of those who were not convicted,"  before the fall of 'Id al-Fitr at the beginning of next week,  IAF parliamentary bloc spokesman Hamzah Mansur said Tuesday [8  March].    Nine people were injured in last month's blasts at the  Rivoli  theatre in Amman and Salwa movie theatre in al-Zarqa'. Informed  sources had earlier linked the arrested suspects to what they  called "the Afghans," which is a group of Jordanian Islamist  fundamentalists who took part in the Afghan Mujahidin war  against the former Soviet Union. IAF Deputy Bassam Omoush told  the JORDAN TIMES that the IAF lawmakers have sent the government  a memorandum in which they requested the release of the Islamist  suspects but have received "no response yet."    Mr. Mansur said that "massive arrests" were made in  connection with the explosions, and those not convicted should  be released to ensure justice and freedom. He said he "fully"  supported the punishment of individuals who are proven gilty of  involvement in "the crime," but added that justice should be  carried out towards those innocent of the charges brought  against them.    A weekly tabloid Tuesday quoted IAF Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah  as saying that he had witnessed the arrest of the IAF  secretariat "despite the fact that the arrest warrant did not  have the secretariat's name on it."    AL-BILAD weekly also quoted Mr. 'Uwaydah as claiming that  political parties were being "harassed by security forces" and  that "democracy is being crippled by these random arrests."    The tabloid quoted an unnamed senior member of the Muslim  Brotherhood Movement as saying that Islamists were targets of  "rumours and traps which are the making of our Jewish enemies,  their agents and collaborators."    According to AL-BILAD, the brotherhood official rejected  accusations that the government was trying to "harm the  Islamists reputation."    "His Majesty King Husayn spent his life calling for Arab and  Muslim unity. (The King's) awareness and political wisdom are  enough reason for us not to believe" that the government is  spreading rumours against the Islamists, the paper quoted the  brotherhood leader as saying.    IAF deputies are awaiting the return of Prime Minister 'Abd  al-Salam al-Majali from his trip to Saudi Arabia to perform  'Umra, to "remind" the government of the issue, said Mr. Mansur.</p>

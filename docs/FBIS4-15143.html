			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitalyy Radetskyy in a  national radio interview on Wednesday said he would fly to  Crimea on business whenever needed without asking for any local  authorization. "Crimea is part of Ukraine and it is the  Ukrainian Armed Forces but not the Black Sea Fleet [BSF] which  is responsible for its defenses", he said.    The minister's statement follows yesterday's report saying  that a group of senior military officials including Radetskyy  would descend on Crimea without any prior arrangement with the  regional administration or BSF command.    Radetskyy denied both the report and media speculations  alleging that he and a group of senior Army officials had flown  out to the peninsula to block local airports to prevent Crimean  President Yuryy Meshkov's return from Cyprus.    The minister said no armed units had been sent to Crimea and  that he himself had worked at his office in Kiev throughout  Tuesday.    "Crimea is part of Ukraine, said Radetskyy, as defense  minister, I am responsible for defenses of the state as a whole.  That is why I do not have to ask for anyone's permission  whether or not to fly to Crimea and what I must do there. I  take orders from the commander in chief who approves plans for  carrying out the tasks according to the country's defense  doctrine."    In the meantime, a defense ministry spokesman told  INTERFAX-Ukraine that Deputy Chief of Staff Gennadyy Gurin and  his aides went on a scheduled trip to Crimea on Tuesday. Among  other things, they visited the headquarters of the Ukrainian  navy in Sevastopol.    For his part, deputy head of the ministry's press office  Anatolyy Murakhovsky described as a blatant lie one report  alleging that a Ukrainian commando unit had been sent to the  Black Sea Fleet.</p>

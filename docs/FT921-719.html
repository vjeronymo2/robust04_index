			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Tokyo sees sharp fall in housing land prices RESIDENTIAL land prices fell in Japan last year by 5.6 per cent, the first decline in 17 years, the National Land Agency said yesterday. The decline in prices comes after a period in which the Bank of Japan held interest rates high in order to deflate an enormous speculative bubble in asset prices left over from the 1980s. Residential land prices in the Osaka area plunged 22.9 per cent, while the Tokyo area suffered a 9.1 per cent fall. The average decline in Japan's three largest cities, including Nagoya, was 12.5 per cent. Industry specialists, however, said the government statistics appeared to have significantly understated the actual declines, which they put closer to 30 per cent. The land agency said prices in other cities continued to rise, by 2.3 per cent, although this was well below the 13.6 per cent rise recorded a year earlier. Commercial land prices nationwide declined by 4 per cent, while the prices in the three largest cities fell by 10.3 per cent. Although the decline in city land prices appears sharp, it reverses even steeper rises in earlier years. The 22.9 per cent decline in Osaka, for example, followed prices increases of 32.7 per cent, 56.1 per cent, and 6.5 per cent in the previous three years. Sales at Japan's large retailers in February grew by 1 per cent in February, compared to a year ago, after adjusting for the extra business day due to the leap year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said. The figures are consistent with other recent data showing a slowdown in consumer spending.</p>

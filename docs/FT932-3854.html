			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok reels after SEC attack on share-riggers - Meanwhile, writes William Barnes, the economic and corporate fundamentals have deteriorated Stockbrokers surveying the gloom that has overshadowed the Stock Exchange of Thailand for most of this year now comfort themselves with the thought that sentiment cannot get much worse. At the beginning of the year, the SET index looked like breaking through the 1,000-point barrier, supported by what appeared to be strong corporate earnings. But, since then, every attempt by the market to move up has been thwarted by bad news; this has culminated in the realisation that corporate earnings are likely to be swimming through mud for the rest of the year. In spite of a rise this week, the index closed yesterday at 844.01, down 1.87 on the day, compared with a peak of 998.44 in Janauary. The new year optimism among Thailand's notoriously volatile domestic investors quickly evaporated as the one-year-old Securities and Exchange Commission continued to pursue suspected share price riggers and corporate smoke-and-mirrors specialists; share rampers, it is said, have at least had the merit of being able to lead the Thai market a merry, if rather dangerous, dance. By April the market's collective nerve steadied and the market greeted the much anticipated SEC announcement that police had been asked to prosecute 30 suspected share-rampers almost with relief. Then, by accident or design, the names of a further 123 suspect investors were leaked to the press and the index dropped 6.2 per cent in five days. No sooner had the index struggled from the depths of 840 and into the 890s - as it became clear that the 123 would not be prosecuted - than companies started releasing their first-quarter results and the index weakened to set a 1993 low of 818.84 ten days ago. Mr Rob Collins, head of research for Asia Equity, says: 'The first-quarter earnings were truly disastrous and everyone got very depressed. Speculation had been taken out of the market (by the SEC's crackdown) and then we had the the fundamentals knocked for six.' At the beginning of this year, the Bank of Thailand's 7.8 GDP growth forecast looked quite reasonable; now, some pessimists have begun to talk of growth of less than 6 per cent - a figure not seen since the mid-1980s. Earlier hopes that Thailand could ride out the global slowdown, and the cost of its own heavy investment in increased capacity in everything from manufacturing to hotels, had to be sharply readjusted. Asia Equity reckons that, of 310 listed companies, the first-quarter results show that less than a dozen are genuinely flush with profits, after stripping out the still lucrative banking sector, the new listings which habitually jump from profit minimisation to profit maximisation, and companies which 'massage' their results. Local investors have drawn some comfort from this week's lacklustre no-confidence debate in parliament - a 'joke', according to the head of one Thai securities house - which helped to set aside worries that the current five-party coalition government might break up. There has also been a flurry of excitement in the handful of recent new listings and warrant issues. Warrants of the respected property company, Land and Houses, traded nearly their entire issue when they hit the market on Wednesday - helping to boost trading volumes to around Bt5bn, compared with the duller trading of around Bt3bn seen over the last two months. Shares in the government's oil and gas producer PTT Exploration and Production jumped from a striking price of Bt33 to close at Bt47.5 on high volume after its first trading session yesterday. It will probably require substantial fundamental good news for these shafts of speculative light to dispel the gloom much before the end of 1993. However, with the long-term outlook for the Thai economy still regarded as excellent, some investors are cautiously picking up long-term growth plays. A dose of corporate realism may have done more to turn Thai investors into enthusiasts for quality than all the efforts of the eager SEC.</p>

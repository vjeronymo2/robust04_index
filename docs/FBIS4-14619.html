			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow 1 April, TASS -- "The agreement on civil  peace among the main political forces of Russia is planned to be  signed on 28 April," Russian President Boris Yeltsin told  ITAR-TASS during the presentation of credentials by several  foreign ambassadors in the Kremlin today.    The president said that the draft text was ready and had  already been forwarded to the State Duma and the Council of the  Federation. Now "work will be started with the parties in order  to reach final agreement on some points." "Not a bad document  has been drawn up," the president noted.    In Yeltsin's opinion, the draft agreement on civilian peace  would not be published for the time being, because "there may be  suggestions by this or that party or group." This is why,  Yeltsin believes, "it would be unethical to publish the document  now."    Yeltsin also said that he would probably discuss the draft  agreement during his meeting with Yegor Gaydar, expected to take  place in the Kremlin today.</p>

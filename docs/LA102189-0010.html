			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VALENZUELA'S NEGOTIATIONS HAVE A SHAKY BEGINNING  </P> <P> The Dodgers' negotiations with potential free-agent pitcher Fernando Valenzuela  have gotten off to a worrisome start.  </P> <P> In last Tuesday's initial meeting between the two parties, the Dodgers' offer  fell far short of Valenzuela's demand, according to Valenzuela's agent Tony  DeMarco.  </P> <P> "I don't think they are close to where we're at," DeMarco said Friday, quickly  adding, "But we make no secret that Fernando wants to play here. We still think  we can get things settled."  </P> <P> Although neither party would disclose figures, the dividing issue appears to be  a pay cut. Valenzuela, who made $1.85 million last season, will not accept  less. He is thought to be seeking a three-year deal worth about $6 million,  something other teams, including the New York Yankees, might be willing to pay.  </P> <P> The Dodgers are reportedly offering closer to $1 million a year. They  reportedly will pursue Montreal pitcher Mark Langston if he becomes a free  agent, and may also feel that rookies John Wetteland and Ramon Martinez have  reduced Valenzuela's importance to the rotation.  </P> <P> Valenzuela's advisers point to the left-hander's comeback from shoulder  problems. Over his last 76 2/3 innings, Valenzuela had a 2.70 earned-run  average. He finished the season with a 10-13 record and 3.43 ERA. However, he  did not win a game for nearly a year because of his shoulder injury, and he has  gone 15-21 over the last two seasons.  </P> <P> The Dodgers' loyalty to Valenzuela, who has been with the team for 11 years, no  longer appears to be a major issue.  </P> <P> "We realize Fernando's importance to the community, but we have to do what we  feel is best for us," Claire said at season's end.  </P> <P> Said DeMarco: "They have the right of first refusal, always. But we also know  that there will be other important teams that are interested in him, teams that  would welcome him."  </P> <P> No other team can officially express interest unless Valenzuela declares  himself a free agent, which must be done within 15 days after the end of the  World Series. DeMarco, however, is confident of that interest.  </P> <P> "We know teams are there," he said.  </P> <P> DeMarco said he will meet with Dodger officials after the Series.  </P> <P> In other news, Claire said Friday he was feeling upbeat about phone  conversations with outfielders Kirk Gibson and Kal Daniels, both of whom are at  their winter homes recovering from knee surgeries.  </P></p>

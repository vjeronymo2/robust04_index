			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Tokyo market hits oversupply snags - At a Glance The Tokyo stock exchange was hit this week by the listing of Japan Telecom, the country's third largest telecommunications company. Rather than boosting the market as had been expected, the flotation created an oversupply problem, and shares in the newly-listed company fell, pulling other sectors down too. On Thursday, the Nikkei index fell through the 20,000 level for the first time in four months. Traders are also worried that another big flotation next month - Japan Tobacco - could futher depress the market. The Tokyo market had a good first half of this year, helped by cash inflows from foreign investors, but has stagnated in the 20,000 to 21,000 band since mid-summer.</p>

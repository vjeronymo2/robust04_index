			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- The division of Black Sea  Fleet infrastructure, including coastal fortifications,  artillery, fleet aviation, storages and apartments of Sevastopol  servicemen, was a stumbling stone at negotiations of the Russian  and Ukrainian premiers on the Black Sea Fleet and the Crimea.    The agreement on gradual division of the Black Sea Fleet  signed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on April 15,  1994, was too general. It voiced the Ukrainian holding of  ten-fifteen per cent of warships and auxiliary vessels, and  separate basing of the Russian and Ukrainian fleets. The  document also instructed ministries and departments to  coordinate conditions and procedure of the division.    A reason for failure of the Black Sea Fleet talks between  the  Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers in April was their  different understanding of the infrastructure notion, said  Vice-Admiral of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff Vladimir  Kryazhev.</p>

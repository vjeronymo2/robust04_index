			<p>BFN     [Text] Toronto, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier  Zou Jiahua today urged Canadian businessmen to make bigger steps  in developing economic relations and trade with China.    Addressing a roundtable breakfast jointly hosted by Goodman  &amp;  Goodman, one of Canada's law firms and the Institute of Toronto  C.D. Howe in his honor, Zou said "I have become more keenly  aware of both the possibility and great potential for our  mutually beneficial cooperation" in economic and trade field  [sentence as received]. More than 100 businessmen attended the  event.    Zou said since the establishment of Sino-Canadian diplomatic  ties, bilateral economic relations and trade between China and  Canada have recorded considerable progress but it falls far  short of the need and potential of the two sides.    With highly developed industries, Canada enjoys an advantage  in energy, transportation, telecommunications and finance, he  said, adding that "It is entirely possible for Canada to make  bigger steps in developing economic relations and trade with  China."    "One of the purposes of our current visit is to explore with  you ways to further expand Sino-Canadian economic cooperation  and trade in the years to come," the vice premier said.    He said during the past 15 years, China has scored  significant achievements in its modernization drive. "The rapid  economic growth in China is now materializing its great  potential as a big market," he added.    "China, a big market with 1.2 billion population, is  attracting more and more foreign investors." Until the end of  1993, China has approved foreign investment in 174,056 projects  and more than 60 billion U.S. dollars have been invested, he  said.    He hoped that more Canadian enterprises will join the rank  of  Northern Telecoms Limited, who stands out with distinction among  Canadian companies to gain a foothold in China's market.    He urged Canadian businessmen to seize the opportunities and  take a more active part in China's modernization drive. "If we  are not a partner today, it will be tomorrow," Zou said.</p>

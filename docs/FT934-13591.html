			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Rail unions fear assault on pay RAIL union leaders believe the government is preparing for anattack on the pay and conditions of 125,000 railway workers after pushing through an amendment in the rail privatisation bill during the Lords report stage earlier this week. Under the late change the unions fear British Rail is being given new legal powers to assign employees to new subsidiaries and modify terms and conditions of employment before privatisation. The amendment replaces a previous clause in the measure that explicitly affirmed that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations applied to any transfer of rail staff. The Tupe regulations provide protection to workers in companies involved in changes of ownership. Under the change, BR and the franchising director created by privatisation will be empowered to assign railway workers to new subsidiaries and modify their employment terms. A government-funded compensation and arbitration scheme is to be introduced for staff aggrieved by the changes. Rail unions say the amendment is aimed at lowering earnings and other employment benefits before the sale or franchising of parts of BR. Ministers insist that the changes reinforce and do not weaken Tupe protection for rail staff who do not work wholly for BR - such as those employed on the Gatwick Express trains. An urgent meeting is to be held with Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, over the amendment. There has been no consultation with the unions before the bill is debated for its third reading in the Commons next Wednesday. Aslef, the train drivers' union, yesterday threatened to hold a strike ballot if it cannot receive guarantees over the future security of BR's Pounds 8.2m pension fund after privatisation of the network starts next spring.</p>

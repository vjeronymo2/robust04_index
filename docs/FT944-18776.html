			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Balmy nights, barmy place - Munich Oktoberfest Munich's Oktoberfest is not for the faint-hearted. The beer is excellent, and so are the spit-roasted chickens, grilled pork with crackling, charcoal-grilled fish, salt-studded pretzels and sugar-roasted almonds. But the crowds can be intimidating and the noise overpowering. The promise of some of the world's best beer, plus the garish funfair attractions and stomach-churning rides - not for trying, or even watching, after downing the odd litre - draw more than 6m people a year to the field where the world's largest beer festival is held over two weeks from late September. (This year's ends on Monday, having been extended by a day to include that day's German unification celebrations.) Organisers of such events love to parade statistics about the vast quantities of food and drink consumed. Those for the Oktoberfest are formidable: 5m litres of beer, 733,000 chickens, 224,000 pairs of pork sausages and 80 oxen. When the weather is warm, as it often is at Oktoberfest time, the beer goes down with an extra relish, its 5.5 per cent alcohol content giving it more of a kick than Bavaria's normal brews. Munich's six main breweries - Augustiner, Lowenbrau, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, Hofbrauhaus and Paulaner - have their own huge beer tents, with brass bands blaring out oompah music to the swaying drinkers, striving hard to sing, talk or retain control of their senses against the onslaught of noise and alcohol. On hot days, the best bet is to sit on the benches outside the tents and enjoy the sun. By midday at weekends, most seats have been filled, serious drinkers (some already the worse for wear) mingling with toddlers and grannies. After a couple of hours of this, sated with beer and heavy but tasty Bavarian food, the crowds can become too much. When you can hardly take two steps in any direction without being jostled by the mounting influx of people, it is time to go home. The big wheel, dodgems and wildwater rides can be left for another time - or for those with tougher constitutions. But most people love it just the same. Those living in Munich try to go at least once a year, often paying with beer and food vouchers handed out by their employers or local companies. Since the beer costs nearly DM10 (Pounds 4) a litre this year, these are highly prized. Foreigners have discovered the Oktoberfest in droves. Italians, Australians, New Zealanders, Japanese and Americans are among the most enthusiastic visitors, but almost the whole world is represented. Since the beer is strong - and far superior to the 'lagers' sold in some other countries  - headaches and hangovers can be memorable. Surprisingly, violence is rare: people prefer to put their energies into drinking and eating (mostly the former). Munich is proud of its Oktoberfest, held on a field named after Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen whose marriage to Bavarian Crown Prince Ludwig (later the first King Ludwig) was celebrated with a fair there in October, 1810. It brings in around DM1bn (Pounds 415m) a year in food, drink and tourism receipts. Some Bavarians show themselves off in their lederhosen, worn with fancy white shirts, knitted jackets, thick socks and boots and (for the really traditional) hats with tufts of chamois hair. This get-up may be to prove that they are Bavarians first and Germans second. (Some locals joke that anyone sporting lederhosen is as likely to be a Prussian - the outdated description many Bavarians give indiscriminately to all north Germans - as a native of Germany's southernmost state.) Bavarians certainly greet each year's Oktoberfest with gusto. On a balmy evening, sitting outside with blue and white lights strung overhead, the world seems to have little wrong with it. As more and more youngsters stream on to the scene, with groups sharing a Mass (litre) or two among them, the atmosphere is cheerful rather than menacing. To anyone not steeped in the Bavarian dialect, the jokes shouted out from along our bench by the well-oiled visitors from the country were almost incomprehensible - even my Munich-born wife had to struggle to understand them. Why was I so quiet, they asked. They accepted the excuse that I was a foreigner - in two senses of the word, non-German and non-Bavarian. At least, I was drinking Munich beer. As an antidote to communication failures, it is almost unrivalled. With anything less thick than a rural Bavarian accent, the alcohol can also act as a very effective, if short-lived, conversational lubricant. After a time, it makes no difference anyway. The beer does its own talking.</p>

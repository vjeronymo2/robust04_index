			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / UK Gilts: Fears about funding help dampen sentiment PRICES rose for most classes of gilts on the back of hopes of lower base rates. However, fears about funding, particularly related to this Wednesday's auction by the Bank of England of Pounds 2.5bn of 14-year stock, held back the consequent drop in yields. The fall in yields was most marked at the short end of the yield curve, on account of the pressure which the government is coming under to cut base rates from their current 7 per cent. That was triggered by depressing economic data released last week which indicated the recession of nearly three years may have a lot longer to run. A poor performance by the car industry was a factor in a 0.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output in November compared with the previous month, while a sharp rise in the jobless total last month pushed unemployment to its highest level for almost six years. The jobless total rose a seasonally adjusted 60,800 in December, the biggest monthly increase since July 1991, pushing the overall figure close to 3m. Meanwhile, average earnings across the economy rose by an underlying 5 per cent in the year to November, slightly below the October figure, which was revised upwards to 5.25 per cent. That demonstrated, according to many economists, the lack of inflationary pressures in the economy. While a sharp fall in sterling last week against the D-Mark did little to lift investor sentiment, a still more powerful drag on the market was the auction of Pounds 2.5bn of 8.5 per cent Treasury stock due in 2007. With many investors weighing up whether to take positions at the auction, demand for gilts in this section of the yield curve was virtually non existent. There was also some confusion in the gilt market on the back of projections that, according to estimates based on the rise in notes and coins in circulation during the first three weeks of January, the year on year rise for the M0 money supply for January could turn out at above 4 per cent. According to Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at the UK office of Japanese bank Yamaichi, that was a worrying feature for the market given that this figure would breach the Treasury's target for M0 growth. Year-on-year M0 growth in both November and December last year was 3 per cent. A figure of above 4 per cent, coming after two months in which the numbers were relatively large, might indicate a rise in inflation was around the corner. Nonetheless, the notion that base rates were almost certain to come down ahead of the March 16 Budget pulled down yields 'in an effect that dribbled along the yield curve', according to Mr John Shepperd, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. 'Even with this sentiment a key question for the market is whether investors can absorb the large amount of supply coming via the auction without a drop in prices,' he said. The economic indicators last week demonstrated a crying need for a cut in base rates, said Mr Simon Briscoe, a bond analyst at Greenwell Montagu. 'The question is whether the government will do it almost immediately or whether it will wait for the Bundesbank to cut rates, which may not be until mid-February.' However, some gilt commentators were more cautious, arguing that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, may want to wait until he sees a date for the economy related to what was happening in January before taking action on base rates. That would be in keeping with his approach in the past of not wishing to be hurried into action on this score, in spite of evidence that any full recovery from the recession might be some time into the future.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNCIL INCREASES AIRPORT FEE  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council voted unanimously this week to increase by about 20%  the rental fee to tie down a plane at the municipal airport.  </P> <P> The increase, which was approved Tuesday night, will take effect May 1 and will  raise the monthly rate from $65 to $80 for planes with a wing span of 30 to 40  feet, and from $104 to $125 for wing spans of 40 to 50 feet.  </P> <P> The recommendation came in January from David M. Griffith &amp; Associates, a  Sacramento-based consulting firm. The 304 tie-downs at the Torrance Airport  bring the city about $196,000 in revenue each year, according to city  officials. The new rates are expected to increase annual revenue by $50,000.  </P> <P> A staff report showed that the average tie-down rate charged at airports in  Santa Monica, Long Beach, Van Nuys, El Monte, Hawthorne and Compton is $79 and  $113, respectively, for the two types of aircraft. Van Nuys, owned by the City  of Los Angeles, charges the most: $115 and $130, respectively.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE 'KILLING FIELDS'? U.S. MAY HAVE TO BACK LESSER OF EVILS IN CAMBODIA;  </P> <P> SOUTHEAST ASIA: GAINS BY KHMER ROUGE MAY FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEAL WITH  HUN SEN. MEANTIME, U.N. CEASE-FIRE TALKS OPEN TODAY.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration may soon find itself facing a foreign policy problem  that it once considered unthinkable: a Khmer Rouge return to power in Cambodia.  </P> <P> Administration officials acknowledge that Khmer Rouge guerrilla forces have in  the past several months made significant gains in the Cambodian countryside,  militarily and politically. At the same time, the Vietnamese-installed  government of Cambodia has seemed increasingly weak, in part because of  financial problems resulting from reduced Soviet aid to Vietnam and Cambodia.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said repeatedly that the United  States opposes a return to power by the Khmer Rouge. When the Khmer Rouge last  ruled Cambodia, from 1975 to 1978, between 1 million and 2 million Cambodians  are believed to have been murdered or to have died of starvation or illness.  </P> <P> But the United States is also opposed to allowing the Cambodian government to  fight the Khmer Rouge, mainly because of Cambodia's close ties to Vietnam, an  old American adversary.  </P> <P> As a result, since the early 1980s, the United States has been supporting a  coalition of non-Communist groups joined in an uneasy alliance with the Khmer  Rouge. The triumvirate, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a former Cambodian  ruler, holds Cambodia's seat at the United Nations.  </P> <P> There is growing sentiment in Congress to cut off aid to these non-Communist  groups, at least until they separate themselves from the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> "The best way to stop the Khmer Rouge is to not support their allies," said  Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs  subcommittee on Asia.  </P> <P> Baker himself suggested last week that the Administration might be willing to  reduce or end its longstanding support for Sihanouk's forces, support that now  totals about $17 million a year.  </P> <P> "I think it's fair to say that we are rethinking the question of assistance to  the non-Communist resistance," Baker said recently on ABC's "This Week With  David Brinkley."  </P> <P> Some lawmakers are also urging the Administration to change a second element of  the longstanding U.S. policy toward Cambodia -- Washington's refusal to  recognize or deal with the Cambodian regime of Prime Minister Hun Sen.  </P> <P> U.S. officials have opposed Hun Sen and his Communist government for more than  a decade, arguing that it is illegitimate because it was installed by force  when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978. Vietnam withdrew most of its troops  last year.  </P> <P> Some congressmen, among them California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica),  believe the United States should throw its full support behind Hun Sen's  government.  </P> <P> "I think we have to cut our aid to the non-Communist resistance," Levine said.  "The sad fact is that there's no alternative to Hun Sen or the Khmer Rouge.  None of us have any reason to believe Hun Sen is a Jeffersonian Democrat. But  Hun Sen is the lesser of two evils, and we have to recognize that."  </P> <P> Others favor prodding the two sides to cooperate in some sort of coalition.  Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  subcommittee on Asia, said, "The only way to defeat the Khmer Rouge is to  achieve an agreement between the non-Communists and the Hun Sen government."  </P> <P> But Administration officials contend that such a coalition would not work,  because Sihanouk and his allies are incapable of working with the  Vietnamese-backed government, which they have been fighting for nearly a  decade.  </P> <P> Another official argued that even if the two sides could form a coalition, it  probably could not defend itself against the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> "The Vietnamese army couldn't eradicate the Khmer Rouge in 10 years with  110,000 troops," he said, "and we know the Vietnamese army isn't bad. What  makes anyone think Hun Sen and Sihanouk could do it on their own?"  </P> <P> But the Administration's critics argue that even if this new approach doesn't  succeed, it is still worth a try -- and is far better than the current policy.  </P> <P> "Our present policy in Cambodia is bankrupt," said Democratic Rep. Chester G.  Atkins of Massachusetts. "Right now, we've got a fight between Hun Sen and the  Khmer Rouge, and we're supporting the Khmer Rouge's battlefield allies. The  Khmer Rouge is using Sihanouk as their cloak of respectability to go in and  organize the countryside."  </P> <P> How far should the United States go in trying to stop the Khmer Rouge? Some  congressmen contend that the United States should begin to provide at least  some military and intelligence support for Hun Sen's government and others  fighting the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> But Administration strategists warn that such action might lead to renewed U.S.  military involvement in Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has been emphasizing the need for a political  settlement. For the last year, Washington's strategy has been to try to  persuade all the parties in Cambodia -- Hun Sen and his supporters, the  non-Communist parties and the Khmer Rouge -- to join in a coalition government.  The aim is to contain the Khmer Rouge by making it a political minority within  the government.  </P> <P> The Administration has also been working with the United Nations to arrange an  international peacekeeping force and a transitional government to serve until  after democratic elections.  </P> <P> Richard H. Solomon, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific  Affairs, has met several times with officials of the four other permanent  members of the U.N. Security Council -- the Soviet Union, China, Britain and  France -- and he is to attend another round of talks in Paris today.  </P> <P> Initially, it was hoped that the Security Council members could use their  influence to bring about a political settlement in Cambodia. For years, China  has been supplying arms to the Khmer Rouge, while the Soviet Union has been the  leading financial supporter and arms supplier to both Vietnam and the Hun Sen  government.  </P> <P> But now, Bush Administration strategists acknowledge that the prospects for a  negotiated settlement are not good.  </P> <P> "The Khmer Rouge says no to everything," a State Department official said. "And  Hun Sen and the Vietnamese seem to be hardening their positions, too."  </P> <P> Until recently, the Administration had little trouble persuading Congress to go  along with its Cambodia policy. Leading Democrats, such as Rep. Stephen J.  Solarz (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia,  and Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.), supported the President.  </P> <P> But now that support seems to be eroding. Last month, Senate Majority Leader  George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) broke with the Administration, charging that its  policy on Cambodia is "incredible" and "insupportable." Mitchell urged the  Administration to talk with the Hun Sun government and provide it with  development aid.  </P> <P> In late June, a week after the House of Representatives voted to continue aid  to the non-Communist resistance groups, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted  to cut off such aid. Congressional sources say the issue will be in doubt at  least until September, when conflicts between the House and Senate can be  worked out in a conference committee.  </P> <P> On Friday, a bipartisan group of 10 senators -- including Robb and moderate  Republicans John C. Danforth of Missouri, Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and  William S. Cohen of Maine -- joined Mitchell in a letter urging the Bush  Administration to alter course on Cambodia.  </P> <P> The Administration itself is deeply divided over Cambodia policy. A number of  officials in the State and Defense departments say privately that they favor  ending the U.S. effort to isolate the Hun Sun government. Indeed, although they  are not willing to be quoted for the record, some Administration officials have  taken the position that Washington should begin to normalize relations with  Vietnam.  </P> <P> "The problem is the White House," one official said.  </P> <P> The strongest opponent of change is said to be Brent Scowcroft, the national  security adviser, who in the early 1970s took part in the Nixon  Administration's frustrated effort to negotiate an end to the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Administration officials still cling to the hope that they can  persuade the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge to agree to some form of  settlement supervised by the United Nations. But they acknowledge that the  Khmer Rouge is making progress in rural Cambodia and that amid a series of  financial and political problems, the Hun Sen government could collapse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Diplomats from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the  United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France -- will meet in  Paris today for the fifth time to discuss Cambodia. The talks center on a plan  for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire there, followed by a caretaker administration  and elections. The U.S. hopes to achieve a political settlement that will  prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to dominance and will lead to stability  to Southeast Asia.  </P></p>

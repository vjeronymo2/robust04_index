			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fresh setback for Dow as dollar drops Wall Street US stocks suffered their second big setback in a row yesterday as a falling dollar excited fresh concerns over the direction of monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 34.88 down at 3,741.90, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.97 lower at 455.48. The Nasdaq composite dropped 10.50, or 1.44 per cent, to 718.85 and the American SE composite weakened 4.07 to 436.19. Activity on the New York SE returned to a more sedate pace after a frenzied 'triple witching' session on Friday. Closing volume was a light 229.5m shares and declining issues outpaced rises by 1,715 to 495. The continued weakness of the dollar sent a shiver through US financial markets, destroying any hopes that stocks would rally on the heels of Friday's 34-point drop. The market often recovers strongly on the Monday after a triple-witching rout, as the quarterly expiration of options and futures tends to exaggerate any underlying trend. Yesterday, however, bargain hunters were thin on the ground. Stocks were in retreat from the opening bell amid fears that the Federal Reserve may have no choice but to raise interest rates as early as next month to support the slumping dollar. The potential impact of such a move on the economy undermined any inclination by the stock market to rally. Bonds were no help either, though the Treasury market was buttressed by a softer tone in commodities. Amid these cross-currents, economically sensitive stocks were leading share prices in a determined march lower. Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer, retreated Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 106 3/8 and Eaton, a supplier of motor vehicle components, lost Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 52 3/8 . Reynolds, the aluminium producer, shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48, while Bethlehem Steel fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/8 . Among other Dow industrial issues, Sears Roebuck slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 . But Philip Morris put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 50 7/8 following news of the resignation of Mr Michael Miles, its chairman. He was believed to be an advocate of a proposal to split the food and tobacco businesses into separate companies. US Healthcare jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 43 1/8 on speculation that Johnson &amp; Johnson was considering a takeover bid for the company, a pioneer in the field of health maintenance organisations. J&amp;J held at Dollars 43 5/8 . The Nasdaq gave up more ground as the technology sector stumbled again and financial issues weakened. Cirrus Logic fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 28 3/8 and Atmel receded Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 23 1/4 . Canada Toronto shares moved sharply lower in line with other Canadian financial markets yesterday after Prime Minister Jean Chretien failed to promise more spending cuts. Early in the day, Mr Chretien sent financial markets into a tailspin when he played down the significance of reports that Ottawa may be forced to make new spending cuts to stop the deficit from increasing due to rising interest rates. The TSE 300 composite index tumbled 68.3, or 1.64 per cent, to 4,088.4 and falls overwhelmed advances by 649 to 162. A modest volume of 47.9m shares was well below Friday's 60.6m. All 14 stock groups ended weaker, led by industrial products and mining, which lost 2.63 and 2.31 per cent respectively. The banking and energy stock groups were each off 1.33 per cent, while golds shed 0.92 per cent.</p>

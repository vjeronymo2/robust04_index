			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: MCI improves to Dollars 134m MCI Communications, the second largest long distance telephone network in the US, yesterday reported first-quarter profits of Dollars 134m, or 51 cents a share, up from Dollars 123m, or 48 cents, a year earlier. Revenues improved from Dollars 2.025bn to Dollars 2.225bn, partly because of continued inroads into the consumer markets. Mr Douglas Maine, chief financial officer, said promotions and discounts resulted in higher traffic growth. 'We remain cautious as to the extent any economic recovery will affect these results,' he added.</p>

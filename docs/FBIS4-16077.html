			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 12/4/1994 -- The  Chisinau-Tiraspol negotiations reached a new level, one that  tries to solve economic problems and avoid political ones, told  BASAPRESS Aleksandr Caraman, the vice president of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. Referring to the 9 April  meeting between [Igor] Smirnov and President [Mircea] Snegur,  Caraman said that if they had discussed merely political issues,  the negotiations could have failed. He also explained that  experts of both sides are now elaborating different ways of  establishing economic relations between the two banks [of the  Dniester River], especially the cooperation between the banking  networks, bilateral payment of goods, gas supplies, and so on.  The Tiraspol leader also assessed that the ratification by the  Chisinau Parliament of the agreement on [Moldova's] joining the  CIS will make easier relations between Tiraspol and Chisinau.  "The dizziness of independence parades is over. Politicians  have understood that survival will be impossible if we stay  separate," said Caraman. Referring to the [Ilie] Ilascu case  [person held prisoner by the Tiraspol authorities], Caraman  declared that his fate is in the hands of the people [certain  persons]. "Ilascu or his relatives will have to write a pardon  demand. If they do not, even Smirnov cannot have the right to  help him," Caraman said.</p>

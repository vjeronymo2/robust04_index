			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 29 Mar (PL) -- A counterrevolutionary  activist is currently facing a possible seven-year prison term  after having acknowledged today in court his attempts to spread  anti-Cuban propaganda on behalf of U.S. radio stations.    Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez violated provisions of the Cuban  penal code by using the telephone to relay, in a calculated and  consistent manner, distorted information with respect to the  Cuban situation and by encouraging, according to the charges  filed, public unrest with the intention of causing apprehension  and dissatisfaction among the population.    Gonzalez's appearance before a provincial people's court was  carried out in an unobstructed manner, with the presence not  only of the accused's relatives and friends, but also of  national and foreign journalists, as well as diplomats  representing the U.S. Interests Section and the Canadian,  Swedish, and Czechoslovakian [as received] Embassies.    Gonzalez, according to his own admission, relayed reports  related to alleged unrest in Havana bakeries and supermarkets to  the so-called Radio Marti radio station. He also provided  reports on alleged abuses and inadequate medical attention for  various inmates including Sebastian Arcos Bergnes and Maria  Elena Cruz Varela.    Likewise, he insisted that a Cuban television station  employee on Isla de la Juventud had been fired because of his  religious convictions and political opinions.    Statements by numerous witnesses, including employees and  neighbors of the area where the alleged protests took place, as  well as police agents, attested to the inaccuracy of the  reports. In addition, the television station employee himself  denied having been fired.    On the other hand, reports filed on medical assistance  provided to Arcos Bergnes and Cruz Varela, who has already been  released, including a video showing Arcos in good health, were  used to prove that Gonzalez and Radio Marti had lied with  respect to the incidents.    An interesting development occurred during the trial when  the  accused was allowed to read a 30-minute statement [words  indistinct] bordering on the offensive, criticizing the  revolutionary leaders' conduct, without the court doing anything  to prevent it despite protests by prosecutor Edelmira Pedriz.    Gonzalez had already once been sentenced to 16 months in  prison because of his attempts to depart Cuba illegally.</p>

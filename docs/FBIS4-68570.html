			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Declaration by Georgian National Independence Party: </F> "Declaration of the Georgian National Independence Party "]    [Text] The Georgian National Independence Party,  considering the national and state interests of the Georgian  people and government, gives great importance to strengthening  relations of friendship, good neighborliness and mutually useful  cooperation between Azerbaijan and Georgia. Our party considers  that the deepening of relations of sincerity, friendship and  all-round cooperation with neighboring Azerbaijan will  strengthen Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and  contribute to peace and stability in the region.    A delegation of the Georgian National Independence Party  headed by its chairman traveled officially to Azerbaijan's  capital, Baku, on the basis of an official invitation from the  Azerbaijan National Independence Party on 15-18 January 1994. In  the course of the visit, an Agreement on basic principles of  cooperation between the Georgian and Azerbaijani National  Independence Parties was signed.    Based on these principles, our parties consider that from  the  point of view of mutual belief, friendship and cooperation  between our peoples the preservation of citizenship rights for  Azeris living in Georgian territory and Georgians living in  Azerbaijan's territory has paramount importance. Serious action  is needed in this direction. Strong enemies of the Georgian  people and Georgia's independence are trying to worsen and  complicate relations between Georgians and Azeris by all means.  They are even trying to start ethnic military conflicts. May God  protect us from this!    It is necessary to implement a series of measures to rectify  completely the citizenship rights of Azeris who are Georgian  citizens. From this point of view:    a) to strengthen to the maximum the fight by law enforcement  organs and strong administrations against all criminal activity  on the territory of Gardaban, Marneul, Volnis, Tetriskaroy,  Sagarchevo and Lagodekh Rayons, and to reduce the probability of  creating personal conflicts between Azeris and Georgians;    b) to assure the active participation of Azeris along with  Georgians in local government and administrative structures, the  procuracy, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the security  organs on the territory of these rayons;    c) to include both Georgian and Azeri citizens in the ranks  of the armed forces of the Georgian Republic;    d) to broaden cooperation between government organs of the  Georgian and Azerbaijan Republics in the sectors of defending  the independence and territorial integrity of our states, to  guarantee the inviolability of existing borders, to strengthen  national security, stability and democracy, to give guarantees  on human rights and the rights of national minorities, and to  conduct a struggle against terrorism, narcobusiness and banditry.    By giving to greatest importance to friendly and neighborly  relation between Georgia and Azerbaijan, we hope representatives  of higher government organs will approach this declaration with  attention.    [Signed] I. Sereteli, chairman, in the name of the Georgian  National Independence Party, 22 January 1994.    The declaration was submitted to E. Shevardnadze, head of  state of the Georgian Republic, J. Yoseliani, chairman of the  Temporary Committee on the Special Situation, I. Georgadze,  Minister of Security, G. Karkarashvili, Minister of Defense, Sh.  Kviraya, Minister of Internal Affairs, and J. Babilashvili,  Chief Procurator.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLASSIC MUSTANG ROUNDUP CORRALS 1,000 CARS  </P> <P> Ken Upchurch, who flew in from Albuquerque just to see the car show in Orange  County, said Sunday that he was not disappointed.  </P> <P> Looking around at the hundreds of vintage automobiles, Upchurch said, "It's  fabulous. There are more (display) cars here than I've ever seen in one place."  </P> <P> Another visitor, Larry Quay of Covina, said, "For someone who likes cars, this  is like Christmas." And yet another visitor, Donald E. Petersen of Detroit,  chairman of board of the Ford Motor Co., said, "This is the biggest show of  Mustangs in the nation."  </P> <P> Thousands jammed the east side of Knott's Berry Farm to lovingly stare at a  wide array of classic cars on display. Petersen, in an interview, said there's  a reason Southern Californians love cars so much.  </P> <P> "I think the California spirit is one of freedom and experimentation -- trying  things that are different and new," Petersen said. "And there is also here a  love for the outdoors and a love for being active. I think this interest in  cars, especially sporty cars and unusual cars, is just part of that."  </P> <P> Petersen was at the event to mark Ford Motor Co.'s 25th anniversary of its  enormously successful Mustang model. About 1,000 early-model Mustangs, now  coveted as collector's items, were on display. European car lovers brought 37  of the classic Mustangs to the show. They shipped their cars from Europe to  Florida and then drove them cross-country to Buena Park to be in the event.  </P> <P> But most of the vintage cars came from Southern California -- a place sometimes  mocked by the rest of the nation because of its love affair with automobiles.  </P> <P> Petersen, however, said he well understands the mystique cars hold for Southern  Californians. "It's a phenomenon I was first introduced to a little kid," he  said.  </P> <P> "I was born in Minnesota, but I grew up in Southern California. I lived with my  folks in San Bernardino and Long Beach. I was in a Depression family that  didn't have cars. But I sure yearned for them and loved to look at them."  </P> <P> As Petersen recalled his lifelong interest in cars, thousands milled among the  gleaming automobiles on display nearby. Some in the crowd stood before restored  cars as if having a religious experience. Their eyes had a dreamy, far-away  look.  </P> <P> The show had a wide assortment of makes and models of classic cars. But the big  draw, and numerically the largest single model on display, was Ford's Mustang.  Today is the official 25th anniversary of the historic vehicle, and Petersen  said Ford Motor Co. chose the Knott's show to be "the official celebration for  the 25th anniversary of the Mustang."  </P> <P> Mustang car owners from Switzerland to San Diego came to the show to display  their "Mustang collectibles." Most were early-model Mustangs, with 1964 1/2  models being the prime objects of attention. Mustang devotees -- and there were  thousands in the crowd -- were quick to point out that the car's debut in  April, 1964, came in mid-year. Thus the first models are officially known as  1964 1/2 year-of-make.  </P> <P> Ken Upchurch and his wife Sherron were among those in the crowd who are proud  owners of 1964 1/2 Mustangs.  </P> <P> "We have two 1964 1/2s: a coupe and a convertible," said Sherron Upchurch.  "We've had quite a few (Mustang) shows in Albuquerque where they've had more  than 100 cars, but it's nowhere near what this show has. The Europeans who  brought their Mustangs to this show drove through Albuquerque, so we saw part  of the 'Pony Drive' on its way here."  </P> <P> Ken Upchurch said he is so anxious to protect his 1964 1/2 Mustang "that I  never drive it any more, I just keep it in the garage for shows."  </P> <P> Sherron Upchurch said that the original year-of-make Mustangs now bring hefty  prices. "I only paid $1,100 for my Mustang in 1968 when I bought it, as the  second owner," she said. "Now I could sell it for about $14,000," she said.  </P> <P> Near the Upchurchs, Larry Quay, a professional photographer from Covina, stood  by his restored 1964 1/2 Mustang convertible. Quay said he had taken a junked  Mustang and restored it to a car that he estimated would sell for up to  $20,000.  </P> <P> A display book by the car, with photos made by Quay, showed the before and  after transformation of his Mustang.  </P> <P> "I found this car about 1 1/2 years ago in Gardena," Quay said. "It was in  absolute, terrible shape. I paid $1,200 for it. Since then, I've put a lot of  work into it, and I guess I've spent about $10,000 all told."  </P> <P> Quay said that fixing up an old car is a bit of adventure. "It's like doing  archeology," he said. "It's also like a three-dimensional crossword puzzle.  It's definitely a hobby; it's real enjoyable."  </P> <P> Quay said that while the restored vehicle now brings many purchase offers, he  has no intention of selling. But he said he is pleased at his investment.  </P> <P> Petersen, the Ford Motor Co. chairman, said that one of the interesting things  about the early Mustangs is how they have escalated in value.  </P> <P> "The first ones are worth so much more now than what we sold them for," said  the Ford executive. "We started (in 1964) selling Mustangs at $2,268, and if  you really wanted to spend a lot of money, you could pay $250 more for our  manual soft-top convertible. So you could buy a new convertible Mustang in  those days for about $2,600."  </P> <P> While the economics of car collecting interested some in the crowd, others said  just the sheer beauty of the vehicles made the event akin to attending an art  show.  </P> <P> Quay gestured to the acres of restored classic cars at the display. "This is  the ultimate," he said.  </P></p>

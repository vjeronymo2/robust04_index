			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Some wondered what all the fuss was about . . . / Review of Damien Hirst How disappointing. After all the excited anticipation comes the let-down, the false step at the top of the stair. For here, as curator of the exhibition, we were to have had Damien Hirst, at once the art world's wunderkind and William Brown of the 1990s, making his choice of the art of his generation. Goodness, what fun, what shocking fun it was bound to be, what blood and guts and flies on the meat for the sceptical critic to get his teeth into. Well, we get Damien and his pals all right, in this exhibition curiously titled Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away, but far from being the Bash Street Kids or Outlaws of our hopes, they seem far closer to Rupert Bear and friends. It is all so safe, so predictable, so orthodox, so . . . how shall I put it? . . . so avant-garde. How we long for something as radical as a painting of a flower in a pot, perhaps, or a tree, or even the life model in the studio. We look out of the windows, to the trees of Kensington Gardens, caught in the sun of the late afternoon, and the world and his significant partner jogging past. Interesting, visually interesting stuff, all of it. But, oh dear, such things are far too risky for the ambitious young: better far to leave them to the Royal Academy, as we shall see in a week or two. Hirst tells us he has been working for three years on putting this show together, which is to say the work of 15 artists, including himself, amounting to something around three dozen exhibits. One of his own contributions, predictably enough, is yet another carcass suspended in a tank of formaldehyde, this time that of a dead sheep, with tiny bubbles of air still trapped in the fleece and escaping quietly to the surface, petillant, like lemonade, or greenish champagne. Another of his works is a large white canvas on which are painted ten rows of nine large dots in several colours, or nine of ten, depending on how you look at it. Beside it hangs a large box by Robert Peacock painted half grey, half orange, and called, yes, 'Grey and Orange Box 1994'. Hirst said of his fellow artists the other day, that 'it's just that they appeal to my sick taste . . . I thought they had visual excitement.' 'I don't think it's shocking exactly', he went on; 'it's just got to get people involved in art. The worst thing is if someone just walks in and out without seeing anything.' And here we begin to get to the heart or, if you like, the wool of it. For this is not just a chance remark to a passing reporter, but, in its Candide-like innocence, a declaration of faith. Hirst, along with so many of his art-student contemporaries, who took in the message, wide-eyed and open-mouthed at their mentors' feet, really does believe that 'it's got to get people involved in art.' There we have it. Art is nothing to do with the artist simply getting his work right in its own terms, and then leaving us to come to terms with it as experience of our own. Not at all. His job is to get us involved, to coerce us into attention. Anything less and his work, whatever its inherent qualities, is a wasted effort. Visual excitement, you see: 'the worst thing is if someone walks in and out without seeing anything.' The worst thing? The worst thing is only that the work should be no good. But there it is, and Hirst dutifully sets out to chivvy us to attention. He shows us the photographs of Hiroshi Sugimoto, of tableaux of murderers in the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's. He leans Andreas Slominski's bagman's bicycle against the wall, suitably over-hung with baskets, bags and panniers of all sorts. 'This work is extremely fragile' says the caption. He hangs Michael Joaquin Grey's orange fibreglass cast of Rodin's Balzac from the ceiling, upside down. The life-size photographs of tombstones by Sophie Calle are laid out upon the floor. A rubber shark by Ashley Bickerton, hung about with coconuts and plastic containers, is suspended by the tail in mid-air. So it goes on. Abigail Lane's manikin down-and-out slumps on the floor. Michael Joo slings expanding metal poles from wall to wall, wedging an eight-limbed plastic bear at one side, a rubber ball, a rubber testicle and a lychee nut at the other. Kiki Smith's 'Virgin Mary' is a standing wax figure, life-sized and flayed as though in anatomical demonstration. Such is the visual excitement that catches the breath and stops us leaving without seeing anything. And is it well done? Well, the photographs are photographs, the bicycle a bicycle, the metal poles metal poles, the sheep a sheep. Miss Smith perhaps could have done with some old-fashioned lessons in modelling the figure from life. The last word, perhaps, should be left to the show's apologist, Richard Shone, in his catalogue essay. 'An urge to bring order to chaos - the search for meaning in the seemingly random flux of experience - has existed as a fundamental human motivation throughout history . . . Works of art are one of the major sources of data in the explanation of this universal need.'

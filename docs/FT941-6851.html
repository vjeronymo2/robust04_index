			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Monday Interview: Lord Lawson's own U-turn - The former UK chancellor tells Peter Norman why his OECD candidacy has involved a change of heart Four and a half years after resigning as UK chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson is hankering to get back into public service. Not content with a highly regarded volume of memoirs, a modest portfolio of directorships and a seat in the House of Lords, he has set his sights on becoming secretary general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development when the post falls vacant in September. Lord Lawson's bid to head the 24-nation centre for economic analysis and co-operation among the world's leading industrial countries is not without chutzpah. In his memoirs, published only 18 months ago, he said the OECD had 'outlived its usefulness as an institution'. He dismissed its annual ministerial meeting as a 'talking shop' and 'a waste of time and money' that 'even causes member countries to maintain a full-time ambassador (to the organisation), ensconced in an expensive Paris residence'. But ensconced in the comfortable surroundings of his own Northamptonshire country home, Lord Lawson insists that he is just the man to move the OECD's operations 'up a gear'. Speaking for the first time on his candidacy, he says he could make it more useful to its member governments and more beneficial to the world economy. But what about those disparaging remarks in his memoirs? The view in his book was based on his experiences as a minister in the 1980s and he points out that he also singled out the organisation's economists for high praise. He has changed his mind about its potential because of dramatic changes in the world economy since then. The collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union, the expansion of the dynamic Asian economies, the world-wide consensus on the virtues of market economics and the emergence of a global economy 'to a greater extent than at any time since before the first world war' mean that there is 'a need and opportunity to try and create a new world order'. This world order, which would encompass countries inside and outside the OECD, 'would be based on the essence of its mission, which is the promotion of economic development through economic liberalisation. 'The liberalising mission is very much in accord with what has always been my own view of the most effective way to secure economic development and growth. Equally, the need or desirability of international co-operation is something which I subscribed to as a minister and indeed practised,' he says. The organisation, he says, has an opportunity to play a bigger role in fostering international economic co-operation and economic liberalisation. But hasn't the OECD already embarked on this course under Jean-Claude Paye, the quiet French diplomat who has been its secretary general since 1983? Although Lord Lawson says that Paye 'has done a very competent job', he says a secretary general is needed who would give more leadership at this juncture of world economic developments. The organisation's message could come across a lot more clearly. It would benefit from a rather higher profile, a less bureaucratic leadership and improved relations with member governments at a higher level. Moreover, Paye has held his post for 10 years and that 'is enough for anybody'. 'The OECD is not just a think-tank. An important element is the relationship between it and the member governments and the interplay between the two. That is absolutely critical. Because of my experience in government I could help that to work more effectively and have a closer relationship between it and the G7 for instance.' Involving governments in the organisation's work at a higher level would ensure that its economic research output would be properly fed into policy-making. Lord Lawson says a radical change of direction is not needed. But he wants to build on present strengths, in particular the expertise of its staff. 'Knowledge - as information, research, analysis - has become much more important than it was before. That is a key resource, rather than money,' he says. The fact that the OECD 'is not in the business of dispersing money is a strength rather than a weakness because it is focusing on economic issues and there are no distractions,' he contends. He points out that ministers and officials are far busier than they used to be and often caught up in crisis management. Its bureaucratic structure means that 'there is a danger of muffling the message, of producing an end product that is not commensurate with the amount of work that has gone into it'. Ministers need to be given work that is clearer, more concise and 'readily assimilable and relevant to their pre-occupations'. Although Lord Lawson speaks of making ministers' lives easier, he faces an uphill struggle to win the requisite support of the member states. There are three other contenders including Paye, the present incumbent. More ominous for the former chancellor is that the US, the biggest member with a 25 per cent stake in the organisation, is giving its support to Donald Johnston, a little-known Canadian. A protracted and unedifying period of inter-governmental haggling and horse-trading about the appointment is in prospect. Even though the secretary general's job is well endowed with pay and perks, one wonders why, at 61, Lord Lawson wants to decamp from his handsome new home to take up a post that could keep him hard at work until he is over 70. The urge to shape policy is in his blood, he says. The world economy is at a very exciting stage and he wants to be part of it. 'I took a decision that if I was going to play a part in this, I would want to play an active part. I wouldn't simply want to write about it,' Lord Lawson says.</p>

The U.S. lifting of the embargo on Vietnam must  have been prompted by economic realities in which the United  States realized that it can no longer afford to stand aloof by  Vietnam's golden market. Besides, the Vietnamese authorities  have shown positive and quick responses toward the solution of  the issue of U.S. soldiers missing in action (MIA's) in the  Vietnam war.    U.S. economic sanctions on Vietnam have been such an  agonizing shackle to the United States it may be said that they  applied economic sanctions on one another.    Therefore, while the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam has  long been envisaged, the decision on lifting the embargo had to  take into account how sincerely the Vietnamese Government pushed  ahead with the search for the remains of the 2,239 U.S. MIA's.  No matter how important the Vietnamese market may be, the  Clinton administration had to be sensitive to potential  criticism from the U.S. war veterans association and the  association of families of MIA's.    During his visit to Hanoi toward the end of last month,  however, (Charles Larson), commander of the U.S. Pacific Forces  who is charged with the search operation for the U.S. MIA's,  highly appraised the Vietnamese authorities' efforts in which  they even offered prize money. Adding that, "If the United  States normalizes relations with Vietnam, it will facilitate the  resolution of the MIA issue," he opened a way to lifting the  embargo.    Lawmakers of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee Appropriations  Subcommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee  Asia-Pacific Subcommittee visited Vietnam. Upon their return  home, they helped adopt a resolution calling for the lifting of  the embargo on Vietnam, thus enabling the government to lift the  embargo.    We can better understand the background behind the steps  taken in order to lift the embargo on Vietnam in view of the  fact that some 300 U.S. businesses, including such multinational  enterprises as Citibank, General Electric Co., and Mobile, have  arrived in Vietnam to begin their brisk marketing activities  there.    Since Vietnam introduced the doi moi renovation policy in  1986, along the lines of the former Soviet Union's perestroyka  and glasnost example, it has achieved an economic miracle with  an annual average economic growth rate of 7 percent from 1991 to  1993 and an annual inflation rate of 5 percent or lower from its  previous three-digit inflation rate. Vietnam's potential, no  doubt, is attractive to U.S. businesses.    With the lifting of the embargo, investment and cooperation  between the two countries is expected to increase in various  fields, such as in construction, real estate, finance,  manufacturing, and in petroleum and gas projects. Brisk  activities are already evident with Mobile's signing last  December of a contract to develop the (Tan Long) oil field.    However, the lifting of the embargo may not smoothly lead to  the complete normalization of relations, for the United States  will probably use the issue of normalizing diplomatic relations  as leverage in securing the initiative in negotiations on  pending issues, such as the MIA issue, the signing of an  investment guarantee agreement, the lifting of the freeze on  U.S. assets in Vietnam, and the human rights issue.    Following President Clinton's 4 February announcement of the  lifting of the embargo, he clarified that "This does not mean we  are normalizing relations," and this supports the above analysis.    Nevertheless, the U.S. lifting of the embargo on Vietnam may  well have considerable impact on the world, as well as the Asian  economy, because it is a signal heralding the official rebirth  of the Vietnamese market, which is called "Asia's last golden  market" second only to the Chinese market, in the Asian economic  sphere.</p>

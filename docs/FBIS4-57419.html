			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (EFE) -- Jose Francisco Pena  Gomez, leader of the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party  (PRD), which has made accusations of fraud in Monday's  elections, said today that it has "a civilian army" to see that  the "people's votes are not mocked."    "We do not accept the results" of the Central Electoral  Board  [JCE], which gives a small margin to President Joaquin Balaguer,  Pena Gomez said on a television program during which he  requested "a vote count tally sheet by tally sheet." He also  reiterated statements he made during the 1990 elections, when he  said: "We must prove fraud before we call for violence."</p>

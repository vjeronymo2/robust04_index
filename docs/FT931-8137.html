			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE derivatives sector ended an active week with a volatile session in the futures as the March contract on the FT-SE reacted to profit taking and favourable economic data, writes Joel Kibazo. March opened at 2,836 but soon moved ahead to 2,847 on sporadic buying. It however fell back as the expiry of the February index options approached at 10.30am. A call for further cuts in UK base rates from a group of economists again sent the contract moving forward, and buying was boosted by data showing a fall in German money supply. March maintained its upward momentum with the firm Wall Street opening before following New York lower. March finished at 2,837, up 2 on its previous close and at a 4 point discount to the underlying cash market. Volume was 9,371 lots. In the traded options, the expiry of the February index options was the main feature. Total volume was 23,662 lots of which 9,816 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 options.</p>

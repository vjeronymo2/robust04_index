			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Moslems furious at mosque destruction: Hindu temples attacked in neighbouring Islamic countries in retaliation for assault on Ayodhya shrine INDIA'S Moslem neighbours reacted furiously yesterday to the burning of the Ayodhya mosque in India on Sunday, as protests also came from Islamic communities in Britain and elsewhere. In advance of the action taken at dawn today by Indian police to drive out Hindu militants from the site of the mosque, Moslem protesters attacked Hindu temples and Indian shops and offices in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Moslem hardliners in Pakistan demanded a jihad, or holy war, against India. Police in the Pakistani city Karachi fought nearly 200 torch-wielding demonstrators who tried to set fire to a small Hindu temple. More than 30 temples were attacked across the country. Pakistan's government called for a one-day strike and peaceful rallies to be held today 'as a mark of protest against the desecration of the mosque'. The government handed a note of protest to the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad. After an emergency cabinet meeting, the government expressed its 'deep anguish and grave concern' at the mosque's destruction. Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister, said: 'The abhorrent act of extreme fanaticism deserves to be strongly condemned by all civilised countries and especially those which oppose religious intolerance and uphold human rights.' The government appealed to the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Countries to urge India to protect the rights of Moslems and their places of worship. The OIC last night urged Moslems to show restraint. The OIC statement, received in Cyprus, denounced the demolition as a 'heinous crime' and accused the state government of complicity in failing to protect Moslems. Security forces and police in Pakistan's main cities were last night guarding Hindu temples and police surrounded the Indian High Commission in Islamabad where students burned an effigy of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, Indian prime minister. In Lahore, protesters stormed an Air India office, dragging furniture into the streets and setting it on fire. Indian airline offices were also a focus of protest in Bangladesh, where thousands of Moslems broke through police cordons in Dhaka and set fire to a building. Paramilitary troops were called in as nearly 25,000 Moslems gathered outside Dhaka's Baitul Mokarram mosque. About 5,000 young men with iron rods and bomboo sticks tried to storm Dhaka National Stadium, but they were beaten back by police. Begum Khaleda Zia, prime minister, appealed to Bangladeshis to stay calm. 'Islam is a religion of peace. It teaches us to exercise restraint,' she said. Dhaka Mayor Mirza Abbas led a peace march by thousands of residents, calling for restraint and vigilance against possible communal violence. Leaders of the Islamic Constitution Movement in Bangladesh said the mosque's destruction was 'an unbearable shock'. It said: 'This has been an unpardonable challenge to Islamic faith in India and the Indian government will be responsible for its consequences.' In Afghanistan, Moslem rebels destroyed three Hindu temples and a Sikh holy place. There were reports of six more temples being burned elsewhere in the country. Britain's Foreign Office warned UK travellers to India that 'outbreaks of violence could occur anywhere across the country, particularly the northern states'. In Derby, England, a fire at a Hindu temple appeared to be related to the Indian violence. Hundreds of Pakistani and Indian Moslems closed their shops in the United Arab Emirates.  -----------------------------    Main religions practised  ----------------------------- Hindus               642m Moslems              120m Christians            18m Sikhs                 15m Buddhists              6m Others                 6m  -----------------------------</p>

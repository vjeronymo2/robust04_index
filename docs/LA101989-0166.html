			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO STOPPING HIM;  </P> <P> PARALYSIS DIDN'T END AN IRANIAN IMMIGRANT'S QUEST FOR U.S. CITIZENSHIP  </P> <P> Confined to living on life-support systems, a 59-year-old immigrant from Iran  realized a dream Wednesday when federal officials came to his Glendale home to  swear him in as a U.S. citizen.  </P> <P> "This was a wish that I had, and I did it," Hratch Petrossian said, speaking  with difficulty over the noise of his respirator. "I came here for the freedom.  Some emigres, they come to have a better life. That's not a crime. But for me,  freedom is more important."  </P> <P> Petrossian developed a degenerative nerve disease in 1981, one year after  coming to the United States. The affliction kept him from seeing much of this  country, but not from becoming a citizen.  </P> <P> Petrossian, an Armenian, is confined to a wheelchair -- paralyzed from the neck  down. He is hooked up to a respirator that does the work his atrophied  diaphragm cannot.  </P> <P> But Petrossian's mind works just fine, and he is a voracious reader who has  long been fascinated with the American system of government, his wife and  family said. He had applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in  vain for citizenship for more than two years. INS officials, unaware of his  disability, had repeatedly told him he had to come into the INS office to take  a citizenship exam.  </P> <P> A few months ago, when Petrossian's doctor wrote to the INS that his patient  could not leave his home, INS officials responded immediately. They came over  to Petrossian's apartment on Oct. 2 to administer the citizenship exam. With no  formal preparation, Petrossian answered every question correctly.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Los Angeles Federal Court Judge William P. Gray came to Petrossian's  home to swear him in and present him with a certificate showing he had passed  the citizenship exam.  </P> <P> With family gathered around him, drinking champagne and sharing Armenian  pastries and a cake decorated with the image of an American flag, Petrossian  smiled and kissed his wife and said he couldn't be happier.  </P> <P> "I have enjoyed every second of my life, because I believe that one has to be  positive," Petrossian said.  </P></p>

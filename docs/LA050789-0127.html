			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PLANE CARRYING AMERICANS CRASHES IN MEXICO JUNGLE; 6 KILLED  </P> <P> Six passengers were killed when a plane carrying American tourists lost power  in one engine and crash-landed in a remote jungle of the Yucatan Peninsula,  Mexican officials said Saturday.  </P> <P> The Aerocozumel flight was returning Friday afternoon to the Caribbean resort  island of Cozumel after taking the tourists to view ancient Indian ruins at  Chichen Itza, about 115 miles inland.  </P> <P> The plane crashed at 3:30 p.m. just outside Playa del Carmen about 20 miles  from the island of Cancun, the airline said. A federal police spokesman said  the pilot had radioed the Cancun airport that he was having engine problems.  </P> <P> Sixteen of the 18 people aboard the plane were believed to be American  tourists, said U.S. consul Bryant Salter.  </P> <P> Capt. Leonardo Tunchon of the Isla Mujeres naval sector, whose forces were  coordinating the rescue, said six people were killed. A Red Cross official said  the victims included two men and four women -- apparently all Americans.  </P> <P> "As far as we know, 16 passengers listed in the manifest all had U.S.  addresses, so we assume they're Americans," said Salter, U.S. consul in Merida,  capital of Yucatan state. He refused to disclose passenger names until next of  kin were notified.  </P> <P> In addition to the 16 tourists, the British-made Trislander aircraft carried a  pilot and a tourist guide, Salter said. The Excelsior news agency said the  aircraft, which was filled to capacity, lost power in one engine but was able  to crash-land.  </P> <P> Diego Acosta, commander of the Red Cross in Cancun, said the jungle terrain  hampered rescue operations, but authorities managed to airdrop food and  medicine until army troops could reach the crash site.  </P> <P> Red Cross worker Josefina Cardiel said the plane crashed inside a ravine in  thick jungle and troops had to clear a path to the site and then provide  rappelling equipment so that rescue workers could reach the plane.  </P></p>

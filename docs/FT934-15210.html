			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Charities defend campaigning role PROPOSALS to abolish charitable status and to split Britain's voluntary sector into service-delivery and campaigning charities, were attacked yesterday by charity leaders. The proposals are contained in a report by three former advisers to the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit. Although the report is not official policy, it is published and partly funded by the Home Office, and is based on one of the most extensive studies of the sector for 45 years. The report argues that charities providing welfare services under public contracts can no longer be regarded as conventional voluntary organisations. It says the sector should be divided into service and campaigning organisations. Ms Judy Weleminsky, director of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the sector's umbrella body, said the proposal was 'simplistic and destructive'. Mr Fred Heddell, chief executive of Mencap, the leading charitable provider of residential services for the mentally handicapped, said that the size and Pounds 60m turnover of his organisation brought 'power and political influence' which were vital in campaigning on behalf of disabled people. He said that if campaigning and service provision were split, much of Mencap's effectiveness would be lost. 'At a time when statutory services are failing to meet so many of the needs of people with a disability, it is irres-ponsible to make proposals which, if implemented, would throw the organisations that provide so much of the limited care available into structural turmoil,' said Mr Heddell. The government intends to study the report before reaching any conclusions. Mr Alun Michael, a Labour spokesman on home affairs, welcomed this cautious approach but said that splitting the sector would be 'bad in principle and dangerous in practice'. He said the government had shown 'unhealthy' signs of wanting to control the voluntary sector. A forum on the social economy organised in London yesterday by Unity Trust Bank agreed there was a need for a formal structure in which non-profit organisations could exchange ideas and information.

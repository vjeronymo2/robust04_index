			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: India in a single word OM AN INDIAN PILGRIMAGE by Geoffrey Moorhouse Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 16.99, 254 pages THE Mandukya Upanishad says, 'OM, this eternal word is all, what was, what is and what shall be, and what is beyond eternity. All is OM . . . It is beyond the senses and it is the end of evolution. It is nonduality and love. He goes with self to the supreme Self who knows this, who knows this.' Geoffrey Moorhouse has made many passages to India in the past 25 years; the latest was to South India in 1992 and the outcome is this book. OM falls somewhere between VS Naipaul and Jan Morris. If I were marooned on a desert island I would not ask for OM, but I would take it with me on a train or an aircraft journey. Its unhurried pace, gentle melancholy and occasional flintiness would ease the tedium of a long flight. Moorhouse gives an honourable reason for his 1992 trip to India: 'And here I am again, on a further stage of my own Indian pilgrimage, hoping to understand something more of the great subcontinent. Also, trying to find another part of myself'. It is entirely possible for a man to find his spiritual home in another country. The key word is 'understanding'. Writers from the West so often come either to applaud or to condemn. Others get smitten by India's holy men, many of whom are dedicated frauds. Those who seek understanding are rare. Ancient India lives on in South India. It is refreshing to find an author spending three months visiting 12 cities and towns, none boasting the false glamour and synthetic liveliness of Bombay or Delhi. Moorhouse, it appears to me, has caught the spirit of the south. He has got Madras just right. He is excellent on Pondichery, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and the Mother (I had a brief glimpse of her in 1956. She inspired neither admiration nor awe in me. Sai Baba also gets a benign dose of Moorhouse scepticism.) OM has some utterly beautiful passages. The first sentence in the book conquers the heart and soothes the mind. Stand on the southernmost tip of India at Kanya Kumari, he writes, 'this is where India begins. On this curve of land, whose stained shore is washed by the jade green sea, an entire subcontinent is poised as if upon a sharpened point.' India helped Moorhouse to some extent to come to terms with personal grief: 'India . . . has taught me no longer to strain and fret against my inadequacy; for India was above anywhere else, the land where every distinction of faith, every equivocation, every contradiction, every doubt, every reticence was commonplace . . . I said my last prayer (at San Thome) in India and asked that I might be allowed to return.' OM is a sensitively written book by a man whose knowledge of India, her religions, her past, her literature, is both vast and deep. A very worthwhile read.</p>

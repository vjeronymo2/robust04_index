			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / BA's global hopes hit by collapse of Dollars 750m USAir deal BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday suffered a severe setback in its ambitions to become a global airline with the collapse of its proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 487m) investment in a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. Both BA and USAir said they would attempt to forge an alternative deal in the new year after their proposed alliance was blocked by a US-UK government dispute over liberalising air services between the two countries. BA said it had decided to pull out of the proposed partnership with USAir because of 'excessive demands' by the US government to give US carriers greater access to the UK market. Under pressure from the three largest US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - the US government had insisted that the UK open up London's Heathrow airport to more US airline services in return for approval of the BA-USAir deal. The UK government in turn had offered a three-phase process of liberalising air services between the two countries which would have led to 'open skies' only after the US eased its rigid foreign ownership rules in US carriers. BA said the UK government 'quite rightly' had been unwilling to make 'unwarranted and unilateral concessions' to the US. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, said talks between the two countries had broken down because 'the US demanded immediate and unlimited access to the UK market while maintaining high protective barriers to its own market - which is 40 per cent of air transport worldwide'. The UK Department of Transport said talks to liberalise air travel between Britain and the US would continue. Mr Andrew Card, the US transport secretary, confirmed in Washington that he would 'probably not have approved the deal'. There was no need for him to take a decision following BA's withdrawal, he said. Mr Card said the existence of an open market for US carriers was a crucial element in any decision on whether to allow foreign investments in US airlines. 'BA, had this transaction been approved, would have had immediate access to the entire US market. Our carriers would not have had access to the entire UK market,' he argued. USAir, like BA, also expressed disappointment over the collapse of the deal. But Mr Seth Schofield, USAir chief executive, stressed his carrier would 'continue to discuss alternative arrangements with BA and evaluate other opportunities'. USAir officials declined to speculate on what other avenues the carrier might pursue, although it has talked to Germany's Lufthansa in the past. It has made clear it does not see a future in remaining a regional US carrier.

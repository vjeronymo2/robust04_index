			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (4): A happy band of users is most important - Justifying the investment, hardware mistakes prompt need for greater prudence MANUFACTURING industry, in particular in the UK, has made large errors in buying computer hardware and software. It is not alone. Other sectors, such as retailing and finance, have also made their fair share of mistakes. However, with hindsight, manufacturing should to be able to invest more prudently. There are signs that this is happening. The biggest breakthrough for medium-sized and large manufacturers has been recognising what is needed for a successful computer system. It matters little how rigorously the investment is justified or which manufacturing system is chosen. What is important, and obviously so, is having a happy group of users in sales, purchasing, on the shop-floor and throughout the rest of the organisation. Users are likely to be more satisfied if they are allowed to decide what they want from a system and are then involved in its selection and, finally, are trained in its use. The steps are simple. They always have been but, until recently, they have been by-passed. The reasons are complex but boil down to money and power. The justification for spending large sums on computer systems was much easier than it is today. In the past, computers were mainly labour-saving devices and the cost benefits could be calculated quickly. Now manufacturers want computer systems that are integrated and intelligent. They want the vast amount of information that they have collected on their mainframe machines to be accessible to management to give an up-to-date picture of the company's performance that can be viewed in any amount of detail. 'These are big projects where many of the benefits are intangible and it is very hard to put numbers on them,' says Mr Roderick Roy, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte's manufacturing consulting group. 'Companies have to weigh up the risk of not doing it,' he adds. For very complex projects some large manufacturers are turning to financial modelling to determine the impact of their investment on the business. This is a lengthy process but there are PC-based computer programs to help and, if these fail, the decision-makers have access to another well-used method of investment justification. The method is described delicately as business acumen or, more coarsely, as gut-feel. Whether the project is small or large, the most common failing in manufacturing is to underestimate the cost of implementation. Typically, manufacturing systems for controlling inventory or production take a year or two before they are fully up and running. During that time the project has to be managed and people trained. Often neither happens to a great enough extent. Investment in information technology should be equalled by the investment in implementation, insists Mr Alan Toplis, a partner with Price Waterhouse. 'If anyone tells you it is less, don't believe them. I've seen companies driven to the brink of bankruptcy because they couldn't implement their systems,' he says. Power or the corporate pecking order has also stopped users getting what they want. Data processing departments, historically, have been closer to the financial director than production and, therefore, have had considerable influence on a company's computer strategy. Much of the time they have dictated what hardware was needed and what software they would develop. When they were only responsible for jobs such as payroll, pensions and sales order processing, it was of minor concern to people running the factory. All that changed when the processing departments started developing manufacturing resources planning packages for their mainframe computers. They were convinced that these packages could cut the cost of manufacture by reducing, among other things, inventory, work-in-progress and lead times. Some of these systems have been successful. However, many have not. Mr Brian Entwistle, general manager of British Aerospace's software development arm, BAeCam, blames the processing department's liking for mainframes which could not (and still cannot) process information fast enough for it to reflect the realities on the shop-floor. A parallel argument is that the department should not have been trying to computerise the complexities of the shop-floor. Rather that manufacturing should have simplified its operations first. So the divide between the processing department and manufacturing has been created. It has been maintained by the large computer suppliers which have the ears of important people in the processing department and a vested interest in expanding the centralised mainframe strategy. It has also been supported by top management which operated, like the computer systems, in an hierarchical manner. Bridging the gulf has been a lengthy job. It required people to admit they had made mistakes and management to take back the control of its computer systems' investments which it had relinquished to the processing department. Some manufacturers have quietly done this. However, the numbers that are clinging to the old way are sufficiently large for disaster stories to abound. Most of the tales of woe have a common theme: in-house software development. The issue is rarely whether or not the spending was justified and benefits enumerated. Almost always it is the processing department's insistence that manufacturing's requirements can only be met by bespoke software. For most commercial and basic manufacturing applications there is now 'very little justification for developing your own software', says Mr Toplis. Generic packages typically match about 80 per cent of a company's requirements. The most up-to-date packages can then be tailored (in consultation with the users) to deliver much or all of the rest. 'They work,' says Mr Roy. 'They also strip years off the implementation process which pulls all the benefits forward.' If manufacturing is to get any satisfaction from its computer investments the relationship between the board, the processing department and users, especially in the factory, must change. It is fashionable to knock the company's information technology people (sometimes rightly so) for their dictatorial attitude. But, equally, the people running the factory have been silent in their suffering. The processing department should offer a service to the users and 'provide a framework in which they can operate', says Mr Roy. Users should be prepared to be more vocal about what they want and their working procedures. Management should minimise the fear of change and of admitting mistakes among its staff. 'More than ever it is important for manufacturers to learn from the past, says Mr Roy. Formal audits after a computer system has been running for a couple of years will pinpoint what has and has not been achieved (from the users' perspective). They have not been favoured in the past, again because people were reluctant to reveal the reality of their decisions. But, as the rate of change of computer technology quickens, manufacturers can guarantee that they will be going through another systems buying cycle in a few years. Armed with this type of information and a multi-disciplined working group with access to the board, selecting the right system for the users will not be easy but it will have a better chance of success.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Trends in expenditure on manufacturing management                    applications by sector (UK Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Industry                   Last 12 months     Next 12 months  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mechanical Engineering           98.3            102.9 Instrument Engineering           85.7             27.3 Elec./ Elec.

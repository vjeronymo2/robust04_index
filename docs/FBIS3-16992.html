He added that the territorial question "was not discussed in  detail" in the talks. But the premier voiced the hope that this  question will be resolved sooner or later: "We will, all the  same, arrive at the conclusion of a peace treaty between our  countries," and the resolution of the territorial problem is one  of the preconditions for concluding it.    Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists that questions of  developing cooperation in the economic sphere were mainly  discussed with the Japanese foreign minister. "It is pleasant,"  the premier said, "that the Japanese side is increasing its  efforts to support our reforms."    Replying to a question about the possibility of transforming  the "seven" leading industrially developed countries into the  "eight" with the participation of Russia, Tsutomu Hata said  that, since the G-7 will hold its summit in Naples this summer,  Italy might play the chief role in resolving this question. In  general, Russia's joining the G-7 must be examined within the  framework of precisely this group of countries. The minister  added that, mindful of Russia's growing influence in  contemporary international politics, as particularly manifested  in the resolution of the Bosnian crisis, Japan ought to have  closer contacts with Russia.    Then Tsutomu Hata held talks with Andrey Kozyrev, head of  the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and met with State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin.    According to Japanese diplomatic sources, the most important  issue during the visit was to advance a two-way dialogue in  accordance with the principles enshrined in the "Tokyo  declaration," which was adopted last October during Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan.    In conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent a Japanese  Foreign Ministry staffer did not rule out the possibility that  the dialogue between Moscow and Tokyo might be continued at the  highest level this year.</p>

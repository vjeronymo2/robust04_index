			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Letter: Brewers are still brewing Philip Rawstorne ('OFT is promised pub checklist', November 3) is incorrect when he states that regional brewers Boddingtons and Devenish have closed their breweries. The Boddingtons brewery was sold to Whitbread, since when it has never been busier. And Devenish's Redruth brewery was bought by its management and now produces beer both for the local pub trade and the national take-home business. Rawstorne is correct to point out that beer prices in pubs have continued to rise faster than inflation and that the major brewers' grip on the UK beer market has increased. The long-term supply agreements negotiated by the major brewers with many of the new pub companies need Office of Fair Trading investigation.

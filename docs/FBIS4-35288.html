			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The House of Representatives this morning  started the sessions of the first period of the first round of  its second annual term under brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn  al-Ahmar, the House speaker.    On the occasion of the House starting its second annual  term,  the brother House of Representatives speaker delivered a speech  in which he congratulated the House of Representatives members  and the Yemeni people on the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth  unity anniversary, which will remain a shining point in the  history of our people and a major turning point in their blessed  march.    The House of Representatives speaker noted that the  parliamentary elections of 27 April [1993] provided clear  evidence of our people's awareness and sound instincts. These  elections, he said, produced a new political reality in the  Yemeni arena.    The House of Representatives speaker noted that the  secessionist group in the Socialist Party leadership, which led  the country to war and infighting, had also directed its  poisonous arrows against the House of Representatives by taking  advantage of its positions in the state's executive agencies,  despite the fact that the House had to put up with a great deal  of arrogance from some of these leaders out of concern for the  march of goodness and prosperity, and out of concern for  national unity.    After that, the House reviewed and approved the agenda of  the  current parliamentary term. The House also listened to and  approved the minutes of the last session of the previous  parliamentary term.    The House then listened to a letter addressed to it by  Justice Minister 'Abdallah Ahmad Ghanim on the public actions  committed by Ahmad 'Ubayd Bin-Daghr, Anis Hasan Yahya, Haydar  Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, Salim Muhammad Jubran, Qasim 'Abd-al-Rabb,  and Muhammad 'Ali al- Qayrahi, including the crimes of violating  the Constitution, attacking citizens and private and public  property, issuing orders in contravention of the law, and  organizing rebellion against the public order despite being  members of the House. He said confirmed information on these  acts were received from the Defense Ministry, the Interior  Ministry, and other parties.    The justice minister's letter to the House states:    We appreciate your positive response to allow us to take the  legal measures against them in accordance with your  prerogatives, as stipulated in the Constitution, and in  accordance with Article 64-F. [passage omitted] In accordance  with the aforementioned articles and following your permission,  the Public Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against these  persons, as well as others. We hope you will take measures to  inform the House of these details in accordance with the  aforesaid articles. We will keep your esteemed House informed  of all developments.    The House then discussed the Public Prosecutor's report  which  was referred to it by the justice minister. Following a lengthy  discussion of this subject, the matter was referred to the  Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee to study it in an  urgent manner and to present a ruling to the House on the  request to deprive the members mentioned in the justice  minister's memorandum on their immunity, in accordance with the  Constitutional texts and the House of Representatives bylaws  issued by Law No. 5 of 1990.    The people's deputies then discussed al-Bid's declaration  of secession. The House members, including members of the  Yemeni Socialist Party bloc, stressed that the declaration of  secession by al-Bid and his gang is a stab in the heart of every  Yemeni. Members stressed that the war is between unity and the  enemies of unity and that everyone supports unity, and that the  people will sacrifice everything dear to protect it.    The House also stressed the need to preserve democracy and  Constitutional legitimacy and its absolute rejection of any  foreign intervention in the Republic of Yemen's internal  affairs, because any intervention or recognition of the  secessionist gang only expresses a flagrant animosity against  the entire Yemeni people and a hostility against their  Constitutional and democratic institutions.    The House set up a committee comprising House Members Yahya  'Ali (al-Ra'i), 'Abdallah Sharaf (al-Humaydi), Yahya Mansur  Abu-Usba', Muhammad 'Abdallah (al-Kifli), Mansur Ahmad Sayf,  Muhammad Naji ('Allaw), 'Abdu Muhammad al-Zanadi, Muhammad Yahya  Hammud (al- Sharafi) to draft a statement refuting the  declaration of secession, stressing the need to protect unity  through all means, and urging all states, particularly Arab  states, to support unity and [words indistinct] overcome the  sedition that was fabricated by some elements that have turned  against the Constitution and legitimacy and against the will of  the people as expressed by the elections of 27 April 1993.    The House also set up a committee including members  'Abdallah  'Ali (Sa'tar), Muhammad 'Ali Ba Musallam, Sultan Sa'id (al-  Barakani), 'Abdallah Mahdi 'Abdu, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Rawhani, and  Sultan (Sayyan al-'Adwani) to draft letters to the Arab League,  the UN secretary general, and to the parliaments of the  fraternal and friendly states.    The House also asked the government to send the brother  foreign minister to attend the House's session tomorrow, Sunday  [29 May], to explain the political situation concerning the  developments in our country so that the parliament can take the  necessary steps.    Today's session was attended by brother Dr. 'Abd-Salam  Khalid  Salman, minister of legal affairs and minister of the House of  Representatives affairs. The House will resume its sessions  tomorrow, God willing.</p>

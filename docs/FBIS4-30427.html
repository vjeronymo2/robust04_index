			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Abrupt Reference to North Korean-U.S. Summit </F> Talks"]    [Text] The U.S. secretary of state's reference to a North  Korean-U.S. summit heralds an important change in the U.S.  policy to the North. Although Secretary Christopher says that  North Korea should change its attitude before the summit can be  held, his remark is all the more noteworthy because we are at a  critical point in our endeavor to resolve the North Korean  nuclear issue. Moreover, because the remark was made by someone  who is responsible for U.S. foreign policy, we are even led to  suspect that since the recent North Korean peace overture, some  secret exchange of messages might have taken place between North  Korea and the United States.    If such a secret exchange of messages was not made, we can  hardly understand why the United States suggests the possibility  of another summit now that the inter-Korean summit talks have  been agreed on. We do not object to the ending of many years of  hostile relations between Washington and Pyongyang and the  U.S.-North Korean diplomatic negotiations after the North Korean  nuclear issue is ultimately resolved. The ROK support for  sanctions on North Korea was not for the sake of sanctions  themselves; it was to induce North Korea to negotiate. The ROK,  more than the United States, must take the lead in inducing the  closed and isolated North Korea to become a responsible member  of the international community. This is so because it is a  national problem directly connected to our survival.    This being the case, it would not be too late to hold a  North  Korean-U.S. summit after the inter-Korean summit is held and  after meaningful progress between Seoul and Pyongyang is made.  At present, only the date has been agreed on for the third  round North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, and the two sides have  yet to negotiate on the key agenda items. North Korea has only  expressed its willingness to freeze its nuclear program, but the  United States is hastily moving to bring a package solution to  the pending political and military issues.    The U.S. strategic team should in the first place verify the  truth behind North Korea's abrupt tactical change. They should  find out why North Korea suddenly changed its stance toward  dialogue with the proposal to freeze its nuclear program. They  should know that with such a tactical change, North Korea  intends to incapacitate the ROK, rather than resolve the nuclear  issue, with the assertion on the "mutual troop reduction to  100,000 men" and to get the U.S. troops withdrawn from the ROK  with the "peace agreement." The United States should not make  the mistake of being implicated in a peace gesture North Korea  habitually employs and of naively accepting the North Korean  proposal without a safety-proof device.    Peace will not settle on the Korean peninsula even if  dialogue and talks are conducted while the problems connected  with the security of the country are being overlooked. The  United States might even find itself giving a tacit approval to  North Korea's nuclear armament. North Korea's tricky peace  overture and the easy-going U.S. policy toward the North as  evidenced by Secretary Christopher's remark "We can hold summit  talks with North Korea" can cause a rift in the ROK-U.S.  cooperative alliance in dealing with the North Korean nuclear  issue. What the ROK and the United States need at present is to  reconfirm their unshakable diplomatic and security cooperative  alliance. The U.S. foreign policy authorities should not forget  that the abrupt reference to the North Korean-U.S. summit at  this point could lead the United States to be fooled by the  North Korean peace offensive.</p>

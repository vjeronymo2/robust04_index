			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, YOSEMITE!  </P> <P> I am in love with Yosemite Valley and have been since my parents introduced me  to it in the mid-1930s. I care very much about the preservation of our great  natural areas such as Yosemite, and I want for them the kind of management that  will maintain them for future generations -- but offer them for the first-hand  enjoyment of these future generations. It takes a Curry Co. to do that.  </P> <P> ROBERT M. CUTSHALL  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Excerpt] Israeli authorities have approved the return of  all Fatah Central Committee members to the self-rule area.  AL-DUSTUR has learned that 15 Central Committee members will  accompany President Yasir 'Arafat when he returns to the Gaza  Strip.    Informed sources have told AL-DUSTUR that the Israeli  authorities have excluded Major General Muhammad Jihad from  those who were allowed to return. Maj. Gen. Muhammad Jihad  leads the hardliners within Fatah who oppose negotiations with  Israel and any agreements that result from them.    The informed military sources said this hardline trend  comprises many military people. It works within Fatah against  the negotiations and is active at Fatah Central Committee and  Revolutionary Council meetings in support of a reinvigorated  intifadah. [passage omitted]</p>

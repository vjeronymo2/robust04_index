			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / The Long View: When inflation gatecrashes INFLATION, they tell me, is yesterday's problem. It cannot possibly revive in today's slump-time economy. I hope they are right; but I have seen inflation reappear so often and so assertively as the answer, by default, to Britain's stubborn problems, that I will need a lot of convincing. Inflation does not need an invitation or an encouragement. It has to be locked out firmly. No politician ever said in public that he or she wanted higher inflation or a devaluation of the pound. Nor were they ever forecast by the Treasury. A man from Mars might, therefore, be surprised that these burdens could ever be visited upon us (although Essex man would not). Here is a quote: 'To curb inflation remains our first priority.' Who said it? It could have been the chancellor of the exchequer, Norman Lamont, at the Conservative Party conference on Thursday but, actually, it was Anthony Barber, then also chancellor, in the House of Commons on June 23 1972 - the day that sterling was allowed to dive down out of the European Community's original currency 'snake.' His next sentence gave the game away: 'We have set our national economy on the path of a 5 per cent rate of expansion.' As he spoke, the year-on-year inflation rate was 6 per cent. For comparison, in the next three 12-month periods the rates were 9.7 per cent, 16.5 per cent and 26.1 per cent. Some priority. These days there are, of course, no fantasies about 5 per cent growth (although, in its more deranged moments, the Treasury projects 3.5 per cent). But might not plain economic recovery be a more powerful priority for politicians? June 1972, when sterling was devalued by about 7 per cent, probably provides the closest historical parallel to September 1992 when the depreciation was rather larger. What Lamont actually said on Thursday was that his objective remained 'to bring inflation down and hold it there.' Whatever one's scepticism, there are strong reasons for believing that the inflationary consequences will not be nearly as serious this time. Bill Martin, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - whose economic forecasts have been much more accurate than most and who, as one of the Liverpool Six, both recommended and predicted sterling's exit from the ERM - sees inflation holding at 3 per cent through 1994. He admits, though, that there is still plenty of scope for things to go wrong. But few, if any, of the leading economists ever predicted the scale of the inflationary surges of 1974, 1980 and 1990. There were always reasons - wage and price controls, or recession - for believing that the worst could never happen. Dare I add that many of the best economists are employed by bond-broking houses which have a strong commercial interest in playing down fears about inflation? It is true that there is a deep recession now, but it has been going on for two years. During that period, unemployment has risen by 1.1m, real GDP has contracted by 3 per cent, and money GDP has risen by just 7 per cent. But average pay for those still in work has risen 14 per cent. When a labour market operates like that, it is hard to see that inflation can be regarded as dead, especially as the implied contraction in company profitability will have to be reversed as soon as better conditions return. In the middle of September, the outside world decided that the British economy was worth about 15 per cent less than the British government claimed. Such a devaluation implies a fall in real incomes in Britain. We shall now see whether that will stick, or whether the average man will attempt to maintain his real standard of living. True, monetary growth has slowed recently: broad money growth has fallen to about 6 per cent year-on-year. But a great deal of money has been created in the past few years - enough to finance an inflationary surge should conditions encourage it. Foreigners already have been taught a harsh lesson for their foolishness in believing that a British government might place a high priority on safeguarding the external value of the UK currency. Historically, overseas investors had to be mad to buy British government bonds as anything other than a short-term punt. But soon after the UK entered the ERM, many international investors decided that it might be different this time, and they started to accumulate gilts within their broader European bond portfolios. Overseas investors bought close to Pounds 10bn net of gilts between the beginning of 1991 and July this year; and although they dumped Pounds 1.2bn in August, and no doubt some more in September (there are no figures yet), they must now have lost the equivalent of a good Pounds 1bn on their remaining holdings. Perhaps they asked for trouble. They could have bought DM bonds but thought that sterling bonds, giving a slightly higher interest rate, offered more scope; they actually outperformed in the early part of the year. But foreign investors now will conclude once again that, whenever the going gets tough, the British government reneges on its obligations in real terms. Indeed, there is a practical penalty in that the prospects for the UK being able to borrow overseas through issues of sterling-denominated paper are now bleak. Meanwhile, Lamont chooses to emphasise a minor recovery in consumer spending, and newspapers are exploring eagerly the possibility that lower interest rates will trigger a recovery in house prices. This does not yet feel like a post-inflationary society. I close with another look back to that inflationary mid-summer 20 years ago. The FT's leader column of June 24 observed that the government's anti-inflation policy was unclear. 'Unless it acts quickly and decisively in this field, the decision to float could turn out in the end to have done more harm than good.' I feel much the same way.</p>

Markova; UDC 621.382] </F>   [Abstract] Based on the methods of parallel  microprogramming, a method is proposed for transformation of a  two-dimensional structure into a three-dimensional. Two options  are described here of the proposed multiplication algorithm of  two integer n-digit numbers with a fixed comma. Using these  algorithms, structural multiplier circuits on electrooptical  programmable logic array (PLA) are designed with a different  number of layers k&gt;  2p, where p is the number of logic layers,  and the complexity of their implementation are estimated. The  fundamental concepts of parallel microprogramming and the basic  multiplication algorithm of integer n-dimensional numbers are  described. Single layer electrooptical models of the proposed  and the developed multipliers are discussed. Different  stratification options of the multipliers and the difficulties  involving their realization with electrooptical programmable  logic arrays are also discussed.

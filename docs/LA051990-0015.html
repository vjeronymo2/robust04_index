			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIVING A NEIGHBORHOOD NIGHTMARE;  </P> <P> SQUATTERS: LIVING NEXT DOOR TO AN ABANDONED HOUSE IS AN EYE-OPENING,  SOUL-WRENCHING EXPERIENCE.  </P> <P> I have led a sheltered life, and guarded. From this second-story room, up among  the trees, images of postcard Hollywood -- the boulevard, the famous sign,  mansions on the hills -- float in the distance.  </P> <P> Directly below is a flat bungalow surrounded by a tall wire fence. The house is  boarded up, but not abandoned. The courtyard, hidden back from the street, is  laid out like a stage. Its props are a shifting congregation of mattresses,  piles of bottles and shoes, two shopping carts, a wheelchair twisted in a heap.  </P> <P> For the past year, from the safety of my room, I have watched this house, once  the home of a good friend, become a "squat" for the city's homeless, a  no-man's-land adrift inside a fence, the edge of civilization as I have known  it.  </P> <P> It was a descent of ordered stages. The owner sold the house to a developer;  soon after came the tenants' eviction notice, a truck to move belongings, a few  beers, a few goodbys. The doors were locked, the keys were left inside. But  that evening I saw the front door hanging, handle smashed, off its hinges. A  candle flickered on the mantle; there was a murmur of low, furtive voices. I  stopped on the threshold, afraid to go inside.  </P> <P> The police didn't hesitate. They marched through the rooms with a thorough,  weary purpose. A few kids, red-eyed, were dragged out, then scattered into the  night. In half an hour, they were back. In a week, the house was destroyed. In  daylight, neighbors joined the pillage. Children rode their bicycles through  the rooms, the fixtures were pried from the walls and carried off, the  courtyard filled up with wire, pipes and broken glass. At night the street kids  took over.  </P> <P> Then one day, a truck with Sonora plates pulled up and a Mexican family moved  into the house. The father and his two sons had the trespassers out in short  order. The family began to fix up the place as best they could. The broken  windows were boarded over, the trash in the courtyard was bagged up and carted  away.  </P> <P> They were friendly people. Still, there was a hesitation in the greetings we  exchanged over the fence. In truth, they were squatters, too. But no one  bothered them, and for the week or so they lived there, the house was clean and  quiet. Then one morning, early, they were gone.  </P> <P> Within hours the kids were back, but in a few days a new group, tougher and  louder, took over. They were in turn replaced by a crew of veteran street  people, crazed from years of homelessness. Then came the gangs. It was cave  politics: The wild replaced the peaceable, the crazies pushed out the wild  until, within a month, only the wildest and craziest remained.  </P> <P> What went on inside the ruined rooms, I could only imagine. From my window, I  saw enough: On the roof, gang bangers sunned themselves, their weapons close at  hand; down in the courtyard, the house's dump and common toilet, the losers,  too old or sick or spacey to fight their way inside, sprawled on filthy  mattresses, drifting in lower limbo.  </P> <P> Still, the shelter and safety of the courtyard was preferable to the street.  Every day a steady stream of newcomers camped inside the yard. Men and women,  sometimes children, squatted in corners, cooked on fires fed with kindling from  the house, or slept in the shade of a small poinsettia bush, still blooming  brightly.  </P> <P> Every night the smell of wine wafted across the fence. Shouts and cursing rose  from the courtyard in contrast to the eerie stillness which enveloped the  house. From the windows, gang members scanned the street with a casual posture  that seemed to say we neighbors weren't worth mugging.  </P> <P> What could be done? The owner, his luxury-apartment project mired in delays,  claimed that securing the property was impossible. And from my city councilman  I received only a copy of his note to the developer requesting that he clean up  the garbage.  </P> <P> The crowd inside the fence grew larger, wilder. Once I counted 25 people  rolling around inside the property. Sleep was impossible. At night I lay  listening to the howls from the courtyard, so angry, so chaotic -- and so  close.  </P> <P> When a crisis flared -- a fight, or the sound of a gunshot -- I dialed 911. I  did so with hesitation. Phoning the police was like calling in an air strike;  you could never be sure with what force the impact would arrive, or where or  when. Sometimes the cruisers would arrive in minutes, sometimes not at all. The  cops themselves were often unpredictable. One time I saw an officer patiently  help a youth fill his shopping cart and press some money into his hand, and  once I stood behind the fence -- my fists clenched -- as a cop flung a drunken  man head-first into a wall. But always, a few minutes after the cruisers had  gone, the courtyard and then the house filled up again.  </P> <P> By summer's end a natural evolution was taking its course. The bungalow was  falling apart, its timbers sagging, roof torn away. The gang moved on; in the  flatland of Hollywood, newer squats were opening up on every block. Eventually  only three tired souls, a woman and two men, remained down in the courtyard.  Amid the trash and stench, they slept all day, in dreadful quiet. It was as if  the property, a carcass first set upon by wolves, had been abandoned to the  worms.  </P> <P> Finally a crew from the Department of Building and Safety arrived one day and  boarded up the house -- ironically, now destined to be razed for a low-income  project. A tall wire fence was strung along the property line. For a few days I  found the fence ripped and torn in places, then the house was left alone,  inhabited only by pigeons rustling in the eaves.  </P> <P> From my room I still keep watch; I have become the house's caretaker. There is  a hole in the back fence, small enough to crawl through, and when it rains  enough to keep the dust down, I slip inside the courtyard to clear up what's  left behind. There is the blackened fire pit, bottles sloshing with wine and  cigarette butts, a blanket smeared with waste. I pick it up and place it in a  bag, move on down the property line. A drop of rain falls on my wrist, that  separates my house from this.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXT OF NEW TRAVEL RULES  </P> <P> Following is the full text of East Germany's announcement on allowing its  citizens to travel abroad or emigrate if they wish. The translation of the  official ADN news agency dispatch was by Reuters news agency:  </P> <P> The government spokesman told ADN the Council of Ministers of East Germany has  decided immediately to set in force the following stipulations for private  journeys and permanent emigration until a corresponding parliamentary law comes  into effect:  </P> <P> 1. Private journeys into foreign countries can be applied for without  fulfilling preconditions (reasons for travel, relatives). Permission will be  given at short notice.  </P> <P> 2. The relevant passport and registration offices of the regional offices of  the People's Police in East Germany have been ordered to issue visas for  permanent emigration immediately without the present preconditions for  permanent emigration having been fulfilled. Application for permanent  emigration is also possible as before at departments of internal affairs.  </P> <P> 3. Permanent emigration is allowed across all border crossing points between  East Germany and West Germany and West Berlin and East Berlin.  </P> <P> 4. Because of this (new ruling), the temporary issuing of permits in East  German missions abroad and permanent emigration using East German identity  cards through third countries will no longer apply.  </P></p>

After about five years in development, the North American  company American Superconductor in Westborough, Massachusetts,  has introduced the prototype of a superconducting high-current  cable made of high-temperature superconductors (HTSC) and  measuring one meter [in length]. An initial test cable with a  total length of about 30 meters should be completed in about one  year in cooperation with the Italian company Pirelli Cable in  Milan.    This cable will then be able to be used for the first time  in  practical tests in power supply companies. It is hoped that in  two years a one hundred meter long cable will be completed,  which could then be put into trial operation. The cable  corresponds approximately to the requirements for smaller power  supply grids in terms of currents to be carried and the  resultant magnetic field intensity.    The developer reports that a direct current of 2,300 amps  per  fiber can be transmitted, which is approximately double the  value of comparable HT superconductors from other developers.  The magnetic fields in the order of 0.2 tesla resulting at these  current intensities are sustained without the superconductor  breaking at operating temperatures of 77 kelvin.    The cable now being introduced consists of oxides of  bismuth,  strontium, calcium and copper, which are filled in power form in  tubes made of silver and then subjected to the required heat and  acid treatment. Finally the tubes are drawn out to fine  filaments with a diameter of 200 micrometers using a drawing  process developed [by the producer].    The test cable is then weaved together by hand from hundreds  of the fine fibers. The North American superconductor company  has so far been able to produce a filament of this type with a  total length of nearly 1,000 meters.    In this collaboration, the Italian cable producer took on  the  task of putting together the cable with the electric and thermal  isolation. The cable is to have a hollow space at its center  through which the liquid nitrogen used for cooling will be  pumped.    Pirelli also intends to develop with an Italian engineering  company a new machine which can weave the fine filaments  together automatically.    Energy experts estimate that power supply companies will be  able to install the first shorter lengths of direct current  cable in ten years at the earliest; however, the behavior of the  cable will have to be closely monitored for some years before it  can live up to all the technical and safety requirements.    [Experts] are also of the view that it will not be for about  50 years at the earliest that we can think of replacing the  high- voltage operated alternating current transmission supply  lines with superconducting direct current cable, according to  the American Superconductor Corporation (Westborough,  Massachusetts 01581, USA).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Myong-chol] </F>   [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's  economic policy is aimed at building "a new economy" based on  the people's creative participation, a striking shift from the  past military-based administrations' policies for economic  growth on the basis of government control and guidance. Under  this policy, the Kim government has embarked on various reform  programs designed to develop the economy's growth potential with  a small but efficient government since he took office last  February.    Kim's economic team, led by former Economic Planning  Minister  Yi Kyong-sik and Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic  Affairs Pak Chae-yun, worked out an initial 100-day plan to  stimulate the economy by removing controls on business  activities. After the plan's completion in early July, the team  drafted a new five-year blueprint stressing development of the  economy's growth potential.    Under the 100-day plan, the government took measures for  increased corporate investment, small business restructuring,  technological renovation, elimination of red tape and price  stabilization of basic prices. Thanks to these measures, the  economy began to pick up, with increasing corporate investment  in equipment and plants.    On Aug. 12, however, the economy felt shock waves from the  surprise announcement of an emergency presidential order  requiring the use of real names in all financial transactions,  the Kim administration's "reform of reforms." The real-name  financial transaction system was considered by many economists  as an obstacle to corporate investment which might negate  stimulus measures taken under the 100-day plan. However, the  new system has proved successful in helping the economy move  upward from the bottom, instead of pulling down corporate  investment.    Most of the money supplied to cushion the adverse effects of  the real-name system on the money market has been siphoned out  of circulation, and the stock market is emerging from its slump  of the past several years. The economy as a whole is looking up  on the strength of increasing exports.    Under the real-name system, however, the practice of using  borrowed names in financial transactions is still rampant, as  seen in the financial fraud involving Chang Yong-cha. This  necessitates strong measures against the use of borrowed names  for the real-name system to achieve complete success.    In late November, the second phase of the financial  liberalization plan was put into effect to bring the financial  market closer to a complete opening, a reform carrying as much  weight as that of the real-name system.    The Kim Yong-sam government also initiated fiscal policy  reform for a salutary budget system, with stress placed on  increased investment in infrastructure.    For this purpose, oil taxes will become traffic taxes  totaling 3.2 trillion won (four billion U.S. dollars) a year for  investment in roads, railways, airports and seaports.    The government has since come under attack for breaking its  promise to introduce a sliding scale system linking domestic and  international oil prices. As international oil prices are on  the decrease, however, the government has announced a big rise  in oil taxes to ensure that domestic oil prices are unrelated to  the falling international prices and thus keep consumers from  benefiting from the plunging world oil prices under the sliding  scale system.    Under the new fiscal policy, shortages of grain purchase  funds will be made up for with government funds, not with funds  raised by issuing grain bonds.    Private industries will be encouraged to make social  overhead  investment in a bid to lessen the government's burden of  investment in infrastructure. To this end, various incentives  will be given to corporations investing in infrastructure.    To achieve a small but efficient government, the Kim  Yong-sam  administration plans to restructure the 23 state-run enterprises  and their 102 subsidiaries and eight state-run non-profit  institutions through mergers and privatization.    Under the plan, 68 state-run enterprises including citizens  national bank and Korea exchange bank will be restructured  through mergers and privatization by 1998, and the 7 trillion  won to be raised through privatization will be poured into  infrastructure expansion projects.    The Kim Yong-sam government has conducted more economic  reforms in the past one year than any previous government did in  office, but its price and labor policies have failed.    Initiating the new five-year economic plan last year, the  government froze civil servants' wages and restrained personal  service charges and manufactured goods' prices from rising to  stabilize prices, but consumer prices nonetheless rose 5.8  percent last year and 1.3 percent year-on-year in January this  year.    Moreover, the labor policy supporting the "no work, partial  pay" principle was blamed for the extreme labor-management  conflict at Hyundai Group companies last year.</p>

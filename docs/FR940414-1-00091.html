			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> XV. Water Quality Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Most of the PAIs being regulated have at least one toxic effect (human health carcinogen and/or systemic toxicant or aquatic toxicant). Many of these pollutants have the potential to bioaccumulate and persist in the environment. Various studies have demonstrated the bioaccumulation of pesticides in aquatic life and accumulation of pesticides in sediments. Documented human health impacts at pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging (PFPR) facilities include respiratory disease and impaired liver function, primarily through worker exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous incidents of groundwater and soil contamination at refilling establishments, largely due to spills, are identified in the Office of Pesticide Programs proposed ``Standards for Pesticide Containers and Containment'' (59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994). According to a 1991 study, an estimated 45 to 75 percent of the refilling establishments in Wisconsin will require soil remediation and 29 to 63 percent of the commercial agrichemical facilities potentially exceed the State's groundwater standards for pesticides. An estimated 40 to 50 percent of refilling establishments in Iowa may require groundwater remediation. Seventy to 80 percent of the detections of pesticides in groundwater in Kansas can be traced back to refilling establishments. Groundwater contamination by pesticides is documented at numerous refilling establishments in Michigan, Illinois, and Utah.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The water quality benefits of controlling the indirect discharges from PFPR facilities are evaluated by modelling the impact of those discharges on receiving streams. The effects of POTW wastewater discharges of 106 PAIs are evaluated at current and proposed treatment levels for 81 indirect discharging PFPR facilities which discharge to 74 POTWs on 72 receiving streams. Water quality models are used to project pollutant in-stream concentrations based on estimated releases at current and Option 1 levels; the in-stream concentrations are then compared to EPA published water quality criteria or to documented toxic effect levels where EPA water quality criteria are not available for certain PAIs. Instream pollutant concentrations are modelled for Options 1, the highest wastewater load option; if no effects are projected to occur for Option 1, none are projected to occur for the proposed option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The in-stream pollutant concentration for one pollutant is projected to exceed human health criteria or human toxic effect levels in one receiving stream at current discharge levels. The in-stream pollutant concentrations for 21 pollutants are projected to exceed chronic aquatic life criteria or aquatic toxic effect levels in 18 streams at current discharge levels. No exceedances of human health or aquatic life criteria or toxic effect levels are projected to occur for Option 1; consequently, no exceedances are projected to occur for the proposed option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential impacts of these indirect discharging PFPR facilities are also evaluated in terms of inhibition of POTW operation and contamination of sludge. Potential biological inhibition problems are projected to occur at five POTWs for six PAIs; no sludge contamination problems are projected to occur at current discharge conditions. No potential biological inhibition or sludge contamination problems are projected to occur for Option 1; consequently no exceedances are projected to occur for the proposed option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The POTW inhibition and sludge values used in this analysis are not, in general, regulatory values. They are based upon engineering and health estimates contained in guidance or guidelines published by EPA and other sources. Thus, EPA is not basing its regulatory approach for pretreatment discharge levels upon the finding that some pollutants interfere with POTWs by impairing their treatment effectiveness. However, the values used in the analysis do help indicate the potential benefits for POTW operation that may result from the compliance with the proposed option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> XVI. Non-Water Quality Environmental Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The elimination or reduction of one form of pollution may create or aggravate other environmental problems. Therefore, Sections 304(b) and 306 of the Act call for EPA to consider the non-water quality environmental impacts of effluent limitations guidelines and standards. Accordingly, EPA has considered the effect of these regulations on air pollution, solid waste generation, and energy consumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Air Pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA estimates that facilities may emit 62,000 pounds of volatile priority pollutants during the treatment process and an additional 114,000 pounds may be emitted through the reuse of the wastewaters. EPA does not anticipate significant losses of active ingredients as most have low volatility. This loss would occur during the emulsion breaking, hydrolysis and/or chemical oxidation treatment steps where the addition of heat is likely to promote the release of the priority pollutants. The air emission estimate is based on the use of open vessels. Because EPA has developed costs for closed vessels, our estimate is likely to over estimate the actual losses due to volatilization from treatment. It is possible that there may be some emissions of priority pollutants during cleaning of equipment or containers, particularly if high-pressure cleaning or steam cleaning is used. EPA invites comment and data that address this possibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimates that without this regulation 968,000 pounds of volatile priority pollutants are being discharged to POTW's. An estimated 784,000 pounds will be lost in the form of emissions as the water is treated by POTW's. Thus, today's proposal will reduce the estimated quantity of volatile pollutants emitted by 791,000 pounds/year. In addition, the emissions would be localized and more suitable for capture and treatment. EPA is also inviting comment and data on the possible mechanisms and cost associated with capturing and treating these emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B. Solid Waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA estimates there will be 2,038,000 pounds of sludge generated from emulsion breaking and sulfide precipitation treatment annually. In addition 7,415,000 pounds annually of spent activated carbon will be generated annually. The sludge and spent carbon are generated from treatment through the Universal Treatment System. EPA has assumed that the sludge generated via emulsion breaking and sulfide precipitation will be hauled to hazardous waste incinerators. It is assumed that the activated carbon will be sent off-site for regeneration, which means that it would not become a waste. There is a possibility of air emissions being generated as a result of the incineration or regeneration of spent activated carbonated treatment sludges and resulting in subsequent generation of wastewater from the air pollution control scrubber usually associated with incinerators. However, hazardous waste incinerators are required to destroy contaminants up to 99.99%, thus if there are any residuals they would be at very low concentration. EPA believes this proposed regulation is consistent with the goals established for EPA's Draft Strategy for Combustion of Hazardous Waste, May 1993. This draft combustion strategy which establishes as the first goal ``a strong preference for source reduction over waste management, and thereby reduce the long-term demand for combustion and other waste management facilities''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> C. Energy Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA estimates that the attainment of BAT, NSPS, PSES and PSNS will increase energy consumption by a small increment over present industry use. The main energy requirement of the proposed technologies is the generation of steam that is used in the treatment vessel to accomplish emulsion breaking and hydrolysis. Steam provides the heat energy to assist with the separation of emulsified phases and increase the rate at which active ingredients hydrolyze. It is estimated that about 120 million pounds per year of steam would be required by the Universal Treatment System. This would require approximately 26,000 barrels of oil annually; the United States currently consumes about 19 million barrels per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, EPA estimates that the operation of the Universal Treatment System will consume 1,760,000 kilowatt hours per year. This is expended by the pumps and agitators used in treatment and associated with the storage of water until it can be reused.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> XVII.

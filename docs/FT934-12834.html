			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Economics: European statistics in focus THIS IS a busy week for European economic figures with several statistics likely to throw light on the state of the recession afflicting many European Community countries. Most economists are forecasting that German inflation in October fell below 4 per cent. Import price figures are also out this week and are expected to reflect the appreciation of the D-Mark which has led to virtually continuous import price deflation. In France unemployment figures on Friday will highlight the wisdom of last week's French rate cut by nudging closer to 12 per cent. France has one of the highest rates of unemployment among OECD countries. The jobless total has risen by an average of more than 30,000 a month since the start of the year.

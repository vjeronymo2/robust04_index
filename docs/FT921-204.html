			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Riot police halt Kashmiri march across border HUNDREDS OF riot policemen, coupled with strict security measures, yesterday prevented militant Kashmiris from marching across the disputed border between Pakistan and India. Their presence halted the latest effort by members of the militant Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) to reunite the divided state, an effort which Pakistani officials feared could lead to war with India. The militants attempted to send small groups to infiltrate sections of the border, as an effort to keep their initiative alive. However the arrest last night of Mr Raja Muzaffar, acting chairman of the Front, put an end to hopes that the march could be a success. Militants on the Indian side also called off their planned march in the other direction, into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. On the Pakistan side riot policemen, aided by army engineers, built walls of stone and erected a barbed-wire fence outside Caikothi, the last garrison 9km from the border town Chinari, to prevent marchers from taking the main road to Srinagar, capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. Last month, a similar march led to the killing of at least a dozen people, while another 60 were injured. Elsewhere in the state, riot policemen fired tear-gas shells on JKLF supporters, to break up a gathering in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir. Last night Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan, prime minister of Pakistani Kashmir, said that his government would allow no similar marches in the future. The militants reiterated their goal of an independent Kashmir, free from domination either by India or Pakistan. Before his arrest, Mr Muzaffar told reporters in a remote mountain hideout some 4km from Chinari that 'the march will discourage the conspiracies to divide Kashmir and will promote our attempts at reunification.' Both Pakistan and the semi-autonomous Kashmiri state have traditionally backed a UN plebiscite for Kashmiris leading to accession either to India or to Pakistan. The Financial Times correspondent was among Western and Pakistani journalists and press photographers who were arrested by the Kashmir police and detained for more than an hour yesterday. Policemen armed with rifles, carrying tear gas shells and batons, surrounded the press team and threatened to charge them for allegedly associat ing with 'proclaimed offenders'. David Housego adds from Srinagar: The Indian government is to release five Kashmiri nationalist leaders in an effort to launch a political dialogue in the state. The freeing of the leaders, announced by Radio Kashmir last night, is expected within two days. It seen by the government as paving the way for elections in the state - possibly within the year. Most of the leaders have been held for two years for supporting the militants' separatist movement. The decision reflects growing confidence by the state government that it can contain the insurgency which in the past has drawn India close to war with Pakistan. Mr GD Saxena, governor of Kashmir, said in an interview yesterday: 'We have the upper hand and initiative now. I feel confident that we can keep things under control.'</p>

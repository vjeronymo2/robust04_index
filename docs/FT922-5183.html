			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / People: Gearing up for the stock market David Brown, the specialist engineers, has found a new chairman to help steer it towards a probable stock market flotation during the course of next year. Derek Kingsbury captained the management buy-out of Fairey, another specialised engineering group, in 1986, taking it public two years later. Chris Cook and Chris Brown, joint managing directors of David Brown, felt his background fitted the company for which they put together an MBO in January 1990. He replaces Tony Firth, chairman and chief executive of Concentric, who resigned as chairman of David Brown in the middle of last year. 'It is often very difficult as chairman of a private company to know what you are doing there' says Cook philosophically, adding that both sides parted company 'very amicably' as work pressures at Concentric built up for Firth. Kingsbury, who was headhunted for the position, should be clearer as to what his remit is, largely because the company's future refinancing strategy is now emerging, according to Cook. 'The new chairman will be at the forefront of the refinancing.' A stock market flotation is at the top of the list of priorities for refinancing in the course of the next two years. Kingsbury, 65, has been at Fairey since 1982, and was previously deputy chief executive of Dowty. He was a non- executive director of Vickers until 1991. ***** Already weighed down with the responsibility of marketing the likes of Brylcreem, Horlicks, Ribena and Lucozade, Harry Groome, chairman of SMITHKLINE BEECHAM's consumer brands business, has been elected on to the board of the main group.</p>

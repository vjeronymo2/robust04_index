			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> North Carolina has refused the Ku Klux Klan permission to join an  Adopt-a-Highway cleanup program that would have allowed the group to post its  name on signs along a stretch of road running through a black neighborhood.  Under the program, the state puts up eye-catching, green-and-white road signs  naming the group or business that has pledged to clean the adopted stretch of  road four times a year. The klan asked for a 3.4-mile stretch of road on U.S.  158 in Rockingham County about 100 miles from Raleigh through a predominantly  black neighborhood.  </P></p>

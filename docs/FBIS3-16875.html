Addressing the Assembly session in St. Petersburg Friday,  Shumeyko, also chairman of the Assembly's Council, said that  pragmatic politicians and the peoples of the CIS had come to  understand that only through joint actions and the consideration  of mutual interests of the CIS partners would they be able to  advance the reforms and build a democratic society.    He believes that obstacles should be removed on the way to  the economic, currency and financial cooperation and favorable  legal and economic conditions created for direct contacts  between enterprises and commercial structures.    Shumeyko said that the CIS states should coordinate policies  in the sphere of social and labor relations, the rights and  guarantees for all working people and citizens, first and  foremost in the sphere of employment, migration, social security.    Shumeyko believes it is necessary that the Assembly draft a  document, a sort of a "social act" or "social charter of the CIS  states" which would fix priorities of social policies and  mechanism for their implementation.    Shumeyko drew everybody's attention to the need to solve,  jointly with the executive branch of power and social and  political forces, the problems associated with the position of  ethnic groups and national minorities, as well as to continue  peace-keeping efforts to settle the armed conflicts and reduce  the acuteness of the related refugee problem.    He spoke in favor of helping the peace-keeping group on  Karabakh created by the Assembly.

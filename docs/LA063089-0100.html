			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> There's been a rash of so-called biomorphic abstraction that makes fine art of  those cellular spores or slowly scooting tendrils we see under a microscope or  in a molecular model. When this art is good it can, without stooping to  sentimentality, refer to universal mysteries like entropy, regeneration, the  mathematical order that dictates the minutest and grandest of natural systems.  When it's bad it can look like first-year-of-graduate-school,  what-am-I-going-to-paint.  </P> <P> Far from amateur and well exhibited in many states, Tom Savage shows large  paintings that fall somewhere between those extremes. Savage builds amorphous,  mostly pastel fields from coats of oil wash, then fills them with shapes that  look like the DNA helix or organic pods beaded like pearls on a string and  suspended in a chalky mist. In his strongest canvas, he sends spindly organisms  floating in a reddish primordial goop and shapes snap to life from the bold use  of color. More often than not, a decorative lilac palette and anemically  drafted squiggles leave you feeling you can't quite hold on to any of it.  (Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 1454 5th St., to July 15.)

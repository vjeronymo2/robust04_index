			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Observer: It's a knock-out Economists at Midland's Greenwell Montagu and James Capel have more than a mere sterling crisis to worry about. With the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's takeover of Midland Bank, a battle of the titans is shaping up to sort out who becomes top dog. In the blue corner, smooth-talking Roger Bootle, head of Greenwell Montagu's economic squad. In the red, Keith Skeoch, his level-headed rival at James Capel. The destinies of several nervous underlings hang on the outcome. Since both chief economists are highly regarded by their City colleagues, Observer suggests a good starting point is to compare their forecasts for growth this year. In January the James Capel team forecast that the economy would grow by 2.0 per cent and Greenwell Montagu forecast growth of 0.9 per cent. The consensus now is for a contraction of 0.5 per cent. On present form, Bootle seems the favourite.</p>

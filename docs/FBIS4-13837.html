			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 24, IRNA -- Majles Speaker Hojjat  ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri here Sunday [24 April] called on  Islamic countries to lift arms embargo against Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Speaking at today's Majles open session, the speaker  referred  to the support of the international bodies, including the U.N.  and hegemonist powers, for the Serbian crimes and said, "Islamic  countries, given the unreliability of U.N. Security Council  resolutions, should lift the arms embargo against Bosnia to  enable the Muslims in that country to defend themselves."    He expressed hope that Islamic countries would not limit  themselves to uttering words but would also enter the scene of  action.    The speaker referred to his recent talks with Malaysian and  Pakistani officials and said authorities in the two countries  held identical views in connection with the double standard of  the internatiional community on Bosnia and its inaction in  standing against the Serbs aggressions.    He also condemned the failed attempt against the life of  Hojjat ol-Eslam Abaie, susbstitute Friday prayer leader of  Mashhad, by terrorist groups and called on the Information  Ministry to take a serious stance towards the issue.    "Those lackey munafiq (hypocrite) elements should know that  by resorting to such assassination attempts and explosions they  could not disappoint the ulema and the people to abandon their  struggle and could not create a state of terror in the society,"  remarked the speaker.</p>

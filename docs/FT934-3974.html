			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Talks stalled as Menem rejects plan to curb his authority Talks between Argentina's government and the opposition over reforming the country's constitution stalled yesterday after President Carlos Menem rejected plans to reduce his authority, John Barham reports. Mr Menem said he would not accept the broad powers proposed for a prime ministerial figure as part of an accord reached with the opposition Radical party to amend the constitution and allow him to stand for a second term when his mandate ends in July 1995. Mr Ricardo Gil Lavedra, a senior opposition negotiator, said the accord was 'blocked' because the Radicals would only support re-election if the president's sweeping powers were reduced and the power of Congress and the judiciary strengthened. In exchange for backing re-election, the Radicals won promises from the ruling Peronist party to increase their representation in Congress, the judiciary and the government. Earlier, Mr Menem said he would ask Congress to vote this week on reforming the constitution. Both houses of Congress must vote two-thirds in favour of amending the constitution before elections can be called to a constituent assembly to write the new text. Mr Menem's resistance is the first serious obstacle.</p>

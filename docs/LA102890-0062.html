			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESEARCH USING FETAL TISSUE  </P> <P> To me, a young Parkinson's victim of 35, the issues of fetal-cell research  appear confused. Fetal-cell implants offer great hope to the victims of  Parkinson's disease and other degenerative conditions.  </P> <P> I am at a loss to understand the anti-abortion movement's objections. They  contend that fetal-cell research is immoral because the material is obtained  from a procedure that is immoral (abortion). This thinking is flawed.  </P> <P> Do we insist that every victim of an automobile accident, who is a potential  organ donor, not be a victim of the illegal and immoral act of drunk driving?  Do we exclude victims of the fastest-growing immoral act in this country,  violence, from being tissue donors? No! Then why does the anti-abortion  movement insist on interfering with basic scientific research and our rights to  benefit from such research?  </P> <P> ANTHONY SCHOONENBERG  </P> <P> West Covina  </P></p>

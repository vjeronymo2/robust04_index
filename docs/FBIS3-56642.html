Nikolay Mamulashvili reports:    [Mamulashvili] At the meeting with journalists most  attention  was focussed on the awaited exhumation and identification of  Gamsakhurdia's corpse, which according to some information is  buried in a village in West Georgia. Let me remind you that a  group of experts from Russia, Germany, and Great Britain is  completely ready to go into these questions.    The security minister reported that on 17 January a telegram  was sent from Chechnya to the head of the Georgian state. It  was couched somewhat in the form of an ultimatum, in which  members of Gamsakhurdia's family and his closest associates  demanded guarantees of the unobstructed removal of the body of  the former president from Georgia and immunity for those  accompanying it. On 18 January, in reply to the telegram from  Chechnya, a telegram was sent to Groznyy in which the Georgian  leadership confirmed guarantees of unobstructed removal of the  body and also proposed to Gamsakhurdia's family that it should  include its own representatives in the group of international  experts.    It is worth drawing attention to a report by the Georgian  Security Ministry, also based on indirect information, or more  precisely on the testimony of a certain doctor who examined  Gamsakhurdia on 2 December, that the former president was  seriously ill, having being diagnosed as suffering from a tumor  in the region of the bladder. Igor Giorgadze also said that one  of the residual groups of the former president's armed  formations was still in operation in the area where Gamsakhurdia  was allegedly buried. We do not want bloodshed and casualties,  the minister emphasized, and therefore we shall not enter the  area by force of arms but will hold talks.    Finally, a delegation from Chechnya is expected to arrive in  Tbilisi on 18 January.</p>

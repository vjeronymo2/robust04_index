			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Observer: Down to earth No shortage of readers willing to point out the obvious error in yesterday's FT interview with Templeton's Mark Mobius, one of the world's hottest fund managers. Mobius, a big picture merchant, said that he had been lured to Russia because of its achievements, such as putting people on the moon. As every schoolboy knows, it was the Americans who put men on the moon (12 at last count) and the Russians had to make do with a robot called Lunokhod. Mobius quickly corrected himself, but the comment has prompted stinging comments from envious rivals. Alastair Begg, Kleinwort Benson's chief investment manager, shot off a letter to the FT saying that if someone as skilled as Mobius is being carried away by such Russian hype, the 'time has come to sell short'. 'They would say that, wouldn't they?' says Mobius, too polite to mention that such cynical views are not going to help Kleinwort Benson's own efforts to sell shares in Gazprom, Russia's largest gas producer, to overseas investors.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PUBLIC SUGGESTS WAYS TO USE SPILL MONEY  </P> <P> A new pier. A beach boardwalk. A wildlife hospital. A new saltwater marsh.  </P> <P> Those are some of the ideas residents suggested Thursday as ways to compensate  Orange County for the oil spill that blackened 15 miles of shoreline in  February.  </P> <P> Officials from seven state and federal agencies held afternoon and evening  forums to hear the public's ideas. The agencies plan to sue the parties  responsible for the American Trader tanker spill to recover an unspecified  amount of money for the closure of the beaches and the harm to natural  resources.  </P> <P> The turnout was small -- only eight residents spoke at the afternoon session,  which was adjourned early. But state officials said they were pleased with the  ideas, which they called creative and intriguing. Now they must determine if  any are achievable and affordable.  </P> <P> "We'll have to go back and evaluate them. We will take a look at them all,"  said Deputy Atty. Gen. Sylvia Cano Hale, who is preparing a lawsuit  representing the state.  </P> <P> Victor Leipzig, executive director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy, a local  wetlands-protection group, recommended a permanent wildlife recovery center in  Orange County to care for injured birds and animals. About 700 birds died when  the tanker ran aground over its own anchor and spilled nearly 400,000 gallons  of Alaskan crude off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> He also suggested construction of a gate or other device to protect Orange  County's wetlands from spills and search for new technology to replace the  plastic, snakelike booms that are currently used to contain oil slicks.  </P> <P> Gary Gorman, executive director of the group that manages the wetlands,  suggested that the state use settlement money or fines to invest in new  marshes. About 90% of the county's coastal wetlands have been filled to make  way for development, so the purchase and restoration of those resources "should  be the No. 1 priority," he said.  </P> <P> Gorman said the state should consider buying and restoring an undeveloped,  66-acre parcel along Pacific Coast Highway near Brookhurst Avenue owned by a  private partnership.  </P> <P> "Restoring even just a portion of it would be better than none," he said.  </P> <P> Tom Pratte, former director of the Surfrider Foundation, a  surfing-environmental group based in Huntington Beach, suggested a new  boardwalk or bike path along the Newport Beach coast, or a seawall to shore up  the unstable Huntington Beach bluffs area.  </P> <P> State officials have not yet determined what companies will be sued. British  Petroleum owned the oil, American Trading Transportation owns the tanker, and  Golden West Refining operates the offshore terminal where it ran aground.  </P> <P> Some residents said nothing will ease their haunting memories of the spill.  </P> <P> "I don't believe anything can compensate for the loss of the birds," said Linda  Patterson, a Huntington Beach resident. "I'll never forget seeing that." MARLA  CONE  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS LOST IN GEOGRAPHY, SURVEY REVEALS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: 15% OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS THOUGHT THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER EMPTIED  INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. TEACHING METHODS ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.  </P> <P> In an indictment of how U.S. schools teach geography, a government study of  American high school seniors released Wednesday indicates that many students  are graduating largely ignorant about the world.  </P> <P> "The Geography Learning of High-School Seniors," a 78-page report by the U.S.  Department of Education, reveals that while 85% of students can locate the  Soviet Union on a map, a confused minority can't differentiate between latitude  and longitude, use maps effectively or understand what causes earthquakes.  Relatively few of the students tested displayed a firm grasp of environmental  problems and world economic relations.  </P> <P> Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said students' answers indicate "most of  what they learned about geography they did not learn in school," but from  television.  </P> <P> "Unless we place a new emphasis on studying geography," he said, "we're passing  on to our children the stewardship of a world they literally do not know."  </P> <P> Education experts said parents are bringing up their children in an environment  without atlases or globes and sending them to schools where many teachers have  little knowledge of physical and cultural geography.  </P> <P> In the United States, only one in seven high school students takes a geography  course, according to the Council of Chief State School Officers.  </P> <P> When it is taught, geography is often integrated into other courses, such as  history, social studies and science, said the report, which was based on a  multiple-choice test given in 1988 to 3,030 students in 304 public and private  schools nationwide.  </P> <P> Some excerpts:  </P> <P>  -- 71% of the students correctly identified Latin America on a map, but 15%  confused it with sub-Saharan Africa. Only 37% could locate Southeast Asia, site  of America's longest war.  </P> <P>  -- 72% could identify the world's major exporters of oil, but only 48% knew  the areas of major U.S. coal deposits. While two-thirds of the students  correctly indicated that the Mississippi River emptied into the Gulf of Mexico,  15% thought its terminus was the Atlantic Ocean, while more than 10% picked the  Great Lakes.  </P> <P>  -- When asked the cause of the decline of forests in the American Midwest, 65%  correctly answered "the growth of farming." But 20% attributed the  deforestation to forest fires.  </P> <P>  -- In a map showing population concentrations, almost one-fourth of the  students mistakenly labeled them "abundant mineral deposits." Some 16%  indicated that ships traveling from New York to London went through the Panama  Canal. Some 32% apparently thought that Finland has a tropical or desert  climate.  </P> <P> "Some of the results are encouraging, but most are disturbing and confirm what  we already know: An unacceptably high percentage of American high school  graduates have not learned geography," said Gilbert Grosvenor, president of the  National Geographic Society, which co-financed the study with the National  Center for Education Statistics.  </P> <P> Nationwide, students correctly answered slightly more than half of the  questions, although scores in the Southeast were lower than in the West,  Midwest and Northeast. White males performed better in geography than their  female peers, the study found.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GEOGRAPHY TEST  </P> <P> How 3,030 high school seniors performed in a nationwide government survey on  knowledge of geography. In percent.  </P> <P> Finding nations, cities on a map.  </P> <P> All: 57%  </P> <P> Male: 63  </P> <P> Female: 52  </P> <P> Showing how to use maps.  </P> <P> All: 53  </P> <P> Male: 56  </P> <P> Female: 49  </P> <P> Knowing who lives where and what products countries export.  </P> <P> All: 60  </P> <P> Male: 63  </P> <P> Female: 57  </P> <P> Climate dynamics, ecological issues, geology.  </P> <P> All: 58  </P> <P> Male: 61  </P> <P> Female: 54  </P></p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Fox attempts to build on property futures - The launch of a derivative in an area where others have failed YESTERDAY'S launch of a UK property futures market by the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) marks an attempt to create the world's first successful such market - previous attempts in Chicago, France and Sidney having failed. The market allows developers and banks to reduce their exposure to market movements; traders to speculate without buying and selling buildings; and investors to switch their funds in and out of property more easily. Also, houseowners and developers can hedge against fluctuations in mortgage rates. Fox is introducing four separate but interrelated contracts, covering commercial property, commercial rents, residential property and mortgage interest rates. They are based on a clutch of property indices: the IPD monthly capital value and rent growth index (based on the valuation of 47 institutional property funds), the Nationwide Anglia house price index, and the London Fox mortgage interest rate index. Someone hoping to make money from the new market has to take a view on the accuracy of the consensus of where the indices are heading, which will be reflected in the price of the futures. A trader will, for instance, profit from buying futures, if prices rise by more than was expected when the contract was taken out. One of the main attractions (and risks) of using the futures market is that contracts are highly geared, so only a small down-payment is needed to gain exposure to the market. Another attraction is that transaction costs are far lower than in the direct property market: Fox calculates average costs of 0.07 per cent for t for property. Fox has appointed eight designated brokers, including Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs, James Capel and Prudential-Bache. The contracts are traded electronically, so the broker types the customer's order into the trading screen. It is then automatically passed on to Fox's matching, allocation, confirmation and clearing systems. The contracts, which expire every three months during a three-year period, are settled in cash. Their settlement is guaranteed by the International Commodities Clearing House. Fox's initiative has attracted intense interest and scepticism in roughly equal measures. Marketing seminars about the futures launch have been well attended, but many potential users say they would prefer to see the market establish itself rather than commit funds straight away. One difficulty for Fox is getting the message across. It is not easy to market a new financial technique to an industry as large and diffuse as property, which has not been eager to adopt financial innovations in the past. Fox has complained that institutions are as deaf to the virtues of a new risk avoidance strategy as they are risk averse to new markets. Moreover, surveyors, whose clients are potential users of property futures, appear to be unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the futures market. 'A lot of them have said they are going to wait and see,' says Mr Jon Payne, business development director of Fox. London Fox may also be handicapped by the mood of caution in the property industry. Few developments are planned and investors appear to lack enthusiasm to expand the range of their operations. That said, it is possible that the uncertain climate in the property industry will give the property futures market just the kickstart it needs. The recent collapse in property values may have helped the cause of the property futures by undermining the market's past claim of stability. The usual consensus in the industry (which has led to worries that it would be a one-way market) has been shattered - for the moment. For example, at a seminar held by Fox, the number of investment surveyors who reckoned that the market value would increase by the end of the year was nicely matched by the number who thought it would fall. The large divergence of views should help create a healthy distribution of buyers and sellers. Fox may also be helped by the illiquidity in the market at present. An institution that believes the property market has hit bottom may wish to lock into existing prices with futures, rather than risk a rapid price rise. However, the main criticism about the contracts is that they measure the average performance of the property market, which blurs the considerable difference in behaviour between different sectors and regions. Some institutions, such as Scottish Amicable, say that only when this problem is resolved will it be interested in property futures. The possibility of using more narrowly-focused indices was dismissed because of the likely lack of liquidity. Instead, Fox hopes that financial institutions will help by offering tailor-made policies for individual portfolios, whose aggregate risk can be offset using the futures market. As the market kicks off, Fox is anxious to see how much momentum can be built in the market's early stages. None the less, a slow start will not be disastrous, thanks to the relatively low costs of screen-based trading. 'The start-up period will not take one day or one month,' says Mr Payne. 'We can manage three years quite easily.'</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT BUSH'S TROOP DECISION;  </P> <P> OPINION: A MAJORITY, HOWEVER, ALSO SAID IT IS LIKELY THAT THE U.S. COULD GET  BOGGED DOWN IN ANOTHER VIETNAM.  </P> <P> Californians strongly support President Bush's decision to send American  fighting forces to the Persian Gulf, but many also think the United States  could become "bogged down in another Vietnam," The Los Angeles Times Poll  found.  </P> <P> And although there is concern throughout the state that the Middle East crisis  could lead to a gasoline shortage, Californians still oppose drilling for oil  off their coast, the survey showed.  </P> <P> People seem to have little trouble fixing blame for the big rise in gasoline  prices: It's not the fault of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime, but the oil  industry, they say.  </P> <P> The Times poll conducted telephone interviews with 1,586 registered voters  throughout California during six days ending Wednesday night. The margin of  error is 3 percentage points in either direction.  </P> <P> The poll's findings indicated that while Californians support the idea of  standing up to Saddam Hussein, they realize that it involves risks to American  lives and possibly to their own lifestyles. So far, they are willing to take  those risks.  </P> <P> Three-fourths of those surveyed approved of "sending American troops to the  Persian Gulf to defend Saudi Arabia" against a potential Iraqi attack -- and  roughly half "strongly" approved. Men and Republicans especially supported the  military deployment -- more than 8 in 10 did -- but so did two-thirds of women  and Democrats.  </P> <P> However, a majority -- 52% -- also said it is "likely" that the United States  could get bogged down in another Vietnam situation. Democrats and women  particularly feared this.  </P> <P> Also, nearly two-thirds of the voters said they are "concerned" that the crisis  will result in an oil shortage.  </P> <P> But when voters were asked whether they now would approve of offshore drilling  to "help the United States be less dependent on Arab oil supplies," or whether  they opposed drilling "because it spoils the scenic beauty of California and  risks oil spills that might damage the environment," only 37% favored drilling  and 57% were opposed. The remainder of those surveyed weren't sure.  </P> <P> This represented only a slight softening of anti-drilling sentiment since last  February, when a similar Times poll found 32% in favor and 60% opposed. Later,  Bush banned most new drilling off the California coast for the rest of the  decade.  </P> <P> Many people interviewed in this survey fretted about the economic impact of the  Middle East crisis. Roughly 6 in 10 said they are "worried" that it "could help  bring on a recession in California."  </P> <P> But a virtually equal number also were worried that long-planned defense  spending cuts could lead to a recession in the state. Roughly one in five of  those interviewed said somebody in their family is employed by a firm that has  military contracts. And of these people with families dependent to some degree  on defense spending, more than a third said the affected employee faces either  a layoff or reduction in work hours because of military cutbacks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Following are results from a Los Angeles Times poll of 1,586 registered voters.  </P> <P> Sending American Troops to Saudi Arabia  </P> <P> Don't know: 7%  </P> <P> Disapprove: 19%  </P> <P> Approve: 745  </P> <P> </P> <P> Likelihood of Vietnam  </P> <P> Don't know: 4%  </P> <P> Unlikely: 44%  </P> <P> Likely: 52%  </P> <P> Source: L.A.

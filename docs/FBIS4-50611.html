			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan will work with  Southeast Asian countries to increase regional intellectual  property rights (IPR) protection, the Board of Foreign Trade  (BOFT) said Friday [13 May].    Taiwan is paying equal attention to consultations on both  IPR  protection and agricultural imports as part of its effort to  join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), BOFT  officials said.    The efforts include exchanges of information and personnel  between Taiwan and members of the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN).    Besides IPR protection consultations, the officials said,  BOFT is seeking bilateral recognition of national laboratories  and cooperation in product verification and quality control  certification with ASEAN members.    Details of the issues will be further discussed in an  October  Asia-Pacific meterology conference to be held in Taipei, BOFT  said.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Unit trust accounting rules ACCOUNTING and disclosure rules for unit trusts were published yesterday by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro). The rules, in the form of a statement of recommended practice, have the backing of the regulatory body and so are binding on unit trusts. They are based on current best practice in the industry and should make little difference to most unit trusts, Imro said. Among the more important rules is a tighter definition of when expenses can be treated as capital rather than revenue items. The regulations are intended to standardise reporting across the industry, which will make comparison between unit trusts easier.</p>

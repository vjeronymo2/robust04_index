Bernard Dowiyogo, who also heads the South Pacific Forum  (SPF), an informal discussion body of 15 nations and regions  including Australia and New Zealand, also thanked Hosokawa for  Japan's assistance to the region.    Dowiyogo said the South Pacific region hopes to "deepen  dialogue" with Japan through an SPF meeting to be held in  Australia in August.    Since 1989 the annual SPF sessions have been followed by  "dialogues" with representatives of important cooperation  partners such as the United States, China and Japan.    In response, Hosokawa pledged Japan's readiness to further  develop ties with the region.</p>

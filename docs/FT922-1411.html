			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Top salaries expected to land on the prime minister's desk later this week - is already causing a political storm. Due before the general election, the report is thought likely to recommend pay rises taking some judges, generals and senior civil servants well over Pounds 100,000 a year. The government postponed publication to avoid top people's pay becoming an election issue. The delay has done nothing to make more palatable possible pay rises of 30 per cent. Junior and middle-ranking civil servants have had to make do this year with rises of 4.5 per cent or less and the level of settlements in the private sector has been falling. Yet if the report makes recommendations of this magnitude, the government will not wish lightly to set them aside. The TSRB last year pointed out that the salaries of public servants in its remit are generally less than half the median earnings of comparable managers in the private sector. Recruitment and retention of high quality public servants is in the public interest, as is two way traffic in high-fliers between private business and Whitehall. Comparison of risk and reward in the private and public sectors, however, is not as easy as is sometimes assumed. In a period when the government is trying to introduce clearer performance standards into the public services, the debate about civil service pay also needs to become more subtle. A useful next step would be for members of the TSRB to defend their recommendations in public, paving the way for government to set out the reasons for its decision in some detail.</p>

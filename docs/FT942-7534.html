			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Accountants' alternative view Sir, While Andrew Jack correctly points out that the student recruitment to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has fallen steadily over recent years ('You don't have to be Australian but it helps', May 19), his statement that among the different accountancy qualifications, 'management accountancy reigns supreme' is not borne out by the facts. Last year, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants registered more than 22,500 students - more than 8,500 of them in the UK - up 7.5 per cent on the previous year; and more than 14,000 overseas - up 22 per cent. These figures are more than five times those of the ICAEW and more than double those of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. Moreover, while there may be some in the profession who are still living in the 'halcyon' days of the 1980s and who do need to indulge in more 'soul searching' on the scope for revisions to future training and recruitment, the ACCA has successfully introduced streamlined examination structures and competence-based training requirements, aimed at imparting skills that employers now want their accountants to possess. It is the responsibility of those in the profession who have not yet come to terms with today's reality to learn from those who have. Anthea L Rose, chief executive, ACCA, 29 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EE</p>

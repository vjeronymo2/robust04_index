			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY REPORTS 93 HATE CRIMES AGAINST GAYS IN 7 MONTHS  </P> <P> More than 90 hate crimes against gays and lesbians in Los Angeles County were  reported between February and the end of August, a slight increase over the  number of such offenses committed during a comparable period last year, the  county's leading gay services agency announced Monday.  </P> <P> The Anti-Violence Project of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services  Center logged 93 hate crimes between Feb. 1 and Aug. 31, said the center's  legal services director, Roger Coggan.  </P> <P> Last year, Coggan said, the center recorded 90 hate crimes between Feb. 16 and  Sept. 30.  </P> <P> The center recorded 18 reports of hate crimes in August, Coggan said, a 50%  increase over this year's monthly average of 12.  </P> <P> "It is a basic fact that bigotry against gay and lesbians is the last accepted  form of bigotry," said David M. Smith, a spokesman for the center.  </P> <P> The center's 1990 hate crime statistics -- scheduled to be released to the  public today -- were dramatically greater than those compiled by the Los  Angeles County Human Relations Commission, which recently issued a hate crimes  report for the first six months of the year.  </P> <P> The Human Relations Commission report said that 50 hate crimes were committed  against gays during the first half of 1990.  </P> <P> "We work with the center," said Eugene Mornell, director of the Human Relations  Commission. "But they look at hate crimes a little differently. We use a more  stringent standard. With many of the agencies we work with -- and this includes  law enforcement agencies -- we reduce the number. Unless (a hate crime)  involves a clear violation of a law, we don't include it in our figures."  </P> <P> Some of the center's figures include actions that may not be legal offenses.  For instance, the center recorded 70 incidents in which anti-gay and  anti-lesbian slurs were uttered.  </P></p>

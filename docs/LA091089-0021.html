			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE WITHOUT KFAC: WHEN ROCK ROLLS OVER BACH  </P> <P> Not all classical music fans are aging bluestockings who hate popular culture.  I am 25, middle class and nonwhite, and I enjoy rock as much as anyone else.  </P> <P> But there are more than enough rock stations for me to choose from. And I would  like Evergreen to know that the station that replaces KFAC will never be among  my choices.  </P> <P> FELICIA A. LEE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

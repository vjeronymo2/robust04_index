			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest April 21 (CTK) -- The Hungarian Foreign  Ministry today said Slovakia's lack of interest in a working  meeting between the two premiers, Peter Boross and Jozef  Moravcik, was regrettable.    The ministry's spokesman, Janos Herman, said Budapest  received Bratislava's statement through official channels on  Wednesday [20 April].    Herman did not specify who had initiated the meeting. He  said that during the preparation of the meeting, Slovakia made  it a condition that a joint communique be issued on the meeting  which would deal with some of the questions to be embedded in  the planned basic treaty. Hungary could not accept this  condition, Herman said, adding that the treaty was not to be the  main topic of the meeting.    In today's issue of the Hungarian daily MAGYAR NEMZET, its  Bratislava correspondent wrote that the meeting had been  initiated two weeks ago by Slovakia and that it was to have been  held on Monday [25 April]. But Hungary replied too late, the  paper wrote, and moreover Budapest allegedly "laid conditions  that are unacceptable to the Slovak party."    It wrote that the Hungarian conditions allegedly included  the  demand that no joint communique be issued from the meeting and  that the premiers do not hold any joint press conference.  Slovakia, the paper writes, has said that such a "secret"  meeting before the May parliamentary elections in Hungary would  have no sense.    Herman said today that at the meeting Boross was ready to  give a new impulse to the development of Hungarian-Slovak  relations and help solve pending problems.    Hungary has laid no conditions and would not accept any from  Slovakia.    The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's offer for the two foreign  ministers to meet on the occasion of a new Hungarian-Slovak  border crossing is still valid, Herman said.    Slovakia conditions the opening of new border crossings by  the signing of a readmission agreement because it fears an  influx of immigrants coming via Hungary from Romania and other  countries.</p>

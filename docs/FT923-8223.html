			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Ashdown papers man 'did not steal' AN OLD Bailey jury yesterday cleared Mr Simon Berkowitz of stealing a confidential document detailing a former relationship between Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and his one-time secretary. He was, however, convicted on a majority verdict of handling the stolen document. Mr Berkowitz, 45, a painter and decorator from Hove, East Sussex, had been accused of breaking into the offices of Mr Ashdown's City solicitors - Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite - and taking the papers, which he then tried to sell. After a seven-day trial, the jury cleared him of the burglary and of stealing Pounds 223 cash. Mr Berkowitz was jailed for 2 1/2 years for handling the document, to run consecutively to a three-year sentence for burglary at another solicitor's office which he is already serving. The court was told Mr Berkowitz had 230 previous convictions for burglary, many for break-ins at solicitors' offices.</p>

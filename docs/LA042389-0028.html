			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUNNING HOUSE  </P> <P> Please encourage anyone who is involved with the Dunning house to let it  remain. Bend requirements, if necessary, to have it declared a "historic"  house. So what, if it isn't really.  </P> <P> There is so little of the past that remains in the disposable society of today.  I love to drive by older, well-kept houses. Not everything in Los Angeles needs  to be new and palatial.  </P> <P> BARBARA S. WINDT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / BBC's support services face market testing THE BBC will today tell staff that it is moving to a system of market testing in non-programme making areas such as the management of buildings, training and transport services. The aim is to ensure value for money in the corporation's support services and that the maximum amount of funds goes to programme making. Market testing, which will become a continual process, will be carried out by individual BBC departments. It will involve competitive tenders being sought for work at present done in-house and the possibility of entire areas of work going to outside contractors. Mr Michael Starks, controller of BBC services, said yesterday that he expected the main impact to come from the non-programme-related service departments reassessing the demand for what they offer following the introduction of theProducer Choice policy last April. Under this policy programme producers are able to buy in services from outside the corporation. Producers who now have to pay for everything at full cost are trying to reduce what they pay in overheads. Mr Starks confirmed that competitive tendering would be used and that further contracting out of services was a possibility. One area likely to receive a close look will be buildings management. Mr Starks insisted that the market-testing exercise was not designed to reduce the size of the BBC. 'It is about demonstrable value for money for the licence-payer,' he said. The result of both a decline in demand for support services at the BBC and market testing will almost inevitably lead to fewer staff jobs at the corporation. BBC staff will also be told that the corporation will help to protect the terms and conditions of staff whose work goes to private operators in line with the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (7): Three biggest groups back in the black - The country's distinctive mortgage credit system has survived a turbulent economic period Securitised mortgages have been a feature of Denmark for two centuries and, 'no mortgage bondholder has ever lost his money in the 200 years the system has existed'. So says Mr Lars Rohde, a member of the management board of Realkredit Danmark (it changed its name from Kreditforening Danmark in 1993), one of the two largest mortgage credit finance groups. The Danish mortgage system is unusual. Virtually all mortgage financing is done through the bond-issuing institutions. These were until recently self-owning associations of borrowers, but they have now been converted into limited companies. The holding companies in the mortgage groups, however, continue to be owned by the borrowers. The companies are not listed on the Stock Exchange but the bonds they issue are. Mortgage bonds account for around half of the turnover in bonds on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The system functions efficiently because it is supported by an infrastructure of a kind which does not exist in many other countries. There is an official property registration and mortgage debt registration system (covering not only loans issued by the mortgage institutions but also private mortgage notes, known as 'pantebreve'). This infrastructure means that there is a quick and legally simple means of reclaiming property if the owner defaults on mortgage payments. Ownership is always known, and there are no privileged liabilities which are unregistered and therefore unknown to the lending institutions, as Mr Rohde explained. Funding and loans by the mortgage credit groups are matched: 30-year loans are matched by 30-year bonds. There is no mismatch, 'which gives the system stability', says Mr Rohde. Nevertheless, the mortgage finance institutions are just emerging from a turbulent period, on which Mr Rohde's judgment is: 'We survived.' The combination of moving from high to low inflation in the late-1980s and the recession which began in 1987 had as dramatic an impact on the mortgage credit institutions as it did on the banks. As commercial and residential property prices collapsed, the level of defaults and executive auctions assumed a scale which was as bad as anything experienced in the 1930s. There was no question of the mortgage institutions going bust, but at the peak of the crisis a situation was reached when it appeared that the institutions would no longer have the capacity to make new loans. Drastic action was called for to put the institutions back into shape. Realkredit Danmark has cut its staff by 35 per cent since 1989, tightened up its credit policy to avoid new losses, and increased the margin (between what it actually raised and what it lends to the householder) on its loans. The other institutions have carried out similar programmes. Last year brought relief. The three largest groups were back into the black. Realkredit Danmark turned a 1992 loss of DKr1.28bn into a profit of DKr1.47bn. Nykredit moved from a very small profit of DKr46m to a profit DKr1.32bn. They continue to carry very high - by the standards of mortgage credit  - loss provisions of around 0.7 per cent of lending, but property prices have begun to recover and the economy is turning up, so the groups expect the level of bad loss provisions will at last begin to fall. Falling interest rates in 1993 opened the way for mortgageholders to convert loans carrying coupons of nine to 11 per cent to loans with coupons of six and seven per cent, which brought on the mortgage companies enormous pressure of business. The launch of a new series of 30-year bonds with a six per cent coupon was also popular with the markets and created a series of highly liquid securities in which there was a substantial foreign interest. From the point of view of foreign investors, however, mortgage bonds carry a number of disadvantages, compared with treasury bonds. The mortgage bonds are not bullets, which is the kind with which foreign investors are familiar, and they are callable. On the other hand they carry a spread of up to 100 basis points (it varies considerably according to conditions in the markets) over treasury bonds. A further problem is that mortgage credit groups have not yet been rated by the international rating agencies, which is often a requirement before the big institutional investors will consider buying an institution's securities. In the meantime, the mortgage institutions are becoming interested in international funding, which reflects the general globalisation of the Danish financial sector. The Danish institutions used to be subject to a rule that krone assets had to be matched by krone liabilities, but this straitjacket has been removed. The Danish institutional investors, who take up the bulk of the mortgage bond issues, are diversifying into foreign securities, says Mr Rohde, 'so we have a natural desire to broaden our funding base by selling internationally.' At home, the mortgage credit institutions are meeting competition from the banks. Den Danske Bank and Uni-danmark both set up mortgage credit subsidiaries last year, which enables them to keep funds within the group which would otherwise have moved to the old-established mortgage credit groups, or, as Mr Rohde less kindly puts it: 'They have cannibalised their own lend ing.' Current legislation does not allow the mortgage credit institutions to reply in kind by setting up banks themselves, although the insurance companies, for example, are allowed to operate banks as subsidiaries, and do. The mortgage credit institutions are now pressing for a change which will put them on a competitive footing with the banks and insurance companies.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE THREE LARGEST MORTGAGE FINANCE GROUPS BY LENDING (1993)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nykredit                                          DKR336bn Realkredit Danmark                                DKR295bn Byggeriets Realkredit Fond                        DKR125bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Source: Financial Times)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

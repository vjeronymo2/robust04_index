			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK" file] </F>   [Text] BAKU [dateline as received] -- The economic program  draft acceptance by the Ministers' Cabinet of Azerbaijan is  delayed, told the Economy Ministry official. The draft project  was submitted to the Ministers' Cabinet in March.    Authors of the program claim that the draft is drawn by the  private initiative, not by the order of government, and is based  on scenario of government activity, with specific targets and  roles of economic institutions. Before submission, the draft  was agreed with all these institutions. Project includes the  acceptance of 87 laws and sub-law acts providing the necessary  conditions for normal functioning of economy.    To this instant, told the authors, the project has been cut  almost for a half and divided into several units. "This  violates the project integrity and makes the program  impractical".</p>

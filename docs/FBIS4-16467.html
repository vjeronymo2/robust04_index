			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Stanislav Koltsov report in the "Budget" column: "Sergey </F> Glazyev Has Sent the Budget Back to the Council of Ministers.  The Duma Hoped To Begin Its Consideration on Friday"]    [Text] Three days before the parliament's lower chamber was  to begin discussing the budget, the State Duma's Economic Policy  Committee decided to send it back to the government for  amendment. The committee's conclusion on the draft federal  budget for 1994 says in particular that the "authenticity" of  the macroeconomic forecast underlying the draft budget "causes  great doubts," proceeding from the correlation of the GNP  deflation index in the first quarter compared to the same period  in 1993 (7.8 percent). True, the Finance Ministry also  criticized the deflation indicators included in the so-called  "second" version of the "forecast." The authors of the  conclusion believe that the rate of inflation, as well as of  production decline, will be much higher than the forecasted  level, and furthermore they assess as "unrealistic" the  estimated budget revenues and expenditures as shown in the  draft.    Second, the Economic Policy Committee considers the draft  budget proposed by the government "inadequate" to the priorities  of socioeconomic development "set forth in the program materials  of the Russian Federation president and government." Analyzing  the structure of federal budget expenditures, the committee  deems it essential to state that "only such structural policy  priorities as the development of the agro-industrial complex and  the fuel and energy sector have been ensured state support,"  while "insufficient financing of major directions of structural  and science and technical policy will not allow in 1994 to break  the dangerous trends toward the country's de-industrialization  and irreversible destruction of its scientific and technical  potential." In addition, the committee believes that "a natural  form of implementing structural policy priorities should be  special-purpose federal programs approved by the State Duma for  the entire period of their implementation."    The Economic Policy Committee, furthermore, assesses as  unsatisfactory the work to raise additional budget revenues. In  this connection the committee recommends abolishing all  concessions in paying taxes, customs duties, and other  obligatory deductions that contradict current legislation and  also fail to stimulate a growth of internal demand and do not  arise from structural policy priorities.    "In order to assist the Russian Federation Government in  finalizing the draft federal budget," the committee proposes  that a parliament-government commission be set up to draw up a  realistic forecast for the Russian Federation's economic  development in 1994 and 1995; that the 1994 draft budget be  reworked on a quarterly basis; and that coordinated targets for  state economic policy in 1994 and 1995 be elaborated as well as  programs for their implementation, in accordance with the  provisions of the presidential message and recommendations of  parliamentary hearings in the State Duma.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Pause for breath AFTER THE most turbulent month on the foreign exchanges since the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s, a semblance of calm returned to the dealing floors this week. The D-Mark, hitherto Europe's safe-haven currency, even managed to show fitful signs of weakness not only against sterling and the lira, but against the dollar and the yen as well. It came not a moment too soon for Europe's political leaders, who are due to meet at next Friday's summit in Birmingham. One of their urgent priorities must be to find ways of reassuring a European electorate whose enthusiasm for ever closer union has been sapped by everything from high unemployment to growing doubts about the contents of the Maastricht treaty. Yet the question remains. Is it the calm after the storm or the lull before the next onslaught? Everything points to the latter, although it would take a brave pundit to forecast when the onslaught will start again. All that has happened since September 16, the fateful day on which sterling parted company with the exchange rate mechanism, is that the more extreme tensions within the system have found a temporary resolution. With sterling and the lira out of the frame and the peseta realigned within the system, the immediate friction has been reduced. The success of the joint front presented by the French and Germans against the markets' assault on the franc further stiffened the defences of what remained of the ERM. Just to round off the picture, the markets had second thoughts on Thursday about the likelihood of a cut in the discount rate in the US and decided that the recent decline in money market rates in Germany might be an indication of looser policy to come from the Bundesbank. A cut in the Italian central bank's key rate lent strength to that happy speculation, which resulted in short covering by traders in the dollar and a consequent weakening in the D-Mark. Policy gaps But speculation it remains; and there is no shortage of German economists who suspect that the Bundesbank will cut later rather than sooner. Meantime the most striking feature of the outlook for the markets is the uncertainty that surrounds the main actors in the drama. As the momentum of Governor Bill Clinton's election campaign becomes more impressive, the gaps in his economic policy proposals, most notably in relation to the budget deficit, become more striking. There is ample scope for nervous eruptions as the election approaches. In Germany the real economy appears to be slowing fast, as the strength of the D-Mark bites into the competitiveness of the tradeable goods sector. Yet the inflationary pressures are greatest in the service sector of the economy, which strengthens the hand of those on the Bundesbank council who will want to delay the interest rate cuts that hold the key to keeping predators away from the weaker currencies in the ERM. Nerve-wracking Forecasting the outcome of the Italian budgetary dilemma is a nerve-wracking proposition. For its part, Britain's Conservative government faces a stormy autumn as it embarks on the ratification process for Maastricht. The best that can be said, after this week's Tory party conference, is that Mr Major has come out of his corner fighting and that some of his ministers, most notably the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, have proved better advocates for the European cause than some had expected. Yet the real conundrum for the markets - and the prize, for the speculators  -remains the franc. With growth running at around 2 per cent, a rate of inflation lower than that of Germany and no strain evident on its current account, France looked a much more credible candidate for support within the ERM than Britain. But the cost of that support has been debilitating for the reserves - and for the French banking system, which has been instructed by the government not to raise lending rates, while deposit rates have soared. This week, three-month Euro-currency interest rates stood at 12 1/4 per cent for the franc, against comparable D-Mark rates of 8 3/4 per cent and sterling rates only marginally higher than that. In effect, the asset side of the French bank balance sheet is under firm state control while the liability side is not - a recipe for increasing losses and, ultimately, if short-term rates do not come down fast, a deterioration in French public finances. On the trading front France is vulnerable to the German economic slow-down, while it has seen a marked loss of competitiveness against its two other main trading partners, Britain and Italy, after their recent devaluations. All this as next year's elections loom closer, thereby adding political sensitivity to any interest rate rise in support of a besieged currency. As long as French and German economic policies are on a divergent tack, the hard core of the ERM is not out of the wood; and for the markets more generally the breather looks temporary.</p>

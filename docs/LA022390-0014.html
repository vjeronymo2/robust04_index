			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AGASSI ILL, DROPS OUT OF MATCH  </P> <P> Andre Agassi, the highest remaining seed in the $1-million U.S. Pro Indoor  tournament in Philadelphia, quit suddenly because of food poisoning Thursday  night, handing a 5-7, 7-5 victory to 13th-seeded Pete Sampras.  </P> <P> Suellen Foley, a spokeswoman for the tournament, said Agassi had eaten pasta  Thursday at a Philadelphia restaurant and had had a banana afterward.  </P> <P> "It's not the way I would have liked to have won, but I'll take it," Sampras  said. "I don't get very many freebies playing top 10 guys."  </P> <P> Sampras said he had noticed Agassi slowing in the second set, but thought he  would keep playing. Agassi, seeded No. 3 in the tournament, joined top-seeded  John McEnroe and second-seeded Brad Gilbert on the sidelines. Fourth-seeded Jay  Berger defeated Wally Masur Thursday.  </P> <P> Earlier, fifth-seeded Tim Mayotte rallied from a first-set loss to defeat Glenn  Layendecker, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), and gain a quarterfinal berth. In other  matches, Richey Reneberg, the player who ousted McEnroe on Wednesday, lost to  Mark Kratzmann, 6-4, 6-4; and eighth-seeded Jim Courier needed four match  points to beat 10th-seeded Christo van Rensburg, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker both struggled before advancing to the  quarterfinals of the ATP Eurocard tournament at Stuttgart, West Germany.  </P> <P> Lendl, ranked No. 1 in the world, had a tough time beating Goran Prpic of  Yugoslavia, 7-5, 6-4.  </P> <P> Becker, seeded second, had to win the last three games to beat hard-hitting  Alexander Volkov of the Soviet Union, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.  </P> <P> In other action, Jonas Svensson of Sweden upset Yannick Noah of France, 6-2,  6-4, and Aki Rahunen of Finland reached the final eight of a major event for  the first time by defeating Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 6-2, 6-4.  </P> <P> Rahunen, 18 and ranked 138th in the world, came through this tournament's  qualifying competition and is such a longshot that the wrong picture appeared  with his biography in the official player guide produced by the ATP Tour.  </P> <P> Zina Garrison used a near-flawless serve-and-volley game to defeat Australia's  Liz Smylie, 6-0, 6-1, and move into the quarterfinals of the Virginia Slims of  Washington.  </P> <P> Garrison, the No. 2 seed and fourth-ranked player in the world, lost only 13  points on her serve and won 26 of 33 points at the net in dispatching Smylie in  49 minutes.  </P> <P> In other second-round matches, Nathalie Tauziat of France allowed only one  service break in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Italy's Linda Ferrando, and Anne Smith  won the last four games en route to a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Claudia  Kohde-Kilsch.  </P></p>

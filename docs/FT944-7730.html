			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Saab-Scania lifts Investor Investor, the central holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg empire, saw pre-tax profits surge to SKr2.28bn (Dollars 311m) in the first nine months, after a strong performance from Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned vehicle and aerospace unit. The result, which compares with a SKr156m profit in the same 1993 period, came after Saab-Scania rebounded to a profit of SKr2.18bn after financial items, from a SKr362m loss. Saab-Scania's performance has been driven by higher sales and earnings from its Scania truck and bus division. These offset falling sales and increased losses at Saab Aircraft &amp; Defence. Investor, which apart from Saab-Scania has strategic holdings in leading Swedish companies such as Astra, Ericsson, Stora and Electrolux, said the value of its investment portfolio on September 30 was SKr28.9bn, down 1 per cent from the start of the year after adjusting for net changes. The group expanded its portfolio through the purchase of its Export-Invest stablemate earlier this year. Investor's result included SKr710m in capital gains and SKr477m in dividend receipts. Shares were sold for a net SKr852m. Saab-Scania saw sales climb to SKr22.2bn from SKr17.6bn, while operating income after depreciation soared to SKr2.32bn from SKr108m. The star performer was Scania, where sales jumped 34 per cent to SKr18.8bn and operating income after depreciation rose to SKr2.45bn from SKr311m. Sales of trucks and buses rose 28 per cent to 23,500 units.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / French workshare scheme progresses THE French Senate yesterday approved a conditional form of state aid to reward companies which agree to cut the working hours of existing employees in order to reduce the country's lengthening dole queues. The Senate amendment to a new five-year employment bill must return to the national assembly, which rebuffed a not dissimilar plan last month. Since then, however, the government has swung behind the workshare scheme, making full parliamentary approval likely. Worksharing as a palliative to unemployment is increasingly in vogue, both in the EC Commission where it is expected to figure in the white paper on jobs, and in France, where unemployment reached 11.8 per cent in September and is forecast to hit 12 per cent by the year's end. Support has been growing among centrist French politicians for a fairer share-out of work than the present division, in which the 11.8 per cent of the potential workforce has no work at all, while the remaining 91.2 per cent are nominally fully employed for 39 hours a week. Free-market liberals in the government's parliamentary majority oppose worksharing as merely adding to business costs. The plan would reduce welfare charges for companies which reduce working hours by at least 15 per cent, and hire at least 10 per cent more workers. The companies would pay 40 per cent less in welfare charges for new employees in the first year of the scheme, and 30 per cent less in the second and third years.</p>

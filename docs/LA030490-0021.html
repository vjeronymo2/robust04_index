			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE PHANTOM WHITE HARE AND OTHER STORIES BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS  TRANSLATED BY DOUGLAS MUNRO (CANONGATE, DISTRIBUTED BY DAVID &amp; CHARLES,  INC.: $13.95)  </P> <P> Five short tales, only two of which previously have been translated into  English.  </P> <P> Warm, gentle and funny, "The Magic Whistle," "Peter and His Goose" and "The  King of the Moles and His Daughter" recall the stories of Hans Christian  Andersen rather than "The Three Musketeers." As "The Night of the Lepus"  demonstrated, rabbits are not generally perceived as frightening animals, yet  Dumas manages to make the snowy phantom in the title story a truly baleful  apparition. "The Adventures of Seven Stars on Earth," a jolly fable of  Jupiter's unsuccessful efforts to bring happiness to an ungrateful humanity,  evokes the rollicking tone of Dumas' popular adventure novels.  </P></p>

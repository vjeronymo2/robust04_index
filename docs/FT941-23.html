			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Attavar's petunias blaze biotechnology trail - India is hoping genetically-engineered plants will yield a rich export harvest In a laboratory in Bangalore, in south India, a researcher holds a dish with three small brown leaves sprouting from a sponge-like mat. It is a petunia, he says, the first fruits of India's commercial genetic engineering industry. The petunia is growing in a light-filled, dust-free room as clean as a hospital operating theatre inside the laboratories of Indo-American Hybrid Seeds, a producer of seeds and plants for farmers and market-gardeners in India and around the world. Founded nearly 30 years ago by Mr Manmohan Attavar, the chairman, the company is now on the fore-front of efforts by Indian and foreign companies to transform India into a principal source for the international trade in seeds and young plants. 'India's got lots of land, water and sunshine. And it has very good researchers. There's no reason why we can't export quite a bit to the rest of the world,' says 62-year-old Mr Attavar, who studied agricultural sciences in the US before returning to India to establish his business. India has a wide diversity of soils, climates and natural flora, which together have encouraged the development of a long tradition in agricultural sciences. But the decades of autarkic economic policies that followed independence restricted the contacts between Indian scientists and their foreign counterparts and limited the prospects for international trade. Moreover, domestic research was dominated by public sector institutions that often frowned upon the efforts of private companies. Also, India's refusal to subscribe to internationally-accepted norms for intellectual property rights made foreign researchers wary of sharing their knowledge. However, the liberalisation of the Indian economy in recent years and the country's decision to accept the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which binds nations to enforce strict patent laws, is bringing India into the mainstream of international trade in seeds and plants. The potential for improving the condition of Indian agriculture is also significant. For example, about half the Rs30bn-worth (Pounds 640m) of tomatoes grown annually are destroyed by viral diseases. Scientists in Mr Attavar's genetic engineering laboratory are trying to produce a disease-resistant tomato by manipulating its genetic codes. The history of Mr Attavar's company mirrors the recent history of India's plant breeding industry. He started in the 1960s by producing hybrid seeds for petunias and other plants and diversified into vegetable hybrids in the 1970s. (Hybrids are produced by cross-pollinating plants to encourage the development of particular qualities, such as resistance to disease or above-average size in vegetables. Producers sell either seeds or plants to farmers and other customers. Indo-American Hybrid Seeds became the country's largest exporter of flower seeds and a leading exporter of vegetable seeds, including tomatoes. Last year its annual sales topped Rs150m, of which Rs65m was exported. Mr Attavar invested heavily in research and development and in 1988 established a biotechnology laboratory for producing plants by tissue-culture - that is growing whole plants from fragments of plants. The technique permits the large-scale reproduction of plants bred for particular qualities, including bananas, vanilla, chrysanthemum and carnations. The newest development is the genetic engineering laboratory, set up last year with the latest imported equipment. It is home to the genetically-engineered petunia, a plant developed mainly to test techniques. Researchers are working on disease-resistant tomatoes, flowers that will stay fresh longer after they are cut and grains with an extra-high protein content. They also dream of creating blue roses (produced in only a handful of genetic engineering laboratories) and blue lilies (which, Indo-American says have yet to be grown anywhere). The international trade in seeds and plants is largely in the hands of companies in the US, the Netherlands and Italy. But developing countries including Thailand are expanding rapidly. Mr John Hamilton, managing director of Cargill India, an affiliate of Cargill the American seeds company, says India's export prospects are 'brilliant'. Cargill, which started its Indian business in 1988, has been at the centre of controversy over commercial seed development. Indian farmers last year attacked the company's Bangalore office claiming that seed companies would seize control of seed development and use post-Uruguay Round patent laws to prevent farmers from trading in their own seeds. The protests were largely based on a misunderstanding of the Uruguay Round, though they also reflected genuine fears of farmers about the impact of new technologies (often of foreign origin) on their work and way of life. Mr Attavar says the farmers have little need to worry as new breeds of plant will improve yields and raise rural standards of living. Far from being harmed by international trade, farmers will benefit by winning access to seeds for crops with export potential. 'If we use the right seeds and improve our transport our agricultural produce can be marketed everywhere in the world.' Protectionist trade regimes in the US, the EU and Japan will restrict access to these markets but Indian farmers will have plenty of scope in nearby countries, notably in the Gulf.</p>

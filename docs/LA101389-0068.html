			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL PUSHES FOR SAFETY CHANGES ON SCHOOL BUSES  </P> <P> More safety features are needed on the nation's 41,000 small school buses to  protect children in accidents, the head of the National Transportation Safety  Board said Thursday.  </P> <P> James Kolstad, acting board chairman, said an investigation into the buses that  make up 10% to 15% of the total school bus fleet shows that injuries to  students in accidents generally have been minor.  </P> <P> "But the board believes that improvements can be made," Kolstad said in  discussing the report adopted by the board Wednesday.  </P> <P> The report found small buses to be generally safe but called for improved  front-door latches and windshield retention and several tests to determine  whether tough standards for larger buses should be extended to those built to  carry between 10 and 24 children.  </P> <P> The board said that although school buses remain one of the safest of all forms  of transportation, some smaller buses have been modified in ways that increase  the chance of injury in a crash, particularly to children in the front row.  </P> <P> "In some cases, passenger lap belts and other restraints had been installed . .  . in a manner inconsistent with federal standards for seat belts, diminishing  crash protection and increasing the potential to induce injury," the board said  in its findings. " . . . Small school buses lack the built-in crash advantage  of superior size and weight provided by large school buses."  </P></p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Ascii in search for funding to repay bonds ASCII, the aggressively expanding Japanese publishing and computer software company, said yesterday it was in talks with its banks in an effort to raise new funding to repay Y10.7bn in convertible bonds which mature next March. Trading of Ascii shares on the over-the-counter market was temporarily suspended yesterday following reports that Ascii was encountering difficulty in its search for a capital injection or fresh funding from its banks. Ascii's debts have grown rapidly as the company has expanded into new ventures, including film production and multi-media. The traditional business of Ascii, founded by three university students in 1977, was publishing, software and integrated circuit design. Ascii is Japan's largest independent software company. Ascii's net debt stood at Y24.12bn (Dollars 190m) at the end of March, compared with Y19.74bn a year earlier. The economic slowdown also forced Ascii's rapid growth to a halt last year, when revenues grew by just 1 per cent to Y34.5bn. Pre-tax profits, however, grew by 20 per cent to Y1.52bn, following an effort by the company to cut costs. The company said yesterday that modest growth in the first quarter of the current fiscal year continued but a spokesman said it would have a problem repaying Y10.7bn in convertible bonds. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the economic daily, reported yesterday that Ascii's banks, which include the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Fuji Bank, Sakura Bank and Mitsubishi Bank, want Ascii to shed some of its investments in other companies before they will agree to a new funding package. They also want the company to take more drastic steps to cut costs. Ascii said it could not comment on the substance of the negotiations, which began last year, until they were completed. A year ago a boardroom dispute led to the resignation of two of Ascii's founders, leaving the more aggressive Mr Kasuhiko Nishi, 36, as president.</p>

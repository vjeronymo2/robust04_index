			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Hesse Minister Demands Kurds </F> Distance Themselves From PKK"]    [Text] Wiesbaden -- The Hesse Office for the Protection of  the Constitution sees indications of actions aimed against the  constitution among the Republikaner. This can be seen from the  "Situation Report on Extremism" in Hesse, which was presented by  Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (Social Democratic Party of  Germany) yesterday. Despite assertions to the contrary, such  indications are found both in programs and fliers of  Schoenhuber's party as well as in statements by various  functionaries.    According to the report, the number of right-wing extremist  crimes rose to 972 last year, compared with 888 the year before.  About 4,600 persons are organized in the right-wing extremist  scene in Hesse. The efforts to link the various organizations  with the help of the so-called Anti-Antifa Campaign  [Anti-Antifascist Campaign] and to call for actions against the  political opponents are watched with concern, Guenther said.    The minister noted that it is alarming that left-wing  extremists are increasingly using violence against right-wing  extremists. Of 151 violations of the law with left-wing  extremist motives registered in Hesse, 87 were acts of violence  against rightists. The concentration of such excesses after  spectacular actions by right-wing extremists -- e.g. after the  neo-Nazi march in Fulda -- shows "that an unacceptable form of  lynch justice is being exercised here."    Concerning the Red Army Faction (RAF), Guenther noted: "Even  after the latest announcements by the RAF, an end of the `armed  struggle' is not in sight."    The minister called on the large number of Kurds, who live  peacefully in Germany, to distance themselves from the banned  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Only 600 of the 40,000-50,000  Kurds in Hesse are PKK members.</p>

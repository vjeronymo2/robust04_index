			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESPONSE TO EDITORIAL ON GUN CONTROL  </P> <P> In response to your editorial "Suddenly, It's Realityland (Feb. 18)," former  President Ronald Reagan might say: "Now there you go again."  </P> <P> Once more you have escalated an isolated, albeit unfortunate, incident of  firearms misuse into a call for "stricter gun control to keep our streets . . .  safer."  </P> <P> Little Nayeli Diana Placentia was the victim of horribly bad luck and a  thoughtless person who committed a very stupid act. She and her family are due  our compassion and empathy, but the circumstances do not support the  conclusions fostered in your anti-gun editorial.  </P> <P> The problems associated with the random discharge of firearms cannot be  ignored. What is required is an intense, continuing educational effort. We must  foster the notion that reporting random shooters by name and address is the  right thing to do. And we must provide a safe, anonymous way for their  neighbors to do so.  </P> <P> Education and enforcement are much better solutions to this problem than your  continuing efforts to deprive law-abiding citizens of their constitutional  rights.  </P> <P> DAVID C. BRITTON  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw </F> Kaczmarek by correspondent Mariola Krzyzaniak; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Krzyzaniak] The most popular privatization method  is the employees shareholding scheme. But your ministry is  rejecting increasing numbers of applications for this form of  ownership transformation from employees' joint-partnership  companies. Employees resent these refusals, saying: First you  let us choose our preferred form of privatization, and now you  refuse to approve it.    [Kaczmarek] Employees' joint-partnership companies are very  good at seeing to work forces' social welfare provisions. On  the other hand, there are two areas they find difficult to deal  with. The first is the price, usually too low, which the  employees' joint companies offer in the bid to buy their  enterprises. The second area is these companies' credibility as  regards realization of the investment-package deals. I am an  advocate of the quickest method of selling small and medium-size  enterprises. I believe that, in their case, success is measured  in terms of their stable functioning and development. I do not  need to aim for getting the highest possible prices for them.  However, I should like to adopt a slightly different approach  to larger enterprises.    [Krzyzaniak] Where does a medium enterprise end and a large  one begin?    [Kaczmarek] I think privatization by liquidation can be  approved for enterprises employing up to 400 persons. In some  cases, this number can be larger: We can negotiate in the case  of enterprises with up to 500-700 employees. The upper limit is  an enterprise whose turnover, in money terms, amounts to a  maximum of 12 million ECU's [European Currency Units] and whose  statutory fund and enterprise fund amount to a maximum of 8  million ECU's. If a given enterprise fits in this category, we  will happily approve privatization by liquidation. If it  exceeds them, it should be privatized by capital takeover. Of  course, in well-justified cases, we can depart from these limits.    [Krzyzaniak] To what extent is your limit on privatization  through employees' shareholding schemes imposed by the  requirement that the Ownership Transformations Ministry transfer  all profits from privatization by capital takeover to the state  budget?    [Kaczmarek] Such a requirement does exist, and we must  remember that the state budget does not profit much from a  transaction whereby an enterprise is sold to its employees and  its status changed to that of a an employees' joint-partnership  company. However, we can still view employees'  joint-partnership companies as taxpayers. I am not against  employees' companies. I believe we should seek solutions  together, in partnership.    [Krzyzaniak] The progress of privatization has been halted  in certain sectors, especially those connected with agriculture.  Debates are in progress on whether privatization should be  controlled by the Ownership Transformations Ministry solely, or  also by other ministries, such as the Agriculture Ministry and  the Industry and Trade Ministry.    [Kaczmarek] I am firmly opposed to the transfer of ownership  transformation powers to other ministries. They should attend,  instead, to the creation of model programs and solutions for  individual branches of industry. We have a ready example here  in the grain, sugar, and tobacco products manufacturing  industries. It is strange, to say the least, that the same  ministry that halts the privatization of tobacco products  manufacturing enterprises issues licenses to other firms to  build new cigarette factories. Of course, we, too, implement  model solutions. An example here is the National Investment  Funds project. The only people with sufficient expertise on  privatization can be found at the Ownership Transformations  Ministry and voivodship offices. We often hear complaints about  the privatization schemes and, consequently, about my ministry.  But the majority of investigation proceedings, prosecution  cases, protests, and problems with ownership supervision that  accompany the implementation of the privatization scheme are  connected with other sectors.    [Krzyzaniak] Nevertheless, there has been a noticeable  slowing down of the privatization processes. One of the reasons  for this is the conflict between individual ministries over  their respective ranges of competence. What is the source of  this conflict?    [Kaczmarek] Without any doubt, work on the Enterprises Pact  and the associated promise of the issue of free shares to  employees caused considerable delays. Employees preferred to  wait until the pact came into force. I declare that I will not  touch the 20 percent of shares reserved for employees. Another  reason is that the management structure at the voivodship level  is currently undergoing a series of changes, and it is in  voivodships that two-thirds of all privatization operations take  place.    [Krzyzaniak] Foreign investors buy shares in our factories  when they bring their money to Poland. There is also another  group of investors that builds factories from scratch on our  territory: these are the so-called greenfield projects.  Examples of the latter practice are the chocolate factory near  Wroclaw that is being built by Cutberry [as published; Cadbury  would have been intended but transcribed incorrectly by  interviewer] or the Dutch-Japanese battery-manufacturing plant  in Gniezno. These plants are often competitive in relation to  already established Polish enterprises.    [Kaczmarek] My principal area of responsibility is to  encourage foreign investors interested in Polish enterprises to  undertake to transform and modernize these enterprises. Today  these projects receive priority status in which a strategic  investor enters the enterprise. On the other hand, I cannot say  I am not interested in the greenfield projects you just  mentioned. They provide additional bridging components in our  scheme, and they greatly facilitate our cooperation with  international financial institutions and foreign investors. If  we refuse entry to greenfield projects and welcome only  investors interested in bringing their capital to our  privatization projects, we will build a trap for ourselves and  discourage much Western capital from coming here. Because these  are firms that operate on the principle of starting from  scratch, we spend tremendous sums of money on getting foreign  investors interested in Poland, and this is beginning to bring  results. Foreign capital investors have already invested more  than $3 billion. The Germans, for example, were quite upset to  learn that they are only in fifth place as regards the amount of  capital invested. They have been left behind by the Americans,  the multinational capital, the Italians, and the Dutch.</p>

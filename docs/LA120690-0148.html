			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> CITY WON'T APPEAL DAYWORKER RULING  </P> <P> City officials have dropped plans to fight in court for a controversial clause  in an ordinance that prohibited people from going to certain sites to solicit  work.  </P> <P> The city last year identified three areas that draw the heaviest concentrations  of dayworkers and added a clause to its anti-solicitation ordinance prohibiting  people from being within 300 feet of those sites with the intent to solicit  employment from people in cars.  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union sued to stop enforcement of the provision,  arguing that it was vague and violated freedoms of speech and assembly  guaranteed under the First Amendment, and an Orange County Superior Court judge  agreed.  </P> <P> The City Council in July had voted to appeal the decision. But new information  presented by City Atty. Thomas Kathe convinced council members that an appeal  would fail, Mayor Mary Hornbuckle said. She would not say what that new  information was.  </P> <P> In addition, Hornbuckle said the council will look at other provisions in the  ordinance, especially one that established a hiring hall for legal residents to  find work.  </P> <P> "I think there is some sentiment for looking at the entire ordinance," she  said.  </P> <P> Council members will look at whether the city has been successful in  prosecuting suspected offenders and whether the ordinance has alleviated the  problem of dayworkers gathering in certain areas, especially Lions Park.  </P> <P> Hornbuckle said other cities, such as Encinitas, that adopted similar measures  have modified them for a variety of reasons, including reducing the city's  liability. She said Costa Mesa might be held liable if an employer who hires  someone from the city's hiring hall is found by the Immigration and  Naturalization Service to be employing an illegal immigrant.  </P> <P> "We have not had a case challenging that, but the possibility exists,"  Hornbuckle said.

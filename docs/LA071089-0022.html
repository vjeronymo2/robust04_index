			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> American ballerina Eva Evdokimova was on the bill to dance Mikhail Fokine's  "The Dying Swan" Sunday at a command performance in the Casino de Monte Carlo.  Prince Rainier III and Princess Caroline of Monaco were expected to attend the  performance, a benefit for the John Gilpin Scholarship Fund of the Academie de  Danse Classique Princesse Grace. Evdokimova claims she is the highest-paid  dancer in ballet history. The reason: When she danced the two-minute, 58-second  "Dying Swan" last September in Berlin (in front of Frederick the Great's  palace), she received a custom-built Mercedes-Benz, valued at more than  $80,000. Evdokimova, 40, has been prima ballerina of the Deutsche Oper, Berlin,  since 1973. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

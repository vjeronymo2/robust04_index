			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> EXUBERANT NEW YORK VOICES  </P> <P> New York Voices, a quintet of singers from Upstate New York that opened at the  Catalina Bar and Grill on Tuesday evening, has borrowed liberally from the  vocal jazz group tradition. There's a little bit of Lambert, Hendricks &amp;  Ross, a little bit of Jackie &amp; Roy, some Double Six of Paris and more than  a sprinkling of the Manhattan Transfer.  </P> <P> Though certainly not lacking its own identity, the group form is so limiting as  to make New York Voices, first formed as a vocal quartet at Ithaca College,  sound like most other jazz vocal groups with their overwritten parts, tight  harmonies, swing rhythms and annoying penchant for a cappella excursions. What  will distinguish this handsome, exuberant group from the rest of the pack --  small, though that pack may be -- is a repertoire that extends beyond the  expected.  </P> <P> During its opening-night set Tuesday, the group made several strides in that  direction with a handful of offerings that showed a willingness to do more than  merely sing a song of Basie.  </P> <P> Directed by singer-saxophonist Darmon Meader, the group opened with a brisk  rendering of Juan Tizol and Duke Ellington's "Caravan." The classic tune, which  featured the first bit of uninspired scatting (there was too much of it  throughout the set), was flawed by a sound system that made it difficult, if  not impossible, to understand the lyrics. That problem persisted throughout the  set, with the notable exceptions of "Stolen Moments," the group's only ballad  of the evening, and "Baroque Samba," which was wordless vocalese.  </P> <P> Other instances of seeking higher jazz ground came in the unlikely, but quite  workable form of "Top Secret," a rock-funk piece from the fusion group the  Yellowjackets, with lyrics by group member Caprice Fox, and a pair of  originals, the joyous sounding "National Amnesia" and the rocking "Dare the  Moon." Again, though, the pieces could be appreciated only for their musical  value as the lyrics were inaudible.  </P> <P> New York Voice was accompanied capably by pianist Jon Werking, bassist Chuck  Bergeron, who soloed beautifully on "Stolen Moments," and drummer Tommy Igoe.  Combined with the tenor saxophone of Meader's and some tasty synthesizer work  by vocalist Peter Eldridge, the musical backdrops created provided plenty of  interest.  </P> <P> Singers Kim Nazarian and, especially, Sara Krieger, provided some superb solo  moments -- though not enough of them -- during the hourlong opening set.  </P> <P> (RELATED STORY: F7) A.

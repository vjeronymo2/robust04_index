			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Lower bond prices put brake on US stocks Wall Street Amid further weakness in the bond market, US stock indices generally finished with little change yesterday in spite of sharp swings in some individual share prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a slight 0.29 off at 3,906.03, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 0.70 to 471.06. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite firmed 0.84 to 477.68 and the Nasdaq composite added 3.50 at 782.70. New York SE volume, at 318m shares, was heavy. Advancing issues led declines by 1,165 to 949. Overnight rallies on many foreign stock markets provided a positive tone for Wall Street, which was already cheered by Monday's rebound from a 96-point rout in the final session of last week. The Dow climbed about 10 points within minutes of the opening bell. However, in the absence of any leading economic news, share prices could not sustain their forward momentum. News of a 4.2 per cent gain in fourth-quarter non-farm productivity barely raised a ripple. Instead, investors were distracted by the US Treasury market, which continued to lose ground in the wake of the Federal Reserve's move to tighten short-term interest rates on Friday. The bench-mark 30-year issue was down  23/32 at 97 13/16 in late trading, amid concern over the issuance of new supply by the Treasury. Among the blue chips, heavy gains by some stocks were nearly balanced with hefty losses by others. Caterpillar powered Dollars 3 1/2 ahead to Dollars 108, while General Motors was lifted Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 . Sears Roebuck dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 after the retailer disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter operating results. By contrast, Allied Signal forged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 77 3/8 after posting fourth-quarter net earnings of 41 cents a share, against 32 cents a year earlier, and boosting its dividend by 16 per cent. Alcoa, another Dow Industrial component, showed no signs of stumbling. It climbed a further Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 79 3/8 as investors followed through on Monday's announcement of deep production cuts. 3M appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 105 7/8 . In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer was marked down Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 3/8 on warning of lower profits in the first quarter, following a sharp slowdown in sales growth in the final three months of last year. The bearish sentiment spilled over into some other drug stocks. Schering-Plough declined Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 60 3/4 . Consumer products companies, which have stayed out of the limelight in recent weeks, resurfaced with falls. Philip Morris shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 and Procter &amp; Gamble Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 57. On the Nasdaq, America Online surged Dollars 3 to Dollars 73 1/2 , after a Dollars 5 3/4 rise the previous day. The company, which offers information services through home computers, announced a strategic alliance with NBC late on Monday. Among other technology issues, Sierra On-Line jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 22 7/8 on strong earnings, but Microsoft fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 78 3/4 . Canada Toronto showed a slightly firmer bias after fairly active trading. The TSE 300 index ended 3.5 up at 4,452.2 and rises outpaced falls by 435 to 346. Volume was 70.8m shares. The 14 stock groups were evenly split between rises and falls. Industrial products added 1.3 per cent and mining 1.2 per cent, while conglomerates and real estate also posted gains exceeding 1 per cent. Pipelines declined by 1.1 per cent. Brazil Sao Paulo was 4.6 per cent ahead by the close as investors awaited a congressional vote on a major element of the government's anti-inflation programme, which was approved by congress later that day. The Bovespa index gained 3,926 at 88,799, while turnover came to Cr176.8bn (USDollars 344.5m). Late yesterday Brazil's congress approved a key part of the government's economic stabilisation plan, voting in favour of a Dollars 16bn emergency fund.</p>

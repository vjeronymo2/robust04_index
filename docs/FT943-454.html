			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / People: Finance moves Hilary Wild, 45, who has been with Kleinwort Benson Investment Management since 1990, has been appointed managing director of Kleinwort Benson Charities, the firm's fund management division, where she will be responsible for managing funds in excess of Pounds 500m. Wild's career is evidence that being a chartered accountant does not necessarily lead to a dull life; she spent time in Greece - between 1981-84, as country representative for Marine Midland bank - and New York, where from 1986-1990 she was chief of finance at the United Nations Children's Fund. At UNICEF, which she found a very dynamic entity, Wild was primarily involved in overseeing the Dollars 350m short-term investments of the organisation, as well as keeping a close eye on cash-flows of the 100-plus field offices. Joining Kleinwort Benson, she first was involved again in shipping finance, before taking over as sales director of leasing and asset finance. She became a director of Kleinwort Benson Ltd in 1992. In her new role she will be looking after the funds of more than 80 medical, educational, religious and other charities. In July this year Kleinwort launched two funds, the Chariguard UK Equity Fund and the Chariguard Fixed Interest Fund, the first an index-linked fund, the second a more conventional fund investing in government securities.</p>

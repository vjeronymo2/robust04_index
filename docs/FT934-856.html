			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: IBM brings in another outsider International Business Machines yesterday named an outsider with a strong consumer marketing background, but little high technology experience, to head two key businesses: personal computers and IBM's new PowerPC chip operation. Mr Richard Thoman, 49, was previously head of international operations at Nabisco, the foods group. Before that he was in charge of international operations at American Express and co-chief executive of the group's Travel Related Services business. In the 1970s he was an associate at management consultants McKinsey. At all three companies he worked closely with Mr Lou Gerstner, the former chairman of RJR Nabisco who was appointed chairman of IBM earlier this year. The appointment of a non-technologist to run the fast-changing PC businesses may provoke controversy in the computer industry but it fits with Mr Gerstner's policy of bringing fresh blood into IBM's inward-looking culture. Analysts said that the company's PC businesses, which are heavily geared towards business customers, could benefit from a marketing expert better able to tap the fast-growing consumer end of the business. Mr Thoman said yesterday that he brought to the company 'an understanding of how consumers think and act, and an understanding of how to sell to them'. He hoped this would complement IBM's technological expertise. Mr Thoman, who will become a member of IBM's corporate executive committee, takes the place at the PC businesses of Mr James Cannavino, who was recently named IBM's top corporate strategist.</p>

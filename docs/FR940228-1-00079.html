			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations governing program participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements state only the basic terms of participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs and the purpose and scope of the agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the Secretary and individual institutions. All of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific provisions of the program participation agreement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are listed in section 487(a) of the HEA are not restated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Instead, all the specific statutory provisions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the actual agreement signed between the Secretary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual institutions. The Secretary proposes to revise this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of the regulations to include not only the new provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of program participation agreements added by the Amendments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992, but also those provisions previously prescribed by the HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not specifically spelled out in this section. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will specify which proposed changes have been made to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section as a result of the Amendments of 1992 to distinguish them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the provisions that the Secretary proposes to add that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already existed under the HEA, but have not been codified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional provisions of program participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements enumerated in the HEA, as well as other changes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary is proposing in order to clarify what the agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover and to reflect new procedures and statutory language, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By providing a comprehensive list of the provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basic program participation agreement in one section, thus making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to all the provisions more convenient, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hopes to facilitate institutions' understanding of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities with respect to initial and continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to clarify the scope of the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation agreement. By signing a program participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement, an institution indicates it understands that its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial or continued participation in the Title IV, HEA programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is contingent on compliance with the Student Assistance General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions regulations, the regulations of the specific Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA programs in which the institution participates, and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional requirements specific to that institution that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary requires the institution to meet. Further, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to make clear the long-standing practice that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program participation agreement applies to each branch or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other additional location of the institution that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable requirements of the Student Assistance General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions, unless the Secretary specifies otherwise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to specify that by entering into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participation agreement the institution agrees to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not only with statutory and regulatory requirements, but also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any special arrangement, agreement, or limitation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed expansion of this provision is necessary to make it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear that if it is to participate in a Title IV, HEA program, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must adhere not only to those requirements listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute and regulations, but to any conditions of provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, any limitation imposed on the institution to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution has agreed, or any other special arrangement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution makes pursuant to statutory or regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority under Title IV of the HEA. The Secretary also believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is necessary to clarify the Secretary's longstanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation that to begin or continue to participate in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program, an institution must comply with each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement applicable to that program, not just selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add a clause specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring that institutions that receive Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds under an advance payment method must time their requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for funds to meet immediate programs needs. The Secretary finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this addition is necessary because, in the absence of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically stated requirement, too many institutions have drawn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> down funds in excess of immediate need, thereby adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessarily to the Federal debt by causing the Treasury to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incur interest costs on funds given to institutions that were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to meet immediate needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendments of 1992, as clarified by the Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1993, has removed the requirement that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may not request from or charge any student a fee for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing or handling the Federal Student Assistance Report, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform with other statutory provisions of the Amendments of 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that eliminated previous references to that report. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary would remove the corresponding regulatory language from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section. No change has been made to the general requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution may not request from or charge any student a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee for processing or handling any application, form, or data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to determine a student's eligibility for, and amount of,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the HEA, an institution must establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and maintain necessary administrative and fiscal procedures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records to ensure proper and efficient administration of Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA program funds that the institution receives from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary or from students. Further, the Amendments of 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that the institution provide, upon request and in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely manner, information relating to its administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability and financial responsibility of the institution to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary, the appropriate State postsecondary review entity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated under Part H of Title IV of the HEA, any applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, and the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agency or agencies. The Secretary proposes to add to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this list of agencies the institution's State agency with legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction over the institution and, where appropriate, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency recognized by the Secretary for the approval of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public postsecondary education as an alternative to accreditation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or preaccreditation. The Secretary believes that it is important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these agencies also have access to information regarding an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's financial responsibility and administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

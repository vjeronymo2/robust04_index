			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT pool for shares I understand that when shares are added to an existing holding, the base cost of the total holding (old and new) has to be used in any capital gains work - and there is not a 'last in, first out' arrangement for subsequent sales. If, however, one holding is personal and the additional one is in a nominee name, how are the above rules applied? Shares in your own name, and those in the name of a nominee, are pooled for CGT purposes without regard to the difference in registration. This follows from sections 60(1) and 107(1&amp;2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992: 60(1) 'In relation to assets held by a person as nominee for another person . . . this Act shall apply as if the property were vested in . . . the person . . . for whom he is the nominee . . .' 107(1) 'Where a person disposes of securities, the securities disposed-of shall be identified in accordance with the provisions of this section with securities of the same class acquired by him which could be comprised in that disposal.' (2) 'This section applies notwithstanding that securities disposed of are otherwise identified by the disposal or by a transfer or delivery giving effect to it . . .'

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (4): An ill wind wakes up the hedgers - The 'no' factor ALL FUTURES and options markets thrive on financial chaos, and the Barcelona-based Mercado de Futuros Financieros SA (Meffsa) put on a lot of weight when Denmark's 'no' to Maastricht, on June 2, painted the Spanish bond market as distinctly bearish. Until that referendum, Meffsa's record number of daily contracts on notional three- and 10-year bonds, priced at Pta10m (Pounds 54,000), had been set on December 19 last year and had totalled 17,000. On June 3, 43,770 fixed-income contracts were traded. Fearing that economic and monetary union (Emu) within the European Community was in doubt, as a result of the Danish 'no', investors had taken a particularly jaundiced look at their Spanish bonds. Spain became even less the flavour of the month when the subsequent French decision also to stage a Maastricht referendum fuelled the doubts of the Emusceptics. The investors had, after all, entered the domestic bond market because of the so-called Maastricht factor - a codeword for a belief that Spanish interest rates would fall as the Spanish economy converged with those of northern Europe, in order to meet the Emu criteria agreed at the EC's Maastricht summit last December. If, in the thinking of investors, Maastricht was being questioned, then Spanish convergence was likewise in doubt and Spain was quite definitely off the menu. The average yield on Spanish government paper had stood at 10.89 on June 2, and it shot up to 11.06 the following day. By June 9, it stood at 11.48. The price of the 10-year bonds, the favourite target of foreign investors, dropped by more than three points in just four days, falling from 96.55 per cent to 93.25 per cent. On June 3, Meffsa's record-breaking contract day, the marketmakers' limit of a 200 basis points spread was already stretched to snapping point, when Wall Street opened at 2.30 pm local Barcelona time and began to drag bond prices down further. At 2.45 pm, 15 minutes before the 3 pm cut-off time when the Barcelona futures market shuts down its computer terminals, Meffsa obtained authorisation from the Bank of Spain, the monetary regulators, to widen its spread to 230 points. Meffsa was thus very much in its element, doing exactly what it is supposed to do, as it matched investors in a hurry to sell their bonds with speculators who believed that prices had touched bottom and were willing to gamble on a position. The reckoning came later as the Barcelona futures market spread the 'I told you so' word. Meffsa is still in its infancy, for it was created in March 1990 and relaunched in December last year as a holding company that based fixed-income and currency futures and options in Barcelona and located futures and options contracts on stock indexes in Madrid. The word was that Meffsa's business of selling notional bonds - it trades in the 90-day Madrid interbank offered rate (Mibor 90) and in five-year bonds, as well as in three- and 10-year paper - was the sort of business treasurers, and fund managers, should have built into their day-to-day routine of corporate husbandry. 'We had spent a long time telling all these people that they had to hedge against interest rates going up,' says Mr Pablo Larraga, Meffsa's manager. In theory, it is all the easier to drive home the message now that the horse has bolted because the stable door was left open. Meffsa's moral, as it is that of every futures market in fixed income, is that the notional bonds, thanks to the marketmakers, trade in far narrower spreads than on the open market; at crisis times, as occured earlier this month, it is far cheaper for buyers and sellers alike to use the services provided by the Meffsa's of the financial world. The moral is hard to sell when the markets, cosily ensconced in convergence plans, are stable. But when 'no's' to Maastricht blow big holes through such plans, and the markets, especially sensitive ones such as Spain's, become hyper-volatile, then there should be willing listeners to the tale that Meffsa has to tell. The post-Danish referendum 'black week' for the Spanish bond market was a distinctly upbeat one for Meffsa. In time, it may come to be looked upon as the true foundation date of the domestic futures and options market, as the week that woke up hesitant hedgers among the corporate community and jolted them into into acquiring new treasury skills.</p>

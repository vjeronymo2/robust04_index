			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / UK squandering peace opportunity, says Adams: Hopes fade that IRA will accept declaration Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, yesterday accused Britain of 'squandering a unique opportunity for peace', adding to growing government pessimism on the likelihood that the IRA and Sinn Fein will accept the Downing Street declaration. In remarks that dashed expectations of an early decision by the republican movement on accepting the declaration as a basis for peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Adams demanded changes in the British government's position. He said that although Dublin had given some clarification of the declaration, London had 'stalled, delayed and refused' to explain further a document which he described as a 'masterpiece of ambiguity'. He claimed it would be impossible for Sinn Fein to give a definitive response without more information. Both London and Dublin have repeatedly insisted that the IRA must end violence before Sinn Fein can join talks on the future of Northern Ireland. When they meet next weekend, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, will be expected to declare their determination to press on with the broad process of negotiations. Giving no sign of any softening in Sinn Fein's stance, Mr Adams rejected what he described as the unionist veto on constitutional changes in Northern Ireland. He insisted that London would have to join the 'persuaders' in seeking to convince unionists that their future lay 'with the rest of the Irish people'. Interviewed on ITV's Walden programme, in which Mr Adams's statements were read by an actor, he called on ministers to go the extra mile for peace. 'Unless the British government says to the unionists: 'Your future rests with the rest of the Irish people' - unless it makes that small step forward, then that government cannot say it is interested in peace.' He said republicans recognised that they needed the consent and full participation of unionists in the process, but that they did not want the British government 'sitting on its hands and blaming and using the unionists'. Mr Adams added: 'Let us not squander the opportunity for peace on the rock of either a veto or on the British refusing to join the persuaders.' Mr Adams said if the British government believed the joint declaration was a basis for a political settlement, it should be prepared for further discussion. Downing Street said last night the government's position on the declaration remained unchanged. It said it was 'deeds not words' that were important and that all the IRA had to do if it wanted progress in Northern Ireland was to abandon violence. Republicans' turn at the wheel, Page 6</p>

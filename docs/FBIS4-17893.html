			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russia Will Sell to Syria `Only </F> Defense Weapons'"]    [Text] Boris Kolokolov, Russian Federation deputy foreign  minister, has stated that Russia will not sell offensive weapons  to Syria. "The question now is only the selling of spare parts  for weapons delivered earlier. We can only speak about the  deliveries to Syria of spare parts and `defense weapons,'" he  said. He also pointed out that Russia would give Tel Aviv  "whatever help it can" in looking for Israeli soldiers taken  prisoner or missing in action: "Oleg Soskovets, who is on a  visit to Damascus, has already been instructed correspondingly,"  Mr. Kolokolov said.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Danes see rapid rate of growth Denmark will enjoy the fastest-growing economy in the European Union in both 1994 and 1995, according to forecasts published by the economy ministry yesterday. The ministry predicts a gross domestic product growth rate of 3.0 per cent in 1994, rising to 3.3 per cent in 1995. The stimulus will come mainly from private consumption, expected to rise in real terms by 4.1 per cent next year and 4.5 per cent in 1995. This will generate a recovery in business investment and housing as well, the ministry predicts. Exports, which fell by about 5 per cent this year following devaluations by Sweden and the UK, will also revive, increasing by about 2.7 per cent next year and by 4.8 per cent in 1995.</p>

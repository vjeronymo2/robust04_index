			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (9): Africa's second biggest stock market  -David White finds that an old-fashioned clubbable place has been transformed in two years The sleepy Casablanca stock market, accustomed to being an old-fashioned, clubbable place where nothing much went on, has come to life. New share issues, privatisation, the arrival of foreign investment funds and radical reform of the bourse's organisation have transformed it in less than two years. According to Mr Adil Douiri, co-founder of Casablanca Finance Group (CFG), an investment bank set up in 1992 and still the only institution of its kind in Morocco, the Casablanca bourse has now established itself as the chief stock market on the African continent outside South Africa, with a market capitalisation of some Dollars 5bn. The reform, approved in September 1993 and still in the process of being implemented, is based on the current French system. Like the French Societe des Bourses Franc,aises, which is providing advice, it involves converting the market into a limited company in which the stockbrokers are shareholders. Among its aims are better company information, more protection for investors and a broader range of financial instruments. It brings in a new supervisory body, the obscurely-named Conseil Deontologique des Valeurs Mobilieres. Up to now, Moroccan businesses have relied on the banking system rather than the share and bond markets to provide funds. Up to 1991, most of the activity on the bourse was in government bonds. Since then, however, equities have taken over and now account for 95 per cent of trading. Interest picked up last year with a series of share offerings - something not seen in Casablanca for a long time. The starting point was an offering of shares in the family-held Wafabank in December 1992. Foreign interest awakened in the form of US and UK-based portfolio managers specialising in emerging markets. These funds continue to dominate foreign investment in the market, with little showing from continental Europe. Their increasing involvement in the Casablanca market reflects an improved perception generally of the Moroccan economy, now that the IMF-led adjustment of the 1980s is completed and the country has resumed repaying its debts after a series of rescheduling agreements. In the past 12 months, some Dollars 200m of foreign money has come onto the market, according to Mr Douiri, about 40 per cent of total volume. He expects the foreign inflow to reach Dollars 500m next year. Trading volume increased 362 per cent last year to Dh2.44bn by CFG's calculation (the figure differs from the turnover total published by the bourse, which includes the separate figures for purchases and sales). Volume this year is already well past 1993's full-year total. Market capitalisation, again using CFG's calculation, showed an increase of 44 per cent to Dh32.9bn at the end of the year, three times the level of 1990. (This figure reflects the value of the whole capital of quoted companies, whereas the bourse uses a smaller figure based on shareholdings placed on the market.) Prices last year rose by 26 per cent, and had already exceeded that rate of increase by mid-October this year. The boost in activity has been greatly helped by share placements made by the state as part of privatisation deals, starting with the CTM transport company in June last year and following by the Cior cement concern. Both were heavily oversubscribed. In addition, there have been private sector capital increases - notably by Omnium Nord Africain (ONA), the country's largest company. Its Dh1.5bn issue of common stock in May this year was the biggest operation ever made on the bourse by an industrial group. ONA is a wide-ranging conglomerate based largely on agribusiness but with interests ranging from a television channel to car sales. The king has an 18 per cent stake. (It is somehow typical of Morocco that an uninformed outsider could read the whole of the 100-page prospectus without becoming aware of this.) Another issue is awaited from General Tire of Morocco, half-controlled by Germany's Continental group. More shares will come onto the market in the next few weeks and months as the government completes its initial list of privatisations. This will include 16 per cent of the shares of the holding company Societe Nationale d'Investissement, which was the best-performing stock on the market last year, with a 171 per cent price increase. The sell-offs have also played a role in increasing public awareness about the market through full-page press advertisements, and in bringing in new investors. Stockbrokers believe the market can absorb all the privatisation issues as long as Moroccan residents continue to be debarred from investing in capital markets abroad. There is also hope that the stock market reforms could lead Moroccan emigrants - there are some 800,000 in France alone - to channel a large part of their money transfers into industrial investments instead of into real estate. The first significant involvement of Moroccan households as investors, in a market overwhelmingly dominated up to now by institutions, is expected to come with the launching of the mutual funds in the next two months. These will be open to foreign investors but are geared mainly to tapping domestic savings. Mr Douiri says mutual funds could bring in Dollars 300m, as a 'conservative' estimate, in the first year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        CASABLANCA STOCK MARKET                   (FIGURES IN MILLIONS OF DIRHAMS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   1989    1990    1991    1992    1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover (purchases and sales)     672   1,806   1,156   1,052   4,870 Capitalisation of shares traded  5,043   7,768  12,449  16,975  25,993 General index                   122.65  158.68  161.09  201.88  256.07 Number of quoted companies          71      69      68      68      65  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bourse des Valeurs de Casablanca  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------     CFG 25-SHARE INDEX  -----------------------------      End-year change over       previous 12 months  ----------------------------- 1988               +29.15% 1989               +26.50% 1990               +39.45% 1991               +29.84% 1992                +2.35% 1993               +25.65%  -----------------------------</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / French small business jobs deal: Balladur secures promise of 200,000 more posts for young THE French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, has enlisted the small business sector in his fight to cut unemployment, but at the cost of handing out yet another tax break and of pledging to curb the expansion of supermarkets. The CGPME small business federation promised Mr Balladur at the weekend that its members would try to hire 200,000 more young people this autumn. The prime minister failed to get the Patronat employers' federation to commit itself to a similar target. In return, Mr Balladur raised the amount - from FFr15,000 (Pounds 1,790) to FFr20,000 - people can put into tax-free savings accounts for banks to lend to small businesses, and asked banks to lower the interest rate, from 8.75 per cent to 8.25 per cent, they charge on these loans. This would make an extra FFr10bn in subsidised loans available to small businesses, Mr Balladur said. The big commercial banks have said they will cut their base rate further on Thursday to 8.4 per cent. But small businesses generally have to pay much more, because banks consider them riskier customers. In another example of how recession is driving the conservative government into intervention as well as deficit, Mr Balladur said he intended to shorten the duration of credit which supermarkets could demand from their suppliers - thereby probably forcing them to raise their prices - and to make it harder for new supermarkets to open. One of Mr Balladur's first acts on taking power in April was to order a six-month freeze on the opening of new supermarkets. Small shopkeepers, who complain of unfair supermarket competition, are a core constituency of his RPR Gaullist party. However, in line with the EC Copenhagen summit's stress on the need to keep Europe's labour costs down, the government has said France's minimum wage will rise on July 1 by only half the average real increase in purchasing power. Meanwhile, the government faces a dilemma on privatisation, due to be debated in parliament last night. The finance committee has tabled an amendment restricting any special 'golden share' which the government takes to eight years. But the government has sought the right to retain 'golden shares' indefinitely.</p>

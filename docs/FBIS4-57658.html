			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de  las Casas, Chiapas, was interviewed this morning at the Mexico  City airport before traveling to Chiapas State. Elvia Moreno  filed this report:    [Moreno] Good afternoon. Signing a piece of paper does not  guarantee the fulfillment of peace and reconciliation accords in  Chiapas as long as there is not a process of change and public  action to change the attitude toward Indians and end  discrimination against Indians, Bishop Samuel Ruiz said.  Interviewed at the Mexico City International Airport, the  bishop said that after the peace accords are signed, all sectors  must be fully conscious of the new situation. This should be  reflected in a profound change in the relationship between  society, government, and the country's Indian peoples. Here is  some of what Bishop Ruiz said.    [Begin Ruiz recording] The situation has not changed much,  nor will it change by signing a piece of paper. Only joint  efforts that we must all undertake will generate change. We  must change our attitude toward Indians. We must end  discrimination against Indians, which occurs even here in the  capital, where we find Indians on the streets. No one knows why  they sell chewing gum on the streets [words indistinct] their  community.    We must all be fully aware of this situation so we can  change  this relationship in society. The proposals and the Indians'  answers will soon be discussed. [end recording]    [Moreno] The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas said,  however, that Indians have noted certain modifications that may  lead toward a different Mexico, even though it may not be  perfect. Bishop Samuel Ruiz said today's Mexico is not the same  as that of 31 December of last year, although it may not yet be  ideal. This is the end of my report. Good afternoon.    [Announcer] Upon arriving in Chiapas State, Bishop Samuel  Ruiz reported that the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]  had sent him a communique, which he hopes contains specific  answers from the EZLN on their determination to attain peace.  Maricarmen Camacho filed the following report.    [Camacho] Peace Mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he had been  notified that an EZLN communique had been sent to him. He  voiced his hope that this communique contains the EZLN's  response on a date for signing the peace agreement.    The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas made these comments  in his first news conference in Chiapas State since his visit to  Rome:    [Begin Ruiz recording] Yesterday, I was called and told the  EZLN had issued a communique. [Words indistinct] I will let you  know what it is all about once I find out. I imagine it deals  with the EZLN response to the government proposal. I imagine  this will be a counterproposal, not to oppose but to change some  points. [end recording]    [Camacho] Bishop Ruiz added that he will disclose the  contents of the EZLN communique this afternoon or tomorrow. He  also indicated that he will reveal the contents of a letter from  Pope John Paul II to the diocese, expressing the latter's views  on Bishop Ruiz's work as peace mediator in Chiapas.</p>

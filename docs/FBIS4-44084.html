			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] As you know, Jean-Luc Dehaene returned from Corfu  having failed in his bid to succeeded Jacques Delors as director  of the European Commission. One no vote threw everything in the  air again, the no vote having come from the very isolated  British. The dossier will doubtless be reopened 15 July at  another summit in Brussels. Meanwhile Jean-Luc Dehaene is not  withdrawing. We (?highlight) this comment: As a person, I have  no problem with John Major. I am not blind to his position in  Great Britain. I am even sorry for him. These are a few of the  things said by Jean-Luc Dehaene on television at lunchtime today  in Mises au Point. Anyway, as far as he is concerned all of  this is not good for Europe:    [Begin recording] [Dehaene] Europe has in fact been blocked  by Great Britain. That itself is not good for Europe. What is  worse is that Europe has in fact been blocked for British  domestic reasons, namely Major's weak position in the  Conservative Party. He is under pressure from the Eurosceptics.  There has been a press campaign against me which he apparently  cannot resist, so he chose to try to strengthen his domestic  position--and it is not clear that will be the right path in the  long run--rather than to play the European game and join the  consensus. So in relation to the Twelve, and in particular to  the Eleven who reached a consensus on my candidacy, this creates  a problem, because we are not going to put ourselves in a  situation where one says: no, and then all the others say: oh,  all right, we give in and we'll go and look for someone else.    I am not speaking of the parliament, because when I see some  of the initial reactions in the European Parliament, I say to  myself that the European Council must pay great attention to  what it does, because then there could be a return to form as  far as parliament is concerned.

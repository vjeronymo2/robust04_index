			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXODUS OF PALESTINIAN CHRISTIANS RAISES CONCERNS;  </P> <P> RELIGION: GROWING NUMBERS FLEE THE ARAB UPRISING AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.  CHURCHES AND TOWNS FEEL THE PINCH.  </P> <P> Deserted streets and shuttered shops have become as emblematic of Christmas in  Bethlehem as creches and holly, but for the Palestinian Christian community,  the lack of cheer extends beyond the surface sobriety of a holiday in turmoil.  </P> <P> As the Palestinian uprising against Israel wears on, the flight of Christians  from the occupied land is leading members of the dwindling minority to ponder  with alarm the possible extinction of traditional and revered communities.  </P> <P> Whole families are packing up to search for surer political and economic  surroundings in foreign lands. The best young minds are leaving to seek  education abroad because universities in the occupied West Bank, where 30,000  Christians live, have been closed by Israeli authorities for more than two  years.  </P> <P> The exodus raises visions of a vacant Christian landscape in places such as  Jerusalem, whose Arab neighborhoods were fully annexed by Israel in 1967, and  in and around Bethlehem, on the West Bank. Churches and shrines become mere  museums of a dead past, peopled only by priests, monks and nuns without a flock  to watch over.  </P> <P> "The question is: Do we want a church of stone blocks or a church of people?"  asked Geries Khoury, a Palestinian theologian and director of the Al Liqa  Center, a religious institute on the outskirts of Bethlehem. "I think that if  such a situation persists, only stones will mark the holy sites of  Christianity."  </P> <P> "There has long been emigration, but it could be a danger if it goes on in this  rhythm," said Michel Sabah, the Roman Catholic bishop of Jerusalem.  </P> <P> It is hard to obtain precise data on the exodus of Christians from among the  1.7 million population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. About 3,000 Christian  Arabs live in Gaza.  </P> <P> Some churches keep tabs on their members, others do not. There were 27,000  Christians in Jerusalem in 1948; today, there are 12,000. Bethlehem, with a  population of 30,000, was once 80% Christian; now Christians make up less than  half of the population.  </P> <P> About 80,000 Christians live in Israel and are Israeli citizens and thus have  political rights denied Palestinians in the occupied land. Most Arab Christians  belong to ancient churches, including the Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Roman  Catholic and Syrian Catholic churches.  </P> <P> Many Palestinian Christians argue that their only chance to secure a vital  community is through the Arab revolt and its promise of an independent state.  But even that hope is clouded. Strains of Islamic fundamentalism that are  intolerant of Christian customs have become prominent and are frightening the  already beleaguered minority.  </P> <P> Still, the Christians tend to throw in their lot with the intifada, as the  uprising is called.  </P> <P> "We prefer the Palestinian state with its risks and advantages. And as  Christians, we would prefer a liberal Palestinian state," commented Peter  Madros, a Roman Catholic priest in Beit Sahur, believed to be the site of the  field where angels announced the birth of Christ to shepherds.  </P> <P> Palestinian experts point out that a decline in the Christian population in the  Holy Land has gone on steadily since the end of the 19th Century, when the  region was under Ottoman Turk rule. Hardship and hunger brought on by land  confiscations forced many Palestinians to seek a new life abroad, notably in  Latin America and Australia. In Honduras, the descendants of Palestinian  immigrants are called Turcos because their forebears originally came carrying  Turkish passports.  </P> <P> The success of Palestinians in setting up themselves abroad was a magnet for  those who stayed behind. Sometimes success was measured modestly. While doing  research into the Palestinian diaspora, theologian Khoury came across a letter  from his grandfather, who wrote about the abundance of bread in Argentina as an  enticement for others to come.  </P> <P> Israel's 1948 war of independence drove hundreds of thousands of Palestinians  into exile, including tens of thousands of Christians. Some Christians became  active in the Palestine Liberation Organization, among them George Habash, who  heads the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist PLO faction.  </P> <P> The 1967 Six-Day War, which resulted in Israel's occupation of the West Bank  and Gaza Strip, created a new sense of despair among Palestinian Christians.  Land confiscations and Israeli settlements ate away at farming and business.  Military rule meant a tangle of rules designed to keep the Palestinians under  control. Travel, construction and business permits were bound up in a  bureaucratic tangle.  </P> <P> "Many Palestinians thought that 1967 was the end," Khoury said.  </P> <P> The intifada, while instilling a degree of nationalist pride, brought further  practical hardships. Because the community values education, the closing of  schools by the  </P> <P> Israeli authorities has hit hard.  </P> <P> "There is a real brain drain among the Palestinian Christians," said James  Fleming, who heads the Biblical Resources Study Center near Bethlehem.  </P> <P> The economies of towns such as Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahur and Ramallah,  which have important Christian enclaves, have suffered a sharp decline. Tourist  traffic is off by 80%; hotels and shops that sell traditional olive-wood manger  scenes are empty. Commerce from Israeli day visitors, who used to buy groceries  and frequent Arab restaurants, has all but ended.  </P> <P> The frequent commercial strikes called by the leadership of the uprising has  cut into sales to the Palestinian public.  </P> <P> Beit Sahur made news in the fall when its residents resisted efforts by the  military government to collect taxes. In doing so, however, scores of families  lost their possessions.  </P> <P> "We are hanging on by very little," said Yaacov, a carpenter in Bethlehem who  asked that only his first name be used. "We want to live here. It is our home.  But the young people have no future."  </P> <P> Yaacov has sent one college-age son to Germany to study and hopes to send  another one. However, because he refused to pay taxes, he fears that the  military government will not give his second son clearance to travel abroad.  </P> <P> Khaled, a partner in a video cassette rental store in Ramallah who declined to  give his family name, said he plans to leave for Australia early next year to  join a brother who emigrated a decade ago. He has sold his furniture, car and  share in a family olive grove.  </P> <P> "We Palestinians have always had to look for a better life elsewhere," said  Khaled, a father of four. "I'm not sure that even a state would make things  easy for us. Tiny groups do not do well in the Middle East."  </P> <P> Hints of the vulnerability of the Christians in the vast Islamic community  surfaced in instances of harassment by Muslim fundamentalist groups. Women have  been told to cover their heads and arms in the Muslim fashion, and some liquor  vendors were ordered to close down.  </P> <P> "Christians wonder what they are going to do here if Islamic forces continue to  gain power," Khoury said.  </P> <P> Christian leaders say that for political and theological reasons, it is  important for Christians to keep a toehold in not just historic Palestine but  the Middle East as a whole.  </P> <P> Some believe that Christians can serve as a link between the Western and Arab  worlds because of their ties to both.  </P> <P> "Christians have many cultural ties to the Arab world and Islam. It is good for  us to be here to be a bridge," said Khoury, whose Al Liqa Center hosts frequent  Muslim-Christian dialogues.  </P> <P> Theologically, the presence of Christians fits with the faith's ideal of  "bearing witness."  </P> <P> "It would be ironic for a living Christian community to disappear from the land  of His (Christ's) ministry," said Naem Ateek, a Palestinian theologian in  Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Many Palestinians resent the activities of fundamentalist Christian sects from  the West that ignore the plight of the Palestinians and unswervingly support  Israel's policies. The support of the fundamentalists is based on beliefs that  the creation of the Jewish state fulfills biblical prophecy.  </P> <P> Some Palestinian theologians have responded to the intifada by trying to  advocate Christian-based nonviolence and to teach a brand of "liberation  theology" in some ways similar to the teachings popular in churches in Latin  America.  </P> <P> However, they ran into an immediate roadblock in the Old Testament passages  that tell of the Jewish flight from Egypt and conquest of the land of Canaan.  In Latin America, theologians base their "liberation theology" on the Exodus  story and its account of the struggle against oppression. But the Palestinians  do not find the account liberating: The stories are frequently used by Jewish  fundamentalists and right-wing Israeli politicians to justify an exclusive  claim to the land.  </P> <P> The counter-theory in vogue among Palestinian theologians is one that depicts a  universal God of justice rather than a tribal and exclusive God. Such a theory  accepts the existence of a Jewish state, but with the Palestinian state  recognized as an equal right for Arabs, exponents say.  </P></p>

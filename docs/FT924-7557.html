			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: Packaging unites business and environment Sir, It is not true that there is an 'irreconcilable difference' between industry and environmentalists over packaging. It is also wrong to say that companies 'want to sell more packaging' (Environmental Management survey, November 10). Packaging is, surprisingly, an area which unites industry and environmentalists. Companies want lighter packaging, because it reduces their costs; and they are happy to use the recycled materials. Today, even plastic egg box covers are made from old cola bottles. Companies know that the consumer is suspicious of unnecessary packaging, and this gives them another incentive to avoid waste. Hence, technology is helping companies to reduce costs and improve the environment. Many problems still exist; but who would have thought that packaging could give business and environmentalists something to agree about?

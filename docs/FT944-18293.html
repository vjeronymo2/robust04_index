			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Japan Development Bank launches Dollars 500m deal A small number of eurobond issues was launched into difficult market conditions yesterday, with sharp falls in US and European government bond prices. Attention today turns to the World Bank's DM2bn global offering of five-year fixed-rate bonds, which will be launched today and priced tomorrow, said joint lead manager Morgan Stanley. In the US dollar sector, the Japan Development Bank launched Dollars 500m of five-year bonds, priced to yield 22 basis points over US Treasuries. Demand for the offering came from institutional investors in Japan and continental Europe, who were attracted by the relatively wide spread and high coupon, said joint lead manager IBJ. The proceeds were swapped into yen. One syndicate manager described the pricing and size of the deal as 'generally well-conceived', although another said it seemed to have received a mixed response. A syndicate official at IBJ said: 'The only problem has been the weakness in the US Treasury market. Some investors are postponing their purchases until they reach the point where they feel that the market has gone too low.' The Kingdom of Sweden launched a Dollars 300m issue of fixed-rate two-year bonds, priced to yield 15 basis points over US Treasuries. Joint lead manager Morgan Stanley said the deal met good demand, mostly in the European retail sector. The funds are believed to have been swapped into floating-rate dollars. One syndicate manager said he thought the deal was priced tightly, but added: 'It was an opportunity that Morgan Stanley saw on the day and pounced on.' The Council of Europe Resettlement Fund launched its first sterling deal since 1984, Pounds 100m of two-year fixed-rate bonds priced to yield 17 basis points over gilts. The issue, which found demand among financial institutions in the UK and retail investors in Luxembourg and Switzerland, offered a wide yield spread against other European markets, said lead manager SG Warburg.</p>

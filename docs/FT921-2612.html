			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals hold back Refuge CONCENTRATION ON its core life insurance activities helped Refuge Group report pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.6m for 1991. The outcome compared with restated profits of Pounds 13.8m last time, but was struck after exceptional provisions of Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 705,000) for bad and doubtful debts in the personal finance subsidiary. Life net premium income expanded 13 per cent to Pounds 213m over the year as the division's attributable profits rose from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 15m. In contrast, general insurance succumbed to the depressed sector trend and incurred increased losses of Pounds 708,000 (Pounds 469,000). Most premium rates have been increased in recent months. Losses in the Douglas Allen Spiro estate agency side amounted to Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 1.33m), but Mr Tom Booth, chairman, said there were signs that the housing market was beginning to show improvement. Earnings per share were virtually unchanged at 25.81p (25.6p). A proposed final dividend of 20p brings the total for 1991 to 29p (26.75p).</p>

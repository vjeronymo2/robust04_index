An SADF statement quoted Mr  Mandela as telling the council on February 23 that the country's  socio-economic backlog and the inability of any government to  fulfil expectations meant it was probable that a measure of  instability would persist for a number of years.    Mr Mandela expressed his appreciation of the valuable work  performed by the SADF in the interests of peace, the statement  said. He pronounced his satisfaction with the growing  credibility and acceptability of the SADF in black townships, it  added.    The statement quoted Mr Mandela as saying the ANC shared the  vision of an apolitical, professional and effective defence  force acceptable to and representative of the people of South  Africa. The national defence force should not be loyal to any  political party, including the ANC, but to the state and the  people of South Africa.    Mr Mandela said the ANC was sensitive to the position of the  commandos and would not like anything done that might alienate  them, according to the SADF statement.</p>

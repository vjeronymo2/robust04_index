			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- A government panel issued a  report Friday [27 May] suggesting that planned deregulation on  Japan's telecommunications industry should be designed to  nurture sound competition.    The report was submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata at a  meeting of the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters  headed by the premier.    The administrative reform task force has been studying  deregulations in wide areas of industry to give foreign firms  greater access to Japanese markets, and consequently to help  reduce Japan's massive trade surpluses.    The report reviewed current regulations in the  telecommunications and broadcasting fields, and said  deregulation should be designed to create advanced systems for  the 21st century like the "information superhighway" plan by the  United States.    It particularly stressed the necessity of removing barriers  between domestic and international telecommunications businesses.    Regional telecommunications service operators should be  encouraged to participate in the field of long-distance  services, which would increase sound competition, it said.    The report's recommendations will be included in a larger  deregulation plan to be compiled by the end of June.    Sources at the panel said Hata voiced eagerness to carry out  the deregulation plan, saying the telecommunications and  information areas are vital for the world moving to a new  century, and also important for Japan itself to create new  businesses.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also participated at the  panel  meeting and said Japan should take part in the worldwide race of  building new telecommunications and broadcasting systems.    Cable News Network of the U.S. and the British Broadcasting  Corp. are strengthening their footholds in Asia and Japan should  join them, he said.</p>

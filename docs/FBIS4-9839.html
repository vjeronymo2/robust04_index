			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 3 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Guatemalan  President Ramiro De Leon Carpio announced he might declare a  state of emergency as result of the murder of Constitutionality  Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez in the next few days. De  Leon made the announcement during the funeral services of one of  the country's most distinguished legal experts. The murder,  which was carried out early yesterday by unknown gunmen, has  been condemned by all sectors of the country. The president  acknowledged that he has considered the possibility of declaring  a state of emergency but that the measure will have to be  approved this week by the State Council of Ministers.    On Friday, Government Minister Danilo Parinello announced  that a possible state of emergency declaration is being reviewed  as result of numerous crimes, attacks, and disturbances taking  place throughout the country and threatening to become a  national catastrophe. Last week, journalist Marco Tulio de la  Roca was shot and, as result, lost his left eye. In addition,  Francisco Elias, the cousin of former President Jorge Elias  Serrano, was also shot and remains in serious conditions at a  private hospital. There was also the recent murder of a  so-called "street child" and a mob attacked an American citizen  in the northern community of San Cristobal Verapaz, after being  accused of attempting to abduct a small boy. Another American  tourist was fired on for no apparent reason by a group of  unknown individuals on a Guatemala City street.    Gonzalez's murder has disturbed the country's judicial,  union, government, church, and diplomatic communities, which  believe the murder will become just another of the countless  crimes that go unpunished in this Central American nation.    Yesterday, De Leon announced he had ordered an in-depth  investigation to locate the murderers of the Constitutionality  Court magistrate, whom he described as an "outstanding citizen,  prestigious jurist, and an authentic advocate of democracy and  peace in Guatemala." This past July, however, when the  president's cousin Jorge Carpio Nicolle, editor of EL GRAFICO  newspaper and secretary general of the Union of the National  Center party [UCN], was murdered, De Leon appointed a special  commission to investigate the crime, which to date has failed to  accomplish anything. The Catholic Church and Carpio Nicolle's  relatives, who were present when the journalist was murdered  along with three other people, insist that the murder was  carried out by the paramilitary Civilian Sel-Defense Patrols  (PAC), but the authorities have dismissed these claims.    The archbishop of Guatemala and the human rights ombudsman  have said it is De Leon's moral duty to solve the Gonzalez  murder, which occurred just 10 days before Gonzalez was to  conclude his term as Constitutional Court president. He was  killed four days after the court had ruled that  Congress-approved reforms to the Electoral and Political Parties  Law were unconstitutional. Gonzalez had argued that the deputies  not only modified the law but, in fact, created a new law. He  ruled that this was illegal because the Electoral and Political  Parties Law can only be repealed by a national constituent  assembly.    The reforms are aimed at increasing the number of  congressional deputies as well as establishing that any party  that does not field candidates in an election for deputies  should be taken off the official political parties list.  Moreover, the congressional deputies affected by the new law  rejected the independence of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and  opened the way for civic committees to participate in the  election process.    The new election law also required the resignation of all  political party members holding government positions and whose  leader occupied the Presidency [alta magistratura], and also  changed name of the new law to the "Election and People's  Organization Law [Ley Electoral y de Organizationces Populares]."    Gonzalez presided over the Constitutionality Court when it  ruled against the 25 May 1993 "self-inflicted coup" carried out  by then-President Jorge Serrano. The court's decision proved  decisive in reestablishing constitutional order in Guatemala.</p>

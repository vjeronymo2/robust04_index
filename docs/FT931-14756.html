			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Ike's favourite soon to join the fray: The Jeep's entry into the four-wheel-drive leisure market CHRYSLER Corporation yesterday returned to the UK vehicle market for the first time since selling its British manufacturing assets to Peugeot of France in the late 1970s. Initially it is battling for sales in one of the few sectors to have grown during the recession - the off-road four-wheel-drive market. Such vehicles have become fashionable among city dwellers who may never do any off-road driving. Chrysler's offering is the Jeep, possibly the world's best known name in four-wheel-drive. The first military versions, along with landing craft and the Douglas Dakota aircraft, were credited by President Dwight D. Eisenhower  -nicknamed Ike - with winning the second world war. The Cherokee, the Jeep model which most closely rivals Rover's successful Land Rover Discovery and Range Rover models, and the Wrangler, a much revised version of the machine for which President Eisenhower had such affection, are to tackle a UK four-wheel-drive leisure sector where sales were estimated at more than 40,000 last year. A measure of the seriousness with which Chrysler is taking the UK market is that the Cherokee has been re-engineered as a right-hand-drive model. The company says it is the first volume production model built with right-hand-drive for export to the UK by a north American manufacturer. According to Land Rover, UK sales of larger vehicles in the category - typified by the Discovery and Range Rover and imports such as Toyota's Land Cruiser and the Mitsubishi Shogun - reached 27,960 in the first 11 months of last year. That was a 38.4 per cent jump on the 20,207 during the same period in 1991. The market is due to become more crowded later this year when Ford and Nissan launch their respective badged versions of a vehicle similar in size to the Discovery. This model will be produced at Nissan's Motor Iberica plant in Spain, and will be sold in Europe under both Nissan and Ford names. The vehicle, code-named ET by Nissan which has yet to give it a brand name, are to be built at a rate of 50,000 a year. Both parties are cautious about predicting market prospects in the UK. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said the company had set no firm sales targets for the vehicle. 'We will have to see how sales develop after it is launched in late spring,' he said. Sales of the smaller, cheaper four-wheel-drive leisure vehicles such as Vauxhall's Frontera Sport, which are becoming fashionable among younger drivers as an alternative to sports cars, also rose sharply in the first 11 months of last year. They increased by just under 20 per cent to 9,698 from 8,112. For Vauxhall the target is to topple Suzuki's Vitara, which accounted for 5,800 of these sales. The Jeeps will be sold through an initial network of 80 dealers. Mr Richard Mackay, managing director of Chrysler Jeep Imports UK, expects this network to grow steadily as Chrysler's market presence becomes established. His company is based in Dover and was set up by TKM, the multi-franchise vehicle distributor and retailer. With Wrangler prices starting at less than Pounds 13,000 and the Cherokee at Pounds 15,345, initial sales of at least 2,000 a year are expected. Mr Mackay, rival importers and Land Rover executives all believe that there remains a great deal of growth in the leisure four-wheel-drive sector, which has quadrupled in the UK in less than a decade. The sector, once dominated by utilitarian vehicles such as the Land Rover, has grown largely as a result of Japanese importers. They have broadened the market with a variety of vehicles of all sizes, and with those such as the cheapest Suzuki models costing little more than a small hatchback. Mr John Norman, Suzuki GB's managing director, believes the marketing to young buyers of the SJ model as a leisure vehicle was a crucial factor in changing British attitudes towards such vehicles. The SJ was depicted in one advertising campaign as a 'wild weekender'. Rover Group's Land Rover subsidiary has been the prime beneficiary of the trend. With its Range Rover model having secured a similar 'lifestyle' niche at the top end of the market, the company's launch of its similar-sized but cheaper Discovery model in 1989 has proved more successful than even it had hoped. Discoveries have replaced more traditional estate cars across large swathes of suburbia, and the model is the undisputed UK market leader with nearly 10,000 sales last year. Chrysler's market research indicates there are some 4.5m people aged 24 to 40 with 'active' lifestyles who are potentially receptive to the Pounds 3m advertising campaign it is about to launch.

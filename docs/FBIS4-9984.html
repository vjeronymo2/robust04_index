			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Osvaldo Vega from La Moneda Palace] </F>   [Text] Today President Eduardo Frei personally told  Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange that he needs to  retire from the institution.    This information was released through an official communique  by Minister Secretary General of Government Victor Manuel  Rebolledo this afternoon, after General Stange said at noon  today after meeting with President Frei that he would not retire.    Minister Rebolledo said that according to the government the  decision of Judge Juica, who proposes the opening of criminal  proceedings against Carabineros Generals Cesar Mendoza Duran,  Rodolfo Stange, and other officers for serious violations of  military duties, puts the Carabineros in a worrisome situation,  as it obstructs the effective and adequate fulfillment of their  functions. Rebolledo added:    [Begin Rebolledo recording] Based on this situation, and  with  the purpose of guaranteeing above any other consideration the  solidity and good operation of the Carabineros for fulfilling  its duties, his excellency the president of the Republic  conveyed to the Carabineros director general the need for him to  retire, as a patriotic gesture in favor of the institution and  the country. Unfortunately, Gen. Stange did not respond in a  positive manner to the president's request. The president of  the Republic, acting on behalf of the high interests of the  country and of the Carabineros, trusts that Gen. Stange will  reconsider his position, and if he does not the president will  proceed to summon the National Security Council at the  appropriate time. [end recording]    Minister Rebolledo did not answer questions from reporters  on  the government's deadline for Gen. Stange to reconsider his  position, or when the National Security Council would be  summoned by the president in case of a negative answer from Gen.  Stange. President Frei will preside over the council, which is  also made up of the Senate president, the comptroller general,  the commanders of the Armed Forces, and the Carabineros director  general, all of whom have the right to vote. The other  officials who can attend the National Security Council meeting,  but without the right to vote, are some ministers.</p>

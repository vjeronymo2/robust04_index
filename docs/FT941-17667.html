			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Uncertain trend as trading volume dies away - Market Report New Year's Eve brought a volatile half-session in the UK stock market with the futures market again showing its power by pulling share prices down from a firm opening. Trading volume was thin, however, and little significance could be ascribed to price trends. The market gained more than 16 Footsie points in early trading, backed by a buy programme from one of the UK securities houses. But the day's peak of 3,445.3 was 35 point short of the year's intra day trading high reached on Thursday and equities turned back sharply when the premium on the Footsie March futures contract crumbled. The final reading, taken at 12.30pm, showed the FT-SE Index at 3,418.4, down 10.4. The year's closing high of 3,462 was recorded on Wednesday. Over the year, the Footsie has risen by 20 per cent, or 571.9 points, driven by falling interest rates and growing confidence in economic recovery. Yesterday was also the end of the three week extended Christmas account in the UK equity market, which has brought a gain of 157.1, or 4.8 per cent on the Footsie. The Christmas account reflected a strong advance in share prices after the November Budget proved much less threatening that some market pundits had feared. It was this renewed surge in equities that caught out at least one leading UK institution which has been forced to cover itself in the futures market this month, thereby driving prices ahead even more strongly. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index remained firm yesterday, edging ahead by 4.7 to 3,791.3, about 15 points under the year's high. Seaq volume, at 277.5m shares, was unexciting, even for a half session. It compared with 554.1m shares on Thursday when retail, or customer business remained high to return a value of Pounds 1.30bn. High retail business has been the most significant feature of this year's bull run in UK equities. Daily value of customer activity has been well above the Pounds 1bn mark throughout the period, ensuring profitability at London based securities firms which have been able to pay good salary bonuses to their employees who had suffered in the reduced business levels of past years. The banking sector continued to outperform yesterday as investors recognised the benefits for future dividends of the decrease in bad debts which has been prompted by falling interest rates and signs of recovery in the UK housing market. Merchant banks, however, which have been strong beneficiaries of the strength of the world securities markets, had a calm session. Store shares, still looking for reliable statistics on the Christmas selling season, did little more than hold steady. Breweries and food retailers again suffered from concern over the outlook for price margins and few other consumer stocks made much showing. Other interest rate-orientated issues, such as building and construction stocks, continued to move forward, however. Market strategists expressed further optimism for 1994. Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura, having seen the Footsie come within 20 points of his year-end forecast of 3,500, predicted 'excellent conditions for financial assets' in the year ahead, commenting that the UK economy will see growth with very low inflation and thus interest rates. He is predicting a Footsie at 3,700 by the end of January and at 4,000 by the end of 1994.</p>

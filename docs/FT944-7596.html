			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / BAe to shed 750 Airbus workers British Aerospace is to shed 750 jobs next year at its Airbus plants at Filton, Bristol, and Broughton, near Chester. Most of the losses will be at Filton, where 550 jobs will go with the completion of a contract for the conversion of VC10 aircraft into RAF refuelling tanker aircraft. BAe said the majority of jobs would be lost in the first quarter of 1995, and would affect all categories of staff. It hoped all redundancies would be voluntary. The Airbus division employs 6,500 at the two plants and BAe has reduced the workforce by 900 this year. In September, Raytheon, the US company which bought the BAe executive jet division, announced it would close by 1997 an adjacent factory in Broughton with the loss of 550 jobs. Mr Chris Geoghegan, BAe Airbus managing director, said the reduction in defence spending and pressure on civil programmes emphasised the importance of the proposed European Future Large Aircraft. He urged the government to consider it seriously rather than rushing to buy the Hercules C130J from Lockheed as the RAF's transport aircraft Nuclear Electric yesterday said 80 jobs were to be shed at Sizewell A power station in Suffolk. The first 50 jobs will go over the next year. Staff are being asked to take voluntary redundancy. Yorkshire cuts jobs, Page 27</p>

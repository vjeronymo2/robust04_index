			<p>BFN     [Text] A second Pakistani wanted by police for questioning  in connection with the suspected plot to harm the Nepalese Crown  Prince has offered to turn himself in, a Special Branch police  source said yesterday.    The source said the fugitive, identified as Mohamad Javet,  had telephoned the Special Branch to say he was ready to  surrender.    The source said Mr Javet insisted he was innocent of any  involvement in a plot against Crown Prince Dipendra bir Bikram  Shah Dev.    The Nepalese Embassy in Bangkok also issued a statement last  night saying the arrest of the other suspect, Shakil Ammad, had  no link whatsoever with the Nepalese Crown Prince or his visit  to AIT [Asian Institute of Technology]. It said the news item  was "misleading".    The 22-year-old Crown Prince arrived in Thailand on Sunday  to  attend a four-day geography course at the Asian Institute of  Technology before beginning an official visit from June 24-27.    Mr Ammad, who is currently being held in police custody,  claimed he knew Mr Javet for only one day, said the police  source.    He said Mr Ammad claimed he wanted to study at the AIT and  his entry to the campus was aided by Mr Javet.    Special Branch commissioner Narongwit Thaithong said  yesterday he had contacted the Pakistani and Nepalese embassies  in Bangkok to check the background of Mr Ammad.    He said the minister counsellor at the Nepalese Embassy, Mr  Pushkaraj Bhandari, met him yesterday and was present during the  questioning of Mr Ammad. The minister counsellor also pledged  support for the police investigation, he said.    The vice consul of the Pakistani Embassy, Riez Seqi, was  also  present during the questioning.    Pol Lt-Gen Narongwit said an initial report yet to be  verified stated Mr Ammad's elder brother was a former student at  AIT and is now working as an engineer in Pakistan.</p>

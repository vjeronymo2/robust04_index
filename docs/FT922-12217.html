			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Havel goes to Asia in search of markets MR Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, will underline Czechoslovakia's search for wider markets and new sources of investment capital during a week-long visit to Japan and South Korea which begins in Tokyo today. Over the last year Germany has emerged as the biggest foreign investor in Czechoslovakia, accounting for a third of the more than 3,000 foreign joint ventures and well over half of the nearly Dollars 1bn (Pounds 565m) foreign equity investment in the country since the communist regime was ousted in November 1989. The more westerly Czech lands have also received substantial investment from other European and US companies, including BSN and Air France, Nestle of Switzerland, the UK-Dutch Unilever, ICI of the UK, and US multinationals such as Procter and Gamble, Boeing and Dow Chemical. Japanese investors, however, have remained cautious. The biggest investment so far has been an indirect one by Asahi Glass, which holds a controlling stake in Glaverbell, the Belgian-based glass company which last year finalised a 'strategic alliance' with Sklo Union, the country's biggest glass maker. This is the biggest of only 10 projects involving Japanese companies in Czechoslovakia to date. Last year, however, Japan provided a Dollars 200m long-term credit, while the Czechoslovak federal parliament last week cancelled the communist-era trade agreement, which was signed in 1959 and was based on rigid inter-state protocols no longer relevant to an economy in the throes of rapid privatisation. After meeting Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, and Emperor Akihito, the Czechoslovak president is expected to sign a new agreement aimed at boosting trade. Czechoslovakia last year exported goods worth only Dollars 71m to Japan, mainly hops and glass, and imported electronic consumer goods, cars and industrial products worth Dollars 124m. On his way back, Mr Havel will visit South Korea for similar trade and investment talks with the South Korean government, with whom diplomatic relations were established only two years ago. Czechoslovakia last year exported goods worth Dollars 8.6m to South Korea.</p>

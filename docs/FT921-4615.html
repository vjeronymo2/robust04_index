			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Electricity users attack Wakeham over price rises SEVERAL leading industrial users of electricity have accused Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, of allowing Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear generator, to force up prices. Their attack on the new electricity market will deepen the row about electricity prices and cause embarrassment for Mr Wakeham in the approach to the general election. The electricity users, including Blue Circle, GKN and other large companies, say they face increases in their electricity bills of between 15 per cent and 30 per cent because Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear stations of England and Wales, sets the electricity price even though its share of the overall supply market is only about 20 per cent. One electricity buyer said: 'We have been throwing our hands up in horror. It is extraordinary that Nuclear Electric should be allowed to set the price.' National Power and PowerGen, the two privatised electricity generators which have a combined market share of about 70 per cent, signed contracts at privatisation which oblige them to sell two thirds of their power to domestic consumers. That leaves Nuclear Electric dominating the industrial market. The row about Nuclear Electric's role deepened last week when Mr Wakeham failed to persuade the company to offer large consumers more electricity at lower prices. Nuclear Electric trimmed prices slightly, offering contracts at 2.425p a unit of electricity plus inflation - which brings the price to between 2.5p and 2.6p - compared with the 2.62p it offered at the end of last year. 'That is still a huge jump,' said Mr John Topliss, chairman of the electricity group of the Major Energy Users Council, which represents large energy consumers. He pointed out that the price in the pool, or wholesale, electricity market for the past year has averaged only about 2.2p. Mr Topliss said: 'You are talking about an increase of close to 20 per cent, which is not justified by any rise in underlying fuel prices. Nuclear Electric are second-guessing National Power and PowerGen, who have been talking up the price.' Mr Ian Blakey, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Association, which represents many steel companies, said his members expected increases of between 15 per cent and 16 per cent. He explained that, although basic energy prices were rising by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, the total electricity bill included other charges which would rise by less. There is little Mr Wakeham can do without being seen to interfere in the free electricity market. One council member said: 'We think he is very anxious to meet our concerns, but he hasn't any idea how.'</p>

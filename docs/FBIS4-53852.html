			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Yoichi Takita: "Markets Test </F> Coordinated Actions of Japan, United States, and Europe--Loss of  Confidence in Dollar Leads to Turbulence"]    [Text] Domestic and international financial and foreign  exchange markets have entered a turbulent phase in conjunction  with the ending of low interest rates in the United States. The  declining dollar accompanied by rising U.S. interest rates is  forcing payment of the piper for high valuations of financial  instruments that were previously supported by a surfeit of U.S.  investment funds. Financial authorities in Japan, the United  States, and Europe have bolstered their coordination of policy  actions, are desperately attempting to mollify market  instability, and are now engaged in the hazardous venture of  determining whether they can restrain the disruptive actions of  the huge money supply created by low-interest policies.  <H5>  Focus on Rise in U.S. Interest Rates </H5>   Bidding for 10-year U.S. notes issued by the U.S. Treasury  on  the 11th did not go well and securities dealers complained, "No  one is placing orders to buy." Domestic and international  investors disregarded the offerings even though the groundwork  had been laid beforehand through actions such as coordinated  market intervention by Japan, the United States, and Europe in  the purchase of dollars and intensified coordinated actions in  the area of interest policy.    Financial market sources are showing nervousness ahead of  the  Federal Open Market Committee meeting of 17 May, asking, "When  is the Federal Reserve Board [FRB] going to raise the federal  discount rate?"    The prevailing view is that the U.S. consumer price index  will rise no more than 3 percent in both 1994 and 1995. Even  Merrill Lynch economist Mr. Steinberg estimates that "the U.S.  economy is undergoing steady noninflationary growth."    Nevertheless, U.S. long-term interest rates have risen 1  percent since the beginning of the year and the rise in interest  rates continues unabated along with tightening measures taken by  the FRB. Chairperson Laura Tyson of the U.S. presidential  Council of Economic Advisers seems to be saying that the markets  are responding erroneously, as she says, "The financial markets  are reacting excessively to inflationary ghosts."    Hirohiko Okumura, Nomura Research Center research director,  takes the view that "the U.S. financial authorities themselves  are responsible for triggering the market turbulence." The FRB's  ultra-low-interest-rate policies of keeping real interest rates  near zero percent for the last two years created the bubble in  financial assets. Invest trusts recruited funds from ordinary  households and went on a buying spree for domestic and  international bonds and stock.    Taking the road to full-scale recovery for the U.S. economy  brought an end to low interest rates. The rise in interest rates  triggered a withdrawal from investment trusts, and in March  caused a net withdrawal of $7.7 billion from bond investment  trusts and a drop of one-half in the flow of funds into stock  investment trusts to a level of $6.7 billion compared to the  preceding month.  <H5>  Dollar Being Sold Despite Recovery in Economy </H5>   Financial and stock markets in Asia, Central and South  America, and Europe dropped substantially as the flow of funds  from the United States slowed. The international capital flow  which had been sustained by the excess money supply in the  United States underwent a sudden, simultaneous shut off.    When the tempo of the U.S. economic recovery accelerates and  interest levels rise, it should trigger dollar-buying, but the  markets have begun to contrarily interpret such trends as reason  to sell the dollar.    It seems that the thinking affecting the markets includes  the  idea that "expansion of domestic demand equals a rise in imports  equals an expansion of international balance-of-payments  deficits equals a decline of the dollar" or "expansion of  domestic demand equals tightening of the labor supply and demand  ratio equals a rise in the inflation rate equals a rise in  long-term interest rates and a drop in the value of dollar."  According to Japanese economists who visited the United States  recently, U.S. business attitudes which promptly look for price  hikes whenever demand rises remain unchanged as consumers  undergo a waiting period before delivery of new vehicles and  hikes in selling prices become widespread.    The tolerance of a strong yen by U.S. monetary authorities  as  a way to correct imbalances between Japan and the United States  has now boomeranged on the United States in the form of a  decline in confidence in the dollar. Japanese institutional  investors such as life insurance companies are hesitant about  buying U.S. bonds. It could be said that the only money now  being made available to compensate for the recurring U.S.  deficit is that flowing into the United States through the  coordinated buying of the dollar by overseas central banks.  <H5>  Key To Restraining Inflation </H5>   Although Japan and Europe have beefed up coordinated actions  to stabilize the dollar from the interest rate aspect by  assuming financial easing policies, they have failed to  eliminate the market psychology of a cheaper dollar.    Japan Industrial Bank's International Financial Research  Department's Deputy Chief of Research Yasunori Nagai comments,  "The recent drop in the dollar is a major U.S. issue wherein  they've been forced to pay the piper because of ultra-easing  financial policies." The key to recovery of confidence in the  dollar rests with U.S. policy to restrain inflation, but the  Clinton administration has chosen CEA member Alan S. Blinder, a  growth advocate, to replace FRB Vice Chairman David Mullins, who  was an advocate of stable prices.    The markets' interpretation of the U.S. Government as  stressing growth and neglecting restraint of inflation is  undermining moves towards financial tightening. The U.S.  Government has treated the low long-term interest rates as  evidence of confidence in its economic policies, but long-term  interest rates have risen to about 7.5 percent, the highest  level since the current administration took office. Turbulence  in the markets is a reflection of the fragility of the  strategies being used to provide a soft landing for a U.S.  economy moving towards being overheated and of the precarious  nature of the reliance being placed on U.S. economic expansion  to improve the global economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shi Qingbin (2457 3237 1755)] </F>   [Text] Quanzhou, 11 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the  implementation of the new taxation system this year, various  kinds of taxes collected by Quanzhou City have grown steadily.  In the first two months alone, various kinds of taxes collected  by the city reached 300 million yuan, 26.8 percent up on the  same period last year.    This year is the first year in which China has implemented  its new taxation system. It is known that in implementing the  new taxation system, the Quanzhou City government has  extensively publicized the new tax laws to increase  understanding of them among people in various circles. At the  same time, taxation departments at all levels have also  energetically conducted special inspection, especially  inspections of some major taxpayers whose tax payments are in  arrears, and they have fixed time limits for tax payments. As a  result, the new taxation system has been operating quite  effectively.    At the same time, taxation departments have seriously done a  good job in guiding taxpayers to calculate and pay value-added  tax and other taxes. They have also taken special measures  toward supply and marketing enterprises, materials enterprises,  and commercial enterprises to guard against fraud.    Moreover, taxation departments have concentrated their  efforts on the collection and management of various kinds of  local taxes to prevent tax losses.</p>

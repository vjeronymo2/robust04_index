			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Upwardly mobile Cellular phones may not have reached the sans culottes yet, but One-2-One looks like a natural for Essex man. Whatever Mercury's protestations that the service is aimed at BT's mass market, the natural locus of users is the small business or sole trader and higher-end domestic customer who would value mobility. The clear publicity coup of free local calls in off-peak periods will grab headlines and doubtless fire the aspirant imagination. It may also ease the pain of forking out around Pounds 300 for a handset, though even that may not be much of a barrier, given the large sums spent on other domestic gizmos. While the target group and pricing will help expand the telecoms market, One-2-One will hurt other operators. Despite the smoke thrown up by Vodafone and Cellnet to confuse price perceptions, existing cellular tariffs will be increasingly seen as excessive. The best tactic may be to cede market share to the new entrant as long as the loss of customers is not too great. Yet lower margins will come. What is less certain is whether Vodafone or Cellnet can expand their markets rapidly enough to compensate for the fall. If they cannot, current valuations look high, whatever AT&amp;T may have paid for McCaw. BT cannot entirely ignore the threat either. The two trends in telecoms  - more cable and multimedia in fixed links and increasing mobility for voice - are both attractive to BT's wealthier customers. BT thus faces a competitive challenge to its best prospects. Since it is currently banned from cable, it had better make the most of mobile. Yet Cellnet has always been a laggard. It may be time for BT to get a better grip.</p>

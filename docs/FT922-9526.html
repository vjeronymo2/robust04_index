			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (12): A radical package INVESTOR-FRIENDLY is the great buzz-word among Swiss quoted companies these days. They are all rushing to publish more - and more revealing  - information about their activities and trying to make their shares more attractive to investors, including foreigners. In part, they are doing this to get their share prices up, so they can raise capital on better terms. But for the biggest companies, such as Nestle and Roche, the hard fact is that the Swiss capital market can no longer meet their needs, so they have no choice but to appeal to foreign investors. If there were an award for the Swiss company that has done the most in the shortest time to become investor-friendly, it would undoubtedly go to Holvis Holzstoff, formerly Holzstoff, a long-established, medium-sized group (SFr823m consolidated sales last year). Holvis has transformed itself in the past two years from a boring pulp and paper maker to a world leading producer of the non-woven polymer-based material for disposable nappies and dozens of other trendy products. Even the group's name is new, created to help it shed its identification with paper, which accounted for only 14.5 per cent of sales last year. Holvis used to be one of the most secretive Swiss companies. 'It was very conservative; there was almost no information,' Mr Rudolf Wenger, finance director, says. And when it finally decided last year to change its spots, it got off to a very bad start. Like many others before it, Holvis proposed eliminating restrictions on foreigners owning its registered shares but installing in its place a general restriction on anyone registering more than a 2 per cent stake. The idea was to prevent someone from secretly accumulating a bid stake, a move which is still possible in Switzerland because there is, in effect, no takeover code. To their surprise, Holzstoff directors ran into a barrage of criticism from Swiss institutional investors. 'The culture around us had changed,' says Mr Pedro Reiser, chief executive, ruefully. So the directors went back to the drawing board, and emerged in early March this year with the most radical package of proposals yet advanced by a Swiss quoted company. The proposals, which were to be approved at yesterday's annual general meeting, included the consolidation of capital into a single class of registered shares with no restriction on ownership, by numbers or nationality. In addition, the shares would be split 10 for one to make their price more accessible to small shareholders. In terms of disclosure, the group has also led the way, being one of the first Swiss companies to publish a breakdown of its profits last year by division. And the directors promise that this year's financial statements will be published in accordance with international accounting standards (IAS). Mr Reiser says that one of the group's objectives in liberalising was to improve the rating on its shares so that it could raise capital more cheaply in the future. It spent Dollars 175m in 1990 buying the non-woven assets of the US paper group, James River, and might need to return to the capital markets in the future. Since the announcement of the capital restructuring in early March, the group's bearer shares have risen from SFr5,040 to SFr5,600. Mr Wenger adds: 'Management has started to understand that shareholders are an important part of a company's life. In Switzerland, that has been neglected.' However, the group has taken a risk by going all the way, because it is now vulnerable to a surprise hostile takeover bid. Several other Swiss companies, including Nestle and Sulzer, intend to liberalise their capital structures this year. But they have decided to maintain a limit on the proportion of share capital that any individual may register until a proper takeover code is in place in Switzerland. Mr Reiser acknowledges the problem, but he says the rise in the market valuation of the group's shares since the announcement should drive away the opportunistic bidder. 'Even if we maintained restrictions, we could not stop a determined strategic bidder. We could only delay him,' he says.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Depressed Tokyo needs stronger medicine By Antonia Sharpe TOKYO'S depression showed no signs of lifting at the start of the second quarter. Even the central bank's long-awaited cut in the official discount rate could not prevent Japanese equities falling by 7.6 per cent in local currency terms, on the FT-Actuaries World Indices. The Nikkei is now languishing below 19,000, a five-year low, and there are few signs of an early recovery. In its weekly report, Nomura International says that in the worst-case scenario the Nikkei could fall to around 15,000. But the broker expects the government to prevent this happening by further fiscal stimulation of the economy. Nomura adds that the prospect of a two-tier market is increasing, with the financial sector vulnerable to further weakness, while early cyclical stocks and good quality companies could drastically outperform the market. The world was generally weaker, down 2.6 per cent in local currency terms. Fears of another currency devaluation depressed Finland by 4.3 per cent. This concern, coupled with a sharp increase in interest rates to stem a big rise in capital outflows, pushed down neighbouring Sweden by 3.5 per cent. Mexico continued to be volatile as it fell back 4.2 per cent on profit-taking following the previous week's surge. The biggest corrections were to be found in Telmex, Aspasco and Tolmex. On a more positive note, volume in Mexican equities is expected to increase noticeably now that trading hours have been extended by two hours. Last week's few winners were provided by continental Europe. Italy recovered 2.8 per cent from its 1992 low as traders squared their positions ahead of the national elections. France gained 1.2 per cent in response to the sacking of Mrs Edith Cresson, its first female prime minister, who was replaced by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, who was popular in his role as finance minister.</p>

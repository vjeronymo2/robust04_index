			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Observer: Title fight What is business success? The title of tonight's debate at The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, sponsored by head-hunters Saxton Bampfylde, will presumably provide the usual amount of hot air. Sir John Egan, the chief executive of BAA, and the Bishop of Oxford, are pitted against a couple of red-blooded capitalists - Tomkins chairman Michael Moore and Bob Horton, the ex-chairman of BP. As far as Observer is concerned the bishop is probably the only one who can come up with a convincing answer - getting to heaven on time.</p>

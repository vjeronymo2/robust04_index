The support  was organized by religious groups, scholars, and politicians to  mark the beginning of a campaign against the aggressive U.S.  policy toward Cuba.    The bill is entitled, Act for Free Trade With Cuba, and is  sponsored by Democratic Representative Charles Rangel, who  describes Washington's policy as hypocrital, given the current  international conditions. However, in political circles in the  United States, the climate is that of prudence in forecasting a  victory in Congress because a change in policy toward Cuba  depends to a degree on the Cuban-American community and Wall  Street businesses.</p>

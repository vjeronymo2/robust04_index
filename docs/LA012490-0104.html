			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: PERLES TO STAY AT MICHIGAN STATE  </P> <P> George Perles, under consideration for a multimillion-dollar contract to coach  the New York Jets, decided to stay at Michigan State after its trustees  sweetened his head coaching job Tuesday by also making him athletic director.  </P> <P> The board of trustees' 5-3 vote brought mostly hisses, but some applause, from  about 300 people at the packed emergency board meeting.  </P> <P> "I am very confident in my ability to do both jobs," Perles said in a  statement. "Of course, you don't run a department by yourself. A strong,  competent staff is essential to any organization. I have a plan that I hope to  develop."  </P> <P> Perles said his immediate plans were to take care of football recruiting, which  ends with national signing day on Feb. 14.  </P> <P> Perles, who will assume his new job on July 1, when current Athletic Director  Doug Weaver retires, will have a one-year trial with no extra salary. Then, the  board will review his performance and decide whether one person can handle both  jobs.  </P> <P> New Jet General Manager Dick Steinberg will have to keep looking. He had  interviewed 11 potential candidates, including Perles. Steinberg has also  talked to current NFL assistant coaches Vince Tobin (Chicago), Bruce Coslet  (Cincinnati) and Floyd Peters (Minnesota).  </P></p>

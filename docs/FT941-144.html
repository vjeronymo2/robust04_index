The departure of Hall, who had been in the running to be head of corporate affairs at the BBC, appears to have been prompted by the decision of the new chief executive, Michael Lawrence, to split Hall's job in two and take the public policy element under his own wing. The responsibility for handling the exchange's corporate communications will be taken over by Kate Bowes, 45, head of publicity and promotion. The retirement of Gerrard, a former senior partner of Lovell White Durrant, means that his responsibilities for regulation will be taken over by a new head being recruited from outside. The new executive will be responsible for the exchange's five regulatory functions - listing, market surveillance, market supervision, membership and settlement regulation, and regulatory development. Meanwhile, the exchange is still seeking to fill the other slot vacant in its reorganised top management team - head of finance and planning.

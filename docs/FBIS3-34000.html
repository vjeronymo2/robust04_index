In a message to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali  on the issue, 'Abd-al-Majid denounced the Israeli measures,  which constitute a major obstacle to the peace process.    He asked the United Nations to play its moral and legal role  in taking care of nations under occupation, including the  Palestinian people. The Arab League secretary general stressed  that Dr. Butrus-Ghali's efforts in this regard will have the  greatest effect on Arab and world public opinion.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid also sent a message to Rawhi al-Khatib,  the  Arab mayor of Jerusalem who was deported after 1967 and who  resides in Amman, explaining the Arab League's efforts and  contacts on the issue.</p>

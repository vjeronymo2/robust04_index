			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PROBLEMS OF THE LOS ANGELES FESTIVAL  </P> <P> I am upset by the lack of publicity for the L.A. Festival, and particularly by  director Peter Sellars' comments in an Aug. 4 article that the festival will  "run by word of mouth" and that people who care will be there.  </P> <P> I am a person who cares! Finally, I had to call and request a brochure, which  (as I write this letter) I still haven't received.  </P> <P> If the festival loses money due to lack of attendance, it will be difficult if  not impossible to stage another event of such magnitude.  </P> <P> MARCIA S. ROSS  </P> <P> Vice President of Talent  </P> <P> Warner Bros. TV, Burbank  </P></p>

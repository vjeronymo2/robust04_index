			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / German industry sheds further jobs JOBS GLOOM in Germany deepened yesterday as two of the country's leading employers  - the BASF chemicals group, and IBM Deutschland  - announced workforce cuts totalling 9,000 in the next two years. The cuts follow thousands of job losses already announced, and confirm the trend towards higher unemployment, forecast at over 4m next year, even if the current recession bottoms out. The news of further redundancies came as negotiations at Volkswagen, the motor industry giant, failed to produce an agreement over the introduction of a four-day week. VW is calling for cost savings of 20 per cent from the programme, which is designed to avoid 30,000 job losses. At Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD), the Cologne-based diesel engine and industrial plant manufacturer, a further 800 jobs are to go from its 11,000 workforce as part of a continuing restructuring programme. The pressure on Germany's mainstream engineering industry was also underlined yesterday with the announcement of a merger between Schiess, the Dusseldorf machine tool manufacturer, and Dorries Scharmann of Monchengladbach. The closure of the Dusseldorf plant will cost some 600 jobs. At BASF, some 2,300 jobs are to be cut in 1994, and a further 700 in 1995. Since 1990, the company has slashed its workforce from almost 58,000 to a target of 45,900 by the beginning of 1995. The latest 6,000 job losses at IBM's German subsidiary are in addition to 3,500 redundancies in 1993 alone. Since 1986, the company has cut its workforce from 29,000 to 21,000. Mr Edmund Hug, IBM Deutschland's new chief executive, said the emphasis would switch to software and servicing from traditional computer hardware. The job cuts in Germany are part of a broad retrenchment by IBM, which plans to cut 35,000 jobs worldwide this year, most of them outside the US.</p>

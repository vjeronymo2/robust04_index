			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Michelin to keep control in the family tradition SHAREHOLDERS of Michelin, the world's largest tyre company, have been asked to approve the 28-year-old son of Mr Francois Michelin, the current chairman, as his possible successor. Mr Michelin, 64, and his two fellow managing partners have put forward Mr Edouard Michelin, currently working in the commercial division, as a future managing partner, paving the way for him eventually to take full charge. The older partners will continue to be in charge at Michelin 'for many years to come', before handing down full responsibility, says a letter to shareholders. This is the best way to ensure management continuity, says the letter. If shareholders accept the proposal at a meeting on June 28, the younger Mr Michelin would replace 75-year-old Mr Francois Rollier, the oldest of the three managing partners, who is due to retire then. The remaining managing partner is Mr Rene Zingraff, 54, who has worked in the same position since 1966 with Mr Michelin senior, grandson of the company's founder. The move is the latest example of how several French companies have held on to the tradition of keeping control in the hands of founding families. The top jobs in companies like Bouygues in construction, Dassault in aviation, Pernod Ricard in drinks and Gallimard in publishing have passed to descendants of the founder in recent years, while father-to-son transitions of power are under way at Matra in electronics and Club Mediterranee, the holiday village group. Edouard, the chairman's fourth son, is around the same age his predecessors were when they became managing partners and is about to take responsibility for the group's US and Canadian businesses. He will report to Mr Carlos Ghosn, the current manager of Michelin's North American interests, including Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre maker acquired last year. Mr Edouard Michelin has followed a standard education for the French business elite, having trained at the Ecole Centrale in Paris, one of the so-called Grandes Ecoles public service colleges. He undertook military service on a nuclear submarine before taking on a series of posts in group plants. He has the attributes 'that the future head of a company like ours must have', says the partners' letter to shareholders.</p>

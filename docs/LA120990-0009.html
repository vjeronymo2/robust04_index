			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE COWBOY AND THE GOOD OL' GIRL  </P> <P> Can someone please explain why, when Ann Richards divorced, it was considered a  "failed marriage."  </P> <P> Yet when writing about Williams, I quote, "Along the way, he married, fathered  two daughters, then divorced in 1964." The writer, making it sound as if  Williams' divorce was just a stroll through the park, feeds into the so-called  macho image. It appears to me that J. Michael Kennedy has a little of the same  prejudice that has made Clayton Williams so popular in Texas.  </P> <P> ROBERT OLIVER  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

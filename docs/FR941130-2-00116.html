The Act eliminated these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Act initially requires a national securities exchange to wait until the third day of trading before extending unlisted trading privileges to any security that is listed and registered on another national securities exchange and is the subject of an initial public offering. The Act directs the Securities and Exchange Commission, however, to prescribe, before April 21, 1995, the permanent period, if any, that exchanges must observe before extending unlisted trading privileges to any such securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result, any national securities exchange that has previously applied to the Commission for approval of unlisted trading privileges in any security may extend unlisted trading privileges to such security in accordance with the terms of the Act, notwithstanding that the Commission has yet to approve the exchange's outstanding application. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, the Commission is publishing this notice to inform interested persons that no further Commission action on these applications is necessary. For further information, interested persons may contact Glen P. Barrentine, 202/942.0145, Senior Counsel, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Mail Stop 5&hyph;1, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington D.C. 20549. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has previously published notice of certain of these outstanding applications.

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dig your way out of a jam Sir, Your report 'Channel tunnellers aim for Alpine projects' (March 3) suggests that there may be things for the tunnellers to do much nearer home. Why not build an inner ring road round London, inside the infamous M25 and deep underground? The construction could include large car parks with escalators or lifts for upward connections to the main London tube stations. Such a project could keep the tunnellers going for years at a steady rate, and it would get the cars out of London, enabling the city to breathe again.

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Dalmatians count cost of war 'THE Republic of Dalmatia,' proclaims a banner headline in a satirical newspaper published in Split, Croatia's port city on the Adriatic. With no prospect of gaining Serb-held territory, the headline is indicative of the mood in Croatia. The once prosperous Dalmatian coast has started questioning the stewardship of Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia. All but cut off from mainland Croatia by Serb-held territories under UN protection, Dalmatia's inhabitants have been hit hard by the forgotten war. Previously accustomed to a comfortable style afforded by tourist receipts, which amounted to as much as Pounds 2bn a year, they are living under stringent restrictions with daily power cuts. Many Dalmatian towns are hostage to Serb rebels who lob artillery from the hinterland. Inflation is running at 25 per cent a month. Croatia's current GNP of Pounds 5.3bn is 30 per cent of the pre-war GNP, estimates Mr Zvonimir Baletic, a Zagreb economist. Aware of growing discontent, President Tudjman on Sunday vowed to assert control over 'every inch of Croatian territory. . . if necessary by force.' Speaking in Split, he promised that trains would soon resume service to the Adriatic through Knin, the rail junction which is also the centre of the self-styled Serb state which cuts Croatia in half. 'It is not only for the good of Dalmatia, but for Croatia as well,' he said. His ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) is bitterly divided over how to establish control over the republic's borders. One faction headed by Mr Gojko Susak, defence minister, is aggressively pursuing the carve-up of neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina with Serbia. In an interview this week, he said Croatia will seize control of the frontiers by the end of the year 'with or without the UN.' According to a recent oppinion poll published in Globus, the Zagreb weekly, 70 per cent of Croatians favour war to re-assert control over the borders. Mr Susak denied accusations that he wants to annex Hercegovina to Croatia, although last month he reportedly hoisted a Croatian flag over the central Bosnian town of Travnik. The HDZ hardliners are at loggerheads with a corp of old-time politicians opposed to the partition of neighbouring Bosnia. Critics of Mr Susak's nationalist Hercegovina lobby have warned that the carve-up would set a dangerous precedent for Croatia which could become an unstable confederation with Serb rebels. In an interview with Danas, the Zagreb news weekly, Mr Franjo Greguric, director of the Croatian oil company INA, said: 'I don't think Croatia should permit three states to be created out of Bosnia before resolving the status of the UN zones and returning them to Croatian control. 'I am more afraid of the regionalisation that is brewing in Croatia.' But an opposition politician sees increased autonomy for regions of Croatia as the only blueprint for a stable democracy. 'There is no other choice for the state. Croatia needs the renewal of regions with a strong degree of autonomy,' he said.</p>

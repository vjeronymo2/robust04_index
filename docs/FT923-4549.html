			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Man in the News: Smooth scourge of low standards - John Patten There are few things more calculated to touch a raw nerve with parents than the suggestion that the standard of their children's school examinations has fallen. So when Mr John Patten, the education secretary, this week demanded an urgent inquiry into the reliability of GCSE results, he provoked a predictable furore. Educational traditionalists who fought the replacement in 1988 of the two-tier system of O-levels and CSEs with a single test for all 15- and 16-year-olds were delighted. They believe that egalitarianism has eroded standards, particularly for bright children. What Mr Patten would call the educational establishment was furious. Teachers' unions accused him of undermining real improvements in GCSE performance. Political opponents seized on his record as an unabashed self-publicist to accuse him of seeking cheap headlines before next month's Tory party conference. At the heart of the controversy was Mr Patten's strong reaction to a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate into the record level of passes in this year's GCSEs. The report said that there was evidence pointing to a gradual erosion in standards since 1988. It suggested that the quality of testing by the independent boards which set and mark the examinations was uneven. HMI's inspectors were concerned that it was too easy for children to achieve the top grades and insufficient attention was paid to punctuation and spelling. Alongside these criticisms was the more measured comment that many of the shortcomings were neither new nor easy to solve. Even opponents of the GCSE acknowledge that standards among the examining boards which set O-levels often varied widely. Mr Patten does not recall it, but the Jesuit-run grammar school he attended in south London frequently directed pupils to different O and A-level boards to maximise pass rates. The full report was published only yesterday. But the education secretary seized the initiative by releasing the most damning extracts at the start of the week and demanding a response from the boards by the end of this month. The handling of the announcement could have been subtler. Parents and children who a week earlier had been celebrating examination passes found the achievements devalued. Mr Patten is unrepentant: 'What the report tells us is that there are serious question marks over the way the examining process has been conducted.' It was vital to seek an urgent response, he said, because whatever remedial action was necessary would have to be taken before next summer's examinations. 'At this stage every single week counts if it is to be got right.' But Mr Patten - who stressed that one of his principal objectives was to achieve a period of 'peace and quiet in the classrooms' - is adamant that he had not sought to provoke new controversy. He had not known of the existance of the HMI study until the results landed on his desk 10 days ago. He had intended to spend this month working on the school restructuring outlined in his July white paper: 'I would have much preferred not to have this report on my desk.' Nor, he insisted, should his reaction be taken as an attack on the nation's classrooms: 'The criticisms are aimed not at pupils, not at teachers, not at teachers' training colleges. They are aimed fairly and squarely at the examining boards.' His response to the ensuing row is likely to disappoint both the traditionalists and those conjuring up fears of a new Tory plot to engineer the return of the O-level. Mr Patten is a politician shrewd enough not to slam the door entirely on the traditionalists but, asked whether his starting point was to improve the GCSE rather than scrap it, he replied simply: 'Sure.' An 'awful lot', he added, could be put right within the present framework: 'I certainly hope that we can make a single examination work.' The furore provides an intriguing insight into the way Mr Patten intends to run the schools system over the next few years. On one level, his appointment after the April general election marked a break with the past. The 47-year-old former university lecturer is as self-consciously smooth as his predecessor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, is instinctively abrasive. He is the product of the state system and sends his six-year-old daughter to a central London primary. He has long had a professional interest in education. His overall approach is infused with the moralism that comes with devout Catholicism. His appointment sent a signal to the teachers that, after the upheavals of the past few years, the government was anxious to rebuild classroom morale. The white paper carried the same message. The radical thrust of the shift to grant-maintained status would continue but there would be no 'big bang'. The process instead would be 'evolutionary'. Local education authorities will wither rather than face outright abolition. Peace in the classroom, however, is not to be bought at any price. Mr Patten is determined, for example, to grasp a political nettle long avoided by education secretaries and reduce the 1.5m surplus places in the nation's schools. More importantly, this week's row signals that he has no intention of retreating from the Conservative assault on the 'progressive' teaching of the 1960s and 1970s. The education secretary is an ambitious politician. Until his appointment in April he had been stranded on the fringe of the cabinet for five years. He is acutely aware that there is no political future for a Tory education secretary who is perceived to be soft on the educational establishment. So making friends with the teachers does not mean making up with their unions or with the progressive educational theorists said by the government to dominate the local education authorities and teacher training colleges. Nor does it mean accepting an erosion of what the average Tory voter might define as standards. Peace and quiet, in other words, is to be relative.</p>

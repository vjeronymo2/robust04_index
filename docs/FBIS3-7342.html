The hardliners  argue that this measure would be "an effective means of curbing  the development of chemical and biological weapons by  non-nuclear states".    This openly revealed their intention to threaten all the  non-nuclear states with nuclear weapons and monopolize chemical,  biological and nuclear weapons, stresses NODONG SINMUN today.    The news analyst says:    If this ambition of the United States is overlooked, the  non-nuclear states cannot be free from U.S. threat of nuclear,  chemical and biological weapons.    The demand of the hardliners of the U.S. military for the  "use of nuclear weapons" is patent proof of the falsehood of  U.S. propaganda that it "is a peaceful state obliged to prevent  nuclear proliferation worldwide."    If the U.S. is really interested in promoting a fair  implementation of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], it  must assure the international community it will not threaten the  non-nuclear states with nuclear weapons and show its will for  nuclear disarmament in practice.    The U.S. nuclear threat to non-nuclear states increases the  partiality of the NPT, which imposes unilateral restriction and  inspection on non-nuclear states while recognizing the right of  nuclear monopoly of the nuclear-weapon states.    In abusing the NPT, the United States seeks to monopolize  the  nuclear weapons and, by wielding them at random, lord it over as  the dominator of the world twisting all countries round its  finger.    Nuclear threat cannot be a cure-all.</p>

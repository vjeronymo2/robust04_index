Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong said on Monday the money  supply expansion ceiling has been set at 14 to 17 percent for  this year. "Unlike past practices, however, we will operate  money supply a little tightly without regard to the ceiling,"  Hong said.    In a policy consultation with senior Bank of Korea  officials,  the finance minister said, "Money supply should be operated in  consideration of the trend of money interests in view of  industries' financial burden."    Touching on the ceiling of foreigners' investment in stocks,  Minister Hong said the government plans, if possible, to reduce  the influx of foreign money into the stock market this year.    "We must develop mid- and long-term policy devices over this  issue in consideration of our country's entry into the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  next year," the minister said.    He thus implied that his Ministry would expand the ceiling  of  foreigners' investment in stocks by next year at the latest as  planned.    "To open the stock market without developing devices for the  management of money supply is like pushing a brakeless car down  from the top of a hill," Hong said. "Yet, a winter comes anyway  even though you didn't prepare a coat."</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Sport: Blame the weather - Cricket Returning from an almost tropical holiday in France, I was not surprised to find everyone in England talking about the hot and humid weather. Especially cricket lovers, since cricket and weather are inseparable and should the cricket fail, the hot weather is an inexhaustible culprit. Should the cricket flourish, hot weather is almost too glorious for words. Almost, but not quite. On June 16 1932, White Willow of the Daily Telegraph reported the game between Essex and Yorkshire at Leyton in majestic style, starting with the weather. 'Under the flaming skies of Leyton yesterday Yorkshire's opening batsmen, Holmes and Sutcliffe, were kings of the match from morn till evening, the Essex bowlers and fieldsmen being their abject slaves in a bondage that is not yet ended.' In the first day's sunshine Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe scored 423 runs. Before lunch on the second day they had scored 555, a world-record first-wicket partnership, whereupon Sutcliffe got himself out. Yorkshire declared at 555 for 1 and 'as Holmes and Sutcliffe stood in front of the score-board waiting to be photographed, the figures were altered to 554]' Spectators, telegrams and messages of protest quickly accumulated, the scorers managed to find an overlooked no-ball and the record was confirmed. This summer, with glory more elusive in English cricket, the heat was assigned a grimmer role. Scores on the first day of the Hampshire v Gloucestershire match at Portsmouth were in a lower league: Hampshire 192 all out; Gloucestershire 58 for 5. The Daily Telegraph began its report on July 15 in angry style: 'When 15 wickets fall in a day, it is probably safe to say that the two sides involved are not playing on a shirt front. For a four-day match, this pitch is clearly too dry, having had 15 days with no water whatsoever, either from the heavens or from the groundsmen, sprinkled on it.' Groundsmen, like the turf they tend, find hot weather troublesome. They can always be held responsible for problems it produces on the field of play. Little interference with nature is often seen as wilful neglect, as at Portsmouth or at Edgbaston on May 25. There was no play between Warwickshire and Kent in the Benson and Hedges Cup because the ground was too wet. The cover-all Brumbrella had not been used in case it encouraged a fungal infection that was damaging the grass. Kent lost the 'bowl-out' that replaced the game. They were not amused. On the other hand, interference with nature is often condemned as excessive. Steve Wright, Leicestershire's assistant groundsman, drenched, rolled, then kept dry the wicket at Grace Road ready for his county's game against South Africa on July 30. The wicket was fast and the tourists' captain Kepler Wessels was hit on his painful right arm by a shooter. The tourists' pacemen were on the brink of finishing off Leicestershire's batting when a downpour ended play before tea on the last day. Wessels declared: 'The pitch is sub-standard.' In July 1868 there was about an hour of abandoned play in the game between Surrey and Lancashire at the Oval described in match reports as 'due to excessive heat'. A helpful lady at the Oval said the only reference to weather on her information machine was the break in play in the England v Australia Oval Test a century later, when the crowd helped mop up the rain after a savage cloudburst. It left Derek Underwood enough time to bowl the Australians out and level the series. Not good summer weather, but useful cricketing weather. 'I've got nothing else to say about the weather,' sighed the assistant contentedly, 'except that everyone here is praying for rain.' At Trent Bridge they were unsure how to apportion the blame between God and rain when their Sunday game against Surrey on July 24 was 'typhooned off'. The teams carried on playing when heavy rain fell, but gave up when fierce lightning rent the sky. The crowd, I was told, went home wearing bin-liners, but not before one of them had counted 120 flashes of lightning in five minutes. Storms always make good reading. At the start of June 1975, one official from the Derbyshire weather centre, unwilling to shut out any possibility, forecast: 'Sunny periods, scattered showers, sleet or snow on mountains; winds northerly, fresh or strong.' Wise man. At Buxton on the first day, Lancashire scored 477 for five declared. On the second day there was the worst summer snow in Britain since 1888. On the third day, play resumed in time for Derbyshire to be all out on a drying wicket, for 42 in the first innings, then 87 in the second and lose by an innings and 348 runs. Derbyshire's secretary told me that the recent hot spell had not really effected them. They had only played at Derby when the heat-wave was gentle, so there was never any question of 'sun stopped play' or 'good light stopped play', which the Derby ground has suffered because its wicket faces east-west, into the evening sun. You never know with Derbyshire. Or the weather.</p>

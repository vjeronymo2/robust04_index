			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yelena Yulikova, head of the administration </F> of social service nonmobile institutions under the Russian  Federation Ministry for Social Protection of the Population, by  Yelena Vasilkova, under the "Continuing the Subject" rubric:  "The Homeless Are People Too"]    [Text] Moscow--We recently published an article about  the homeless that was sent by our correspondent from Perm and  titled "Extraterrestrials." But this problem exists in more than  just one city. Recently, "persons without definite employment  and residence" can be seen practically at every railroad station  of any city.    Why have they become so numerous? Is anyone involved  with the destinies of these people, or has our society turned  its back on them?    "Yes, this has become a real catastrophe for Russia," says  Yelena Yulikova, head of the administration of social service  nonmobile institutions under the Russian Federation Ministry for  Social Protection of the Population. "People are moved or forced  to become homeless for the most various reasons. Due to the  production drop, some people have lost their jobs and, together  with them, they have lost their beds in the dorms. Others have  come here because of interethnic conflicts. Still others get  `thrown out' into the streets by their relatives...."    [Vasilkova] Are all these people now doomed to wander from  place to place and beg? Our people cannot find employment if  they do not have permanent residence registration, can they?    [Yulikova] Yes, they can find it. True, it is hard and  nonprestigious jobs, if they are healthy and, what is most  important, willing to get out of this situation. But imagine,  many of the homeless do not want any changes in their lives.    Not so long ago, we conducted a small sociological study at  several Moscow railroad terminals, and we offered the following  to the homeless: We would put the old people in boarding houses  and find jobs for those who can work. Here is the result: Out of  the 180 people we talked to, nobody wanted to have anything to  do with the federal organs. Some of them even expressed their  indignation: This, they said, is a violation of personal  freedoms and an infringement on human rights, which cannot be  allowed in our present democratic society.    Here is another example: A man was showing off his  artificial  limbs in the underground passage right next to our Ministry.  Passersby were dropping money into his hat, and I came up to  him, introduced myself, and invited him to come to our Ministry  for help. Do you think he was happy? Quite the contrary! It  turned out that he had a family, an apartment, and a pension. He  was simply "moonlighting" in the passage there. There are so  many such people now!    [Vasilkova] But there are other people also, feeble old men  and women who, through some tricks or sometimes threats, have  been forced to sell their apartments, and now they have to  wander around without a place to live.    [Yulikova] But why does this happen? Nothing of the kind  could have happened before, for the simple reason that there was  a rule: If someone went to sign out, prior to his departure from  a residence, he had to produce a document stating where he was  going. We do not have such a rule any more. You can sell your  apartment, sign out, and go wherever you wish. Is this normal?  Scoundrels jumped at this opportunity right away--they found a  loophole for fooling old people and taking away their legitimate  residences.    [Vasilkova] What can the victims do in such cases? They are  lucky if they have relatives who can give them shelter. But most  often this happens to lonely people.    [Yulikova] We try to help such people if they come to us.    [Vasilkova] But many of them do not know about you, they do  not know how to find you. As far as I know, in the old days the  militia used to detain vagrants, but now, for some reason, the  militiamen just pass them by with indifference.    [Yulikova] The problem is that, rather recently, we repealed  Article 209 of the Criminal Code, which specified types of  punishment for vagrancy. Apart from detaining transients, the  militia used to send them to special reception and distribution  centers, where their identities were established, necessary  medical assistance given, and their future fate decided. It  often happened that wanted criminals were hiding among the  "tramps."    [Vasilkova] Yelena Pavlovna, for some reason you are using  the past tense when you talk about all this. Have special  reception and distribution centers been closed, due to our fight  for human rights?    [Yulikova] Not yet. They are still run by the Ministry of  Internal Affairs [MVD], but there are plans to replace them with  rehabilitation centers. Now we are the only agency that has been  entrusted with the problem of the homeless.    [Vasilkova] In other words, it is your service and not the  militia that is going to round up the homeless at railroad  terminals and on the streets and place them in those centers?    [Yulikova] We are not going to force anyone to go anywhere.  Ours is a social institution which, I want to repeat, adheres to  the principle of free will.    [Vasilkova] What kind of extremes we have in our country: We  used to exile people to the 101st kilometer for not working; now  you can idle all you want and nobody cares! But you yourself  said that vagrancy has become a profession for some people; it  is doubtful that any of them will come to you to "surrender" of  their own free will. Which means that it is you and I now who  are destined to look at hordes of ragged and dirty people  filling our railroad stations and underground crossings. But  what about the recent edict of our president "On Measures for  the Prevention of Vagrancy and Begging"? What are those measures?    [Yulikova] The complexity of this document lies in the fact  that it does not define the status of either a vagrant or a  beggar. Incidentally, the same problem exists in many other  countries. Even though some of them have laws restricting even  begging to certain places only: You cannot stay at a  transportation terminal if you do not have a ticket for a train  or a bus. But you are right in saying that our railroad stations  have become filthy night shelters. I agree that it is unpleasant  and even dangerous to be there, next to dirty people who are  often sick or covered with lice. There are quite a few hoodlums  and thieves among the homeless, too. This is the reason that I  think that it was a rash step to shift from the militia to us  such an important, urgent, and crime-conducive problem. We ought  to defend those who need it, but not the people who we need to  be protected against.    [Vasilkova] Would it be better for you to deal with the  problem in cooperation with the militia?    [Yulikova] We successfully cooperated with them before,  also.  The most reasonable decision would be for us to continue  cooperation and reorganize the reception and distribution  centers instead of closing them down. But to destroy all this  with a single blow all of a sudden and to make us start it from  the very beginning?    [Vasilkova] So what did you start with?    [Yulikova] So far, we have been operating by trial and  error.  Certain things we borrowed from our foreign colleagues, others  we invented ourselves. We settled on three types of social  assistance: the overnight shelter, the social hostel, and the  adaptation center. We have made the designs for them and sent  them to various regions.    Any person, even one with no documents, can go to an  overnight shelter. There he is given, free of charge, a bed and  bedding, and medical assistance. We are planning to have  counseling services in those places in future.    A social hostel will provide shelter for a term from one day  to a month. During this time, every person will be given a free  meal ticket daily. An adaptation or rehabilitation center will  accommodate people for six months; they will work there and  receive treatment. They will have addiction treatment and legal  services, and medical and labor centers. One such center has  already been opened in Makhachkala. An overnight shelter and a  social hostel have opened in Lipetsk.    [Vasilkova] And in Moscow? As far as I know, there is just  one flophouse, an overnight shelter, excuse me, for the entire  huge city. Do you think it sufficient?    [Yulikova] Who can think this! But if you only knew what it  cost us to open even this one! It is not even a house: We just  secured part of a boarding home for the elderly who had to  settle for less space for this. The Moscow government could not  find any accommodation for this charitable institution. They  manage to find buildings for all kinds of firms and joint  ventures, but here--alas!    [Vasilkova] Here are your market relations, Yelena Pavlovna!  Firms pay big money.    [Yulikova] We, our society, will have to pay a lot more if  we  do not resolve the homeless problem in time. Believe me, this  problem is very far from being a simple one, and we should not  hush it up, unload it on someone else, or let it run its own  course. We need to take urgent measures including some  legislative ones. If we want to live in peace.</p>

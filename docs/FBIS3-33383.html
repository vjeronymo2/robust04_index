It has reported  on its plans to control, through a draft bill, the use of the  150-km-wide strip of territory along the Brazilian border with  other countries. In accordance with the project the Strategic  Affairs Secretariat sent to congress, any initiative for the  border strip will have to be discussed first with the Executive  Secretariat of the National Defense Council. [passage omitted]    The draft bill sent to Congress by the government  establishes  that the National Defense Council will have to make all  decisions about the border strip area: be it about the purchase  of buildings by foreigners, the demarcation of indigenous land,  scientific expeditions, the installation of television and radio  services, and the admittance or work of religious missions and  nongovernmental organizations.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Stopping an arc before it starts ACCIDENTS CAUSED by arcs which develop in electrical switchgear and distribution boards account for about one third of all electrical accidents in industry. When arcs occur on land-based equipment they can damage plant and cause injuries, but off-shore arcs jeopardise the lives of everyone working on a platform. When an arc develops it resembles an explosion with temperatures reaching 20,000 deg C, and light intensities 2,000 times stronger than office lighting systems. The traditional solution on offshore drilling and production platforms has been to enclose distribution panels in metal cabinets. The enclosure contains the explosion, but does nothing to protect the electrical circuitry. To tackle the problem ABB Control, part of the Asea Brown Boveri group, has developed the TVOC optical-based monitor which disconnects faulty electrical equipment in less than two milliseconds - less than the time it takes for an arc to fully develop. Because the ABB solution prevents arcs rather than containing them, special arc-proof containers are not needed, and repair times are cut or eliminated. ABB Control: UK, 0203 368500.</p>

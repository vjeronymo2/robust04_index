			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Omago; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN </F> 26 January Evening Edition]    [Text] Washington, 25 Jan -- At a news conference on 25  January, Takakazu Kuriyama, Japanese Ambassador to the United  States, said: "Japan should urgently work out pump-priming  measures, including a draft fiscal 1994 budget, to show its will  to fulfill an economic responsibility." In this way, he  stressed the need for Tokyo to compile the draft 1994 budget  before the Japanese-U.S. summit talks take place on 11 February.  Noting that Washington has put great expectations on Japan's  pump-priming measures, a Japanese diplomatic source in the  United States also said: "A delay in formulating  economy-boosting measures is against Japan's interests. It also  annoys people of the world."    During the news conference, Ambassador Kuriyama referred to  the ongoing Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks in Washington.  He said: "Both Japan and the United States should remember the  starting point of the talks," expressing an apprehension over  the situation in which Japanese and U.S. negotiators continue  confronting each other over whether or not objective criteria  should be set. He added: "Japan agreed last July to reduce its  current account surplus and increase imports, and that was the  starting point." His remark indicates that both Japan and the  United States need to make concessions during the talks.    Regarding the prospect for the two sides making compromises,  Kuriyama said: "Tokyo and Washington earlier agreed during  construction talks to set criteria to gauge the openness of the  Japanese construction market. This becomes a precedent and will  be good for reference." In this way, he indicated that Japan  would comply with the U.S. demand for setting criteria if they  are yardsticks to evaluate results.</p>

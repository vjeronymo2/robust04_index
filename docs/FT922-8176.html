			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking leaves Paris lower at the close Profit-taking was evident in Paris yesterday, as other senior bourses generally held steady, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was initially lifted by a firm franc and bond market but profit-taking and a flat opening on Wall Street sent shares lower by the close. The CAC-40 index dropped 10.46 to 2,053.17 in moderate turnover of FFr3.2bn. A FFr6.10 drop to FFr390 in Elf, which held its annual meeting yesterday, weighed on the market. The chairman said first quarter operating profit fell about 25 per cent from the year-ago period. Unspectacular first quarter turnover figures sent Alcatel lower for the second day, closing down FFr13 at FFr648, and also wiped FFr18 off Saint Gobain to FFr595. Euro Disney stabilised after Tuesday's drop, and analysts said the stock looked oversold. It rose as high as FFr129.30 before closing 70 centimes better at FFr126. Pechiney International eased another FFr5.30 to FFr201.70 following Tuesday's private placement of new shares. FRANKFURT was mixed in quiet trade as metalworkers mooted further talks with employers; after hours, a resumption of talks was scheduled for Hesse today. The DAX index closed 1.74 lower at 1,749.42 after a similarly token 0.16 rise to 706.98 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume eased from DM6.2bn to DM6bn. An unsubstantiated rumour that Deutsche Bank had recommended steel stocks left Hoesch and Klockner-Werke DM3 and DM1.50 higher, at DM246 and DM118 respectively, but Preussag fell DM6.90 to DM406. Kaufhof, the retailer, gained DM7 to DM498 on a higher dividend and a 30 per cent jump in net profits. MILAN was supported by short-covering ahead of the close of the account tomorrow. Dealers said that call options on Fiat and Montedison were taken up but that those on insurance stocks had been abandoned. The Comit index edged up 0.73 to 482.33 in turnover estimated at L80bn-L100bn after L86.6bn on Tuesday. Dealers were sidelined ahead of the Fiat results due tomorrow, which could either help the market to recover or condemn it to a further decline. A 30 per cent cut in the dividend has been discounted by the market, but a dividend paid partly in cash and partly in shares in one of the group's subsidiaries or a capital increase, both rumoured yesterday, would be taken badly. Olivetti rose L77 to L2,949 on turnround hopes after its heavy loss and restructuring charges last year. ZURICH took SBC at its word. The bank said on Tuesday that Moody's downgrading of its triple-A rating was not material. Its shares recovered SFr6 to SFr287 as the SMI index closed 2.7 higher at 1,953.5. AMSTERDAM was disappointed by Aegon's flat earnings per share for 1991 and its shares fell Fl 1.10 to Fl 124.80. The CBS Tendency index was unchanged at 130.2. CSM, the food and biochemicals group, advanced 90 cents to Fl 96.60 on unsurprising first-half figures. Hunter Douglas lost Fl 1.50 or 2 per cent to Fl 75.30 after reporting a small rise in first quarter sales after Tuesday's close, while Royal Dutch, which reports first quarter figures today, eased Fl 1.10 to Fl 150.20. MADRID's general index closed up 2.91 at 260.82 with strong buying noted late in the session prior to the expiry of futures and options contracts today. Endesa put on Pta105 to Pta3,675 after reporting better-than-expected first quarter earnings while Tabacalera weakened Pta90 to Pta6,700. STOCKHOLM rebounded from an early drop on demand for Volvo and Ericsson. The Affarsvarlden general index added 1.4 to 1,007.8 in turnover of SKr689m after SKr576m. Ericsson B free's added SKr6 to SKr141 following Tuesday's late news of a big Japanese order. Volvo B free's recovered SKr4 to SKr448 after Tuesday's drop. COPENHAGEN was lifted by a 38 per cent jump in Novo Nordisk's first quarter net, the KFX index closing 0.38 higher at 96.39 as Novo rose DKr13 to DKr547. Hafnia fell DKr24 to DKr200 in thin, speculative trading. HELSINKI dropped on profit-taking, the Hex index felling 12.2 to 852.3. BRUSSELS eased with the Bel-20 index closing down 3.12 at 1,221.74 in thin turnover of BFr669m. Electrabel, which announced investment plans of BFr40bn in 1993, lost BFr55 or 1 per cent to BFr4,890. VIENNA's ATX index shed 1.81 to 966.75. Among active issues Austrian Airlines lost Sch30 to Sch2,280 after announcing a 12 per cent decline in first quarter earnings.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes  Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1191.17  1191.06  1191.30  1189.65  1190.13  1190.86  1188.60  1187.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1191.63            Day's Low  1187.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------      May 12       May 11       May 8       May 7        May 6     1188.40      1191.63      1188.95??   1182.52      1182.62  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ??

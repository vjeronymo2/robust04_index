			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / US envoy fails to get Arafat back to talks: Ross returns to Washington after discussions in Tunis Mr Dennis Ross, US special envoy, failed yesterday to win the consent of Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, for resuming peace talks with Israel, AP reports from Tunis. Mr Ross, State Department co-ordinator for the Middle East, left for Washington after two sessions with Mr Arafat at his Tunis headquarters. Pressed for comment after the second session, Mr Ross said only that the talks 'touched on a number of issues including Palestinian concerns about the security of the Palestinians in the (occupied) territories'. He refused to elaborate. Wafa, the PLO news agency, said Mr Arafat renewed demands for 'international protection for the Palestinian people against massacres committed by the Israeli army and armed settlers' before the talks could resume. Peace talks were suspended after a Jewish settler killed 30 Palestinian worshippers in a West Bank mosque on February 25. Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, a PLO executive committee member, said the talks with Mr Ross were 'frank and very useful'. But he added that the PLO was still looking for 'security guarantees for the Palestinians in the occupied territories'. Other officials described the discussions as tense. 'Arafat made no commitment beyond expressing his desire to see the talks restarted. . . but after the Palestinians get something on the ground,' said an official. 'Arafat did not say the magic words Ross wanted to hear.' Mr Arafat also received an Israeli delegation yesterday which came to Tunis reportedly to convey new proposals to lure the PLO back to the negotiating table. Israel radio reported the peace talks could resume by the end of the week in Washington if the Tunis contacts went smoothly. Julian Ozanne adds from Jerusalem: Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, who yesterday was preparing to leave for Washington, said: 'I believe we will put the peace negotiations back on track. Those who want peace have to know how to overcome painful events.' His government also stepped up the crackdown on extremist Jewish groups banned and branded terrorists by the cabinet on Sunday. Israeli police raided the homes of settlers in the heart of Hebron, confiscating weapons and issuing arrest orders. Police officials said 23 movement restriction warrants would be served on followers of the two anti-Arab groups - Kach and Kehane Lives. Observers said Mr Rabin was determined to have the crackdown under way before arriving in Washington, where he may face pressure from US officials to do more to rein in militant Jewish settlers. Mr Rabin is also likely to come in for criticism for the continuing aggressive settlements policy of Jews in what the government calls 'Greater Jerusalem' but which is part of the occupied West Bank. In Washington, it emerged last night that the US State Department was considering whether to put Kach and Kahane Lives on its list of terrorist sponsors after the Hebron massacre. Reuter adds: Mr Rabin yesterday signed an agreement to add the religious Shas party to his government coalition, giving him a majority in parliament. When the accord goes into effect after approval by Mr Rabin's Labour party, Shas leaders and parliament, the government will be supported by 62 of the 120 parliament members, up from 56.</p>

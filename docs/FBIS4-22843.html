Galperin, Institute of Engineering Physics </F> imeni A.F. Ioffe, St.Peterburg; 01;05;09]    [Abstract] Noise in SQUIDS built with high-T[.sub]c[/]  superconductors and operating at radio frequencies is analyzed,  of specific concern here being the effect of flicker  fluctuations of the critical current in the nonlinear Josephson  junction on the 1/f noise in such a SQUID and the dependence of  its spectral density on the mode of SQUID operation. The  interferometer is inductively coupled to a LC oscillator-pump  tank circuit with a shunting resistance R. The analysis is based  on four equations: 1) one for the magnetic flux in the  interferometer, which consists of a signal flux and an  ``external'' flux; 2) one for the Josephson current, which  consists of a fluctuation component and a supercurrent in  addition to the (h/2eR)_P_ current (h- Planck's constant, e-  electron mass, R- oscillator resistance, _P_- total magnetic  flux normalized to a flux quantum, displacement current  negligible at low frequencies; 3-4 oscillator equations for the  voltage across it and the total current in it respectively.  Inasmuch as the inductance of a SQUID is usually very low, its  static _P_(_P_[.sub]ext[/]) interferometer diagram is  calculated on the basis of the threshold model (K.K. Likharev;  Introduction to Dynamics of Josephson Junctions, Izd. Nauka  1985), which includes a hysteresis loop consisting of linear  segments, whereupon the performance of such a SQUId is analyzed  again for noise, this time taking into account that hysteresis.

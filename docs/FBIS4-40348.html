			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- Russian field engineering  units will be brought in to demine sites in Abkhazia on  Thursday, in accordance with the first stage of peacemaking  operation in the area of Abkhazian-Georgian conflict.    The announcement was made by Colonel General Vladimir  Semenov  at a news conference held in the main headquarters of Russian  land forces on Wednesday.    Russian peace-making forces will be introduced in the area  in  accordance with Georgian-Abkhazian agreements and Russian  president's decree, Semenov emphasized.    According to him, at present a task force of the Russian  Defence Ministry led by Deputy Defence Minister Colonel General  Georgiy Kondratyev is in the area, making a reconnaisance of the  sites where the peace-keepers will be stationed and commanding  points will be set up. They are going to demine these very  sites.    Asked if Russian servicemen will be guaranteed security,  Semenov underlined that a full guarantee could not be given.  The main conditions for such a guarantee lie in demining the  terraine in the 12-kilometer strip and building engineering  facilities at the peace- keepers' checkpoints, he added.    Every effort will be made to prevent losses of Russian  servicemen, he said.    In case of attacks upon the checkpoints run by Russian  peace-  keepers, the latter will shoot to kill, he emphasized.</p>

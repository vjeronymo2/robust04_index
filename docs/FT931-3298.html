			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Rolls joint venture secures big order BMW Rolls-Royce, the joint venture formed two years ago, has won its second important order for the BR710 aero-engine it is developing for business and regional jets. The joint venture's BR710 engine has been chosen by the Canadian Bombardier group to power its Canadair global express business aircraft. No value has been placed on the deal but Bombardier has won 37 firm orders for its long range twin engine business jet. This could represent about Dollars 75m worth of business. The aircraft, which can fly 6,500 nautical miles non-stop at a maximum operating altitude of 51,000 ft, is due to make its first flight in 1996 with the first customer deliveries starting late 1997. BMW Rolls-Royce is developing the BR710 family of engines at a new plant outside Berlin. The joint venture won its first order last September when Gulfstream of the US ordered 200 BR710 engines worth Dollars 500m to power its Gulfstream V corporate jet.</p>

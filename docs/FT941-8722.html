			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Treasury reveals cost of tax rise The government yesterday disclosed that tax rises from April 1995 will cost a family on average earnings more than Pounds 1,000 per year. If reductions in mortgage tax relief are added to the official figures Labour said the total tax rise would be more than Pounds 1,250 a year - the so-called 'tax bombshell' the Conservatives accused Labour of planning during the last election campaign. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'In the interests of honesty and standards the Tories should now put up billboards in every constituency saying the Conservative government is responsible for the Pounds 1,000 plus tax rise.' Confirmation of the new tax increases were contained in a written answer from Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, to Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's Treasury spokesman. Figures show that a married man on average earnings with two children will have to pay Pounds 22.32 more in tax per week in April 1995 than he does now. This amounts to Pounds 1,160 more per year in tax. The Conservative party's credentials as the party of low taxation have already been under attack following the recent publication of figures showing that the government will from April take more in tax from the average family than Labour did. As a result of the 1993 Budgets the total tax paid by a married man on average earnings will rise from Pounds 118.36 to Pounds 130.88 in April, to Pounds 140.68 from April 1995. The change in tax paid since 1979, when Labour was last in office, as a percentage of earnings in direct and indirect taxes, is 35 per cent from April, rising to 36.2 per cent in 1995/96. That compares with 32.2 per cent in 1978-1979. The Treasury yesterday argued that the figures were hypothetical since they had not yet come into force and did not take account of future budgets. It also argued that Labour had ignored the increase in living standards since 1979 which outstripped tax increases. Ms Harman said: 'There is nothing hypothetical about the government's figures since they relate to what has already been put into law. Having failed on tax they cannot claim competence in economic management.' The tax increases come in various forms and at different times over the next few years. From April personal allowances are frozen, the married couple allowance is cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, national insurance goes up and VAT is levied on domestic fuel at 8 per cent. The new 3 per cent insurance premium tax comes into force from October and air passenger tax from November. From April 1995 the full 17.5 per cent is levied on domestic fuel and the married couple allowance is cut by another five per cent to 15 per cent. The government figures showing the increases in tax do not include cuts in mortgage tax relief from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in April, followed by another five per cent cut to 15 per cent the following year. In a parliamentary answer to Ms Harman two weeks ago the Treasury said cuts in mortgage tax relief would cost a typical family with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage, Pounds 4.40 a week from April 1995. Earlier in the day Mr John Smith, Labour leader, renewed his assault on the prime minister's 'back to basics' policy, accusing the government of failing to tell the truth on tax. But Mr John Major insisted at Commons question time that the Conservatives were 'the party that cuts taxes'. Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

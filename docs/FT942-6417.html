			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Telecoms report presented Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, yesterday told telecoms ministers that the liberalisation of telecommunications networks across Europe could be achieved without large injections of public sector finance. Presenting findings of the long-awaited industry report on the future of Europe's telecoms markets, he said discrepancies between member states in areas such as data protection and the remaining constraints on public sector telecoms companies acted as more of a hindrance than scarcity of funding. Ministers decided to press ahead with preparations for arrival of digital television, agreeing to step up research and pave the way for harmonious development across the continent by adopting joint standards. But the tricky question of conditional access - ensuring only viewers who pay for programmes get them - remained unsettled. No decision will be made until September.</p>

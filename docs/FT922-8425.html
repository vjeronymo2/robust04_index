			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Fall in core inflation to 3.8 per cent THE GOVERNMENT revealed a lower than expected figure for core inflation yesterday but this potentially good news for the economy was accompanied by indications of continued weakness in consumer demand. The Central Statistical Office said the index of prices of manufactured products for domestic consumption rose in the year to April by 3.8 per cent. The rise was the lowest recorded for more than four years. But leading retailer Marks and Spencer - whose sales are tracked on a monthly basis by the Treasury - said in its annual results statement that consumer spending had yet to show an upturn. Indications that the removal of political uncertainty after the April 9 election has so far failed to stimulate the economy were reflected in a fall on the London stock market. It ended four successive days in which prices had closed at new records. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares finished at 2,722.4, down 15.4. The inflation figure highlighted the lack of success of many manufacturers to restore profit margins - which have suffered since the recession started around mid-1990. Meanwhile Sir Richard Greenbury, the chairman and chief executive of M and S, said in announcing a 1.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 623.5m that the recession had not ended as far as his company was concerned. Hopes of a sustained recovery later this year are linked to projections about a broad increase in consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of gross domestic product. However, Mr John Major, the prime minister, put a more positive gloss on the economic outlook, emphasising the 'dramatic change' in business and consumer confidence since the Conservatives' general election victory. The inflation figure also contained good news for the government in that ministers believe the strong pressures on manufacturers to cut their prices, together with low wage settlements, will eventually spur increased output. Between March and April, the index of output prices at the wholesale level increased by 0.4 per cent, after a 0.7 per cent increase in March. That pushed the year-on-year rise in the index to 3.8 per cent, after 4.5 per cent in March. The extent of the reduction in the year-on-year figure was partly explained by this year's earlier than usual Budget statement on March 10. The early statement meant the normal Budget-time increases in excise duties for alcohol and tobacco showed up mainly in the March producer-price index number, rather than in April. The index of prices of products excluding food, drink and tobacco is the Treasury's favoured index for core inflation. It rose in the year to April by 2.8 per cent, as opposed to 2.9 per cent in March. Further indications of weak inflationary pressures emerged from the index for factory input prices. It showed a fall of 0.6 per cent last month compared with April 1991. Further figures for inflation - at the retail level - are to be released on Friday. The year-on-year change in the retail prices index last month is expected to be about 4.4 per cent, after 4 per cent in March.

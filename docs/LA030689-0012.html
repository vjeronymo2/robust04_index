			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADICAL PALESTINIAN SAYS HE'LL KILL RUSHDIE  </P> <P> Radical Palestinian guerrilla leader Ahmed Jibril vowed Sunday to kill British  author Salman Rushdie in compliance with the orders of Iran's leader, the  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  </P> <P> Jibril, an ex-Syrian army officer and head of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), said in a statement:  </P> <P> "We in the PFLP-GC will confront this new conspiracy (against Islam) and work  to execute the legal action against Rushdie."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Damascus-based PFLP-GC, asked if the statement represented  a death threat against the Indian-born author, said: "Certainly. This is a  death sentence against Rushdie."  </P> <P> The statement, quoting verses from the Koran, said Rushdie's novel, "The  Satanic Verses," was a conspiracy to defame Islam and had been written at the  behest of "arrogant (Western)" forces.  </P> <P> Iranian clerics, saying the book blasphemes Islam, have offered a $5.2-million  reward for Rushdie's death.  </P> <P> "The satanic media all over the world rallied their resources to promote  Rushdie's book," Jibril's statement said.  </P> <P> The PFLP-GC is part of a Syrian-based radical Palestinian alliance that also  has ties to Libya. It opposes the policies of Palestine Liberation Organization  Chairman Yasser Arafat.  </P> <P> Demonstrations against the book have killed at least 20 people in Pakistan and  India.  </P></p>

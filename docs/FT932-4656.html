			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Klockner write-off plan approved by creditors KLOCKNER-WERKE, the ailing German steel producer, yesterday won overwhelming approval from its creditors for a debt relief scheme, paving the way for the company to write off nearly 50 per cent of its DM2.7bn (Dollars 1.66m) debt. Creditors, dominated by the leading German banks, will receive between 40 and 60 per cent of their claims. Small creditors, owed no more than DM10,000, will be fully reimbursed. The approval also leaves Klockner free to reopen negotiations for the sale of a significant share of its steel assets, a company spokesman said. The company is considering selling at least a 50 per cent stake to an outsider, Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, Klockner's chairman, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper yesterday. The sale of Klockner-Edelstahl, the special steel division, was announced earlier this year pending the success of the debt-relief scheme. The subsidiary is to be sold for a symbolic DM2 to Mr Jurgen Grossmann, its chairman until February 15. Druker, a Frankfurt-based consultancy company, will acquire 25 per cent of the shares. Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest steelmakers, also announced last month that they would lead a European consortium of steel producers to bid for Klockner's cold-rolling mill, the most profitable part of the company. But Mr von Rohr said he would not sell such an important asset without also negotiating the sale of a part of Klockner's hot-rolling mill, an area of the European industry which suffers from severe overcapacity. Any move by Klockner to sell part its core steel assets will be watched with some trepidation by other German steelmakers which have expressed worries at the prospect of the company emerging better able to compete in a market still affected by over-capacity. Under pressure from other steel producers, including German steelmakers, the European commission insisted on significant capacity cuts at Klockner before agreeing to write-off part of its DM175m loan. Under its agreement with the commission, signed last Friday, Klockner will reduce its pig-iron capacity by 33 per cent to 2.4m tonnes per year. The company's crude steel production will fall by 20 per cent to 2.8m while its hot-rolling mill capacity will decrease by 12 per cent to 3.7m tonnes. The company plans to tear down one of its two blast furnaces in Bremen in answer to the EC demand that its production cuts be made irreversible. Creditors will also be entitled, over the next 8 years, to receive a third of the group's distributable profits, including earnings coming from its non-steel divisions, as long as this does not make up more than 50 per cent of the debt they have agreed to cancel. The debt-relief plan is expected to be approved today and tomorrow by the creditors of Klockner's steel subsidiaries, most of whom are the same as those of the holding company.</p>

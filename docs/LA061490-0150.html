			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON PARK;  </P> <P> DUARTE RESIGNS AS BOXING COACH OF ATHLETIC PROGRAM  </P> <P> Former world championship contender Frankie Duarte has resigned as head boxing  coach of the Huntington Park Athletic Club, a city-sponsored boxing program to  keep youths off the streets and out of gangs.  </P> <P> Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly, who helped organize the club, said Duarte  resigned last month to take care of personal business.  </P> <P> Connolly said he hoped Duarte, 35, would return to the position soon.  </P> <P> "We're really going to miss him," Connolly said. "He's made a great  contribution and we want to get him back as soon as possible."  </P> <P> Duarte, a former drug addict and alcoholic, had a relapse before he accepted  the coaching job last year. Connolly said Duarte's resignation was not related  to drug or alcohol abuse. Duarte could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Duarte had his biggest victory in July, 1986, when he won the North American  Boxing Federation bantamweight championship. It capped a comeback from drug and  alcohol addiction that had derailed his career.  </P> <P> Duarte had several championship fights but was never able to capture a major  championship belt. He retired last August after losing a one-sided fight to  Daniel Zaragoza for the World Boxing Council super-bantamweight title.  </P></p>

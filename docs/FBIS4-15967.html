			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 12, BNS -- A tapping facility was found  Monday [11 April] in the premises of the DIENAS BIZNESS (Daily  Business) newspaper in the Press House, Chief Editor Juris  Paiders said.    Paiders had suspicion already earlier that conversations in  his office were being overheard: facts discussed in a narrow  circle became known to others before publication or without  publication.    Independent experts, invited by Paiders to search the rooms,  found phone-tapping equipment in a telephone switchbox.    The experts also showed how conversations in the room can be  heard out in the street.    One of the group told Paiders that the equipment was  installed unprofessionally. But he did not rule out that more  facilities were hidden in the editorial office.    Paiders submitted an application to security service chief  Juris Vectirans and asked to clear out the incident.    Paiders claims that the problem is of great importance to  the  Latvian security because conversations of journalists often  contain information that can be used to blackmail or indict  someone mentioned.</p>

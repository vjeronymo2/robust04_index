			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VENERABLE SHOPPING CART GETS SOUPED UP  </P> <P> You may not have read about it in your high school history book, but more than  50 years ago an Oklahoma grocer named Sylvan Goldman changed the world.  </P> <P> The place was the Humpty Dumpty market in Oklahoma City. The year was 1937. The  invention: the shopping cart. It gets better. Just listen.  </P> <P> "The shopping cart is a complex sociological phenomenon," said Gene von Stein,  vice president of Unarco Commercial Products, the nation's shopping cart giant.  "The shopping cart has totally changed the commerce and culture of America and  the world."  </P> <P> The jury may still be out on that, but the lowly cart does make the supermarket  possible by giving shoppers a vehicle to purchase a week's worth of groceries  in a single trip.  </P> <P> In the past five years, this functional sculpture of wire on wheels has been  the target of innovation -- increasingly electronic, occasionally designed to  assist the consumer, more often an effort to sell more products.  </P> <P> There are anti-theft gadgets and bolt-on baby seats, calculator/billboards and  shopper tracking devices, carts for the kids and electronic tour guides. This  week, they were all on display at the Food Marketing Institute's supermarket  convention in Chicago.  </P> <P> "I don't know that shopping carts are going to get very space-age, but they're  functional and they get a little better all the time," said Norman H. McMillan,  a partner in the Chicago-based retail consulting firm McMillan/Dolittle.  </P> <P> Appropriately enough, Goldman's pioneering pushcart was unveiled 53 years ago  at the very first Supermarket Institute convention, the grandparent of FMI's  annual industry extravaganza.  </P> <P> Before the 1930s, mass general-merchandising stores were unknown and grocers  gave their customers personal service. It was also a time when housewives  shopped more often and bought fewer goods.  </P> <P> When that began to change, von Stein said, Goldman devised hand-carry baskets  that he furnished to customers at his Humpty Dumpty markets in Oklahoma City  and Tulsa.  </P> <P> "Then he saw that shoppers would stop shopping when they got the baskets full,"  von Stein said. "The baskets were too heavy to carry. So he got the idea of  putting the baskets on wheeled frames."  </P> <P> By 1940, the company had developed the nesting shopping cart that can be found  today in most grocery stores.  </P> <P> "The shopping cart has been the one piece of equipment essential to making  self-service shopping a success," von Stein said. "And all of modern consumer  product merchandising is based on the concept of self-service."  </P> <P> In February, 1988, Smart Products Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., sold its first  bolt-on baby seat, a device that fits over the traditional child chair and lets  parents fill a shopping cart with food, not children. The company has sold  20,000.  </P> <P> ADDvantage Marketing offers a calculator that fits over the handle of the cart.  It allows consumers to tally their purchases so they can figure out what's a  better value: 16 ounces of detergent at $2.50 or 12 ounces at $1.75. It also  has a mini-billboard with product advertising that stares up at shoppers for as  long as they're on the premises.  </P> <P> Information Resources Inc. of Chicago offers an interactive video screen that  bolts onto cart handles and can tell shoppers where to find up to 800 items in  the store. In addition, markets that use the product are fitted with infrared  triggers that signal the VideOcart screen as the shopper moves through the  store.  </P> <P> "As you go through the aisles, ads are triggered on the screen, or aisle  specials, or promotional information on new products," said Bill Dupre, a  company spokesman.  </P> <P> Unarco unveiled its latest product this week, a gadget called Promotronics that  fits on the end of the shopping cart and flashes advertising messages at  consumers. It also records how long shoppers spend in the aisles and in front  of certain products -- valuable marketing information, von Stein said.  </P> <P> Some say, however, that shopping-cart innovation hasn't gone far enough -- that  esoteric problems are being solved before basic components are perfected.  </P> <P> Or as McMillan put it: "If anyone could ever figure out how to get the wheels  to turn round and round endlessly, that could be more valuable than all of this  gadgetry.  </P> <P> THE CART THAT CHANGED THE WORLD  </P> <P> Birthdate: 1937  </P> <P> Inventor: Sylvan N. Goldman  </P> <P> Number sold each year: About 1 million  </P> <P> Major manufacturer: Unarco Commercial Products, Oklahoma City  </P> <P> Average price: $70-$120  </P> <P> Theft rate: The average food store loses about 12% a year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- The state-run Chinese  Petroleum Corp. (CPC) said Wednesday [1 Jun] it will step up  investments in Vietnam in tandem with the government's "southern  strategy."    "With the anticipated liberalization of the local oil  market,  the CPC has to go international while trying to consolidate its  local market share," CPC Chairman Chang Tzu-yuan said in a  speech marking the CPC's 48th anniversary. For now, the CPC is  Taiwan's sole oil supplier.    The CPC, along with France-based Total Oil Company, signed a  contract with Vietnamese authorities in February to build a  refinery there, pending the results of a feasibility study on  the construction site, likely environmental impact, and other  factors.    Construction of the refinery is expected to begin soon after  the feasibility study is completed early next year, and the  refinery, with a daily capacity of 130,000 barrels, would begin  commercial operations in 1999.    Some of the oil products produced by the refinery may be  shipped back for local consumption, according to Chang.</p>

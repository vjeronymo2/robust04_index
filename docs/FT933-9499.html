			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Midwest floods recede faster than expected WATER levels are dropping dramatically in some areas along the swollen Mississippi River, but there is still enough pressure on water-logged levees to keep flood-weary residents on edge, AP reports from St Louis. The river at St Louis had fallen 1.3 feet in 24 hours to 43.6 feet by yesterday morning, said Mr Lou Chiodini of the Army Corps of Engineers. That is down from the record crest of 49.4 feet on August 1. The Mississippi had been forecast to drop below flood stage, which is 30 feet at St Louis, by late August or early September. High water pressure remains on the levees that have held back the river for weeks. 'You can breathe a certain sigh of relief but it's not a time to stop being vigilant,' Mr Chiodini said. The National Weather Service said much of the Midwest would be without rain for the next few days, raising hopes that the levees will survive as the water recedes. 'It's looking better,' a weather service spokesman said.</p>

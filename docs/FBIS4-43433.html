			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi by Kai </F> Diekmann and Paul C. Martin; place and date not given: "Mr.  Berlusconi, What Do You Like About Germany?"]    [Text] [BILD] Prime Minister, what should the new Italy  be like?    [Berlusconi] The new Italy will be a happy, more just  country that is in a position to deal with its affairs better.  Italians have an inclination toward the practical and can also  imagine their future. That means they can dream with their eyes  open.    In other words, the new Italy must demonstrate pragmatism in  solving its problems, but at the same time, it cannot lose the  ability to develop utopias and possess visions.    [BILD] Germany is the first country that you are paying an  official visit to.    [Berlusconi] There is, of course, a special relationship  between Italy and Germany. It is a question of deep ties, of  established traditions, mutual contacts, and common cultural  origins that have their roots in Christian values.    Our economic ties are striking proof of that: Ties between  our companies are particularly intensive. Siemens has just  bought 50 percent of "Italtel." There is also a significant  Italian presence in the eastern German laender.    What links us above all is a common, firmly established  belief in ideals and democratic patterns of behavior. That is  how we triumphed over communism and that is what led to the  reunification of Germany. These ideals and patterns of behavior  have bolstered our determination with regard to intolerance,  racism, and totalitarianism.    [BILD] What do you particularly like about Germany?    [Berlusconi] To my mind, the most attractive thing about  Germany is the mixture of the old and the new. A great  classical culture reflected in your exceptional countryside,  your geographical landscapes, and your cultural greatness. At  the same time, some of your cities are modern machines that  produce work, prosperity, as well as science and technology at  the highest possible level.    What has always impressed me about the speeches I have heard  when I visited your country as a businessman or tourist is your  sensitivity regarding the environment. One can see that this  sensitivity has very deep roots.    [BILD] Why have you made neo-fascists ministers in your  government? Reservations are also being voiced about that in  Germany.    [Berlusconi] There are no neo-fascists in my government.  The ministers from the National Alliance have nothing to do  with fascism. It is enough to read their biographies and ideas.  They are firmly anchored in democracy. The party they come  from rejected a nostalgic attitude toward its roots years ago.    [BILD] There are problems with militant right-wing radicals  throughout Europe.    [Berlusconi] Right-wing extremism is a problem that has  nothing to do with the Italian Government. It is a serious  problem and it worries me as well as the German chancellor    It is intolerable that 50 years after the defeat of European  fascists, nationalism, racism, hostility toward foreigners, and  anti-Semitism have appeared once again.    I hope that a new climate in Europe, developed by its  leaders  at the urging of the people, will cause these old ideological  phantoms to disappear; phantoms that have been fed by the  economic and social crises that we have experienced over several  years.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian output cut bolsters aluminium Reports of the first output cut by a Russian aluminium smelter and that a second Australian smelter was to reduce production immediately helped the metal's price move up again yesterday on the London Metal Exchange. Sentiment was also helped by Mr Vladimir Kalchenko, first deputy director of Concern Aluminiy, the producers' association, who told the Reuter news agency in Moscow that the Russian government had ways of forcing reluctant smelters to make cuts. Some analysts and at least one Russian industry official have cast doubt on the republic's ability to live up to its undertaking to help restore the aluminium market to balance by reducing its annual aluminium production by 500,000 tonnes. He also said that the 200,000-tonne Novokunznetsk smelter in Siberia had closed some operations for modernisation and this would trim its annual output by 20,000 tonnes. Reuter also reported that, elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent States, Tajikistan's aluminium smelter said it would shut down completely last night unless it received essential raw materials held up at the border with Uzbekistan, another CIS republic, which claimed that it was owed money for earlier shipments. The Tajik smelter is one of the biggest in the world with an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes. But analysts believe it produced only 280,000 tonnes last year. Laurie Morse in Chicago writes: Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium producer, announced yesterday that it would reduce its primary aluminium output in the US by 100,000 tonnes a year. The cuts follow last week's international trade agreement in Brussels that aims to reduce world aluminium output by at least 1.5m tonnes by year-end in an effort to bolster historically low prices. In June Alcoa slashed US production by 25 per cent, or 268,000 tonnes. The latest cuts, which the company said would be take effect immediately, bring Alcoa's total reductions over the past year to 308,000 tonnes. The reductions will be at Alcoa's Rockdale, Texas, facility, where it has already closed an aluminium rod plant, and at its operations in Wenatchee, Washington, where electric power prices have been increasing.</p>

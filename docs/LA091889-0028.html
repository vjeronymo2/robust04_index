			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JEFFERSON AIRPLANE SPUTTERS, STALLS AND NEVER QUITE SOARS  </P> <P> Even during its best moment Saturday night at the Pacific Amphitheatre, the  Jefferson Airplane inadvertently raised the question of just what it was doing  out of the hangar after all these years.  </P> <P> "Volunteer for anything you like, volunteer for anything you need," Grace Slick  urged as she improvised at the end of the strong, hard-driving rendition of  "Volunteers" that closed an uneven set for the reunited San Francisco band.  </P> <P> Back in the '60s, there was nothing so open-ended about the Airplane's call for  volunteers. The ideological lines were clearly drawn between generations  clashing over drug use, the Vietnam War and changing sexual mores, and the  Jefferson Airplane drew much of its lift and thrust from its role as a musical  banner waver for the new counterculture.  </P> <P> The Airplane's 2 1/2-hour show Saturday included eight new songs that showed a  continued willingness to volunteer in service to such old ideals as  revolutionary change and fear and loathing of conservative political authority.  </P> <P> But neither those nor the older rabble-rousers among the evening's 27 songs  gave the concert the kind of center and focus that the Airplane automatically  could draw upon during the turbulent times (1966-71) in which it originally  flew.  </P> <P> With charged performances, the five veteran Airplane members (augmented by four  other players) might have been able to compensate for changed times. But the  times aren't all that have changed. Slick, who will turn 50 next month,  couldn't approach the vocal clarity and muscularity of her prime in a  performance strewn with missed notes and wobbly control.  </P> <P> Marty Balin, the Airplane's other main voice, was less diminished, but still  sounded brittle at times. With Paul Kantner joining in, the Airplane got  inconsistent results as it tried to recreate its distinctive three-part  harmonies.  </P> <P> Finding a coherent concert structure is admittedly no easy task for a group  with four lead singers and songwriters and a wide range of styles encompassing  folk and blues, psychedelic rock and mainstream pop anthems and ballads.  </P> <P> But the Airplane let much of the show progress in mix-and-match fashion,  leaving potential unities of theme and style unexplored (exceptions were the  hard-rocking ending and a nicely conceived post-intermission folk-blues segment  featuring guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bassist Jack Casady).  </P> <P> For all the lesser-known oldies it worked in, the group omitted its most  famous, most-requested song, the drug anthem, "White Rabbit" (Just saying no  after all these years? Or, more likely, just acknowledging Slick's vocal  limitations).  </P> <P> Befitting a San Francisco psychedelic band, the Airplane, which plays Tuesday  and Wednesday at the Greek Theatre, had an inventive light show featuring  lovely, colored backdrops and five unusual on-stage pillars that served as  giant lighting fixtures.  </P> <P> With some creative spark remaining, the '89 model Airplane doesn't quite belong  in mothballs. But with some misfiring and poorly meshing parts, it fell short  of a fully satisfying recreation of the powerful, soaring ride of long-ago  missions flown in cultural combat.  </P></p>

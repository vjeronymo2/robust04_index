			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / HK market buoyed by reports on China talks: Beijing sends conflicting signals over reforms THE Hong Kong stock market gained sharply yesterday on reports suggesting that China may soften its opposition to talks with Britain about proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, for wider democracy in the colony. The reports, in Chinese newspapers published in Hong Kong, were the first indication that China might drop its call for Mr Patten to withdraw the proposals, published last October, as a precondition for talks. In spite of the reports, which quoted mainland officials, Beijing later denied that it had moderated its opposition to the plans. These cover broadening the electoral franchise in 1995 elections. Following the denials, early trading was hesitant on the Hong Kong stock market today. Separate to the latest reports, China has indicated that it is willing to discuss Hong Kong's political development before Mr Patten's proposals are put to the colony's Legislative Council. The Executive Council, Mr Patten's top advisory body, two weeks ago cleared a bill for submission to the Legislative Council which would give effect to his plans for greater representative democracy in Hong Kong without amendment. But it was understood yesterday that Mr Patten had last week delayed gazetting the bill after Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, requested time to study it. The bill is still expected to be introduced before the end of this month and Legco is likely to debate it at length. Mr Lu is understood to have indicated to Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador in Beijing, an interest in discussing Hong Kong's political development before the bill is published. If talks do begin, Mr Patten and the British government will have to decide whether and how long to defer the introduction into Legco of the governor's plans, or attempt to negotiate with China while Legco debates them. Officials said China had left it to the eleventh hour to suggest talks might be possible. 'They will have to recognise that the process has moved a long way since and that we cannot put everything on hold,' said one. The Hang Seng index yesterday rose 191.29 points, or 3.27 per cent, to end the day at 6,049.44 - the first time the market has closed above 6,000 since November.

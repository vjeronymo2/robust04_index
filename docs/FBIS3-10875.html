The chairs of the two  candidates who did not come to this debate are empty. We thank  the parties and candidates who did understand the need to debate  and openly discuss their plans.    Today we begin the first of three debates with this subject:  economic measures of the next administration during the first  100 days in office.    Here today are Dr. Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes,  presidential candidate of the Authentic Christian Movement  [MAC]; Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate of the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front-Democratic Convergence [FMLN-CD]  coalition; Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena, presidential candidate of the  Christian Democratic Party [PDC]; Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart,  presidential candidate of the National Solidarity Movement  [MSN]; and Roberto Escobar Garcia, presidential candidate of the  National Coalition Party [PCN]. We welcome you and thank you  for responding to Canal Doce Television's invitation to debate  and openly discuss your plans of action. To the two candidates  who are not present here this morning, I hope you will watch the  program and listen to the statements made here today.    The debate will be in three parts. During the first part of  the program, each candidate will have five minutes to present  his economic plan; that is, his economic plan for the first 100  days in office. The speaking order was decided prior to the  program by a drawing. Poll results have no bearing on the order  of the speakers. During the second and third parts of the  program, the candidates will discuss and comment on the programs  presented. We invite listeners to call the studio -- the  telephone number is 88-0309; it will be appearing on your screen  -- and ask any question you may have for the candidates.    Our first speaker will be FMLN-CD presidential candidate  Ruben Zamora.    I do have one question for all the candidates. If you were  to become president of the Republic, what economic measures  would you implement during your first 100 days in office? How  will you confront the country's economic problems. The voters  believe that the country's biggest problems continue to be  unemployment, inflation, and poverty, among others. You have  five minutes to answer. [39-second break in reception]    [Zamora] ....that we sit down and draft a basic agenda for  the country's economic development, establish what is and what  will be the framework of this agreement, and decide on basic  policies for investment, employment, and wages in El Salvador.    Second, and based on this agreement among the various  sectors, I suggest a renegotiation of the conditions of the  foreign debt. Based on the new boost we will give the country, I  will approach the U.S. Government, the World Bank, and the IMF  to discuss the terms of our foreign debt to ensure that our  domestic social debt will not continue to grow. I will also  talk to the U.S. Government about the situation of our fellow  countrymen in the United States and ask that they not be  declared illegal. I will attempt to show that my government  recognizes the role of foreign countries, but I will also make  it known that Salvadorans will make the final decisions.    The third main topic we will broach will be financial  policy.  I will not devaluate our currency, but I will meet with the  Central American presidents [eight-second break in reception]  and too indiscriminate for our national production. I will not  nationalize banks. Banks will continue to remain in private  hands, but we will immediately do two things: First, we will  reduce the current difference between interest rates paid for  assets and those charged for liabilities. The difference is too  great and does not contribute to the reactivation of the  economy. Second, we are going to confront and immediately solve  the agrarian debt problem.    The fourth main measure to be implemented in the first 100  days in office is directed at unemployment. We are talking  about [four-second break in reception] productive investment,  especially for small and midsize producers, which are the two  sectors that create the most jobs. We must also encourage  foreign investment. For the past year I have been working on  this with a group of U.S. investors who want to invest in our  country. We are going to implement these types of actions. We  are also going to ensure that state funds deposited in private  banks will be used to promote development and job creation. That  is the fourth measure I would implement.    The fifth measure is to confront this government's  shortcomings in terms of the peace plans. We will solve the  land problem that has not been solved. We will compensate  former soldiers and national policemen with programs for their  reintegration into the country's economic life. We are going to  handle the problems faced by the war disabled from both sides.  We will allocate the necessary funds to develop the institution  that has been created for them.    Those are the first and most important measures we will  adopt. In sum, I will prove during my first few months in office  that we are going to make changes, but changes that reflect an  intelligent combination of modifications and continuity.    [Funes] Dr. Zamora, you still have a minute. You have  presented a concise plan for the first 100 days, but I would  like to ask you another question. There is a real problem, the  root of which is governing. The economic measures to be  implemented in those first days also calls for a process of  agreement among the various sectors, particularly the economic  sectors. How will you accomplish this? You represent a  coalition of leftist parties. One of the biggest doubts the  various sectors have is whether the left is capable of achieving  a modicum of understanding among the different groups in light  of the country's current situation and whether the left is  capable of governing.    [Zamora] If there was ever anyone in this country who worked  toward an understanding [26-second break in reception].  [passage omitted]    [Funes] Thank you very much. According to the drawing,  Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart, National Solidarity Movement [MSN]  candidate, is next.    [Rodriguez] The MSN proposes several measures. The first is  related to the structural adjustment program. We would request  a meeting with the IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank  [IDB] to adopt measures related to the problems caused by our  country's structural adjustment. We are worried, because we  know there are private meetings going on now between the World  Bank, IDB, IMF, and the government to discuss a possible  devaluation that would be implemented after the elections.    Second, we would seek international cooperation, especially  for land transfer projects. We would seek international  cooperation at a donors meeting to expedite the obtainment of  financial resources of approximately $275 million, which are  required to comply with this part of the peace agreements.    Third, we would seek a consolidation of budgets; that is,  the  merger of regular and special budgets under the sole control of  the Finance Ministry instead of maintaining separate budgets, as  is currently being done, because this could lead to corruption,  inefficiency, or a mishandling of the nation's money.    Fourth are tax collection and fiscal evasion. We have  noticed the Chamber of Commerce's statements regarding  contraband. We would try to improve the fiscal collection  mechanisms and enforce the law against fiscal evasion. This is  pursuant to the call by the Salvadoran Chamber of Commerce and  Industries to apply severe corrective measures to prevent  contraband and apply the full force of the law against any  official involved in contraband in our country. We all know  there is much contraband that is not being combated at custom  posts and border areas, because the government is not firmly  committed to doing so.    Fifth, we would review interest rates; that is, review the  financial system's interest rates to ensure they match the  inflation rates which supposedly exist in our country and which  are between 9 and 12 percent. The gap between active and  passive rates is too wide, and we think they must have a  coherent relationship with the national inflation rate.    In international trade, we will adopt a mechanism to promote  the union of private enterprise and unions to take advantage of  the SGP [Generalized System of Preferences] and the Caribbean  Basin Initiative regarding investments and technology in order  to prepare our country for achieving a future competitiveness  within the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. This  means we must strengthen El Salvador's international negotiation  team with international law experts who can solve international  legal problems concerning NAFTA's adoption and implementation.  One of our priorities will obviously be to expedite the  economic integration process at the regional level, particularly  with the Central American economic market.    Another important measure for us is that the investment of  family remittances should become a productive investment; in  other words, we will design a financial system program that  encourages the beneficiaries of family remittances to invest in  the production sector, in mini and small enterprises, to help  generate riches and distribute the economic surplus. We will  establish consortiums between mini and small businessmen and big  businessmen so these two sectors can integrate, through an  exposure to business dynamism, to improve production and exports.    [Funes] Excuse me, Doctor. Only 30 seconds more, please.    [Rodriguez] We will strive to make a long-term strategic  investment with the IDB and the World Bank for the recovery of  the country's hydrographic basins, the reconversion of its  industrial sector, the protection of its ecology, and the  maintenance of its aquiferous strata. I conclude here, although  three or four measures are still pending. I think we can  discuss them later in the debate.    [Funes] Dr. Roberto Escobar Garcia, presidential candidate  of the PCN [National Conciliation Party]. You have five minutes  to outline what would be the first measures you would take. We  are also defining a specific time for the adoption of decisions  and for the implementation of these measures--we mean emergency  measures--during the first 100 days in government. If you are  elected, what would you do in the economic sector?    [Escobar Garcia] Thank you for the invitation, Mauricio. I  believe the importance of this program derives from the ideas  and specific measures we may provide to counter urgent problems,  leaving middle- and long-term problems for a later date.    In this regard, we cannot concentrate on social and age  composition, employment, consumer population, but we must look  to the working public, because we all know work is a very  serious problem. We are dealing here with a very important and  delicate issue; that is why I met with my economic team led by  my partner on the ticket, Mr. Marquesin, and we have discussed  certain measures divided into three large groups.    The first measure refers to the recovery of the agriculture  sector; the second refers to industrial recovery, the third to  massive public works. Regarding the recovery of the agriculture  sector, we believe we can start working fast on the fiber issue,  such as cotton, [word indistinct], and sisal. We can also begin  working on intensive cattle raising, particularly in the  northeastern part of the country, and nontraditional products,  particularly those being sold to the United States, such as  watermelon and melon. We can also perhaps work on marine  products.    Regarding industrial recovery, we will undoubtedly devote  our  attention to assembly plants, because they require smaller  investments; in addition, the training of assembly plant workers  is not really difficult. Furthermore, we will work to export  those products we are more capable of exporting, such as  pharmaceuticals and chemicals, which, at this time, rank third  among Salvadoran exports. Furthermore, in this area we will  give special attention to the metalworking industry, which is  even producing spare parts for national consumption.    Regarding the area of massive public works, we must pay  immediate attention to roads, airport expansions, pier  expansions, and large-scale constructions of schools. We  believe these measures can be perfectly implemented in the first  100 days of government. Even though their effects may not be  perceived immediately, the measures taken in a timely fashion  upon assuming the government and even before would make it  possible to resolve the immediate problem I stated at the  beginning. [sentence as heard] The medium- and long- term  measures will come later.    [Funes] Thank you, Doctor. To conclude this first round,  Christian Democratic Party candidate Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena will  now speak.    [Chavez Mena] Thanks, Mauricio. Congratulations on taking  this initiative. We deplore the absence of Armando Calderon Sol,  ARENA's [Nationalist Republican Alliance] official candidate. We  think he is wrong to refuse to participate in the debate with  the other candidates so the people can have a better idea of our  respective views.    We believe there are three important aspects: Crime, lack of  jobs, and price policy. I will split this five minutes into  three blocks. First, measures to ensure governability. This is  essential. We are convinced we are the only ones who can give  this country a framework of governability, that we are the only  ones capable of leading and carrying out a political and  economic project according to the reality and the correlation of  existing forces.    As soon as it is known we were the elected candidates for  president and vice president, we intended to create a climate of  confidence, which is essential for the business sector. Our  model of social and market economy rests on entrepreneurs, who  are the dynamic motor of economic activities. They must have the  psychological element of confidence and security. Therefore, our  first action will be to meet with the most representative  entrepreneurial sectors to set the rules of the economic game  and to say very clearly that our government will befriend  entrepreneurs, and is willing to create, expand, and stimulate  business. Then, within this concept of participation, we will  immediately stimulate the creation of a national congress with  delegates from the business and labor sectors as well as experts  to discuss the economic strategy to be implemented during our  government.    Third, we will reactivate the economic reorganization forum  -- this is essential in fulfilling the peace agreements -- to  present a national emergency plan for attaining a social truce  in six months, during which time we will present our initiative  to freeze the price of staples, establish a salary policy  consistent with stability and the prevailing fiscal situation,  and determine the measures to be immediately taken to combat  poverty and the problems derived from structure adjustments. In  addition, we intend to create a National Agricultural and  Livestock Council to stimulate agriculture with the direct  participation of the country's various agricultural sectors so  they can define, stimulate, and supervise those policies.    Given the importance of Central American integration, it is  necessary to create a commission to start negotiating Central  American integration. Also, it is necessary to create a National  Women's Association to incorporate women more effectively into  productive activities. Mini-, small-, and medium-size  enterprises, as well as agricultural sectors, will immediately  be incorporated into the state institutions directly linked to  their respective sectors. A very important criterion will be the  gradual application of economic policies and the search for a  consensus before establishing these economic policies.    Finally, we think it is very important to reach a basic  political agreement among the country's political forces as a  part of governability so this governability can allow for the  stability and the security that the state needs.    The second block would consists of measures to begin  resolving the most pressing economic problems. The first block  deals with governability of the economy. Now for the second  block. First, the immediate reactivation of the country's  hospitals network. Essentially, this is a social subject, but,  given its relationship to economic problems and the country's  human problem, the existing hospitals and health centers network  must be reactivated.    Second, we intend to create approximately 120,000 jobs in  six  months through productive basic infrastructure projects to be  financed with the $465 million currently available, of which  only 25 percent has been disbursed. We have appointed a group of  experts so these projects, which are essentially productive and  focused on the areas in conflict and where the most serious  poverty exists, can be initiated immediately. We will be  prepared to disburse at least $200 million. The government has  been inept in handling these disbursements.    On the other hand, we plan to draft the 1995 budget, we  plan to present a foreign cooperation policy on the subjects of  ecology, drugs, migration, the problem of disbursements for  production activities and the case of (?residents) in El  Salvador. We propose to eliminate the value added tax on staple  products, elements necessary for production, and raw material  necessary for the pharmaceutical and other similar industries.  [passage omitted]    [Escobar Garcia] We insist on the agricultural sector's  recovery because, based on the government's experience in this  area, we know it can be reactivated quickly. For example, when  we talk about fiber and cotton, we are talking about a product  produced the same year; in other words, foreign exchanges  obtained with cotton exports are received immediately.  Naturally, there will be some questions about the relation  between cotton and the environment, but that depends on  production techniques and the number of manzanas used in El  Salvador for this activity.    Therefore, when we talk about the recovery of the  agricultural and livestock sector, we are talking about the  country's northeastern region, which has been quite affected.  During our visits to that area, Ocicala, Sesori, and other areas  affected by the conflict, we have seen interest and it is  possible to quickly develop the cattle industry almost  immediately. Right now, when we tour those areas and review  agricultural activities, we realize the great efforts that are  being made. Therefore, it is just a matter of giving the sector  the encouragement and incentives it needs. We are also working  on some nontraditional products. Although some Fusades  [Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development]  programs have not been successful, we have gained some  experience in exporting nontraditional products.    As you can see, all these measures focus on sectors that are  currently facing more difficulties, but which are capable of  recovering in a short period of time, as I just said. This  group, of course, includes the reformed sector. The  configuration of landownership has changed, and consequently we  must pay more attention to cooperatives and [word indistinct].  The cooperatives problem, which are now facing a very difficult  financial situation, could be resolved or eased through special  plans.    As for the political aspect of your question -- criticism  about the concentration of wealth -- I would like to say that if  we analyze policies that existed 20 or 30 years ago, those  policies could seem inadequate today even though they were  correct at that time. Therefore, we can say with absolute  certainty that during its government, the PCN achieved  significant economic growth, social development, and to some  degree paved the road for the political development we now have.  These criticisms are groundless and seem to respond more to  political interests than to real situations that clearly and  specifically belong to the past. [passage omitted]    [Funes] We have a question for Rodriguez. You mentioned tax  evasion and you proposed treating it as a crime. Specifically,  how could this practice be eliminated; what specific measures  would you implement during the first 100 days of your government  to eradicate the problem of tax evasion in order to collect more  revenues for the state? Would you be willing to use 10 percent  of the taxes for the renovation of jails and in that way reduce  crime?    [Rodriguez] We believe guaranteeing compliance with our laws  is a matter of political willingness. We believe it is possible  to obtain additional income for the state through more  efficient, productive, technical controls of the Salvadoran  general tax system. For example, we believe there is a shortage  of personnel and real capacity to handle the value added tax,  VAT.    We have also said we share the idea that the VAT should be  eliminated from foods, staples, electricity, and potable water.  We believe an adequate VAT on luxury items could substantially  increase fiscal revenues, thereby reducing the impact on  products that are basic for the majority of Salvadorans. We  believe it is possible to improve tax collection through state  reforms, better training, human development, and technology.  There are many ways to improve it. We believe this is something  we must do immediately after assuming the government. [passage  omitted]    [Funes] Colonel, you were demobilized and know the armed  institution very well. I am surprised that your first 100-day  program does not mention measures guaranteeing the productive  reinsertion of demobilized military personnel, taking into  account the current situation. I suppose the television viewer  has referred to the fundamental issue, which has been raised  recently, on compensation payments to demobilized Armed Forces  members and guaranteeing their productive reinsertion.  Specifically: What do you offer demobilized Armed Forces'  personnel and how can you guarantee the productive reinsertion  of these men, who only fought during the war, therefore they  have no production capacity?    [Escobar] Thank you Mauricio, and I also thank the person  who  posed this question because it gives me the opportunity to refer  to a sector that is linked to my own feelings without taking  into account the patriotic role they played during the recently  concluded conflict. This is certainly one of the most difficult  issues to deal with, as is being observed in the very  application of the reinsertion of both sides' former combatants.  This is a decision that does not solely depend on the  government; it also depends on the will of the people who would  benefit from these measures. In this regard, the programs the  government established are currently being implemented. I do not  know if they are being implemented speedily or broadly enough  but they have already been set up. Once I take office, however,  the reinsertion program's basic points would have to be totally  reviewed. Numberless criticisms and many commentaries have been  made on this subject, therefore the basic points would have to  be reviewed to determine the people who are going to be  reinserted and in what areas.    I had not thought of this issue as an emergency measure. As  I  said at the beginning of my participation, I tried to narrow my  comments down to what you had specifically requested, immediate  measures, that is shock [preceding word in English] measures. In  reality, the demobilized program should continue within the  government, but is not necessarily a shock program that will  reactivate the economy and partially resolve the unemployment  problem. I definitely did not take or we did not take this issue  into account as part of the immediate measures to be  implemented. This program must be continued; it must be reviewed  and assessed if the basic reinsertion budget and conditions  respond to the reality of this specific issue. I would like to  make it very clear that we have not excluded the demobilized  from our priorities, rather it is because these programs, in our  opinion, do not correspond to the government's first 100 days.    [Funes] Thank you very. Now Mr. Chavez Mena, here are  several  questions, however, I will ask you to be brief as we are short  on time. Here is a question. I imagine it is from a businessman.  As one of the emergency measures to be implemented in the first  100 days of your government, you have proposed price controls on  basic products. Doesn't price control recall the ghost of state  intervention that plunged the Christian Democratic government  during Napoleon Duarte's administration to discredit and defeat?  How do you intend to implement this price control, and won't  this price control discourage investment?    [Chavez] We have not talked about price control. We have  talked about price freezing though...[pauses] only of the family  basket food products. This is to be combined with a salary  policy with economic measures to combat poverty, of course.  Where would this measure be discussed? This would be discussed  precisely at a forum, as I stated previously.    I am glad this question came up as it gives me the  opportunity to explain matters. It is precisely through market  mechanisms and a six-month period, which we call a social truce,  that we will implement this price freezing process. This goes  hand in hand with removing the VAT from family basket food  products. This measure is precisely to reduce the increase  generated by the VAT to family basket food products' costs and  prices. Therefore, we believe it is very important to implement  this price freeze, as the result of a consensus, as was done  with great success in Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina, and recently  in Chile with regard to taxes. This can be achieved by making a  difference; that is freezing prices, establishing a salary  policy, establishing certain measures by consensus as a result  of a social accord, a social agreement. This is what I am  referring to.    This is a matter of justice; this is a matter that responds  to an economic need and truly responds to the people's feelings.  The people in this country cannot support the cost of living. A  time gap, a social truce must be implement. This is the reason  for the price freeze.    I would also like to take this opportunity to make a brief  comment on the ability to govern issue addressed to me. We  insist that a leftist government, from former guerrillas in this  country, would not make the nation governable nor stable.    It would have problems owing to the mistrust the business  sector may feel; something that would generate even greater  difficulties and contribute to a level of regional instability.  In this respect, we feel the country is not prepared from a  historic and political standpoint to have a government headed by  the FMLN-CD. As for the business PARE [expansion unknown] Dr.  Zamora referred to, it was essentially a political PARE. The PDC  defended the country's economic system; it defended the economic  system. It began a process of democratization. In addition, it  began a process of international cooperation.    I want to state it in this manner because the ability to  govern topic is essential, and we must say clearly it. There is  a lot of mistrust. We are proposing trust, that is, generating a  climate of trust within the business sector. We have talked to  them. My relations with business sectors are very good. We have  clearly outlined our criteria for gradual steps and consensus,  or rather the search for consensus prior to adopting major  economic policies instead of adopting them without  consultations. In this respect, I want to refer to Mr.  Rodriguez' remark, who seems to have been truly swayed by the  ads. We had a debate prior to all those economic measures. There  really was political motivation behind the ads of a group of  politicized businessmen who entrenched themselves and joined the  ARENA ranks. In addition, we had a war, and the economy was  constantly being sabotaged. The economic and electricity  infrastructure was damaged, and this really caused an economic  problem that was extremely delicate. We have to put ourselves in  that historic situation. In conclusion and in thinking of the  future, what we have to have is, that in order to be able to  govern, to be able to implement a political program, we need to  have a political program. For one reason or another, the Pope  correctly said that neoliberalism has been a failure wherever it  has been implemented. In Brazil with Collor de Mello, in  Honduras, in Costa Rica, where there were problems because of  neoliberalism, in Venezuela,....    [Funes interrupting] Allow me to interrupt you, but we have  a  time limitation, and every candidate has four minutes.    [Chavez] I just want to conclude by saying real socialism  has  disappeared. The ability to govern problem is essential, and I  wanted to refer to it. [passage omitted]</p>

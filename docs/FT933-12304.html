			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Prolific comes in from the heat - Unit trusts / A fund which survived turbulence to reach calm waters FEW COMPANIES can claim historical links with John Maynard Keynes but Prolific is one. Keynes, who died in 1946, worked as a fund manager for Provincial, the privately-run insurance company established in the 1900s. Provincial was the parent company of Prolific, the unit trust subsidiary which it set up in 1969. Prolific was as good as its name, and had become the UK's 15th-largest unit trust group by the late 1980s. But its growth brought it into collision with its parent and, after a period of rebellion, it finally demerged from Provincial in an acrimonious split. After trying to stand on its own feet, the need for capital to finance an expansion of the business led to its purchase by Hafnia, the Danish financial services conglomerate which was broken up last year after becoming insolvent. Michael Vogel, fund manager of the High Income fund - one of the best performers in the Prolific stable - acknowledges that the company has been through torrid times. But it now appears to be back on a more even keel after its purchase last year by Scottish Provident, the mutual life insurer, which has left the unit trust and investment management part of Prolific as a stand-alone business. This period of turmoil has not helped to achieve stable performance but the fund, which had a weak year in 1990, seems to have overcome these problems in the past 12 months. The High Income fund was launched in 1974 and, with more than Pounds 350m under management, it is one of the largest in the UK equity income sector. It is sixth in terms of performance in the 10 years to July 1, according to Finstat, and has appeared consistently as one of the 20 top-performing funds since then (with the exception of the year to July 1, when it was ranked 28 out of 112 funds.) The fund has only had two managers. Andrew Cherniavsky took it through its first 14 years and Vogel, who had been with M &amp; G unit trusts, took over five years ago. Its emphasis is on total return by trying to achieve capital growth while providing real growth in income. Vogel is proud of the fund's record of never having cut its distribution, and says the average annual dividend growth has been 15 per cent since its launch. This commitment to an increasing dividend helps to account for the lack of resemblance of the fund's portfolio to traditional high-yielding funds. Instead of having a large holding of utilities or other high-yielding stocks, the fund is concentrated in 20 companies. These have been selected for their capacity to sustain dividend growth over a long period of time, rather than a high yield. Kalon, the paint company, is a good example. It has a yield of 2.7 per cent but its dividend growth has been 40 per cent for the past two years. 'We don't buy into high-yielding stocks which then cut the dividend,' says Vogel. The largest holdings are in Siebe, the instruments and controls manufacturer which has a yield of only 2.7 per cent; BTP, the chemical company; Shell, the oil giant: and BAT Industries, the tobacco conglomerate. The 20 holdings account for just under 60 per cent of High Income while 15 per cent is invested in high-yielding convertibles and preference shares. By tradition the fund has had a heavy weighting in small to medium size companies in order to push up growth. Around 40 per cent is invested in companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 100-500m and a further 8 per cent is held in smaller companies, with the balance in FT-SE 100 companies. The drawback is that the smaller companies tend to fare badly in times of recession as investors flock to the relative safety of the blue chip companies. High Income was hit heavily after the 1987 crash and performance dipped again in 1990/91 as the recession took its toll on its core holdings. 'We did sit down more than once after the crash and asked ourselves whether our theory was flawed, but we concluded that quality will come through,' says Vogel. He is now glad to have kept his nerve by retaining his core holdings, such as T. Cowie, the vehicle finance company which bounced back from a low of 28p to 245p; Kalon, which fell to 33p and is now 155p; and London Forfaiting, the specialist trade finance house: its price price dropped to 40p and is now 215p. To balance the concentration on medium-size stocks, the fund has a relatively high overseas exposure through its investment in UK-quoted companies with a high proportion of overseas earnings, such as Siebe. 'This is a defensive position because we think that, over time, sterling will decline and the UK economy will be weaker than the average Western economy,' says Vogel. 'It does mean, though, that in times when the pound is strong, the fund underperforms.' Overall, 60-65 per cent of the earnings of the companies in the fund are from overseas, some 10 per cent above the average for the market. How can Vogel tell which companies will maintain dividend growth? He uses some brokers but, in the main, 'we find our dividend growth companies from the management of the companies we have cultivated over a number of years.' Despite High Income's commitment to dividend growth, what of those investors who need a high income to live off? The yield on High Income is 3.9 per cent, which is lower than the average income unit trust and lower, too, than the yield on the FT-SE 100 of just over 4 per cent. (The graph does not include re-invested income and, therefore, under-represents the fund performance). Vogel says that for the sacrifice of a low yield in the first few years, the dividend growth will more than make up the shortfall. He argues that this is a fund for the long-term investor wanting a steady stream of increasing income combined with capital growth. Charges The initial charge on the units is 5.25 per cent and the bid-offer spread on July 21 was 6 per cent. The annual mangement fee is 1 per cent and the minimum investment is Pounds 250. The minimum monthly investment into the savings scheme is Pounds 50. High Income qualifies for full Pep status; there are no extra charges for the Pep.</p>

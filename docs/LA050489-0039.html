			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SEEKS WAYS TO WIN RACE FOR HIGHLY DEFINED TV  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is launching a fast-track effort to come up with  measures that can help propel the United States into the race to produce  high-definition television -- possibly including relaxation of federal  antitrust laws and a new research and development tax credit.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said Wednesday that a new interagency task force headed by  Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher is exploring these and other options,  although it has not yet decided which of them to endorse or even whether the  government should act.  </P> <P> The Administration is concerned because high-definition TV, which offers  viewers a television picture that has the clarity of motion-picture film, is  likely to dominate the television market of the future. Yet Japan has taken the  lead in developing it, while U.S. firms have stayed out of the race.  </P> <P> Sources said that Mosbacher has begun consulting informally with U.S.  electronics and telecommunications firms on the new technology and is scheduled  to meet with industry representatives next Wednesday.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said that the proposals the task force is considering so far  would be limited to development of high-definition television -- or HDTV as it  is commonly called. But they said that some proposals -- such as relaxing the  antitrust laws so that U.S. firms could launch joint production and  manufacturing efforts -- could have broader application.  </P> <P> Mosbacher has said several times that he believes the time is ripe to propose  such changes. Congress is deeply concerned about the ability of U.S. firms to  compete internationally. And the public mood on antitrust issues has changed as  well.  </P> <P> The officials said Wednesday that the Administration may seek to make its  proposal to cut capital gains taxes a part of any HDTV package. Mosbacher  believes that a reduction in capital gains taxes is necessary to help high-tech  firms raise the capital they need.  </P> <P> The Administration's efforts come as the industry, too, has begun exploring  ways to catch up with the Japanese. The American Electronics Assn. has hired a  private consulting group to draft a plan for U.S. entry into the field and  plans to unveil it to Congress next week.  </P> <P> Still, experts warn that the entry of the United States into the market is far  from assured. Critics already have begun questioning whether it is even  realistic for U.S. firms to seek to develop HDTV technology on their own, given  the Japanese lead in the field.  </P> <P> Commerce Department officials said that Mosbacher hopes to fashion any new  Administration HDTV package on the basis of what the U.S. industry itself  believes will be feasible in the next several years. At this point, they said,  that still is unclear.  </P> <P> They said that Mosbacher himself still has not decided whether the group should  recommend a relaxation of antitrust laws or any of the other options now on the  table. They said that the secretary especially wants to "remove any  impediments" that the government is imposing.  </P> <P> Under any such plan, relaxation of the federal antitrust laws would be  necessary only to enable companies to cooperate in the production and  manufacture of HDTV products. Joint efforts for research and development  already are permitted under federal law.  </P> <P> Another possible measure being considered, restoration of the tax credit for  research and development, would bring back a tax incentive that Congress  enacted in the early 1980s but later repealed.  </P> <P> The United States already is providing seed money for research and development  on HDTV. In early March, 87 high-technology firms submitted applications for  $30 million in Defense Department grants. The Pentagon is interested in HDTV  for military applications.  </P> <P> The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute issued a study recently that  predicted that unless the United States moves aggressively into the new  technology, it could lose more than 2 million jobs a year and suffer a $225  billion trade deficit in electronics by 2010.  </P> <P> Japan expects to have an HDTV system in full operation by the mid-1990s.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LINCOLN S&amp;L'S PARENT WINS RULING; CREDITORS HOPEFUL  </P> <P> A federal judge in Phoenix denied government motions Friday to throw out the  bankruptcy petitions of 11 subsidiaries of insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan, keeping alive the hopes of creditors that they may get back a portion of  the $363.1 million owed them.  </P> <P> The decision, together with other rulings and comments by U.S. District Judge  Richard M. Bilby, was a "big victory" for Lincoln's bankrupt parent firm,  American Continental Corp., said Brad Boland, a company spokesman.  </P> <P> Both sides had acknowledged previously that Friday's hearing was a key one in  the legal battle between American Continental, which filed for bankruptcy  protection on April 13, and federal regulators, who seized Irvine-based Lincoln  on April 14. The collapse of Lincoln could ultimately cost taxpayers $2.5  billion, making it the largest S&amp;L failure ever.  </P> <P> Had the motions been granted, regulators would have had a free hand in dealing  with the 11 subsidiaries, which hold most of Lincoln's assets, and American  Continental's hopes for reorganizing itself would have been dashed.  </P> <P> Kathleen Wood, a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. staff lawyer assigned to the  subsidiaries, said the denial of the motion will inconvenience rather than  jeopardize the agency's efforts.  </P> <P> "The subsidiary cases are going forward," she said. "The ruling will not affect  what we do so much as hinder us in doing it."  </P> <P> One obstacle to the FDIC's effort Friday was a motion filed Monday by the  creditors committee, including about 22,000 holders of nearly $200 million in  American Continental bonds, to consolidate the bankruptcies of the  subsidiaries, as well as the receivership of Lincoln, into the American  Continental bankruptcy.  </P> <P> A committee lawyer, Donald Gaffney of Phoenix, argued that a racketeering suit  brought by federal regulators two weeks ago alleges that the parent and all its  subsidiaries constituted one enterprise.  </P> <P> "Someone somewhere has to deal with the whole ball of wax," the judge said.  </P> <P> In a folksy but direct manner, Bilby told a courtroom packed with nearly 100  lawyers and government agents that he wants American Continental, the FDIC and  the creditors committee to start negotiating to settle the bankruptcy cases.  </P> <P> Steve Webb, a free-lance writer in Phoenix, contributed to this report.  </P></p>

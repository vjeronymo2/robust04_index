			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / International Company News: ACG set to create a global footprint - General Motors' components business is entering a new era General Motors' vast automotive components business has been turned into a separate entity with greater autonomy and a brief to seek business outside the GM group as aggressively as possible. To talk of a new era is not over-stating the case. If the company - ACG Worldwide - has its way, dependence on GM's North American vehicle assembly operations will have been reduced to little more than 45 per cent by the end of the decade from 85 per cent at the start of the 1990s. By then, ACG intends to have created a 'global footprint' of component manufacturing and joint venture plants, capable of supplying any other vehicle maker with components systems wherever they might choose to set up a vehicle assembly plant. Despite substantial job cuts since the late 1980s, ACG still employs 178,000 people worldwide, operates 180 manufacturing plants in 23 countries and has 13 technical centres and proving grounds. Sales last year topped Dollars 25bn. Given a business base of this magnitude, the financial implications for rival motor components companies could be daunting should ACG manage to meet its business goals. ACG is more than twice as big as its largest rival component groups, such as Robert Bosch of Germany and Japan's Nippondenso. Whereas most competitors concentrate on specific areas, ACG's six divisions - reduced from 13 in the mid-1980s - embrace all vehicle the key component systems. Around 27 per cent or almost Dollars 7bn of last year's turnover was earned from customers outside GM's North American Operations (NAO). Given that ACG has no intention of yielding up any GM business, the planned sales ratio targets imply a more than tripling of non-NAO sales to Dollars 22bn, at current prices, says Mr JT Battenberg III, ACG president. Such ambitions are likely to be regarded with some scepticism by major European and Japanese components groups. Many of them have been moving as fast as ACG to cut costs and raise productivity - a few much faster. And they can point to a lacklustre past performance for many of GM's components operations. Yet based on contracts signed or pending, an interim target of 30 per cent non-NAO sales by 1996 now looks certain to be exceeded. The non-NAO business is not wholly non-GM. It includes unquantified sales to Opel, GM's German cars division, and other GM subsidiaries. But Mr Battenberg insists that, in the wake of the 'purchasing revolution' instituted at GM by its controversial former purchasing director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, ACG is having to fight for the business like anyone else. Of Dollars 900m in non-NAO business secured in the past year or so, only Dollars 56m is acknowledged to have come from Opel. ACG maintains that a number of factors are running in its favour - although they should serve to increase the size of the cake for rivals, too. Not least is Mr Battenberg's contention that the components business is growing at twice the rate of vehicle sales. 'More customers want power steering, brakes, catalysts, on-board diagnostics; there are increasing legislative demands, in the realms of environment and safety, which will also increase vehicle sophistication and thus component content. 'Many of the growing areas are where we're particularly good - the market's going our way,' he declares. ACG's specific forecasts for the period to 2000 appear startling. It projects 5 per cent annual growth for Europe's vehicles market - but 7 to 10 per cent for components. It projects 4 per cent annual vehicle growth in the Asia Pacific region and 6 per cent in Latin America - but 10 to 15 per cent growth in each for components. Shorter car and truck replacement cycles and market fragmentation - typified by four-wheel-drives, MPVs (multi-passenger vehicles) and the return of the sports car - are increasing the volume and variety of demand. The vehicle industry has also become global and requires globally- capable first tier suppliers - another point mostly to ACG's advantage. ACG can be global partners with pretty well everyone, says Mr Battenberg. 'As Mercedes, for example, moves into the US, Mexico and Eastern Europe, we have already got components manufacturing bases lined up wherever they are moving.' Only last week ACG secured the contract to supply the dashboard module, wiring harness and other components for the leisure four-wheel-drive vehicle Mercedes is to start producing in Alabama in 1998. Mr Ned McLurg, a GM vice-president and general manager of the newly-formed AC Delco Systems division, also stresses the substantial business his division has won with Toyota. Where GM has had clear success is in forging individual divisions into a coherent corporate identity. Individually the names within the new ACG empire are well known: Delco Chassis, Saginaw (steering systems), Harrison (thermal management systems), Packard Electric, Inland Fisher Guidse and AC Delco Systems, newly created by combining AC Rochester (engine management) and Delco Remy (electrical energy storage and conversion). Additionally, two other entities, ACG Europe and ACG Asia Pacific, are charged with finding non-NAO business. But in the outside world they have tended to trip over each other, duplicating contacts with non-GM companies and failing to capitalise on poolable assets. This, too, Mr Battenberg aims to redress. He is the first to acknowledge that ACG's road ahead is rough. Vehicles makers require sharp reductions in costs both from themselves and their suppliers. And while ACG's precise financial performance is buried within GM's consolidated accounts, it has been struggling to emerge from two years of losses in the early 1990s. To that end, some Dollars 3.5bn worth of non-core businesses are being shed. Between 1991 and last year, hourly paid employment fell from 160,000 to 147,000, at the same time as turnover rose from Dollars 21.8bn to Dollars 25.1bn. By the end of this year, costs will have been reduced by some Dollars 4.5bn and 12 plants closed. ACG admits to a turnround in earnings before interest and tax of nearly Dollars 2bn in the past two years. That it is now making profits has prompted speculation that last week's separation of ACG from the rest of GM may be the precursor to an eventual flotation.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. EXPECTS S. AFRICAN MOVES TO END SANCTIONS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration anticipates that South Africa will comply with the  standards set by Congress for lifting U.S. economic sanctions by the end of  this year, according to a senior U.S. official.  </P> <P> The official, who talked to a small group of reporters Wednesday on the  understanding that he would not be identified by name, said it now seems clear  that sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations played a role in  the decision by South African President Frederik W. de Klerk last week to lift  many restrictions on several long-banned black and anti-apartheid  organizations.  </P> <P> The sanctions were enacted by Congress over the veto of President Ronald Reagan  in 1986. At the time, Administration officials said they thought the sanctions  would be counterproductive, diminishing U.S. influence in Pretoria without  producing any change in the policy of the white minority-led government.  </P> <P> But the Bush Administration official said De Klerk decided to seek greater  cooperation with the black majority because he became convinced that the South  African economy could prosper only with cooperation between the races.  </P> <P> "This realization has been pushed along by international pressure, including  American pressure," the official said.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the sanctions law, the President may lift the sanctions if  South Africa releases all political prisoners and takes any three of these  steps:  </P> <P> * Repeals the state of emergency.  </P> <P> * Ends the ban on political groups, such as the African National Congress.  </P> <P> * Repeals the Group Areas Act, which imposes residential segregation.  </P> <P> * Agrees to enter good faith negotiations with "truly representative members of  the black community."  </P> <P> The official said that De Klerk has complied with two of the standards --  repeal of the ban on political groups and agreement to negotiate. He said he  expects South Africa to move soon, certainly by the end of the year, to free  all political prisoners and end the state of emergency. He said the government  has said it will go slower in repealing the Group Areas Act.  </P> <P> Until the sanctions can be legally lifted, the official said, Washington hopes  to show its support for De Klerk's reforms by increasing high-level diplomatic  contacts. He said De Klerk has already been invited to visit the United States,  although no dates have been set. And he said that a top Administration  official, possibly Secretary of State James A. Baker III, might soon travel to  South Africa.  </P> <P> The official said that Washington plans to apply steady pressure on both the  South African government and the black leadership to proceed with negotiations  over the future of the country. Both sides have agreed to meet, but they are  still haggling over ground rules.  </P> <P> "We will put pressure on both sides to negotiate," he said.  </P></p>

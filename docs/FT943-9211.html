			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Reed Elsevier The trouble with highly-rated companies like Reed-Elsevier is that they have to run fast to stand still. The fall of nearly 3 per cent in Reed's shares after yesterday's interim results suggests disappointment with the pace of organic growth. The impact of last year's acquisitions, notably Official Airline Guides (OAG), accounted for Pounds 15m out of the Pounds 33m increase in pre-tax profits. But to worry too much about how much organic growth may be evident at any one stage of the cycle may be to miss the point. Reed Elsevier's longer term future depends heavily on how the group is reshaped by acquisitions. The good news is that OAG seems to be working well. The bad news is that the two large companies at which Reed Elsevier has been looking, Ziff and Mead Data, look expensive. Though Reed is generating large amounts of cash, it would not wish to see its interest cover reduced below six or seven times. It thus has around Pounds 1bn to play with. It cannot afford both Ziff and Mead and needs to negotiate indicated prices down substantially. There is little danger of it overpaying, but some nimble footwork is required before the next large purchase is secure.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. Has Negative Net Worth: Imperial Corp. of America said  additional losses sustained by its already battered junk bond portfolio have  resulted in a negative tangible net worth for the troubled San Diego-based  parent company of Imperial Savings of California. Federal regulators have been  fully informed of ICA's "capital deficiency" but there are no indications yet  that regulators may seize control of the S&amp;L, ICA spokesman Bruce Dunn  said. According to the minimum standards in the bill, ICA's core capital is  supposed to equal at least $150 million, or 1.5% of its $10.5 billion assets.  Dunn declined to specify what ICA's negative tangible net worth now totals.  </P></p>

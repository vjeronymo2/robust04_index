			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Rose in Bihac peace mission General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, was reported yesterday to have won a verbal promise of a truce in Bihac from Mr Fikret Abdic, renegade Moslem leader, whose troops have fought alongside the Serbs in the northwestern Moslem enclave. He had talks with both Mr Abdic and General Atif Dudakovic, commander of the Bosnian government Fifth Corps, in an attempt to halt fighting which threatens the country's latest ceasefire. A UN source said Mr Abdic had accepted a three paragraph truce proposed by Gen Rose. However, Gen Dudakovic is understood to have expressed some reservations and to have indicated that he would have to consult his government in Sarajevo. Details of the truce proposal were not immediately known. Gen Rose, who until yesterday was prevented by Serb forces from visiting Bihac, met for talks on implementing a truce in the region, encircled by Serb forces. Clashes in the Bihac region have thwarted negotiations on the details of a four-month cessation of hostilities, brokered by Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president, due to come into force on Sunday. As Gen Rose held talks in Bihac, fighting flared in the north of the enclave around Mr Abdic's stronghold of Velika Kladusa, with some 87 shells falling near the town, according to a UN spokesman in Zagreb.</p>

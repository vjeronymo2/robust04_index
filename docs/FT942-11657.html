			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Central banks step in to defend Dollars: Fed move follows failure of last week's intervention The Federal Reserve yesterday led a concerted effort by central banks to stem the dollar's steep decline against the yen and chief European currencies, stepping into the foreign exchange market repeatedly to buy the US currency. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, said the intervention reflected the Clinton administration's view 'that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals. This administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency'. The Fed had intervened last week to support the dollar, but yesterday's operations were supported by as many as 17 central banks, including the Bundesbank, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England, Bank of Canada and most European central banks. Several billion dollars of intervention was seen, central bank sources suggested. The central banks initially struggled to arrest the dollar's slide. During the morning in New York, the Fed and other central banks bought dollars around DM1.6570 and Y101.20. After the intervention, the currency rebounded more than 3 pfennigs from its overnight close to DM1.6643, and more than Y1 to Y102.43, but later slid back to near its morning lows. A second round of intervention helped to stabilise the currency. By late afternoon in New York, the dollar stood at DM1.6542 and Y101.90, a gain on the day of only 1 1/2 pfennigs and less than Y1, respectively. US officials are anxious at the prospect that the slide in the dollar's value, by making foreign investors less willing to put their money into US bonds, could accelerate the rise in long-term US interest rates, damping future economic activity as a result. However, the move had little direct impact on the US stock and Treasury markets, although shares and bond prices were unsettled by speculation that the Fed might have to lift the discount rate - the rate at which it lends money to banks - to support the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 16.66 at 3,697.75. The benchmark 30-year government bond, which fell half a point during the morning, revived later in the day following weaker-than-expected April car sales data. By late afternoon it stood unchanged, yielding 7.346 per cent. Although finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations agreed two weeks ago to continue to co-operate closely in foreign exchange markets, yesterday's concerted intervention was more a response to the failure of last Friday's more limited intervention than an implementation of a detailed G-7 plan. Earlier, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, signalled German unhappiness with the dollar's weakness. 'Too strong an appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar is not in the interests of our economy,' he said. This had an immediate beneficial impact on the dollar. Since President Bill Clinton took office, sharply on expanding US exports to Japan and other markets, the dollar has dropped in value against the yen by almost 18 per cent. A senior US Treasury official said central banks had intervened 'to counteract a negative psychology that had developed on the basis of false perceptions that the US was trying to drive the dollar down . . . or was somehow indifferent to where market forces took its currency'.

(``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 17, 1990, the Commission approved the PSE's LMM system on a pilot basis. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Previously, the Commission has approved Exchange requests for extension of the pilot program, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  which is set to expire on September 30, 1994. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The PSE submitted pilot program reports to the Commission on September 18, 1992, and on July 26, 1993. In addition, on April 20, 1994, the Exchange withdrew several pending rule filings relating to the LMM program and did so with the intention of resubmitting a consolidated filing at a later date. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  At this time, the PSE is considering additional rule changes to be included in the consolidated filing. Therefore, the Exchange proposes to amend its rules to extend the LMM pilot program through September 30, 1995, in order to provide additional time for evaluation of the LMM program in light of any changes that may be approved within the next year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27631 (January 17, 1990), 55 FR 2462 (January 24, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33854 (April 1, 1994), 59 FR 16873 (April 8, 1994) (``April 1994 Pilot Approval Order''); 31063 (August 21, 1992), 57 FR 39255 (August 28, 1992); and 31635 (December 22, 1992), 57 FR 62414 (December 30, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  April 1994 Pilot Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from David P.

Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PSE has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposal to extend the LMM pilot program through September 30, 1995, is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The Commission concludes, as it did in approving the LMM pilot program, that the pilot program may enhance the market making mechanism on the PSE, thereby improving the markets for listed options on the Exchange. Specifically, the Commission believes that the LMM pilot may improve the PSE's market making capabilities by creating long-term commitments to options classes. Moreover, the pilot program will continue with adequate due process safeguards in the LMM selection and termination procedures and will retain procedures that prevent the misuse of material non-public LMM information by either an LMM or a broker-dealer affiliated with an LMM. The Commission notes, however, that before the pilot program can be approved on a permanent basis, the PSE must provide the Commission with a report on the operation of the pilot program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 515 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, before requesting permanent approval or further extension of the pilot program the PSE must submit a pilot program report by June 1995 that addresses: (1) whether there have been any complaints regarding the operation of the pilot; (2) whether the PSE has taken any disciplinary or performance action against any member due to the operation of the pilot; (3) the number of LMMs involved in the pilot; (4) the extent to which the pilot has been used on the PSE; (5) whether the PSE has terminated or replaced an LMM and the reasons therefore; (6) the impact of the pilot on the bid/ask spreads, depth and continuity in PSE options markets; and (7) whether the PSE has taken any action or there have been any complaints against LMMs or associated broker-dealers relating to improper activity as a result of LMM affiliations with upstairs firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because the PSE has not indicated that there have been any problems associated with the operation of the LMM system pilot program and because the Commission has not received any adverse comments concerning the pilot program. In addition, the Commission believes good cause exists to approve the extension of the LMM pilot program on an accelerated basis in order to allow the pilot program to continue uninterrupted. The Commission believes, therefore, that granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is appropriate and consistent with Section 6 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing.

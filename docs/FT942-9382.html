			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo A fall in short-term interest rates to record lows and increased buying interest from institutional investors are expected to support Japanese bond prices this week. Since the instability of US financial markets, caused by fears of rising US inflation, have also unnerved Japanese bond investors, they will be focusing on the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the Federal Reserve Board's stance on interest rates. While the fluctuations of the currency markets and the US bond market continue to affect investor sentiment, Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo expects domestic institutional interest in short- and medium-term bonds to support the new issue market for four- and six-year government notes and bank debentures. Market volume is a benchmark for the recovery in confidence towards the bond market. A rise in trading volume for the 10-year benchmark bond on the broker-broker market to above Y200m a day - a level not seen on a sustained basis since early March - will signal a return of investors, says BZW. Meanwhile, the spate of corporate earnings announcements this week is expected to confirm the fragile state of the economy, and the deflationary effect of the yen's strength on profits of export-oriented companies.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ATLANTA PAPER NAMES MARTIN EDITOR  </P> <P> Ronald D. Martin, vice president and executive editor of USA Today, was named  today as editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, five months after the  stormy exit of Bill Kovach.  </P> <P> Martin will begin work at the Atlanta papers on Monday, said Publisher Jay  Smith, who made the announcement. Arnold Rosenfeld, who has served as interim  editor, will become editor-in-chief of Cox Newspapers, the parent company of  the Atlanta papers, Smith said.  </P> <P> Rosenfeld said Martin is a "very experienced newspaper person and one I have  great respect for."  </P> <P> Kovach, a former Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, resigned from  the Atlanta newspapers last November after a dispute with management over  control of the Cox chain's Washington bureau. His departure sparked an effort  by admirers, including a march in downtown Atlanta, to get him back on the job.  </P></p>

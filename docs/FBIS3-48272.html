And some paid media of the United States  urge the DPRK to accept a special inspection, spreading the  rumor that it agreed to accept routine and ad hoc inspections at  the New York contact.    This is an act of throwing a wet blanket over the solution  of the nuclear issue the way of which has been paved with so  much efforts; it cannot be construed otherwise than a folly of  those who do not know the essential nature of the nuclear issue  or the direction of its solution but seek other purpose, says  NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today.    The news analyst notes:    The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula was caused by the  introduction of nuclear weapons into South Korea by the United  States. It is also the United States which complicated the  situation by bringing forward "suspected nuclear development by  the North".    Thus the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a matter  to  be solved between the United States and the DPRK in view of its  origin and background of its complexity today and the DPRK and  the United States have the authority to solve it.    For the United States to remove the nuclear threat to the  DPRK and renounce its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK is the  precondition for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue  and a matter of clearing the debt owed by the United States to  the DPRK down through history.    The DPRK agreed with the United States on the matter of  inspection because we took into account the fact that the U.S.  side accepted our formula of package deal and proposal for both  sides to move simultaneously and manifested its willingness to  discontinue the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises this year  and hold the third-round DPRK-USA talks.    As for the inspection we intend to allow this time, it is an  inspection needed merely for the guarantee of the continuity of  safeguards according to the promise we made to the United States  when we suspended temporarily the effectuation of our  withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] for  the solution of the nuclear issue through negotiations.    The conception of the inspection for the continuity of  safeguards is a new one that originated from our special  position in the state of temporary stop of the effectuation of  the withdrawal from NPT. The inspection for the continuity of  safeguards is, therefore, quite different from the routine and  ad hoc inspections pursuant to the obligation under the NPT and,  moreover, the "special inspection" cannot be an object of debate.    The DPRK is in a state of temporary suspension of the  effectuation of its withdrawal from the NPT. Therefore we are  not under obligation to implement the safeguards agreement like  a full-fledged signatory.    This notwithstanding, the anti-dialogue forces of the United  States, setting in motion intelligence plotters and paid  trumpeters, are painting an exaggerated picture of the fact as  if the U.S. side has made a unilateral compromise and crying  that the DPRK must be made to undergo the routine and ad hoc  inspections and "special inspection" of the International Atomic  Energy Agency first. This is an imprudent act that does not  hold water.    That the rightwing conservative forces of the United States  are crying for pressure by demanding even the "special  inspection" cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to  bring the situation to a catastrophe by totally driving the DPRK  out of the NPT. This real intention is to break up the  DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and persistently pursue the hostile  policy to stifle the DPRK.    We will counter toughness with toughness and our tough will  will be manifested more strongly in practice than in word.    If the U.S. hard-line conservative forces do not want to  regret for their act tomorrow, they should act with discretion  before it is too late.</p>

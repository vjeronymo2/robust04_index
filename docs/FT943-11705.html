			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Hochtief wins DM640m Beirut airport contract Hochtief, one of Germany's biggest construction companies, has won a DM640m (Dollars 408m) contract to rebuild and extend the badly damaged Beirut airport, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn. The Essen-based company said work was due to start in the autumn and would probably continue until 1998. It will work with Consolidated Contractors SAL, a Lebanese company, and will use a variety of sub-contractors mainly to supply the workforce. Years of fighting around the Lebanese capital have left the airport in ruins, without proper runways and facilities. The Lebanese government had earmarked the project as a priority in an attempt to attract foreign investors. The 3.4km runway is to be extended 1.9km into the sea and the contract also includes the construction of a passenger terminal, a transit centre, a control tower and a hotel. Hochtief has been involved in a variety of construction projects in the Middle East including the airport in Jeddah, which handles visitors on pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>

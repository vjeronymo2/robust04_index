			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: THE NO-SEX, NO-POLITICS READING LIST  </P> <P> I have been under siege for writing that I couldn't think of any good American  novels that weren't heavy on sex or politics.  </P> <P> Ruth Lerner of Pacific Palisades had asked me to name 10 such books for her  son, who is sojourning in China. He had asked her to send him works of American  fiction, but none that might be confiscated by the Chinese.  </P> <P> Obviously my answer was ironic. I was saying that it is hard to find a  contemporary novel that isn't saturated with sex, politics or both.  </P> <P> I have been bombarded with dozens of titles of American fiction from "Moby  Dick" and "The Scarlet Letter" to "Slaughterhouse Five" and "Catcher in the  Rye."  </P> <P> One man, J. L. Jonsson of Long Beach, names no fewer than 46 novels, and  suggests that I should have passed Mrs. Lerner's request on to "someone who  reads at least a book a month."  </P> <P> Jonsson's suggestions range from Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter" to "Gone With the  Wind," neither of which, it seems to me, is quite free of sex and politics.  </P> <P> His list poses another problem. If I had named 10 of his selections, he might  have accused me of leaving out the other 36. Also, I wonder how long it's been  since he read "Call of the Wild."  </P> <P> Lester E. Sansome of Rosemead notes that the Horatio Alger stories, which,  along with the Rover Boys, was the only selection I could come up with, are in  fact testaments to the American free enterprise system, and might be anathema  to the Chinese.  </P> <P> Judy Burkey of Signal Hill points out that in observing that "The Wizard of Oz"  reeks of abnormal sex I failed to note that it is also a last hurrah for the  waning Populist movement of the 1890s. Certainly a no-no on two counts.  </P> <P> Judy Kupperman, a teacher of English at Granada Hills High School, sends a list  of 16 novels, several of which are English, not American, including "Lord of  the Flies," "Jane Eyre," "Pride and Prejudice," and "Picture of Dorian Gray."  She also suggests "Little Women" and "Little Men," both of which I would  hesitate to recommend to a young man today.  </P> <P> Ralph William Bentlege writes that as "a mere youth" in the Navy on Guam, he  read, among others, "Anthony Adverse," "Captain Hornblower," "Great  Expectations" (English) "Pilgrim's Progress" (also English) and various books  by Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason), and Raymond Chandler (Philip Marlowe). I  can't believe that anyone but a literary or theological scholar could read  "Pilgrim's Progress" today, and I certainly wouldn't foist it on a young man  who might already be feeling isolated and disoriented in China.  </P> <P> Susan Gardner concedes the difficulty of finding readable books that are not  saturated with sex and politics, but she recommends anything by Dick Francis  and Agatha Christie, both English. She explains: "Maybe Mrs. Lerner should  stick with some of the Brits, who know the art of insinuation better than the  U.S. writers."  </P> <P> Rachel Pearson of Pasadena follows the British trend, recommending "Lucky Jim"  by Kingsley Amis as "the funniest book I've read and re-read." I agree that  "Lucky Jim" is a delightful book, but it is quintessentially English, and  doesn't qualify.  </P> <P> Linda Palmer of Beverly Hills recommends several good novels, including "A  Woman of Independent Means" by Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey, "The Heart Is a  Lonely Hunter" and "Member of the Wedding" by Carson McCullers, any 87th  Precinct novel by Ed McBain, any Nero Wolfe novel by Rex Stout, "Giant" by Edna  Ferber, "Gone With the Wind" by Margaret Mitchell, and "The Great Gatsby" by F.  Scott Fitzgerald.  </P> <P> Palmer also concedes that few "modern" American novels meet Mrs. Lerner's  restrictions, but she insists that the books of Herbert Gold and Joseph  Wambaugh are "worth risking jail to read."  </P> <P> She says: "If, as has been said, an age is defined by its fiction, then I fear  for our age."  </P> <P> Fred A. Glienna and Gary Nordell both recommend the novels of Zane Grey. "You  won't find prurience in Grey's 'Riders of the Purple Sage' or 'Union Pacific,'  " says Glienna. He also recommends Owen Wister's "The Virginian." ("When you  call me that, smile.")  </P> <P> Mrs. J. Ford Johnston of Sunland wonders how I feel about the Bible.  </P> <P> Well, for one thing, it is definitely not American. Also, it has a lot of  begetting in it.  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (10): Many are destined to disappear - Components Suppliers - Paul Betts reports that the thousands of component manufacturers are the main casualties of the recession and defence cuts. Boeing, the world's biggest builder of commercial jets, finds dual sourcing is becoming too costly and is therefore reducing the number of its suppliers THE AEROSPACE industry is structured like a pyramid, Mr Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice-president of planning and international development, recently noted. At the top are the large aircraft manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas, British Aerospace, Fokker and the Russians. Below them are more than 200 major aerospace structure and assembly suppliers. And at the lower end of the pyramid are many thousands of companies responsible for building smaller but critical parts for aircraft. These many aerospace components manufacturers have found life even more difficult than the prime manufacturers in the current down cycle. The profound changes caused by the structural decline in defence activities and the financial slump in commercial aviation is likely to lead to significant changes in the relationship between prime contractors and their suppliers. Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, says it is already reducing its suppliers. 'Until recently, in many cases we had two or more suppliers providing the same component. The fact is dual sourcing is very expensive and we have had to find ways to be more and more competitive,' Mr Clarkson explained. The changing relationship with the prime contractors coupled with the uncertainty of the market is now speeding up the trend towards greater consolidation in the aerospace components sector as well as prompting most companies to increase their presence in the commercial side of the business to offset the decline in defence activities. The successful takeover this year of Dowty, the UK aerospace components and information technology company, by TI Group, the British specialist engineering concern, is an example of this trend. One of the attractions of Dowty for TI was the possibility of integrating and merging the two companies' aerospace activities to create a business with annual sales of Pounds 400m and a more competitive critical mass. Smiths Industries, another leading UK aerospace components supplier, has been in talks with the Collins Avionics division of Rockwell International of the US to create an important avionics partnership. The idea is to create a third force in the commercial avionics sector to compete against Honeywell, the US company which is the current market leader in this sector, and against the French Sextant avionics group. The move would rationalise the commercial aircraft avionics business along the same lines as the other main sectors of the commercial aerospace industry dominated by three airframe manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas) and three engine makers (General Electric, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce). The industry argues that there is only room in this market for three groups to provide the avionic systems for the flight decks of commercial airliners. Honeywell already controls about 35 per cent of the world market and is dominant on McDonnell Douglas aircraft. In France, Aerospatiale has merged its avionics activities with those of Thomson CSF to form the Sextant group which is the dominant supplier of European Airbus airliners. The partnership between Smiths and Collins is expected to concentrate on winning business from Boeing which makes up about 55 per cent of the world airliner market. All the leading aerospace equipment suppliers have been forced to develop a global presence to survive in the business. All the large UK companies in this sector, including the General Electric Company (GEC), Smiths, Dowty and Lucas Aerospace, have become global players producing equipment not only for the UK aerospace industry but for aircraft and engine manufacturers throughout Europe and the US. Mr Antony Edwards, managing director of Lucas and last year's president of the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), explained that Lucas saw in the early 1980s that the company was much too dependent on two major customers: Rolls-Royce and the UK Government. He said that while nurturing these important customers, the company set about broadening its customer portfolio, concentrating on the US, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the western world aerospace market. 'But to succeed in the US, particularly in the military market, it was necessary to have manufacturing facilities on shore. After a planned acquisition programme, 40 per cent of our sales now originate from our own US operations,' he said in a recent speech. He added a similar process was undertaken in Europe through acquisitions and joint ventures to give Lucas substantial manufacturing operations in France, Germany and Spain as well as in the UK and the US. Lucas is just one example. GEC, Dowty and and Smiths have all taken the same route and own a wide range of companies in the US. The French Thomson CSF group has been equally active in attempting to build up its presence in the US market through acquisitions and partnerships. This trend is now likely to accelerate in combination with greater transnational concentration in the industry as prime contractors and other aerospace components customers continue to reduce the number of their suppliers.</p>

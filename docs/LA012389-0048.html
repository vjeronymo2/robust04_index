			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABRAMS LEAVES STATE DEPT. JOB AS HE CAME IN -- SPEAKING OUT  </P> <P> "I don't have any regrets at all," said Elliott Abrams, the Reagan  Administration's least-loved assistant secretary of state.  </P> <P> And to show that he means it, Abrams' repertoire of malediction remains as rich  as ever. His opponents, he says, are "vipers," President Daniel Ortega of  Nicaragua is "a liar" and members of Congress who blocked U.S. aid to  Nicaraguan rebels "will have . . . blood on their hands."  </P> <P> Almost three years ago, Abrams became the Reagan Administration's chief  strategist on Latin America, vowing to bring Nicaragua's Sandinista regime to  its knees. Later, he added Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, to his  list.  </P> <P> Abrams left office Friday; he has not sought, nor has he been offered, a job in  the Bush Administration. In Nicaragua and Panama, both Ortega and Noriega are  still firmly in power. And Abrams admits only one major error: not being  tougher.  </P> <P> "When you look back eight years, a mistake was made in 1981 in the approach to  this problem (in Nicaragua), which was to try to put it on a middle burner or a  back burner," he said.  </P> <P> "I don't see where we've been able to achieve a sensible negotiated solution  unless we've placed great pressure on the Communist side," he said. "And great  pressure will be needed now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Argument for Use of Force  </P> <P> Does that mean the United States should have intervened in Nicaragua with  military force? "You can make a very good argument" for that idea, Abrams told  an interviewer recently -- the idea that "the President should simply have  said, 'Look, we have to enforce the Monroe Doctrine; we cannot have a Communist  government in Nicaragua,' and (we should have) done whatever we needed to do to  get rid of it, including a naval blockade or possibly even an invasion."  </P> <P> He wasn't actually proposing an invasion, Abrams explained later -- merely  offering "a very good argument."  </P> <P> That has often seemed the essence of Abrams' stormy diplomatic career: a candid  love of argument, a zest for saying things bluntly instead of clinging to  Washington's customary gray euphemisms.  </P> <P> Part of it, friends say, is that Abrams is brilliant -- and still believes in  his ability to convince others by sheer force of argument. Part of it is that  he is a neo-conservative, a former Democrat whose greatest passion is not  merely advancing a policy but proving his liberal opponents wrong as well.  </P> <P> The result has been a great divide: a few fiercely loyal and admiring friends,  but a great many enemies.  </P> <P> "I'm a charter member of the Elliott Abrams fan club," said Rep. Henry J. Hyde  (R-Ill.), one of the Contras' champions on Capitol Hill. "It is an elevating  experience to find someone who believes in something and is willing to fight  for it."  </P> <P> "Elliott Abrams has done tremendous damage to relations between the executive  branch and Congress," countered Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.), a Contra foe.  "There's no question that we didn't get the truth in our exchanges with him,  and that is one of the gravest assaults on the way our system works."  </P> <P> Hyde and others defend Abrams against the charge of misleading Congress. But  even Abrams' allies acknowledge that his give-no-quarter style did not help  broaden support for the Administration's policies in Central America.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low 'Grovel Quotient'  </P> <P> "Diplomacy is the art of the compromise, the art of the possible," Hyde said.  "His virtues to us are vices to others. He wasn't temperamentally able to back  and fill and grovel. To succeed in diplomacy, one's grovel quotient has to be  fairly high -- and his wasn't."  </P> <P> Inside the State Department, too, assessments of Abrams' performance are  divided. "Elliott's problem is that he believes too much of his own rhetoric,"  one subordinate said. "The policy's been falling apart, but it took him a long  time to recognize it."  </P> <P> Even Secretary of State George P. Shultz has expressed some regret over the  outcome of the Reagan Administration's policy in Central America. In several  recent interviews, Shultz has said the Administration may have missed an  opportunity to negotiate with Nicaragua in 1987 -- when Shultz proposed sending  a special envoy to open talks with Managua but Abrams and other Administration  hard-liners persuaded President Reagan to block the move.  </P> <P> But Shultz has also stuck doggedly by Abrams despite demands from Democrats in  Congress that he be fired. During the Iran-Contra affair, Abrams lied to the  Senate Intelligence Committee in an attempt to conceal a State Department  effort to raise money for the Contras from foreign governments. He later  apologized, but some members of Congress never forgave the offense.  </P> <P> Last fall, Shultz pointedly gave Abrams one of the State Department's major  honors, the Secretary's Award for Distinguished Service. And two weeks ago,  Shultz spoke warmly of Abrams at a farewell ceremony, lauding him as  "invaluable," according to officials who attended.  </P> <P> "I owe Secretary Shultz a debt that I can never repay," Abrams replied. "But  that's appropriate, since most of the countries I work with (in Latin America)  also have debts that can never be repaid," he quipped, alluding to the vast  foreign debts of most of the countries in the region.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faults Congress  </P> <P> If his goals in Nicaragua were not met, he said, that was the fault of  Congress, which cut off military aid to the Contras when they were -- in his  view -- approaching victory. And if the U.S. attempt to topple Noriega failed,  he said, that was the fault of others in the Administration who resisted his  proposals for action -- proposals that reportedly included a plan to kidnap the  Panamanian dictator.  </P> <P> Overall, though, Abrams said he views his tenure as a success: for having  supported the movement toward democracy in most of the countries of Latin  America, for setting a conservative Republican Administration against military  dictatorships and for what success he did achieve in supporting the Contras.  </P> <P> "In a sense, what's remarkable is how well we did, given the polls," he said.  "We have never had a majority for military aid (for the Contras) . . . but  Congress voted for it several times."  </P> <P> And Abrams, still only 40, made it clear that he plans to be back in government  after a stint at the conservative Heritage Foundation and some practice as a  lawyer and investment banker.  </P></p>

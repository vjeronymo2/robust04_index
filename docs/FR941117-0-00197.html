			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because commenters were supportive of leaving the determination of the location of the undertaking to the parties, the relevant language of the Proposed Amendments, requiring a Participating Underwriter to look to ``undertakings in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of holders of such securities'' has been adopted as proposed. Therefore, undertakings may be included in a trust indenture, bond resolution or other legislation, or a separate written agreement. Undertakings also may be included in the bond form itself. This general requirement will create a direct obligation to bondholders, yet will be flexible to address variations in state law, as well as the wide variety of types and structures of offerings in the municipal securities market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also recognizes that an issuer's ability to contract may be limited under state law. To the extent that issuers are restricted by statute from entering into long-term contractual arrangements, the undertaking may include a qualifier to its obligation, such as that it is subject to appropriation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 132 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 132 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters were concerned that in some jurisdictions, an issuer's ability to agree to provide information beyond a one year period might be restricted by state law. To address such concerns, inclusion of a condition subsequent in the covenant, such as subject to appropriation, might be appropriate. It is anticipated, however, that should funds that would enable the issuer to provide the agreed upon information not be appropriated, disclosure of such fact would be made by notice to the repositories pursuant to Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters generally took the view that, while a statement in the final official statement describing any undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure would be an important addition to undertakings in a written agreement or contract, in order to make clear that the undertaking is an obligation of the issuer or obligated person that is enforceable on behalf of bondholders, the undertaking should be in a writing signed by the issuer or obligated person. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 133 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Statements regarding an issuer's or obligated person's provision of secondary market disclosure made exclusively in an official statement would not satisfy the terms of Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5) because they would not create a contract enforceable on behalf of bondholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 133 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Chemical Securities; Letter of Dain Bosworth, Inc.; Letter of Dillon, Read &amp; Co., Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters addressing the inclusion of undertakings in various documents were concerned that the failure to provide continuing disclosure pursuant to the undertakings could be deemed a potential event of default on the securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 134 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Though a failure to comply with the undertaking would be a breach of contract, the rule does not specify the consequences of an issuer's breach of its undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure. As called for by the Joint Response, as well as other commenters, remedies for breach of any undertaking under applicable state law are a subject for negotiation between the parties to the Offering. To avoid uncertainties of enforcement, the parties to a transaction are encouraged to enumerate the consequences in the undertaking, including the available remedies, for breach of the information undertaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 134 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters argued that an issuer's failure to comply with undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure should not result in an event of default.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of ABA Urban Law Section; Letter of State of Washington, Office of the Treasurer; Letter of Colorado Municipal Bond Supervision Advisory Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Recommendation of Transactions in Municipal Securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendments would have prohibited any broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending the purchase or sale of a municipal security unless it had specifically reviewed the information the issuer of such municipal security had undertaken to provide. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 135 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The purpose of this provision of the Proposed Amendments was to assist dealers in satisfying their obligation to have a reasonable basis to recommend municipal securities by requiring them to consider the most current information before making a recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 135 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> paragraph (c) of the Proposed Amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the importance of secondary market liquidity in municipal issues, the Commission requested comment on whether the Proposed Amendments would have a substantial or long-lasting effect on market liquidity. This request for comment was based on concerns raised about whether municipal securities dealers would be willing to effect secondary market transactions in a broad range of municipal securities if review was required on a recommendation by recommendation basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters strongly criticized this provision of the Proposed Amendments. The majority of commenters responded that requiring the review of information prior to making a recommendation on the purchase or sale of a municipal security would create substantial compliance burdens for dealers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 136 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenters also noted that the specific requirement to review information either would impel dealers to hire larger research and analysis staffs, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 137 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or, more likely, would cause dealers to restrict the issuers whose municipal securities they would trade to a smaller number of large and frequent issuers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 138 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenters predicted that, as a result, liquidity for all but the largest and most frequent issuers would be reduced. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 139 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 136 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of PSA (noting that paragraph (c) would require dealers to create records showing that they had reviewed municipal securities).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 137 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Chapman and Cutler (brokers with fewer analysts will be at a competitive disadvantage); Letter of Morgan Stanley (noting that in order to comply with paragraph (c) as proposed, reliance on third-party service providers for information analysis would be required).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 138 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Joint Response; Letter of PSA; Letter of Gabriel, Hueglin &amp; Cashman.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 139 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Joint Response; Letter of PSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters proposed alternatives to the recommendation prohibition, including basing the type of review of a municipal security, and disclosure about such review, on whether the investor was an institutional or retail investor, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 140 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or on the type of municipal security recommended. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 141 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other commenters suggested the continued reliance on the reasonable basis standard inherent in the MSRB's suitability rule, G&hyph;19, and the antifraud provisions, as discussed by the Commission in the 1988 and 1989 Releases proposing and adopting Rule 15c2&hyph;12, as well as the Interpretive Release. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 142 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 140 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Investment Company Institute (``ICI'').  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter of MSRB; Letter of NABL.

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Chancellor's big day moves to November The spring revenue-raising Budget, that symbol of winter's end and harbinger of longer and brighter days, is no more. Administrative pressures have dictated that the new unified tax and spending Budgets, that will determine the nation's finances from 1994-95 onwards, have to be decided well ahead of the tax year beginning on April 6. The Treasury has announced that the first of the new unified Budgets 'will be no later than the last week of November' this year. The finance bill that follows that Budget will be published in January instead of late spring, giving taxpayers and their advisers a clear idea of most tax changes well before the date that they take effect. Until this year, the legislative changes announced in the Budget were not published until after the start of the tax year. The new unified Budget will also eliminate one of the two separate income tax coding exercises that take place early each year under the pay-as-you-earn income tax scheme (PAYE). In future, it should be possible to meld the annual mid-January coding with changes determined in the Budget so that employers have to implement only one set of coding changes in time for the start of the tax year on April 6. As at present, governments will have to raise some taxes such as excise duties on wines and tobacco overnight after the Budget. It is doubtful whether these increases in the approach to Christmas will add to a government's popularity. There will be a problem in forecasting the economy for the year ahead and especially in determining the public sector borrowing requirement more than four months ahead of the new financial year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that average PSBR forecasting error could rise to around pounds 5.7bn with November budgets from the pounds 4.7bn average over the past 10 years. Budget day wil be a bigger challenge for the Chancellor, parliament and the press. The Budget speech will be longer because it will have to include details of the government's spending plans. The record to date is held by William Gladstone, who spoke for four hours and 45 minutes in April 1853.</p>

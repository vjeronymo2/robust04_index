			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (5): Exotic options fit the bill / A look at new instruments available to corporate treasurers THE UPHEAVAL in Europe's foreign exchange market last autumn has had a number of side effects, not least of which has been a reappraisal of currency risk management by many companies. Currency risk management is no longer relevant only to exporters and importers, because many companies now have overseas operations. However, volatility has also had the effect of raising the cost of instruments, such as currency options, used to hedge exposure to the foreign exchange markets. To win the hearts and minds of corporate treasurers, who tend to baulk at what they see as overpriced insurance policies, investment banks have become more adept at structuring more complex options - known as exotic options - which meet the primary aims of companies at a lower cost. 'The second generation is important,' said Mr Albert Maasland, manager of foreign exchange derivatives marketing at Chase Manhattan Bank in London. 'Derivatives on derivatives tend to reduce cost, and if you understand a client's risk profile, you can structure products to suit their needs.' But companies are also aware of the risks inherent in the use of these complex financial instruments. The loss of Pounds 150m in foreign exchange dealings two years ago by the treasury department of Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, illustrated the potential dangers, if corporate treasury operations are not carefully controlled. The problem stemmed from the practice of writing currency options, which can lead to unlimited losses. There are two types of exposure which companies may try to hedge, transaction exposure and translation exposure. In the last year, companies have become more active in hedging transaction exposure - the currency exposure stemming from a particular sale or purchase of goods of services. While in the past the tendency has been to hedge next year's budget, or to hedge known sales or purchases a year ahead, corporate treasurers are now tending to look a year or two further ahead. 'More companies are saying to themselves that if they have a currency position which is strategic, they should start to take the volatility out of that risk,' said Mr Paul Ward, a director of Salomon Brothers in London. For UK companies which are effectively long dollars, it may seem attractive to lock in an exchange rate of Dollars 1.50 to the pound over several years, for example. One potential problem with hedging transaction exposure is that there is some concern that the tax situation may become less favourable in the UK, and the ability to net positions between different parts of the company may be reduced in the next Budget. Attitudes to translation exposure are more mixed. Translation exposure arises in companies' balance sheets when, for example, a UK-based company is operating in the US. If it has no debt and is financed by sterling equity, the value of its assets against its liabilities will fluctuate. Some companies effectively hedge against such exposure by borrowing in the relevant foreign currency to match their assets. Others take the view that since such exposure is only in the balance sheet, it is not worth worrying about mere accounting numbers. However, in a highly geared company, such volatility may affect gearing and have an impact on banking covenants. There is widespread agreement among investment bankers that UK companies lag their European counterparts in their use of derivatives, particularly in the recent vogue for exotic options. French companies in particular are known for being highly sophisticated in their use of options - and also have more autonomous treasury departments. Among recent popular products which can help reduce costs are basket options, which allow a company to hedge exposure to a range of currencies, and average rate options, which allow companies to have a smooth rate throughout the year. Average rate options are 'a great product for companies with a regular cash flow, because they are quite simple to explain and simple to use for (hedging) transaction exposure,' said Ms Sara Sullivan at Chase Manhattan. Knock-out options are cheaper because if the underlying spot rate trades above or below a certain level, the option expires. They are generally about 35 per cent cheaper than other options. Meanwhile, some companies are eschewing options in favour of dynamic hedging. In dynamic hedging, instead of buying options, exposure is hedged by buying and selling forward contracts in the market to replicate options. This method creates substantial savings for companies, according to Mike Shilling, assistant director at Record Treasury Management. Meanwhile, some banks have also been touting Safes - synthetic agreements for forward foreign exchange - which are essentially forward contracts that do not require an exchange of principal. As a result, banks need to devote less capital and are less exposed to the risk that their counterparty will default. There are two types of Safe: the exchange rate agreement, or ERA, which protects the purchaser against a change in the forward foreign exchange spread and the forward exchange agreement (FXA), which gives protection against a change in the spot rate as well as the forward spread.</p>

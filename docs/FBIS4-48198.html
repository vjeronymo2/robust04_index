			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amid reports of continuing shelling between  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] fighters and government troops in  Kigali and the killing of 80 [as heard] school girls in Rwanda,  120 Tanzanians have arrived in the country from Rwanda via  Burundi. The 120 Tanzanians, including 40 children, met the  Ngara district commissioner, Ndugu Jonah Mwakishomba, who was at  Kabungo on the Burundi border on other business.    The Tanzanians led by the secretary of the Tanzanian  community in Rwanda, Brother Ramadhani Hamza Tisiime, told the  district commissioner of the suffering they experienced in  Rwanda before their departure via Burundi. The Tanzanians, who  arrived in Tanzania in a freight truck flying the Tanzanian  flag, and five private cars are travelling to Mwanza where they  hope to meet the regional commissioner. They plan to present  the commissioner with the national flag which was removed from  the Tanzanian Embassy in Kigali and is now flying on the truck.    The embassy in Kigali was closed many days ago. The  Tanzanians say they stayed outside the embassy in the sun and  rain without getting any assistance from the Rwandans who  claimed that President Habyarimana had been killed on his way  from Tanzania and therefore they should fend for themselves.  One woman told the Ngara district commissioner that she had  been on a visit to Kigali and had left her residence for a short  time. When she returned she found that all the Tanzanians in  the house had been killed by government troops and government  militia. The Tanzanians related that on their way home, they  received some assistance from RPF fighters.    They also said there are 40 other Tanzanians at the embassy  in Kigali without food who need assistance from the government  of Tanzania. [passage omitted]</p>

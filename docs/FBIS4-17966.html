			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- "Missile retargeting"  planned for this coming May is not to impair the combat  readiness of Russian missile forces, according to their  commander-in-chief, Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev.    In an interview with TASS after today's meeting with some  foreign military attaches, Sergeyev said the "retargeting" will  be performed in full accordance with the Moscow declaration  signed by the Russian and U.S. Presidents. Under this document,  Moscow and Washington are obliged to retarget their strategic  nuclear missiles by May 30, 1994, so that they should not be  targeted at each other. This initiative was also joined by  Great Britain.    According to experts, the scheme of retargeting is not  complicated: geographical reference of the targets in Russia and  the United States put in the computer working memory are  expected to be replaced by those of some desert areas of the  world ocean.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Hearings on baseball strike The current baseball strike reached the halls of Congress yesterday when a House judiciary subcommittee began hearings on whether the sport's team owners should continue to enjoy immunity from the nation's anti-trust laws. Mr Bud Selig, the acting commissioner of baseball, testified in favour of retaining the exemption and Mr Donald Fehr, chief of the players' union, against. Congressman Jack Brooks, the committee chairman, showed his colours by warning in advance that though the owners could hide from the fans they could not avoid Congress on anti-trust matters. But Congress is unlikely to vote until next year, at the earliest, with much possibly depending on whether next year's baseball season also remains in doubt. At issue is the 1922 Supreme Court ruling, written by the legendary Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. He wrote then, at a time when the sport was in difficulty, that although baseball was certainly a business it did not engage in 'commerce' in the 'normally accepted understanding of the word'. The anti-trust exemption permits the owners, in effect, to act as a cartel and removes from them the obligation of other than minimal disclosures of their finances and discussions.</p>

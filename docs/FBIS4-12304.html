			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Danger of a Nuclear War in the </F> Subcontinent -- the Need To Resolve the Kashmir Issue"]    [Text] Commenting on the visit of Strobe Talbott, the U.S.  deputy secretary of state, to the Indian subcontinent beginning  6 April, Voice of America [VOA] has said that the danger of the  outbreak of a nuclear war during the next few years is nowhere  in the world so great as in Asia. In view of this apprehension,  Talbott will exert pressure on Pakistan and India to end the  race to manufacture nuclear weapons and missiles. The VOA  commentary also expressed doubts about the success of Talbott's  visit because no country in the subcontinent can instantly sign  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. They might not even  be ready to have their nuclear installations inspected. This is  why the United States anticipates a growing danger of a nuclear  threat in the subcontinent.    The question is why the United States is not trying to find  out the reasons behind this serious threat. It has become  well-known throughout the world that India has repeatedly been  threatening a limited war on the Kashmir issue and trying to  establish a justification for it by alleging that Pakistan is  "abetting terrorists." Two wars had already been fought in the  subcontinent on Kashmir, and every time it was India which  started the aggression. At first, in 1948 it captured the  Muslim-majority state of Kashmir adjoining Pakistan by deviating  from the predetermined agenda on the partition and independence  of India. When this was resisted by the Kashmiris and Pakistan,  then India went to the United Nations where the Security Council  adopted a cease-fire resolution on the condition that the people  of Kashmir would be given an opportunity to freely express their  views on Kashmir's accession either to India or Pakistan.  Although India had then accepted the resolution, for the last  half a century it has been avoiding a plebiscite while claiming  Kashmir is an integral part of India.    Four years ago, the Kashmiri people indigenously launched a  crusade to get rid of the Indian yoke of slavery. India is  awfully baffled by the success of this struggle and it is quite  possible for her to embark on an onslaught against Pakistan  anytime as she did in the past. India has equipped itself with  the most modern, dangerous, and destructive weapons. It  expanded its blue water navy exceeding its legitimate defense  needs. It has been given the target of control in the Indian  Ocean region. [sentence as published] It did not stop there.  India turned itself into a nuclear power. It has been  confirmed by CIA records that India possesses enough enriched  uranium to produce 20 to 100 bombs. India's entire attention is  now focused to the production of long-range missiles as carriers  of nuclear warheads. It is conducting experiments in this  regard.    The irony is that India has not accepted any global  restriction on its nuclear program nor is it ready to sign the  NPT. Pakistan has every right to do everything to ensure its  defense. It can be said with full confidence that if India did  not dare wage a war so far, it was because of Pakistan's nuclear  program. Still, the Pakistani nuclear program is being made a  target of criticism by the United States and anti-Islamic  powers. The United States has even suspended economic and  military aid to Pakistan so as to exert pressure. It is  refusing to supply the F-16 planes to Pakistan although Pakistan  has already paid for them. It is being proposed now that  Pakistan will have to cap the nuclear program and sign the NPT  in future.    Pakistani Army Chief General Abdul Waheed is currently  visiting the United States. He has repeatedly made the position  clear that Pakistan is always willing to abandon its nuclear  program. It has repeatedly said that a solution to the nuclear  issue should be found on a regional basis and India should also  be included in the NPT so that at least a nuclear confrontation  in the Indian subcontinent can be averted. However, India not  only rejected the regional solution, it has also termed the NPT  contrary to its national interests. In fact, it is not in  Pakistan's interest either to sign the NPT without determining  the balance of power between Pakistan and India and securing a  guarantee for it. It is becoming more and more difficult for  Pakistan to counter India with conventional weapons. And in this  age, we cannot face India depending only on our faith in God,  because our faith in God has also dwindled.    The fact is that so long as the Kashmir issue remains  unresolved and a permanent peace agreement is not concluded  simultaneously, there will always be a threat of aggression from  India. Therefore, if the United States is interested, even  slightly, in establishing peace in the subcontinent, then it  becomes obligatory on the part of the United States to allow the  Kashmiris an opportunity to express their views as provided by  the Security Council resolutions. Obviously, at a time when the  Kashmiris are engaged in a jihad against the Indian troops,  their verdict will be in favor of accession to Pakistan. The  key to the establishment of peace in the subcontinent lies in  this verdict.</p>

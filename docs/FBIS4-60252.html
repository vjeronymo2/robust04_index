			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani, and  the deputies from the cities of Langrud, Jahrom, Ahvaz, and  Sanqar and Kolia'i gave speeches. Then the Majles took up its  agenda, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to  the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Law Transferring Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to </H5> Educational Units in the Ministry of Education and Training    The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the Health Care Commission's second  consultation on the Motion To Amend Article 1 of the Law  Transferring Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to  Educational Units in the Ministry of Education and Training,  enacted 9/12/1370 [3 December 1991], of which Article 1 was  approved by the deputies.    Article 1: The text of Article 1 of the Law Transferring  Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to Educational Units in  the Ministry of Education and Training enacted 9/12/1370 is  amended as follows, a note entitled Note 4 is appended, and its  existing Note 4 is changed to Note 5.    All health monitors in elementary schools who were trained  in  the supreme health care schools under the Ministry of Health  Care, Treatment and Medical Education are transferred to the  Ministry of Education and Training.    Note 4: As before, the responsibility for health care in the  schools (planning, policy making, manpower training and  implementation) in the framework of the nation's health care and  treatment network is the responsibility of the Ministry of  Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education.  <H5>  Bill Exempting Islamic Republic Shipping From Paying Taxes </H5> To Buy Ships    The second item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Economic, Financial and Cooperative Affairs  Commission concerning the Bill Exempting the Islamic Republic of  Iran Shipping Company From Paying Taxes on the Portion of Its  Profits Allocated To Buy Ships. A member of the Economic Affairs  Commission discussed the reasons for rejecting this bill. He  said: If every organization is going to avoid paying taxes, how  can we expect others to pay them? If taxes are not collected,  how are going to implement development projects? Implementation  of these projects depends on collecting taxes.    He then added: On the one hand we want to free ourselves  from  dependence, and on the other hand we want to have tax  exemptions. These two things do not go together. If tax  exemptions are made every day, the government will not be able  to carry out its responsibilities.    One of the bill's supporters said: If we exempt them, they  will be able to buy a ship every year. Since ships are very  important and vital for us, they must therefore be tax exempt  for this purpose.    After talks by supporters and opponents, the general form of  the aforementioned bill was put to a vote and approved.  <H5>  Parviz Siqali, Deputy From Langrud </H5>   A recent imperialist plot is to make the people disappointed  in their past performance    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Siqali, deputy from Langrud. He observed the  martyrdom anniversary of the acting commander of the Gilan 16  Qods Army. He discussed the Great Satan's plot to reduce the  price of oil and the appropriate procedures adopted by the  president of the republic to deal with the crisis of the severe  drop in oil prices. Continuing, he added: If the price of a  barrel of oil increased to $30 instead of $12, and if we had a  foreign exchange surplus instead of a foreign exchange deficit,  we would repay our foreign debts on time and a positive answer  would be given to the rightful demands of the Majles deputies  and others. If the price of a dollar were less than 100 tomans,  would we have the same views and judgments we have today?  Clearly the answer is no. We all know that the price of oil is  an international issue, and that Iran's role in OPEC is not  constructive.    He also said: The recent imperialist plots were planned in  calculated frameworks, and in difficult economic circumstances,  psychological and spiritual pressure will be applied in the  following areas:    (1) Disappointing the people in their performance;    (2) Portraying the dimensions of Islam as ineffective and  not  world-inclusive in the management of a country;    (3) Portraying the government as weak in terms of its stated  goals, and in short it will seek to draw the conclusion that the  slogans of the splendid period of the Islamic revolution have  not been realized.    Siqali said that nothing more than this is to be expected  from foreign enemies, and if they change their position on the  course of the Islamic revolution one must be skeptical. He said:  How must one deal with domestic enemies, who consider themselves  Muslims following the leader's path, but in practice act in  secret hypocritical opposition to God, his Prophet, the vice  regent of the Muslims and the sacred government of the Islamic  Republic?    The speaker discussed the fact that the Imam of the Age's  (may God hasten his joyful advent) nameless soldiers clearly  know them better than anyone, and they know well that they are  busy every day collecting the assets of the people and the  government, putting unworthy people in the nation's sensitive  and key positions, and having vulgar gatherings at night for  debauchery. Continuing, he said: They call collecting countless  coins and hundreds of millions of tomans the giving of gifts,  and today the taking of bribes is rampant in Islamic society;  large and small acts of embezzlement are seen in the offices,  the government companies, the banks and other places. Sometimes  it is reported in the high-circulation newspapers. The people  are asking the officials how these people must be dealt with,  and what level of divine punishment should be applied to them.    Siqali then discussed the fact that the province of Gilan  has  been forgotten, and the people are asking the deputies, what  national development projects have been carried out in this  province since the Islamic revolution, other than the during the  earthquake issue, which opened the eyes of many ministers. In  this same regard he added: More than 85 percent of the villages  in Gilan do not have drinking water and its cities are no better  off. The rural roads are not suitable and about 60 percent of  the province's villages do not have the benefit of electrical  power.    Continuing, he said: The communications networks are in the  worst condition. The Qazvin-Rasht road has taken the lives of  many travelers and has become known today as a killing ground.  At the same time, this province does not have a railroad. The  famous Rasht airport is an airport in name only. On the shores  of the Caspian Sea the passenger and freight shipping lines do  not have coastal cities or multipurpose ports, and nothing has  been done about them in the planning for province development.    At the end of his speech, the deputy from Langrud discussed  the fact that based on the report from the Fisheries Company,  revenues from caviar exports were about $100 million. If the  dollar is worth 200 tumans this year, revenues from the sale of  caviar are about 20 tumans billion, yet net fishermen, with high  costs of living, live by the skin of their teeth or drown. In  the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] three people drowned  under very suspicious circumstances. At the first opportunity I  told the governor-general of Gilan, the minister of the  reconstruction crusade and the minister of the interior that the  reason for the drownings is still shrouded in ambiguity.  <H5>  Mohammad Mehdi Shoja'ifard, Deputy From Jahrom </H5>   Today, thanks to this government, the Imam's Aid Committee  even pays the educational expenses of college students it covers.    The second preagenda speaker was Shoja'ifard, deputy from  Jahrom. During his speech he said: It makes the nation more  optimistic when we compare the nation's various affairs before  and after the revolution with other countries.    He discussed the nation's economic situation. He said:  Before  the revolution, 85 to 90 percent of the people had economic  problems, yet today, thanks to the Islamic government and  through the efforts of the officials and the president of the  republic, more than 80 percent of the people have no basic  economic problems.    Before the revolution, did the poor receive a million rials  in any city from the Imam's Aid Committee, as they did in  Jahrom? Where was it possible for a student to study easily is  he so desired? The speaker continued: Today, thanks to this  government, the Imam's Aid Committee even pays the educational  expenses of the college students it covers. I want the Voice and  Vision organization to cover this subject. Compare the security  issues. Today in America itself, which is proclaiming the new  world order, this nation's students are being searched in the  junior high schools.    Shoja'ifard thanked the minister of the interior for dealing  with the nation's security problems. He noted: Currently when  most of the nations of the world want to keep themselves among  the people, they announce in some way that they have relations  with the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Continuing, the deputy from Jahrom discussed the Palestine  issue. He said: We declare that emigration to Israel should not  take place, for it will be regretted.    In conclusion, he said: In view of the fact that the Majles  has guaranteed the purchase of the date crop, 15,000 tons of  dates are now rotting in Jahrom. I also further advise Mr.  Rafiqdust that he must pay more attention to wounded war  veterans and not lay this burden on the government. If he gives  one-third of the foundation's revenues to the wounded war  veterans, that is sufficient.  <H5>  'Ali Maturi, Deputy From Ahvaz </H5>   Are we adhering to the religious and lawful principle of  supervision in the way that we should?    The next speaker was Maturi, deputy from Ahvaz. In his  speech  he said: Along with the astonishing and undeniable glory that  has come to us and the ray of hope that has come into the heart  of each and every believer and oppressed person in the world,  are we adhering to the religious and lawful principle of  supervision in the way that we should? Or have we contented  ourselves with a few investigations and interpellations? To  understand the intellectual and moral poisons in order to  develop a work ethic and social order, which was discussed by  the exalted leader and could be the cure for all our social and  economic problems, have we made the same effort that we have  made to solve the traffic problem or the poisons caused by  automobile exhaust and factory smoke in the city of Tehran, with  all the investments, discussions, debates, observations and  media reports, which are also themselves quite necessary?    He added: Have we given careful attention to what the  exalted  leader has said, with his divine insight, in his message to the  new chief of the Voice and Vision organization? Have we  presented that to society as a cultural and political message?  Truly, this illuminating and path-finding message, along with  the fateful messages of the late Imam, should be revived as  standard equipment for the journeys of society's cultural and  educational thinkers, artists and officials. If we apply the  contents of these messages, we will no longer be confused about  how to deal with videos and satellites.    The deputy from Ahvaz discussed the enemy plot to diminish  the importance of our involvement in international affairs,  especially the World Haj Conference. He said: We must think  about how to answer these clever plots. Today the international  battlefield is a political and cultural battlefield, and the  world is clever and deceitful.    Our enemy controls all the resources and even all the  international organizations. In this commercial fair we must  purvey our values with clarity, sincerity and faith, and in this  regard we must adopt the best procedures and the soundest paths.    Maturi then discussed the problems in his electoral  district.  He said: Apparently the project to develop sugarcane and the  ancillary industries was intended to develop Khuzestan and solve  the problems of unemployment and national production.  Unfortunately, however, it must be said that not only has the  area's unemployment problem not been solved, but in effect it  has also multiplied the problem by several hundred times, and by  taking over working lands instead of unused lands and making  refugees of farmers, it has sent them to the cities and to false  employment. I ask the respected Majles supervisors and also the  minister of agriculture to supervise the course of this great  national project more carefully.    He asked the minister of the reconstruction crusade and the  officials of the nation's Deprived Regions Office to look  realistically at the numerous problems in the deprived villages  of Ahvaz, and to look kindly upon these deprived villages with  serious help, especially with regard to solving the drinking  water problem.    He added: Cutting the reconstruction budget for the  municipality of Ahvaz is great oppression, which has been  visited upon the noble people in the years since the war. I  earnestly implore Mr. Mirzadeh to put an end to this undesirable  situation.    Several times I have asked the governor-general of Khuzestan  and the minister of the interior to make the village of  Jamidiyeh into a district.    In conclusion, he thanked the chief of the Physical Training  Organization for stabilizing the current situation in Khuzestan,  and he thanked the Soccer Federation for guiding the South Ahvaz  team to the Asian Cup games.  <H5>  Barat'ali Mohammadifar, Deputy From Sanqar and Koliya'i </H5>   Unfortunately as yet no conclusive result has been announced  on the research and investigation in the province of Kermanshah.    The final preagenda speaker was Mohammadifar, deputy from  Sanqar and Koliya'i. During his talk he expressed severe regret  at the statement from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Pilgrimage  prohibiting the distribution of any kind of books or photographs  during the Haj rites, and reducing the number of visitors to the  house of God. He said: The Muslims of the world have a question  to ask of a government that considers itself the servant of the  shrines. According to what criteria of religious law are Islamic  books and books on the Haj rites prohibited in Saudi Arabia  during the days of the rites of Abraham's Haj?    Mohammadifar said that the declaration of this prohibition  by  the Government of Saudi Arabia is a violation of a clear verse  from the Koran and it is a violation of a tradition of the  Prophet (peace be upon him). He said: We hope that the  Government of Saudi Arabia will come to its senses and not carry  out orders that violate the commands of Islam and the Koran.    He then discussed the research and investigation in the  province of Kermanshah, which the Majles has been studying for  almost two years, and whose report has been published for the  public's information by the Majles. He said: Unfortunately a  definitive conclusion has not yet been announced on this for the  martyr-nurturing people of the province of Kermanshah. In view  of the repeated letters that have been written and the protests  the people of the province have sent to the province deputies  and even to the Article 90 Commission concerning the lack of a  careful report and a trial of the violators, we ask the chief of  the Article 90 Commission to prepare this report as soon as  possible and send it to the respected chief of the judiciary so  the violators can be tried and punished. In conclusion, the  deputy from Sanqar and Kolia'i thanked the government and the  chief of the Deprived Areas Office for declaring his electoral  district a deprived municipality and he thanked the chief of the  Plan and Budget Organization for allocating a significant budget  to build the Sanqar road.  <H5>  revolution Courts Have Right To Hear Cases on the Return of </H5> Confiscated Assets    Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  judiciary  and the courts are dealing harshly with the narcotics issue, and  the American government's claim that drugs are being transported  through Iran is completely without basis.    Ayatollah Moqteda'i, chief of the National Supreme Court,  announced the above. He added: More than 40 tons of morphine was  confiscated in the years 1360-1372 [21 March 1981-20 March  1994], yet there is absolutely no domestic consumption of  morphine. Smugglers were transporting this cargo for  distribution in Europe and America.    The chief of the National Supreme Court, speaking yesterday  morning at a gathering of media correspondents, continued:  Recently baseless and purposeful statements have been made by  American leaders that the Gvernment of Iran is smuggling  narcotics across the country. Now, after approval from the  Interests Discernment Council, the revolution courts system is  dealing harshly with the issue of narcotics and narcotics  smuggling.    He added: Fatal blows have been dealt to narcotics smugglers  and smugglers by the revolution courts and the police forces.  The statistics on prisoners, 60 percent of whom are in prison  for narcotics crimes, are good testimony to this.    At the beginning of his talk Ayatollah Moqteda'i discussed  the duty of the National Supreme Court, the appeals procedure in  the branch court and its procedures for dealing with  deficiencies, reversals, and upheld verdicts. He then discussed  statistics. He said: In the year 1372, 39,000 cases reached the  branch courts, of which 38,850 were heard and closed. There were  also 12,912 open cases at the beginning of the year 1373 [21  March 1994], which are being heard in the branch court. All  these existing cases are from the second half of the year 1372.    Elsewhere in his talk, the chief of the National Supreme  Court discussed the establishment of a Supervisory Unit in the  court. He said: For judges whose verdicts come to the court, we  have prepared a case folder to see how often a judge's verdicts  are reversed and how often they are upheld. This is itself a  criterion for understanding judges and their benefits and  promotions so judges can be evaluated for quantity and quality.  In this regard all files that have more than 250 reversals are  collected. We print them and make them available to the judges.    He discussed the investigation of special cases. He said:  Rapid investigation of special cases such as murder, kidnapping,  armed robbery, and other things has shown that there are few of  these kinds of crimes and this type of investigation has had a  useful effect reducing the crimes.    He then discussed the public, revolution and general courts,  whose details have recently been approved by the Majles. He  said: The system of general courts has many distinctions,  including the two main goals of the courts, which are rapid  investigation and arriving at truth and reality. Of course there  are also problems, which are gradually being corrected.    Continuing, he compared the current judicial system with the  system intended for the general courts. He said the current  system, with public and revolution prosecutors, has weaknesses,  and the approval of the general courts system will solve the  current problems in the judiciary.    Ayatollah Moqteda'i said one of the duties of the National  Supreme Court is to create unity in judicial procedures by  forming a General National Supreme Court Council. He said: If  there is conflict between two level-one legal courts or two  level-two penal courts in dealing with a law, the general  council will convene to deal with the conflict. The majority  opinion of the meeting will have the force of law as a unified  judicial procedure.    Continuing, he noted: In the year 1372 there were 26  meetings  of the general council and 74 cases were discussed and closed.  There were 11 unified judicial procedure cases, and the rest  were penal or legal demands.    He discussed three instances of unified judicial procedures  in the year 1372. He added: One of them had to do with cases  where the revolution courts ordered confiscation of property,  and individuals came to the legal courts with documents, letters  of guarantee, checks or other documents and demanded the return  of their confiscated assets. With a unified procedure, the court  gave the verdict: Since these cases were heard by the revolution  courts and the confiscation order was given, the return of the  assets and claims in this regard must be also be heard in the  revolution courts.    Another case had to do with crimes of smuggling goods, where  individuals evaded customs regulations and the courts gave  discounts. This led to the spread of smuggling of goods and no  fines were collected for the smuggled goods. The National  Supreme Court gave a unified procedures verdict that fines on  smuggled goods cannot be discounted. It announced that this is  crime subject to government fines and that these must be  collected under the law. On the other hand, nongovernment fines  may be changed in accordance with the opinion of the religious  magistrate.    The third case had to do with security crimes. The question  was whether this crime is private, public or both. The court's  view was that security crimes are both private and public, and  even if the private plaintiff declines to prosecute, the court  will not decline because of the public aspect.    At the end of his speech, Ayatollah Moqteda'i discussed the  case of Jalal al-Din Farsi. He said: After a protest from the  Tehran Public Prosecutor, Mr. Farsi's case came to the court and  was referred to Branch Court 11. After a careful study of the  case the problems with the verdict were considered. Of course,  these basic problems did not overturn the verdict. That is, the  judges of the court believed that it was manslaughter, but there  were defects in the quality of the argumentation and the  evidence, and they raised an objection during the full defense.  The charge of manslaughter was upheld, however, and it was sent  to the penal court that issued the verdict to be returned after  removal of the defects.</p>

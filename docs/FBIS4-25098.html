			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>   [Text] Following top-level discussions with China's  economic czar, Zhu Rongji, one of Hong Kong's business leaders  is now convinced that the gloom over the country is being  overdone and the economy is being brought under control. "He  (Mr Zhu) feels very confident that what he's done, and some of  the measures he's put in, are beginning to show signs of moving  the overall economy in the right direction," said Mr Paul Cheng,  who led a Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce delegation to  Beijing last week.    Mr Cheng, the chamber's former chairman, said that, in a 90-  minute meeting with Mr Zhu, the Chinese vice-premier revealed  some key numbers which "provided some confidence to our  delegation that things are basically under control".    Mr Zhu said:    -- The amount of money issued, which doubled a year ago, was  down to 20 percent year-on-year.    -- The rate of heavy construction investment was down to 30  percent from 70 percent a year ago.    -- The yuan had been maintained at a stable level of 8.7 to  the US dollar over the last few months.    -- The profitability of the state sector increased 40  percent  in the first four months, although growth rose only five per  cent.    -- Foreign reserves were up to US$30 billion, from $21.1  billion in January.    Mr Cheng said Mr Zhu was optimistic that he could bring both  the country's annual economic growth and inflation to 10  percent, although the former chamber leader forecast higher  inflation. "(Mr Zhu) He maintains that inflation and gross  national product growth will both be 10 percent. He thinks he  can still do it, although my own view is that inflation will  probably be higher," he said. Asked if he detected a hard-sell  approach by Mr Zhu, Mr Cheng said: "I didn't detect any  overselling on his part. He was just stating the facts to us."    China's economy expanded by 13.4 per cent last year, while  inflation reached 14.7 percent on a national level and 19.6  percent in the major cities. Such unsustainable rates have  prompted calls by foreign economists to rein in the runaway  economy before serious structural and social problems set in.    Last month, for example, World Bank managing director Ernest  Stern urged Beijing to manage the overheating economy and  inflation if it wanted economic growth to continue. In slowing  economic growth to nine percent and inflation to 10 percent,  China has, among other things, clamped down on new fixed-asset  investments -- except for state-approved projects -- issued  bonds to finance the budget deficit and tightened lending to  state enterprises.    Mr Zhu suggested that through the media, foreigners had  overstated the seriousness of China's economic overheating. Mr  Cheng said: "He was not denying that the economy was overheated  to some degree, but he said you need to understand why the  economy arrived at that stage."    Mr Zhu produced figures which Mr Cheng said he had never  seen  put together before. The vice-premier said one reason for the  overheating was colossal infrastructure investment, and that no  country in the world had devoted the sort of attention to  capital construction that China did last year. He said that  last year alone, the country installed almost 2,000 miles of  railways and highways, 15 million telephone lines and 15 million  kilowatts of power generation capacity. "No country ever in its  history has pumped all these activities in one year. Naturally,  you could create a sort of ballooning effect," Mr Cheng quoted  the Chinese leader as saying.    Mr Zhu said another cause of inflation had been the increase  in farm produce prices to shore up the agriculture sector in an  effort to check the shift of the farming population to coastal  areas in search of better jobs. Mr Cheng said: "They have to  raise farm produce prices to keep the incentive for farmers to  stay and continue to shore up that side of the economy. And, by  raising the prices, you're bound to fuel inflation."    The vice-premier said he would wait for reforms in place to  filter through before considering additional measures to preen  the economy. In spite of the inevitable provincial resistance  to the tax reforms implemented in January, 22 percent extra had  been collected in tax revenue in the first four months of the  year, compared with the same period last year.    Mr Zhu added that the state sector's share of the economy  had  fallen to 48 percent, and that half of those losing money were  small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Cheng said: "What he's  trying to say is that the major organisations are doing okay,  but a lot of the small and medium ones are not doing so well.    "And when he puts in his reform measures, naturally, the  impact will be heavier on the small and medium enterprises.</p>

Last week, in fact, Jean Sollier, SEP's CEO, confirmed "the  perfect agreement" prevailing on this issue with Gerard Renon,  SNECMA's CEO. He, in turn, had recently stated that it was a  "natural" idea to merge the brake (Messier-Bugatti) and brake  disks (SEP) manufacturers.    It also "makes sense" to Jean Sollier "to ally the aircraft  brakes manufacturer and the supplier of carbon-carbon disks."  According to him, such activities presently account for nearly  FF700 million at Messier-Bugatti (that controls between one  quarter and one fifth of the carbon brakes market in aerospace)  and for about FF170 million at SEP for aircraft and automobile  brake disks.    Still, nothing has yet been done for this regrouping. As  SEP's president says: "The industrial project still needs to be  built, the formula for association spelled out, participations  regulated, etc." He emphasized that "if the merger is to occur,  it will obviously be in 1994!"    For, as he puts it: "This merger will allow the new team to  win market shares. The prospects are good." And over a few years  the activity could engender more than FF1 billion in turnover,  considering that the two teams already are well established in  civilian and military aircraft brakes, with the Airbus and the  Mirage 2000.    It is Jean Sollier's view that the joint team could also  launch into brakes for trucks and the railway. SEP has already  made a stab in this direction, for example, with Formula-1  carbon brake disks and those for top-of-the-line cars (Venturi  and Bugatti) and trials on high-speed trains. But real  development would come from equipping trucks, busses and rail  coaches, and even future generations of the Very High-Speed  Train [TGV].    But if the merger of brake and disk activities between  Messier-Bugatti and SEP is successful (in several months), Jean  Sollier will already have won the wager made in 1990 to  diversify SEP's consolidated activity upwards of FF1 billion in  1995. It represents a gambit that already saw the opening move  made last year with the buy-back from GEC-Alsthom of its (50  percent) share in Carbone Industrie that will realize a turnover  of more than FF230 million in 1993.</p>

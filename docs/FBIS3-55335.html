			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report under the "Yesterday" rubric: </F> "Russia and NATO"]    [Text] A NATO session at the level of heads of state and  government opened in Brussels yesterday. It is assumed that two  key decisions will be adopted: Readiness to accept new members  into the bloc has been expressed, and the start of the  implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" program, aimed at  closer military-political cooperation between NATO and the  countries of the former socialist community, has been announced.    The insistent knocking on NATO's door by a number of former  Warsaw Pact countries -- first and foremost Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia, joined by Lithuania in the past  few days -- has provoked a negative response from Moscow, which  with every justification assesses the possible eastward  expansion of the North Atlantic alliance as a manifestation of  bloc ideology and an attempt to isolate Russia from Europe-wide  processes. This assessment was voiced in a statement made by  Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian Federation president's press  secretary, and a number of speeches made by Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev. "The over-hasty eastward expansion of NATO has  the potential to provoke the development of a most terrible  scenario," the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed  notably during an interview with the German FRANKURTER  RUNDSCHAU. "It will deliver into the hands of extremists in  Russia a strong argument in favor of the need to revive the  Russian empire in order to resist the 'offensive from the West.'"    According to Andrey Kozyrev, the fears about a renewed  "threat from the east" about which our neighbors have been  talking recently can be dispelled first and foremost through the  strategy of partnership with democratic Russia, which is moving  toward a rule of law state and a market economy. Those who talk  about some kind of "aggressive" policy in Europe on Moscow's  part are in no position to cite any specific evidence.    Nevertheless, East Europeans have the right to obtain  greater  guarantees for their security. No one is disputing this. But  they can be secured in practice without becoming a permanent  member of any military-political alliance. In particular, this  aim can be achieved by carrying out the strategy of partnership  in political questions, as well as in the sphere of security,  put forward by Russia. As we know, Washington has agreed to  this idea, formulating it in the "Partnership for Peace"  program, as have the capitals of other European states. Right  away, on his first day in Brussels, U.S. President Bill Clinton  noted: "The changes which have occurred in recent years in the  international arena require the NATO allies to review the  organization's role and channel efforts into developing  partnership with the East European countries which have embarked  on the path of democracy."    Other Western leaders agree with this stance. "I am in favor  of NATO's expanding its relations with Russia in the security  sphere," FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated on the eve of the  Brussels summit. At the same time, he especially stressed the  need to dispel concerns that the West is pursing a line aimed at  isolating Russia. Speaking in turn about the North Atlantic  alliance's East Europe strategy, NATO Secretary General Manfred  Woerner stressed that the alliance's leadership has not yet  determined specific dates for new members to join the bloc.    Today we will find out how close these statements are to  specific actions. But one thing is clear: Without Russia's  participation, security in Europe is impossible.</p>

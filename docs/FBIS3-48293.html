			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Norikazu Ozaki: "Interest Rate Response </F> Dull, No Growth in Long-Term Fixed Rate Loans"]    [Text] Generally, corporate borrowing at fixed  interest rates over long-term should increase at times of low  interest rates, but the long-term fund needs of corporations are  as weak as ever. There is the effect of the burst of the bubble,  but the high yen has made a big, direct attack on the major loan  clients of long-term credit banks. The will for capital  investments in the auto, electronics, and machinery [industries]  has withered. There also is intense competition with life  insurers and government affiliates on long-term fixed rate  loans. For the time being, demand for funds has been limited to  non-expansionary short-term funds such as inventory funds or  high interest transfer portions.  <H5>  Miscalculation of Second Half Recovery </H5>   The long-term prime rate, which is the standard for the loan  interest rates of long-term credit banks, dropped to the lowest  level in the past (4.8 percent) in September. It reflected the  recent weak economic trend and further dropped to 4.5 percent in  October. However, regardless of this historically low interest,  it is the consensus view of the three long-term credit banks  that "unfortunately, it has not been linked to increases in  loans."    Viewed by business sector, long-term credit bank loan growth  has continued to be minus since last year and the sluggishness  has continued to be less than that for other business sectors  such as city banks, regional banks, and trust banks. Generally,  in a low interest rate situation like the present, long-term  fixed rate borrowing naturally has been desired by corporations,  but that is not so. "While stock adjustments are continuing, the  interest response has been low." (Takashi Watanabe, chief of  Business Development Section, Business Planning No. 2  Department, Nippon Credit Bank)    It seems that the loan growth for the three long-term credit  banks was much less than initially anticipated for the first  half of this year. When all is said and done, the greatest  factor has been that the actual state of the economy has been by  far worse than forecasted. Amidst this, the fact that "the rapid  high yen has withered the corporate investment mind" has had an  effect. (Hitoshi Nakamura, councillor, Business Planning  Department, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan) The recent high yen  has directly attacked the leading industries of Japan such as  autos, electronics, and machinery. These can be called the most  important clients of long-term credit banks. Although the high  yen has not directly made bank earnings a minus, it is not a  stranger to long-term credit banks which have business financing  as their principle aim.    However, the degree of worry is greater for the second half  to come rather than the first half which has passed. In the  annual plan, the first half had been positioned as a so-to-speak  "time for patience" when the demand for funds would not  increase. Therefore, the minus level for the growth in loans  could be tolerated. However, signs of a recovery in the real  economy were seen for the second half and a scenario of "a time  to grasp business chances" was painted. However, anxiety has  deepened where "there even is apprehension that the bottom will  fall out of economy and the future is completely cloudy."    Furthermore, although it can be called loan sluggishness in  short, the quality has greatly changed. Let's take a bird's eye  view of the content of loans from last fiscal year to this  fiscal year.    In the first half of fiscal 1992, the burst of the bubble  was  actualized, and the demand for funds related to Tokyo  metropolitan area real estate, which had played a major role in  new borrowing, stopped. Like city banks, long-term credit banks  had the goal of improving the contents of assets and exercised  self discipline on real estate related lending. Upon entering  the second half, one after the other withdrew from so-called  financial engineering such as reducing the finance division  centering on trading companies. This appeared in the form that  the demand for funds by non-banks stopped in long-term credit  banks. Then in the first half of fiscal 1993, with the advance  of the high yen and sluggish economy, plant and equipment  investment funds for export industries such as auto,  electronics, and machinery also just about stopped.    The net increase amount in loans for the Long-term Credit  Bank of Japan for the second half of fiscal 1992 dropped to  one-third of the first half of fiscal 1992, and further fell to  half of that in the first half of fiscal 1993. If it continues  this way, there is a fear that the net increase in loans for the  second half of fiscal 1993 will end up zero.    "If the level of 1 dollar equals 105 to 112 yen remains  fixed, the demand for funds probably will continue bottoming  until the first half of next fiscal year," say the three banks  in unison.  <H5>  Shift to Short-Term Borrowing </H5>   The increase in loans for all three banks has become a minus  of about 1 percent over the previous year, but that does not  mean that there have been no new loans up to now. Viewing the  breakdown of first half loans by long-term credit banks, "the  greatest minus factors are the cancellation of hedging loans by  trading companies and the withdrawal of funds from non-banks. As  opposed to this, it was equity bond redemption funds centering  on large firms and plant and equipment funds for some medium and  medium to small firms centering on the manufacturing industry  that increased as the demand for new borrowing." (Tsutomu Abe,  deputy chief, Business Department, Industrial Bank of Japan)    However, it seems that the expectations are weak that this  portion which increased as new demand in the first half will be  firm in the second half and thereafter. That is to say,  redemption of equity bonds will peak this year and will decrease  as a whole next year and thereafter. It seems that there also  are many "who have shifted to procurement by straight bonds."  (Watanabe) Moreover, borrowing by medium and medium to small  firms, which had been comparatively firm up until now,  inevitably will have a minus increase in the second half," like  large firms. (Nakamura) At the present time, the balance itself  in the case of long-term credit banks has not greatly dropped  immediately because there is a demand for conversion of the  contract repayment portion. However, there are no prospects for  enough new loans to cover the withdrawal portion other than  contract repayment created in the process of changing the  composition of asset portfolios and it appears that "it  inevitably will be a difficult situation for one to two years."  (same)    The current demand for funds seems to have become limited to  non-expansionary short-term funds, which do not make [the banks]  very happy, such as inventory funds and transfers for high  interest portions.    The fact that long-term loans are not increasing is greatly  related to the view on interest rates and corporate profits. At  the present time, the city bank short-term prime rate has become  3.25 percent and the margin with the long-term prime rate is  over 1 percent. In the borrowing of funds which they inherently  wanted to be long-term and fixed, there seems to be a tendency  in firms which have fund procurement capability to alleviate the  recent interest rate burden by immediately rolling over with  short-term borrowing.  <H5>  Securing Rather Than Increasing </H5>   What should they do if loans do not increase? Naturally, the  future environment will not be an extension of the past. First  of all, above all, "it is necessary to deepen the relationship  further with business companies." (Abe) In other words, it will  be necessary to cooperate and demonstrate their special  character as long-term credit banks by indicating a new vision  on changes of the industrial structure which is in upheaval.    Amidst this, the loan goals for the second half will not be  established that high. "It is presumed that growth will be about  the same as the growth of the nominal GNP." (Industrial Bank of  Japan) So, it tells the painful feeling that "it is not a time  to take chances. Conversely, we must have a constitution to  produce earnings even with this much of an increase."    Long-term credit banks are procuring funds by bonds,  especially 5-year interest bearing bank debentures. For this  reason, the ALM must be viewed in a longer range than city  banks. At the present time, the high coupon wide of the fall of  1990 still remains and while loans do not increase, this will  become a big factor in holding down earnings. It seems that they  will be forced to take difficult risk control in the next one to  two years.</p>

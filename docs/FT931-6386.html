			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / M0 growth lifts retail sales hopes CASH IN circulation grew strongly last month, raising hopes that retail sales continued to rise in February, according to Bank of England figures released yesterday. Narrow money, M0 - consisting mainly of notes and coins in circulation  - increased by a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent in the year to February. The rise breached the government's official target range of zero to 4 per cent for the second consecutive month. In the year to January M0 rose by 4.1 per cent. However, Treasury officials indicated that the latest increase was unlikely to prompt tighter monetary policy. Other indicators are showing different trends. Growth of the broad money measure M4 - M0 plus bank and building society deposits - is below the floor of its 4 per cent to 8 per cent monitoring range and inflation indices continue to point to disinflationary pressures in the economy. The 0.7 per cent month-on-month rise in M0 in February points to buoyant consumer spending. A number of other factors could explain the higher than expected monthly and annual increases in the narrow measure of the money supply. Economists said recent reductions in base rates to 6 per cent meant that there was less incentive for people to hold money in savings accounts, which could account for the boost to cash in circulation. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'Low interest rates means that once money is withdrawn it stays out for longer.' At the same time borrowing on credit cards, the rates for which have stayed relatively high, is expensive and is acting as a further incentive to use cash rather than credit. The strong growth of M0 might also reflect the fact that people are buying cheaper goods that can be purchased with cash, rather than expensive durable goods. Mr Bootle said: 'I suspect that there is rather a lot in the balance of all these factors and it would not be the first time that a monetary indicator is giving a misleading picture.' Many retailers say the rise in sales that started over the Christmas and new year period was maintained into February. The British Retail Consortium said yesterday it expected February's trading figures to be 'reasonable.' WH Smith said the firmer tone that came in after Christmas has been broadly maintained. Sales were stronger both compared with the same time last year and with the autumn period. The John Lewis Partnership said its department store chain had seen encouraging sales growth of 5.9 per cent for the first three weeks of February compared with the same period last year. Revised figures from the Bank of England showed that bank and building society lending to the private sector rose in January by Pounds 4.36bn after a fall of Pounds 198m in December.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova, </F> Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, and Vladimir Shekhovtsov]    [Text] Madrid April 13 TASS -- "It is not an easy thing to  establish cooperation with Russia now, but it is a promising  venture," said Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a meeting with  members of the Spanish business community on Tuesday.    He noted that Russia was reviewing its attitude to the  international trade system and mechanisms regulating its  activities, "taking into account, among other things, our  accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a  full member".    According to the president, this move will meet the  interests  of both Russia and GATT member states. Its participation in  GATT will help to strengthen the multilateral trade system and  to create stable conditions for the access of foreign goods to  the vast Russian market.    Yeltsin said that the Russian Government is now engaged in  drafting a new foreign economic legislation. He said that "it  provides for using the most favoured nation regime, granting the  national regime to goods from other countries, cutting and  liberalising customs tariffs as the main instrument of foreign  trade regulation as well as slashing and repealing later quotas  and licencing of exports".    As a result of talks with GATT, the Russian leader  continued,  the sides drafted a memorandum on Russia's foreign trade regime,  signed a joint declaration on the main principles of relations  between Russia and the European Community.    "Our firm line is to simplify capital investments in  Russia,"  he stressed. Preferential tax and customs regime will be  established for foreign investors in many cases.    Yeltsin called equality and responsible interaction with the  EC as a priority area of Russia's economic cooperation with the  outside world. The main thing here is to complete work as soon  as possible on an agreement on partnership and cooperation  between Russia and the EC, he underlined.    The agreement will also give an impetus to stepping up trade  and economic relations with Spain.    The question of guarantees occupies a prominent place in  establishing mutually advantageous cooperation, the president  continued. The Russian company on investment insurance,  recently registered abroad, is an important instrument for  tackling this problem.    It was established to insure foreign investors from  political  risks.    Russian legislation in the sphere of investments will be  also  improved, the Russian leader noted. He informed the gathering  that a Russian-Spanish conference on investments will be held in  Madrid and Barcelona in May. The Russian round of the  conference is planned to be held in Moscow in July.    "Russia should be both advantageous and predictable trading  partner," Yeltsin underlined.    According to the president, the scale and areas of  Russian-Spanish economic cooperation are much lower than  possibilities of the two countries.    Spanish firms could participate more actively in setting up  small and medium enterprises and industrial cooperative  societies in Russia and could be more active in establishing  joint ventures, the president said in conclusion.</p>

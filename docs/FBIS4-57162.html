			<p>BFN     [Text] The Peruvian mission charged with promoting Peru's  good image abroad returned to Lima this morning after a  successful tour of several European countries. Economy Minsiter  Jorge Camet also returned from Europe, where he attended the  World Bank consultative meeting in Paris, France.    Confiep [National Confederation of Private Businesses]  Chairman Arturo Woodman praised the agreement reached with  international financial institutions.    Economy Minister Jorge Camet asserted that the $1.1 billion  in aid granted to Peru by the international financial community  will be invested primarily in social programs. Upon his return  from the World Bank consultative meeting in Paris, Camet said  the letter of intent submitted by the Peruvian Government to the  IMF reflects the reforms adopted by the executive branch with  the objective of curbing inflation.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Walter Samuel Leiva] [words  indistinct] are you satisfied and happy with the results  obtained at the meeting?    [Camet] Yes, I am satisfied.    [Leiva] How will these funds be invested, sir?    [Camet] There are concessionary and normal loans totalling  $850 million that will be used in infrastructure and social  programs. We also have $250 million in donations.    [Leiva] What are the terms for these loans?    [Camet] Some of them are concessionary loans and others are  normal loans -- in addition to the donations I have already  mentioned.    [Leiva] In how many installments?    [Camet] Well, this is for the whole of 1994.    [Leiva] What are your comments on the letter of intent that  the Peruvian Government has submitted to the IMF?    [Camet] Well, the letter of intent was drafted by the  Central  Bank and the Economy Ministry, and it reflects the government's  economic reform program and the goals we intend to achieve:  about a 20 percent inflation rate and a growth in reserves by  $150,000, that is, more than $300 billion. [end recording]    Economy Minister Jorge Camet added that the current economic  program will remain unchanged. He said there will be no changes  because the government intends to continue curbing the inflation  rate and eradicating extreme poverty in Peru.    He said the Peruvian business mission's European tour, which  ended today, was very positive. The Peruvian mission was headed  by Industry Minister Liliana Canale and Peruvian businessmen,  among them Confiep Chairman Arturo Woodman.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: TV activity Reports that the 'big nine' UK television companies will shortly be allowed to bid for each other prompted activity among a number of TV stocks. Of the nine, the two strongest bid candidates are seen as HTV, which jumped almost 10 per cent, gaining 4 at 50p, and Anglia, which rose 9 to 296p. Of the potential bidders, Carlton added 17 at 756p, although more on consideration of results earlier in the week. Central, which might be poised to launch a bid for Anglia but could be attacked by Carlton as it already owns 20 per cent, advanced 15 to 1888p. Ulster TV, which would not be affected by any regulatory changes and which is unlikely to attract a bid because of the political nature of its region, rose 18 to 414p. A large buyer in Scotland was said to be responsible. A strong US recommendation for Reuters Holdings was given added impetus as SG Warburg reiterated its support for the stock. The shares threatened to test the 1400p level at one point and settled 21 higher at 1373p. Expectations of improved trading news from Tesco at today's agm led a resurgence in food retail stocks. The rise was underpinned by a feeling in the market that the bad news in the sector was now in the price and several stocks were beginning to look cheap. Fears over margins being squeezed by dicount operators in what is seen as a maturing market has seen several brokers turn bearish on the sector this year. However, recent sessions have been punctuated by the odd change in sentiment, and this week's results from Argyll Group prompted a flurry of positive recommendations. Yesterday, shares in Tesco sprinted 7 1/2 to 220 1/2 p, J. Sainsbury 12 to 487p and Argyll 8 1/2 to 336 1/2 p. The Pounds 199m cash call from Hammerson was widely predicted and the 'A' shares rose 4 to 344p. The ordinary shed 7 to 373p. But the move gave an excuse for profit-taking in other property stocks, which have been strong performers in recent sessions. Sedgwick's Pounds 41.5m convertible bond issue triggered switching from the ordinary to the convertible stock, which was said to have been snapped up by Continental investors. The shares dipped 4 to 163p. SG Warburg raced up 23 to an all-time high of 717p after well received preliminary figures. Guinness recovered strongly on positive market comment following the agm on Wednesday. The shares later slipped on the back of a profits warning, although this was seen by drinks specialists as a knee-jerk reaction to a widely forecast situation. The stock was up a net 15 at 475p. Guinness's talk of US recovery helped Grand Metropolitan, 8 firmer at 395p. Strong results from Morland saw the shares gain 12 to 500p, cheering other regional brewers. Mansfield Brewery climbed 12 to 500p, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 9 tp 509p and Greene King, which has a substantial holding in Morland, 9 to 554p. Dealers said Glaxo suffered at the hands of US options traders. The drugs group's shares had been up 4 at one stage but a very large trade in puts, options to sell shares at a fixed price and on a certain date, right across the pharmaceutical spectrum rippled through to the London market, where the shares ultimately closed 6 lower at 612p. Despite a cautious agm statement, Inchcape continued to benefit from a broker's recommendation made earlier this week and a gentle squeeze. The shares put on 11 at 587p. An upbeat statement from industrial group Suter at its annual meeting sent the shares 9 forward to 153p. The company has increased its stake in engineering group James Wilkes - a penny easier at 80p - to 16.45 per cent. Smiths Industries came under pressure, with NatWest Securities reported to have had a large line of stock on its books. The shares closed 5 lower at 334p. Shrugging off an MMC report critical of its contact lens business, Boots surged 8 to 437p. Dealers said the stock benefited from improving sentiment after recent underperformance. Confectioner Thorntons retreated 26 to 144p as it announced a restructuring of its French operations.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: A ripening target for a takeover bid - Fyffes has turned from potential predator to prey TWO years ago, Fyffes, the UK and Irish fruit distributor, looked to be on the verge of a significant expansion into the European mainland market as it raised IPounds 60.2m in a rights issue and took on a new chief executive, Mr John Callaghan. For many investors, these were signals that the McCann family, which had run the company since they bought it from United Brands in 1986, were preparing to take Fyffes into the European big league of fruit distribution alongside US majors such as Chiquita and Dole, which control almost two-thirds of the 'dollar' banana market in Europe. 'In the future we will be making fewer, but larger deals . . . attractive opportunities come in bigger packages, said Mr Carl McCann, the group finance director at the time. Two years on, several efforts to make big acquisitions have failed. The Fyffes warchest, totalling IPounds 90m, remains largely unspent and Fyffes itself became in April the target of a takeover offer by Dole, which was rejected by the board. Then last month Mr Callaghan resigned with no clear explanation being given to shareholders. The stock market's exasperation with the company is growing. 'The lack of information on a matter of such importance is a shameful disgrace for a publicly-quoted company,' said one analyst. The main interpretation in Dublin is that Mr Callaghan found that he was given less freedom of action than he had anticipated when he joined the group. Mr Neil McCann, the executive chairman, and his sons Carl and David, hold the principal posts in the group, and - the argument goes - were unwilling to cede executive control to Mr Callaghan. Another view is that the McCanns simply came to the conclusion that Mr Callaghan's accountancy background was not necessarily the best suited for heading a fresh fruit trading business. Either way, the incident has been a big embarrassment for the company, and undermined investor confidence in the management team, which has still to appoint a replacement chief executive. Fyffes' fleeting interest earlier this year in purchasing a stake in Greencore, the Irish sugar, milling and malting group, also also raised questions over management strategy, and whether it is as committed to building a Europe-wide fruit distribution network as it says it is. It is thought that the McCanns might instead choose to spend their cash on an agricultural trader outside their core fruit and vegetable business. The company's cash is invested mostly in Irish financial assets, and with interest rates now forecast to dip as low as 5 per cent by the year-end, pressure will be mounting on the company to spend the warchest on a big acquisition. In its results for the first half to April, half of the IPounds 14m pre-tax profits came from interest income - a result which will not be repeated in the second half. Mr Joe Gill, a food industry analyst at Riada stockbrokers in Dublin, notes: 'With interest income set to decline, Fyffes will require a strong recovery in operating profits or acquisition-driven profits to attain earnings growth in 1994.' So with stagnating performance, no significant acquisition on the horizon, and retrenchment taking place in the Dublin headquarters, Fyffes looks like a ripening target for a new takeover bid. Dole's April offer, the first for Fyffes since the McCanns took over, valued the company at IPounds 420m, or IPounds 1.15 per share, a six-year high at the time. The Fyffes board unanimously rejected the bid, but was careful not to brand it as hostile. Enough hints were dropped around the market that some of the key shareholders would be sellers at the right price. One of those is considered to be DCC, the Dublin-based holding company headed by Mr Jim Flavin. DCC has an 11 per cent shareholding, the largest single holding, and although Mr Flavin is a long-term supporter of the McCanns he is also committed to developing DCC as an industrial holding company. Fyffes stands to benefit under the new EC banana import regime, which came into force in July, being an importer from both the Central and South American 'dollar' banana area as well as from the traditional African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, which enjoy tariff-free entry to the EC. The new regime will allow Fyffes to pick up market share from Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte, the main players in the 'dollar' sector of the European banana market. Its strong cash position and good European growth prospects make the group a potentially attractive company, especially to the big US players. Chiquita, currently facing large capital expenditure commitments, and posting a loss last year of Dollars 284m, is not considered a likely bidder, and would most certainly be regarded as hostile. Del Monte is still bedding in under its new Mexican owners, and so Dole remains the most likely contender. Ms Patricia Fee, an analyst for BCP stockbrokers in Dublin, says that Fyffes' current share price, of IPounds 1.05, has a renewed bid by Dole priced in, although she said she does not anticipate an antagonistic bid. 'Dole is dependent upon Fyffes for its sales in the UK market and will not want to prejudice those,' she said.</p>

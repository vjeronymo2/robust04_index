			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Agreeing to differ on currencies FT-SE Index: 2,539.9 (+29.5) It is easy to see why Ger-many's inflationary preoccupations stopped it joining any moves to boost the world economy at last weekend's Group of Seven meeting. The apparent absence of US/Japanese action needs a little more explaining. Japan needs a higher Yen to fend off US protectionist pressures and lower interest rates to float its stock market off the rocks. An agreement by the US, even behind the scenes, to lower its own interest rates would have helped meet both objectives. It might also have elicited a more forthright statement from the meeting. The missed opportunity prompts the question of whether the Federal Reserve is actually preparing to cut rates again, as many in the markets believe. Or has it been deterred by the softness of the Treasury bond market, which is apparently beginning to take the prospect of economic recovery more seriously? If a further cut in short-term rates undermined bond prices, it would be counter-productive. Long-term rates have a significant effect on demand, not least through their effect on the housing market. A modest reflationary package in tonight's State of the Union message might reassure bond dealers, but even that need not point to monetary easing. It could simply mean that alarm over the economy was abating. That need not imply that yesterday's dollar bounce heralds a sharper upward move, but it does raise doubts about whether the Yen can sustain its relative strength. The D-Mark is at least still underpinned by high interest rates. Fear of intervention is unlikely to do much for the Yen if the Nikkei does crash through the 20,000 level and the Bank of Japan is forced to lower rates again.</p>

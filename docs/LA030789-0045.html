			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> RIDGE STRING QUARTET AT CALTECH  </P> <P> What is the secret of music- making so engaging, so exquisite, so delicious as  that offered by the Ridge String Quartet Sunday at Caltech?  </P> <P> It certainly goes beyond mere accuracy of execution, though in matters of  intonation, tone quality, balance and technical precision, one could find  little to complain about. It has more to do with the distinctiveness of the  performances -- the personality of the music.  </P> <P> The quartet's reading of Schumann's Quartet in A, Opus 41, No. 3 is a case in  point. While the four players capitalized fully on the work's many contrasts,  showing a remarkably wide dynamic spectrum, they proved especially alert to the  subtleties of the score. They shaped phrases with eloquence, bent tempos at  just the threshold of perceptibility and brought delightful piquancy to the  little dissonances that figure throughout the work.  </P> <P> The only blemish in the performance was the players' tendency to inhale audibly  at dramatic moments.  </P> <P> There have been some personnel changes since Southland listeners first heard  the ensemble, as the winner of the 1982 Coleman Competition, but Bartok's  quartets have remained a constant in the group's repertory. And the work that  garnered it the top prize -- the Second Quartet -- was what violinists Krista  Bennion Feeney and Robert Rinehart (the founding members), violist Maria  Lambros and cellist Peter Wyrick offered at Beckman Auditorium Sunday.  </P> <P> Striking a balance between the dramatic intensity and the heady complexity of  the work, the foursome gave a reading both intellectually probing and  emotionally stirring.  </P> <P> Their reading of Haydn's Quartet in F minor ("Razor") also proved a fine  combination of elegance and ebullience. Under Feeney's strong leadership, the  quartet played with vigor -- but never raucousness -- and allowed Haydn's  delightful wit to come to the fore. TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

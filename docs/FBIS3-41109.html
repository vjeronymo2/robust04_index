At the scene trafficking in amphetamines they  caught red handed the international drug kingpin and general  sleaze Shao Yuanlai, along with Tang Mingkuei and Chen Chialong,  a foreign-born laborer who was helping manufacture the  amphetamines. They seized 150 kilograms of amphetamines and  partially finished products and expanded the continuing  investigation into the international amphetamine distribution  network.    For the amphetamines seized by the Maritime Investigations  Office in this raid, the raw materials had been smuggled in from  Mainland China; the smuggling pipeline consisted of shipment by  fishing boat to the coast of 400 kgs of raw material which could  produce 200 kgs of amphetamines. In yesterday's raid only 150  kgs of amphetamines and partially manufactured drugs were  seized, so some 30 kgs [sic] had already slipped the net. Some  of the amphetamines are sold in Taiwan, but the majority are  sold in Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, and the suspect Shao  Yuanlai is one of the "founding members" of the amphetamine  manufacturing and selling ring in this country and could have  been engaged in such activities for a long period of time.    In June of this year Keelung District Investigations Office  Deputy Prosecutor Wang Chintsung, while investigating an  amphetamine ingestion case discovered that the amphetamine raw  material was smuggled in by fishing boat and that the final  amphetamine products were also smuggled abroad by fishing  vessels, and so handed the case over to the Maritime  Investigations Office for handling. In September the  Investigations Office discovered that Shao Yuanlai (age 54) was  involved in the smuggling of ephedrine hydrochloride from which  amphetamines are produced for sale throughout the country and in  Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia and that he had close  connections with international underworld organizations.  Considering the situation critical, they mobilized a stakeout  and search for evidence against the criminals. Two nights ago  they received information that Shao Yuanlai and T'ang Mingkuei  (age 42) who acts as a large scale drug dealer, were to carry  out a transaction. In a lightning swift move very early  yesterday morning, they seized an amphetamine factory set up in  the basement at Yungfeng Road Lane 242 Number 20 in Tucheng  City. When the investigators on the scene entered the  amphetamine factory, Shao Yuanlai was in the process of handing  a case of amphetamine products to Tang Mingkuei, and although  they tried to hide, all were captured. It was later learned that  because Shao Yuanlai owed Tang Mingkuei a large amount of money  for the amphetamine raw material, the amphetamine products being  exchanged yesterday were to pay part of his debt, and they had  no inkling it would all be seized.    The three men arrested by the Maritime Investigations Office  yesterday included Shao Yuanlai, aka "Big Brother," a Korean  born Chinese, formerly with the Hanyang Medical Academy in  Korea, has a record of 12 violations of the narcotic drug  control regulations and was arrested in 1991 by the Keelung  District Courts for violating these ordinances; Tang Mingkuei,  of Taipei, has also been in custody for violating the narcotic  drug control regulations; Chen Chialong, (23), is from Malaysia,  is a foreign born laborer. The Maritime Investigations Office  has already turned the three men over to the Keelung District  Prosecutors Office for investigation and trial for violating the  drug control regulations.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Sport: Hard climb to the downhill - Winter Olympics Cities that bid passionately for the Olympic Games tend towards an envious belief that once the Good Fairy of the International Olympic Committee has granted her benediction everything will be wonderful. Some of the winning cities know different, however. Lillehammer, for example. When Gerhard Heiberg, one of Norway's leading industrialists, was drafted in to head the country's Winter Olympics project one year after Lillehammer received the IOC's nod, he found chaos. 'There were no budgets, no schedule. People thought the government would pay for everything,' recalled Heiberg, 54. Three weeks before the Games open, on February 12, Heiberg sits in his Lillehammer office a calm man. Every venue is completed, tested and polished. Sponsors are in place and happy. Income is running ahead of budget  -although Oslo will still pick up two-thirds of the total Pounds 650m cost of the Olympiad. 'In Norway things have to happen in a calm, well-planned way or everyone gets very nervous,' said Heiberg. He spends two days a week in Lillehammer, on secondment from his full-time job as chairman of the Aker group. 'Last-minute changes are not at all the Nordic style.' I commented on the contrast between Lillehammer and Barcelona 1992 - where workmen were often still completing Olympic sites with an hour to go. Heiberg shudders at the thought. 'Latins are much more flexible - for good or bad,' he said. 'But I can tell you that we could start the Games tomorrow if asked to.' When a skier clutching the Olympic torch leaps off the Lysgardsbakkene ski jump, visible from Lillehammer's main street, to begin the opening ceremony, it is certain that the world will pay more attention than ever before to the Games of snow and ice. One reason is the shift of the Olympic calendar so that winter and summer Games alternate every two years. Previously they occurred in the same year - such as Albertville followed by Barcelona - making life difficult for everyone from sponsors to TV broadcasters. 'It will enable the winter games to come into their own and grow, rather than be the Little event before the Big event,' predicted Juan Antonio Samaranch, IOC President. That has certainly been true internationally. What has especially helped the 1994 Games achieve lift-off in Norway is the country's success in Albertville two years earlier. Its skiers and skaters achieved nine golds out of a total of 21 medals, second overall to Germany. It was an extraordinary performance for a country of only 4m people, where many disciplines such as Alpine skiing and bob-sleighing are quite alien to a pragmatic sports culture of cross-country skiing and skating. 'We were very fortunate that this happened just two years before Lillehammer. It created a wave of enthusiasm,' added Heiberg. 'At a time of rising unemployment and economic worries Norwegians wanted a cause to believe in.' His style was to lead from the front. When the downhill course opened at Kvitfjell, 15km north of Lillehammer, Heiberg was the first person to make the descent; the gradient touches 60 per cent in places. Top skiers such as Alberto Tomba have said it is one of the toughest tracks in the world. 'I was scared like never before in my life - until they persuaded me to open the bobsleigh track. To this day my legs still shake when I think about the bobsleigh. Nothing could make me do it again,' said Heiberg, who claims his managerial style is to delegate everything. Media moguls and IOC dignitaries alike will find themselves housed in a simple Nordic style that is far from their custom. Lillehammer is a tiny town (20,000 people) that aims to remain somewhere James Stewart could retire to. 'Some of the Olympic committee members coming here won't be happy,' said Heiberg, who knows full well that the IOC members have a built-in default to first-class. 'We don't have any five-star hotels here and we're not interested in building any. 'This is a beautiful agricultural part of the country with long traditions. Why should we build something looking like Japan or America? I told Mr Samaranch four years ago that we are going to do these Games the Norwegian way.'</p>

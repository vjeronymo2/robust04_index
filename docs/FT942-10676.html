			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Laurie Connell found guilty of conspiracy Mr Laurie Connell, the West Australian businessman and former head of Rothwells bank, which backed a number of the nation's 'entrepreneurs' in the 1980s, was yesterday found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The jury in the Perth district court acquitted Mr Connell of another count of conspiring to fix the 1983 Bunbury Cup, a regional horse race run about 140 miles south of Perth. But they decided Mr Connell was behind payments worth more than ADollars 500,000 (Pounds 238,000) to Mr Danny Hobby, the former jockey who was riding one of the favourites in the race but allegedly jumped from the saddle before the race ended. Mr Hobby left the country and the payments were supposedly made to him to stay out of Australia and the reach of police for nine years. The verdict came after a 106-day trial, and evidence from more than 100 witnesses. The jury deliberated more than 35 hours over six days before reaching its verdict. Sentence will be passed tomorrow; the maximum penalty for the charge on which Mr Connell has been found guilty is seven years' jail. Lawyers for the businessman said he would appeal, adding they believed the jury, which returned a unanimous decision, had reached a compromise to release themselves from further deliberation. 'I have a suspicion in my mind that the jury had spent so long in deliberation that they had to find a way out,' Mr Alec Shand, QC, acting for Mr Connell, said. Mr Connell, now 48, is the son of an Irish bus driver and the great-grandson of West Australia's longest-serving police commissioner. He became a prominent figure in the 1980s, when he was an important business contact of Mr Brian Burke, then Western Australia's Labor premier, and a close associate of Mr Alan Bond, the Perth-based former tycoon. In its heyday, Rothwells, Mr Connell's merchant bank, presented itself as an aggressive financial institution. He became known as 'Last-Resort Laurie' for taking on clients others were reluctant to deal with. But the bank proved heavily borrowed and ran into difficulties immediately after the 1987 stock market crash. Mr Bond tried to organise a rescue package, with backing from businessmen such as Mr Kerry Packer, Mr Robert Holmes a Court, Mr John Elliott, and Mr Brian Yuill. But the effort was doomed and Rothwells was liquidated in 1988. Five years ago, Mr Connell was charged with a series of Rothwells-related matters, due to be heard in a Perth court later this year. Mr Connell won fame for making the biggest bet in Australasian history, winning ADollars 3m after backing the winners in the Melbourne and Caulfield Cups.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "The illicit import of raw tobacco (tobacco leaves)  from across the southwestern border has caused extensive  confusion, a considerable tax collection shortfall, and has been  a source of unusually high illegal profit for a number of  people. Therefore, the state has decided that beginning in  1994, all the imports of raw tobacco will be put under official  control. As early as 22 September 1993, the Customs General  Department issued Notice No. 793/TCHQ-GQ, which points out:  Those cigarette manufacturing units wishing to import raw  tobacco from Cambodia must seek quota allocations from the  Ministry of Commerce and must correctly comply with all  stipulations of the state governing the import of goods."    At the request of the Vietnam Tobacco General Corporation,  the Ministry of Commerce on 3 February 1994 allowed the general  corporation to import $10 million worth of raw tobacco. After  that, the general corporation assigned the Nam Raw Tobacco  Company (in Thong Nhut district of Dong Nai province) the duty  to import $2 million worth of raw tobacco. "Nevertheless, in  late March to early April 1994, this company continued to buy  large quantities of raw tobacco through their imports beyond the  quota allocated."    In view of this violation, the 3d Market Control Team  inspected the company and seized over 152 tons of tobacco from  it. Later, however, the market control team somehow chose to  put this case into limbo, arguing that "it found only a small  amount of tobacco -- 4,709 kilos -- kept by the company in  excess of the quantities of its duty-paid tobacco."    After securing the release of its confiscated goods, the  company again bought 14 truckloads of raw tobacco. This time  the company's action could not go unoticed by members of the  C-15 Economic Police Unit who found the company had 98 tons of  duty-not-paid raw tobacco in its storage.    Because the company registered 6,000 dong as the import  price  per kilo of tobacco, compared to the real price of between  18,500-20,000 dong per kilo, it is believed that the company  "delared the import price of its raw tobacco below the real  buying price to evade tax."</p>

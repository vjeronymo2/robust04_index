			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Pharmaceuticals Equity markets now view pharmaceuticals companies as either predators or prey. Among those most likely to make a strategic acquisition, Glaxo has barely kept pace with the UK market during the past few months. Yet Wellcome has outperformed by 45 per cent since the end of April, when Roche made its agreed bid for Syntex, fuelled by speculation that it might attract similar interest. In the US, Eli Lilley and Marion Merrell Dow are among the possible targets. Consolidation certainly looks overdue. The world's top 10 drugs companies account for less than one-third of industry sales. Such fragmentation suggests that healthcare buyers and shareholders are supporting excessive overheads. The large premium paid by Roche - and by American Home Products in its unsolicited bid for American Cyanamid - only makes sense if cost savings can be achieved. Similar efficiencies across the industry would help protect margins at a time when drugs prices are falling. The worry is that organisations that rely on scientific and marketing flair do not react well to rough restructuring. Neither are most drug company managements proven in the area of takeovers. The most rational solution would be a second wave of agreed mergers, like those which created SmithKline Beecham and Bristol Myers Squibb. Such combinations could deliver the same benefits as takeovers in terms of efficiency with fewer risks. The snag is that the instant gratification priced into the shares of many drug companies would have to be foregone.</p>

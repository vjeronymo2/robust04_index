			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Salinas to merge ministries in cabinet reshuffle MEXICO'S President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has replaced his education minister, Mr Manuel Bartlett Diaz, who resigned on Monday night, with the budget minister, Mr Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, writes Damian Fraser. He also announced plans to merge the budget and finance ministries to 'strengthen fiscal and financial policy' and consolidate economic recovery. Mr Zedillo, a 40-year-old Yale-educated economist, earned a reputation as a tough, orthodox, penny-pinching budget minister, and won wide acclaim for organising a programme to eradicate extreme poverty during his three-year stay in the ministry. He is a close ally of Mr Salinas's powerful chief of staff, Mr Jose Cordoba, and his new post suggests that the long-heralded reforms of the education system may soon be launched. Mr Zedillo will not be replaced as budget minister, and instead his department will become part of the Finance Ministry, as was the case in the 1970s. This gives Mr Pedro Aspe, the charismatic finance minister, undisputed leadership over the handling of Mexico's economy. Mr Aspe must now be considered one of the leading contenders to succeed Mr Salinas in 1994, along with Mr Manuel Camacho, the mayor of Mexico City. Mr Bartlett, an old-style Mexican politician, unlike Mr Zedillo and Mr Aspe, is likely to bow out of federal politics, and may well become the governor of the state of Puebla later in the year. Mr Bartlett had been interior minister in the previous administration, and oversaw the fraud-tainted 1988 elections that brought Mr Salinas to power. Observer, Page 18</p>

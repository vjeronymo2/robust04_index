			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS' HANDLING OF KIMBLE IS TYPICAL  </P> <P> Once again the Clippers have demonstrated that nothing has changed and that  they will remain a second-class organization into the 1990s.  </P> <P> The Clippers land Bo Kimble, a bona fide player and a marketing dream, then  allow their attorney to belittle him in public. Very intelligent.  </P> <P> TERRENCE J. SCHAFER  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Coca-Cola invasion starts to worry businessmen: Stefan Wagstyl reports that much of industry will be hard-pressed to compete with rising imports THE appearance of Coca-Cola bottles in Indian shops makes Mr Rahul Bajaj, a leading Indian businessman, feel nervous. The US drinks group last month muscled its way into India by buying out Parle, the country's top cola company, for Dollars 40m. Mr Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto, the world's largest scooter maker, is concerned that other Indian companies may suffer Parle's fate. He says: 'There's no level playing field between Indian companies and foreigners. In one stroke, Parle as a company has disappeared. If this happens to several companies, will it be good for India?' Mr Bajaj is not alone. At a meeting last month of the Indian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Mr Fredie Mehta, an economist and senior executive of Tata, the diversified steel and engineering-based grouping, said in a speech that the 'critical question before a number of captains of industry is: 'How long will Indian industry remain Indian?'' The question has a wide resonance in India, which until a decade ago made national self-sufficiency its guiding light. The liberalisation which started in the 1980s and gathered pace in 1991 has long provoked opposition from those who feel threatened by the change - trade unionists, junior-level bureaucrats, and left-wing intellectuals. The Bharatiya Janata party, the right-wing Hindu opposition party, has tried to capitalise on these sentiments by accusing the government of being favouring foreigners at the expense of Indians. However, until this summer, top industrialists generally publicly supported reform, including moves to open the Indian economy to foreign trade and investment. Whatever reservations existed largely remained unspoken. But, in the last few months, some leading industrialists have begun to question publicly the pace of liberalisation. The true impact of increasing competition from imports is beginning to dawn. Even though the flow of foreign-made goods is still very slow, because of continuing tariffs and restructurings, the business studies commissioned by virtually every large group point to one conclusion - that much of industry will be hard-pushed to compete with imports when the barriers come down. Moreover, some business families, which typically run their corporate empires holding 20 per cent or less of listed stock, are seriously concerned about retaining control of their businesses as liberalisation spreads. As one Delhi-based economist says: 'The most acute pain is a fear that they cannot pass their business on to their sons and grandsons.' Prominent among those questioning the pace of reform are the heads of some of India's older family-owned groups, including Mr Bajaj, Mr Govind Hari Singhania, who controls the Delhi-based J K Organisation with interests in tyres and other products, and Mr Lalit Thapar, president of Ballarpur Industries, flagship of a diversified papermaking group. These men insist they do not oppose reform. Their arguments are couched in careful language to maximise support and avoid causing unnecessary offence. Their watchword is a demand for 'a level playing field'. They argue that foreign companies entering India come with all the advantages of operating in the international economy - such as access to the best technology, economies of scale and low-cost capital. Indian companies, by contrast, have been kept locked up in an uncompetitive environment. Pre-1991 restrictions on private enterprise prevented them from developing world-class plants and products. These arguments have a political dimension because they echo parts of the economic manifesto of the BJP, which is broadly sympathetic to promoting Indian-made goods at the expense of foreign products. Businessmen with greater faith in liberalisation scorn the thought that Indian industry is about to be swamped by multinationals. The most enthusiastic supporters of reform tend to be younger executives, often managers at more recently-established companies, such as Reliance Industries, the textiles and chemicals group. These men argue that India needs foreign companies now to help up-grade skills and technology and bring much-needed capital. They accept that competition will cause casualties. These progressives have no complaints about the decision of Mr Ramesh Chauhan, the owner of the Parle group, to sell out to Coca Cola. Mr Onkar Kanwar, managing director of Apollo Tyres, a rapidly-expanding manufacturer, says: 'He is a wise man. He saw the writing on the wall. He saw he could not compete.' However, even the strongest supporters of liberalisation acknowledge that the conservative lobby has highlighted some genuine grievances. One is a permission granted to foreign companies with part-owned Indian listed subsidiaries to increase stakes at a discount to the stock market price. Indian institutions, which dominate the share registers, are mostly happy to do this because an increased investment by a foreign group brings growth prospects. Indian entrepreneurs are annoyed because they too would like to raise funds without losing control. Another frequent complaint concerns import tariffs. Recent tariff cuts created anomalies. In some industries, duties on components are higher than those on finished goods: the idea is to protect domestic component makers but the effect is sometimes to benefit the foreign producer of finished goods. Businessmen are also irritated with the country's state-dominated banking system, which channels low-cost funds to politically-favoured borrowers such as farmers at the expense of large-scale industry. Few foreign companies borrow in India so they do not face the same problems. Proponents of reform argue that, while these complaints are fair, it is quite wrong to use them to build a case for slowing liberalisation. They also say that India's problem is not attracting too much foreign investment but too little. Nevertheless, Mr Mehta of Tata believes that unless the concerns of the conservatives are taken into account there is a risk of 'some sort of possible backlash against the economic reforms from certain sectors of industry'.</p>

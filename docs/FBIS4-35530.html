			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Uri Revah] </F>   [Excerpt] Jibril al-Rujub, head of the Palestinian  security service in the West Bank, told our correspondent he  will salute the peace opponents if they win the elections in the  autonomy. Al-Rujub visited the Bedouin town of Laqiya in the  Negev today. Our correspondent Uri Revah met him there:    [Begin recording] [Revah] Jibril al-Rujub and Muhammad  Dahlan, the heads of the Palestinian security service, were  invited to Laqiya by Knesset Member [MK] Talib al-Sani', a local  resident. The Hebron massacre and the death of a demonstrator  during the ensuing riots in Rahat tightened the links between  the Bedouins and the Palestinians, according to MK al-Sani'.  Al-Rujub denied he has said that the opponents of the agreement  are entitled to continue the armed struggle.    [Al-Rujub] I said that all citizens must honor the agreement  signed by the PLO, because the PLO is the sole representative of  the Palestinian people. Soon we will have elections, and if  they score success we will salute them. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

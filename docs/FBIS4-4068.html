[Li] Zhejiang is situated in China's southeastern coastal  region. It has 43 million people living in an area of about  100,000 square km. Historically speaking, Zhejiang was one of  the areas in China that is relatively rich and well-developed in  terms of its economy. [passage omitted on the history of  Zhejiang's economic development]    Thanks to the adoption of the policy of reform and opening  to  the outside world following the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee, Zhejiang has achieved great economic  development. [passage omitted on progress in the eighties and  nineties]    Notwithstanding a weak industrial foundation, a lack of  mineral resources, and limited arable land, Zhejiang developed  rapidly. Zhejiang's rapid development can be attributed to two  major reasons. First, Zhejiang benefited from Deng Xiaoping's  policy of reform and opening up. Second, Zhejiang enjoys unique  conditions for developing its economy. [passage omitted on  Zhejiang's superiority in development]    [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] What about the current operations of the  Qinshan nuclear power plant?    [Li] The Qinshan nuclear power plant was the first nuclear  power plant designed and built by China. Its current  electricity-generating capacity is 300,000 kilowatt hours [kwh].  A report prepared by experts from the International Atomic  Energy Agency following their inspection of the Qinshan nuclear  power plant in 1989 testified to the safety and reliability of  this nuclear power plant in the areas of design, machinery  equipment, and installation. The Qinshan nuclear power plant was  designed with three protective layers. The operation of the  nuclear power plant has been normal following two years of  electricity generation.    [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] The Qinshan nuclear power plant is  located at Hangzhou Bay, which is a densely populated area. Was  this factor taken into consideration when making the decision to  build this nuclear power plant? Were there objections from the  masses and cadres about building this nuclear power plant?    [Li] The Qinshan nuclear power plant is located at Hangzhou  Bay, which is an area between Hangzhou and Shanghai that is  known for its economic development and for its dense population.  At the beginning, the masses did harbor some misgivings about  the nuclear power plant, but following our explanations, local  cadres and the masses realized that their safety could be  guaranteed. We also told the local cadres and the masses that  nuclear power is a form of power generation that is relatively  safe and that produces less pollution. Therefore, we did not  encounter problems with the cadres and masses over the  construction of the nuclear power plant. The state plans to go  ahead with the second-stage project of installing another two  power-generating units, with each of them being capable of  generating 600,000 kwh of electricity. I have visited the  nuclear power plant several times. It is protected on the  outside by a layer of cement. Unlike the former USSR's  Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which looked like a workshop at  an ordinary factory, our nuclear power plant is enveloped by a  very thick layer of cement. Even if an accident should occur,  it would not endanger the safety of the staff at the nuclear  power plant and the masses who live near it because we have  meticulously formulated accident- prevention and safety measures.    Zhejiang is preparing to build an additional nuclear power  plant. Its site has been selected at Sanmen Bay. Basically, the  state has decided to build more nuclear power plants at the end  of this century and in the beginning of next century by  introducing foreign funds and by pooling domestic funds. The  new nuclear power plants that are under consideration will be  bigger than the Qinshan plant. Because there are many nearby  islands, it is a rather ideal place to build several more  nuclear power plants. [passage omitted on compulsory education,  introduction of foreign funds, housing]    [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] Many people from Zhejiang went to live  in  Taiwan [after the communist takeover of China]. Therefore,  there are many people in Taiwan who have relatives in Zhejiang.  We also know that many Taiwan fishermen operate near the  Zhoushan archipelago. Could you tell us how Zhejiang has  developed relations with Taiwan?    [Li] When talking about the Zhejiang-Taiwan relationship,  people in Zhejiang can lay claim to many top honors. For  instance, first place goes to Zhejiang for having the most  people in the country who emigrated to Taiwan; one estimate puts  the number of them at 200,000. Zhejiang also tops the nation  for having the most people with relatives in Taiwan; that number  is estimated at 400,000. Another No. 1 rank for Zhejiang is in  the number of well- educated people who emigrated to Taiwan.  They were mostly people from military, political, and  commercial circles. Of course, there are historical reasons  behind these numbers. Zhejiang holds another top title of  attracting the greatest number of fishermen from Taiwan to the  East China Sea fishing zone, to Zhejiang's coastal areas, to  receive supplies, and to seek refuge from typhoons. Over the  years, we have received some 22,000 Taiwan fishing boats  carrying about 150,000 people.    We have also taken advantage  of our superiority to actively attract Taiwan capital to  Zhejiang. Taiwan accounts for roughly 30 percent of all foreign  capital invested in Zhejiang. Hong Kong still tops foreign  investors in Zhejiang. There is a strong presence in Zhejiang of  Hong Kong businessmen who are of Ningbo origin. Some 1,100  Taiwan-funded enterprises have invested $2.4 billion in  Zhejiang. Because it is difficult to identify some of the  Taiwan-funded enterprises, we tend to consider them  foreign-funded enterprises, not Taiwan-funded ones.    I have met a lot of the friends from Taiwan. I got the  feeling that most of them, whether they are upper- or  middle-class or businessmen, want more cooperation and exchanges  between the two sides of the strait. Another thing that struck  me is that most of the friends from Taiwan are very astute and  are rather pragmatic. The younger generation is particularly  well-educated. I should also say that most of the Taiwan-funded  enterprises are well-managed.    [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] We know there are many Taiwan fishermen  operating in the East China fishing zone and near the Zhoushan  archipelago. Are there many fishing disputes? How do you  handle these disputes?    [Li] Many Taiwan fishermen fish in the East China fishing  zone. Many people from Zhejiang work aboard Taiwan fishing  boats. Because Zhejiang has a good fishing foundation and  because the labor quality of Zhejiang fishermen is rather high,  Taiwan fishing boats like to hire fishermen from our Zhejiang.    Generally speaking, the relationship between Zhejiang and  Taiwan fishermen is good. We have set up Taiwan compatriot  reception centers along coastal areas for Taiwan fishermen who  come to fish and who seek supplies. The greatest number of and  the largest Taiwan compatriot reception centers can be found at  Shaoshan Bay, near Ningbo. I have been there. The facilities  there are quite good. There are hospitals, rest areas, and  places that supply reasonably priced diesel oil and nonstaple  foods. The management of the reception centers is also good.  In recent years, Zhejiang's coastal areas have received a total  of 150,000 Taiwan fishermen and have treated some 2,000 injured  fishermen and some 300 seriously ill fishermen. I once visited  injured and sick Taiwan fishermen at the hospital. There were  also photos and newspaper reports about their treatment at the  hospital. Taiwan fishermen are generally satisfied with their  reception at the reception centers.    There have indeed been some small frictions and small  disputes between Zhejiang and Taiwan fishermen while fishing.  Sometimes disputes erupt following the collision of fishing  boats and the tangling of fishing nets due to a lack of the  clear definition of navigational rights of way. Some instances  of small-scale trade along coastal areas also give rise to some  banned pornographic publications and lowbrow and unhealthy audio  and visual products and books making their way to Zhejiang.  [passage omitted on Zhejiang's per capita income]    [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] Do you see a possibility of cooperation  between Zhejiang and Taiwan in the areas of nuclear power  generation, the disposal of nuclear waste, and in agriculture  and fisheries?    [Li] I should say there are great possibilities as well as  bright prospects for cooperation in those areas. Because of  overfishing, marine resources in the East China Sea fishing zone  are gradually being depleted. But, because Zhejiang has a long  coast, there are great potentials for developing aquaculture  along the coast. Zhejiang fishermen sell some of their catch to  Taiwan on the open sea, but most of their catch is exported to  Japan and Hong Kong. If the friends from Taiwan are interested  in nuclear power generation, we welcome their investment in  Zhejiang. We understand that many Taiwan friends invest in  Zhejiang's farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries.  We welcome Taiwan investment. I believe that there are great  prospects for cooperation.</p>

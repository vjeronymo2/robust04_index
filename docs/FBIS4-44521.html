			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Licheng (7120 4539 2052): "Effects of New Tax </F> System"]    [Text] On 1 January this year, China formally put into  effect a new tax system. What are the new tax system's effects  on local financial income and local economic development? This  question has become a "hot point" of concern in all quarters of  society. Now, with Baoying City, Jiangsu Province, as an  example, I will make a brief analysis of this question.  <H5>  Effects of New Tax System on Local Financial Income </H5>   Under the old tax system, the proportionate division of this  county's income from industrial and commercial tax revenue was:  above-line 35 percent; retained 65 percent. After the new tax  system was put into effect, this county's local financial income  was mainly composed of two large parts: one part was that of the  25 percent consisting of fixed income and value added tax; the  other part was that of the total amount of the consumption tax  and 75 percent of the value added tax, 45 percent of which was  retained. Accordingly, the data for the first two months of this  year are calculated as follows:    1. Separate above-line figure = (227,000 yuan in consumption  tax + 8.46 million yuan in value added tax x 75%) x  55% =  3.615 million yuan.    2. County-level above-line figure = 3.615 million yuan in  separate above-plan figure + 2.281 million in province-level  income + central-level income (other) = 5.896 million yuan.    3. Separate retained-for-use figure = (227,000 yuan in  consumption tax + 8.46 million yuan in value added tax) x  45% +  8.46 million yuan in consumption tax x 25% = 5.072  million yuan.    4. County-level retained-for-use figure = 5.072 million yuan  in separate retained-for-use figure + 2.261 million yuan in  local fixed income = 7.333 million yuan.    5. Separate proportions:    a) Above-plan proportion = 3.615 million yuan in separate  above-plan figure 10.948 million yuan in local income x  100% = 33.02%.    b) Retained-for-use proportion = 66.98%.    From a look at the resultant calculations, we see that,  after  the new tax system was put into effect, the above-plan  proportion fell by about 2 percentage points. In line with the  actual results in 1993 and calculating the proportional income,  in 1994 the tax revenue income will be about 96.52 million yuan,  and subtracting the provincial-level income of 3.2 million yuan,  the central- and country-level income will be 93.32 million  yuan. According to calculations under the new tax system, the  country-level retained-for-use figure will be about 62.52  million yuan; under the old tax system, which calculated  separate financial proportions, the county-level  retained-for-use figure would have been about 60.56 million  yuan. Thus, under the new tax system, this county's  retained-for-use financial strength is slightly greater than the  retained-for-use financial strength under the old tax system.  <H5>  Effects of New Tax System on Local Economy </H5>   1. Positive effects:    The new tax system makes uniform the income tax for domestic  venture enterprises and the circulation tax for domestic and  foreign venture enterprises; it also, in the "Provisional  Regulations for Value Added Tax," stipulates that there are only  three grades of rates--zero tax rate, 13 percent low tax rate,  and 17 percent regular tax rate--in order to provide a tax  revenue environment conducive to competition on an equal basis.  The tax burden under the former tax system on some high tax-rate  products has been reduced by a fairly large amount, e.g., on  rubber products, paint, miscellaneous goods, and other chemical  industry products, and on electric wire, electric cable, woolen  products, glass products, and electric power products. For  example, in this county the electric cable factory's value added  tax, under the old system, was a levy of 21 percent and a  discount of 14 percent, but the actual tax burden was about 10  percent of the tax-included value; under the new tax system, the  levy is 17 percent and the discount is 17 percent, and so the  actual tax burden is 5.5 percent of the tax-included value.  Under the old tax system, the product tax rate paid by the  county's miscellaneous goods factory was 16 percent of the  tax-included value; the new tax system changed to a value added  tax rate with a levy of 17 percent and a discount of 17 percent,  making the actual tax burden approximately equal to 5 percent of  the tax-included value. The product tax rate for the county's  electric power bureau under the old tax system was 10 percent;  under the new tax system, there was a change to a value added  tax with a rate equal to only about 3 percent of the  tax-included value.    The tax burden on commercial retail enterprises has also  been  lightened. The new tax system changes the business tax of 5  percent of retail value to a value added tax with a levy of 17  percent and a discount of 17 percent in line with the  non-tax-included value, and after making calculations we find  that the actual tax burden is only equal to about 3 percent of  the tax-included value.    2. Equal effects:    With regard to foreign-funded enterprises that were set up  before 1993, and the increased tax burden after the new tax  system was put into effect, the method of "first levying taxes  and afterward withdrawing" was adopted in order not to increase  the tax burden on foreign-funded, to obtain credit from foreign  businessmen, and to maintain the continuity of the policy of  opening up to the outside world.    After the new tax system was put in effect, there was a  fairly big increase in the tax burden on some enterprises: e.g.,  cement, brick, and waste product purchasing and processing  enterprises; grain enterprises; nonstaple food enterprises; and  chemical fertilizer, agricultural chemical, and agricultural  capital goods enterprises. The State Council and all levels are  studying the formulation of specific policies and measures, and,  following the thorough implementation of these policies and  measures, the problems facing these enterprises can basically be  solved.    3. Negative effects:    Newly run township and town enterprises, and enterprises  like  cooperative stores and restaurants, which formerly enjoyed tax  reduction or exemption, will, without exception, have their tax  reduction or exemption eliminated after the new tax system is  implemented. If these enterprises do not develop new products,  adjust their product mix, enhance their management, stress  returns, and seek development, they will certainly be hard hit.    For production enterprises that use agricultural and  sideline  products as their raw materials, e.g., those in the cotton  spinning, silk reeling, and papermaking industries, the new tax  system stipulates that their income tax be calculated at 10  percent, and for enterprises in other industries, by comparison,  the income tax be calculated at 17 percent, a tax burden that is  clearly on the high side.    For commercial wholesale enterprises, under the former tax  system, there was a 10 percent tax on the import sales price  differential, but under the new tax system the tax is 17 percent  of the non-tax-included value with a 17 percent discount; the  actual tax burden is equal to about 13.8 percent of the tax  calculated under the former tax system, so the tax burden is  increased 3.8 percentage points.    Compared to the tax burden on the ordinary taxpayer, the tax  burden on the small-scale taxpayer is a little heavy, and the  use of the "value-added tax special-use voucher" is not allowed.  Thus the production and businesess activities of these  enterprises is bound to be adversely affected.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Flow of funds slowed as hard times hit - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has long been one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special report, Peter Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and Robert Peston, unravels some aspects of the mystery / Business The problems faced by East Midlands Industrial Council in recent years are typical of those which have affected the other nine industrial councils of England and Wales. Several council members, who were involved in raising funds for the Conservative party and attended regular meetings with government ministers, have been forced by the region's economic downturn to scale back their involvement and concentrate on their businesses. Mr Tony Budge, who resigned his chairmanship of the council at the end of 1992 when the family company AF Budge collapsed, said the council reached its peak in the late-1980s boom years. He said: 'Industrial councils have suffered in line with disenchantment with politics and the Conservative party in recent years.' Mr Budge chaired the council from 1987 and is still a member of the party. 'The council's success was a product of the Thatcher era, when there was a government which was asking business what it should be looking at,' he said. Members of the council, which was at its most influential in the late 1980s, would take two or three personal business contacts to occasional meetings with ministers in the House of Commons. Mr Budge said: 'It was not harmful for our own business to take our suppliers and other people with whom we worked, and give them an opportunity to get involved.' A small office in Grantham, Baroness Thatcher's birthplace, acts as the headquarters of the East Midlands council, while meetings are usually held in Newark. The council's fundraising target for this year is believed to have been about Pounds 400,000 but members believe that no more than Pounds 120,000 has been raised. Council chairman Mr Colin MacLeod, chairman and owner of Newark-based Caledonian Mining, said: 'I have been on the council about seven years and this year is the worst (for fundraising). I have never seen anything like this.' As well as difficulties in raising money, some members of the council are scaling down their involvement. Mr Budge - having recently bought several AF Budge subsidiaries from the receiver - has no intention of becoming actively involved again, although he is still a member. Several other members describe their membership as 'in name only'. At least one, Mr David McErlain, former chairman of Anglo United, plans to resign. Mr McErlain, who has raised Pounds 100,000 for the party in the past five years, said that the role of the industrial councils was clear: 'They are a straight money-raising unit of the party. It is a joke to say that they have anything to do with the relationship between the government and industry.' He said being a member of a council 'is like being a member of the party without having a ticket'. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, the airline, said he was a member of the council 'in a personal capacity, not in a corporate sense'. Sir Peter Mansfield, professor of physics at Nottingham University, said he was invited on to the council by Mr Budge. He was picked as an academic to broaden the council's membership beyond business executives. He said the council had 'little contact' with the local Conservative party association and had been 'fairly inactive for about six months', while a new secretary, Maj Michael Hankinson, was appointed. Ms Jean Parker, director of Grantham-based Vacu-Lug Traction Tyres, is the only female member of the council and one of only a very small number of women members in England and Wales. She said: 'It was not a condition of my appointment that I go out and raise money. At dinners there is generally some kind of appeal for funds but most of us industrialists have got thick skins and do not feel obliged to respond.' She regards herself as a 'fringe member' of the council. Mr Reg Brealey, chairman of Indian jute company Titaghur and of Sheffield United Football Club, is also a member but has not played an active role for a number of years.</p>

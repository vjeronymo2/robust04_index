			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN UNSEEN SINGER  </P> <P> In her July 28 review of the film "Distant Voices, Still Lives," Sheila Benson  writes: ". . . an unseen, bass voice, which may even be Paul Robeson's, sings  'There's a Man Going 'Round Takin' Names.' The voice happens to be that of  Jessye Norman, and how Benson could mistake it for a man's voice, especially  Robeson's, I would be interested to know.  </P> <P> ROBERT SLOTTERBECK  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

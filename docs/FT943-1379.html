			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Allied Leisure Pounds 30m in loss after restructuring Allied Leisure yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 30.1m for the 48 weeks to June 19, after withdrawing from its nightclub businesses to refocus on its ten-pin bowling operations. The company blamed the deficit, which compared with a Pounds 2.94m profit for the previous year, on write-downs of Pounds 12.65m, losses on closures of Pounds 11.51m and restructuring costs of Pounds 4.41m. A year of board upheavals continued with the appointment of Mr Ken Scobie as part-time chairman, replacing Mr William Davis. Mr Scobie resigned as chief executive of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, in January 1993. Allied is still seeking a chief executive after Mr Richard Carr resigned in March. Yesterday's results were for a shortened 48-week period, in order to announce the sales and finance arrangements. The company's half-year writedowns and provisions had breached its banking covenants, but the banks have now agreed to extend facilities to September 19 next year on the basis that Allied sells three nightclubs and grants options in respect of 2.25m shares. The sale to Rank Leisure of the clubs, in the Bournemouth and Poole area, raised Pounds 4.5m which will be used to cut borrowings of Pounds 13.7m. Mr Scobie said: 'I think we are in a situation where the company has taken its medicine. What we now have is a core business of bowling allies. 'I think the only resemblance between Brent Walker and this company is that they are both listed in the leisure sector,' he added. Turnover fell from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 22.1m, and operating profit declined to Pounds 452,000 (Pounds 3.96m). However, Allied's remaining operations produced pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m. Like-for-like bowling sales fell by 10.5 per cent across the year, but the decline slowed down in the second half. Net interest payments were cut to Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 1.64m) and gearing stood at 67 per cent. The directors declared no dividend (3p) and losses per share were 45.49p, compared to earnings of 5.22p.</p>

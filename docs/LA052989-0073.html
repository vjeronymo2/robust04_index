The bank holding companies  said the merger would not have benefited shareholders of either company at this  time. The proposal, announced last month to merge the Plaza Bank of Commerce of  San Jose and Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, would have created a strong  Silicon Valley institution with combined assets of about $752 million.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata  said Monday [9 May] he and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown  have agreed to do their utmost for an early reopening of the  stalled trade "framework" talks. The accord was reached when  Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Hata met with  Brown during an east-west conference of trade ministers that was  held in Warsaw for two days until Saturday.    Hata told a news conference that he and Brown shared the  view  that an early resumption of the framework talks would meet  expectations not only of both countries but of the global  community. But he said he has clarified anew to Brown Tokyo's  stance against numerical targets as a tool to measure foreign  access to Japanese markets.    Hata said the meeting with Brown did not touch on specifics  of three U.S. demands presented to Tokyo earlier as conditions  to resume the framework talks. But both parties agreed that  accords on the conditions should be struck before the July  summit of the seven leading economic powers in Naples, Hata said.    During the April meeting between then Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata, now prime minister, and U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, Washington demanded that  Japan offer new proposals on a macroeconomic policy, overall  goals of the framework talks and "objective criteria" to gauge  openness of Japan's markets.    On the recent controversial remarks by former Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano over the 1937 Nanjing massacre, the  trade minister said the cabinet of Prime Minister Hata has been  "damaged greatly."    Japan should "deepen its regret" over wartime conducts  toward  the next year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II,  Hata said.    Nagano said in an interview with a newspaper that the  Nanjing  massacre was a fabrication, a remark sparking global criticism  and forcing his resignation as justice minister.</p>

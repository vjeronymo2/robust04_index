			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Waldegrave accuses BMA of Labour alliance MR William Waldegrave, health secretary, yesterday accused the British Medical Association of joining an 'unholy alliance with Labour' in opposing government reforms of the National Health Service. 'It is a matter for great regret that the BMA has chosen this moment to jettison the more responsible approach it had adopted recently and jump on the political bandwagon,' Mr Waldegrave told Bridgwater Conservative Association. He said the NHS was too important to be a political football 'either kicked by the Labour party or by the BMA'. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, called on the government to explain alleged 'queue-jumping' for non-urgent operations by patients of fund-holding GPs. He said a promise by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that all patients would be treated on the basis of clinical priority had been broken by Mr Waldegrave.</p>

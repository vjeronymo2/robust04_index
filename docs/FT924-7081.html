			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Shareholders in ITN given new outline on ownership THE POSSIBLE future of Independent Television News was outlined in a three-part offer sent to shareholders yesterday. The improved offer from Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications who is leading a consortium to take over the organisation, would mean: around Pounds 13 a share for the three shareholders that have lost their franchises - Thames Television, Television South and Television South West. The original offer was Pounds 1 a share; membership of the consortium which is now made up of Carlton, Central, London Weekend and Reuters would be extended to include Granada Television, Scottish and Anglia. The original consortium members and Granada would each have 18 per cent and the other two would have 5 per cent each; the other ITV companies, which would no longer be shareholders, would get a smoothing out of the five-year news supply agreement set to average Pounds 53.3m a year over five years. The improved package does not come in time to stop the extended offer lapsing today. There is also growing concern that shareholders have not seen promised revisions to a shareholder agreement. There are fears about whether the four original consortium members are acting in concert, how much freedom of action ITN executive directors would have and whether new guarantees of editorial independence are required. If the revised deal is nailed down, a US network, possibly ABC, could join the consortium at a later date.</p>

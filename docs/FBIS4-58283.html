			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has asserted that there will not  be any capping of Agni nor India would accept a regional  nonproliferation treaty. Replying to the debate on the working  of the Defense Ministry in the Rajya Sabha today, Mr. Narasimha  Rao said that New Delhi will not budge even an inch on India's  policy that the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] should be  universal and nondiscriminatory. The prime minister asserted  that the country will continue to have optimum defense  preparedness and no one should tell us what our defense  requirement should be.    Referring to the controversy over the recently-held London  talks, he said we should not refuse talks, as it is important to  apprise the other party of our view on this issue. He  categorically reiterated that there is no pressure from the  United States for capping our missile programs. On the visit of  the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. Talbott, to New Delhi,  he said the NPT was not discussed. Mr. Rao said that the NPT  itself is under review and India has demanded that it should be  radically changed in its spirit to make it more acceptable to  Third World countries.    On Agni, he said it is an experiment and not a missile  program. He asserted that it will not be stopped under any  conditions. He said it is absurd to say such a program of  national importance will be stopped for want of 50 crore rupees.  He said that the data from recent experiment of recent  technology is being analyzed and it will be about a year to  complete the study. The prime minister announced that the  government's decision to set up a National Security Council,  which will examine the total security need of the country.  [sentence as heard]    Assessing the present world security scenario, Mr. Rao said  in the post-Cold War era developing nations have to be more  vigilant. He hailed the international treaty banning the  chemical weapons as a major step toward disarmament, which is  universal and nondiscriminatory. He said the Nonaligned  Movement has greater relevance today for putting forward the  developing countries' views.    Expressing dissatisfaction over the prime minister's  clarification over the Agni program, most opposition members  staged a walkout from the house.</p>

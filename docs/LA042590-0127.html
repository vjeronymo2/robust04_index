			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GYROMATICS TO PLAY REUNION SHOW  </P> <P> The Gyromatics, one of the most offbeat bands the Orange County pop music scene  produced in the 1980s, has reunited and will make its first public performances  in nearly two years May 11 and 12 at the Sunset Pub in Sunset Beach.  </P> <P> Leader/guitarist Ron Eglit, singer Floyd Elliot, saxophonist Alan Palmer and  bassist John Wheeler, all original members of the group, will be joined by  drummer Steve Aschoff, who plays with Eglit in the band of surf guitarist Dick  Dale.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach-based Gyromatics, whose eclectic sound was once described  by Elliot as "atomic swing music," released some independent singles and EPs  but never landed a major record contract.  </P> <P> Eglit said that he thinks the band was "ahead of its time" and that he decided  to attempt a reunion because "now it's OK" to combine Western swing, roots rock  and jazz with the anything-goes attitude of '80s punk.

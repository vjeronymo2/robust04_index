			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NFL UNION SUGGESTS BAR ON ALL MEDIA  </P> <P> The NFL players union today suggested that all members of the news media, male  and female, be barred from locker rooms and that separate interview areas be  set up to assure privacy for the players.  </P> <P> "NFL players should be afforded absolute privacy in their locker rooms," Gene  Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Assn., said in a statement from  his union's headquarters.  </P> <P> "They should not be expected or required to participate in media interviews  unless fully clothed."  </P> <P> His statement follows two recent incidents involving female sports writers  covering NFL teams.  </P> <P> Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson alleged that on Sept. 17 several Patriot  players approached her while they were naked in an attempt to embarrass her  with lewd suggestions.  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam Wyche barred USA Today's Denise Tom from entering  his team's locker room last Monday. Wyche was fined 1/17th of his salary by the  league.  </P> <P> Upshaw acknowledged that women reporters must have the same access to players  as male reporters. As a possible solution, he suggested a "separate area,  removed from the locker room, where all players would be available on an equal  basis to all accredited media, male or female."  </P></p>

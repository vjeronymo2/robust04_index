			<p>920804 FT  04 AUG 92 / World Trade News: China acts on copyright CHINA has decided to join a global copyright convention as part of its policy of economic reform, the official New China News Agency said, Reuter reports from Beijing. Qin Guanlin, representative to Unesco, had officially notified it of the decision. US trade negotiators had pressed Beijing to back up promises to protect patents and copyrights with deeds. China promised last year to join international copyright organisations. 'The decision was a result of China's policy of deepening reform and opening to the outside world,' the agency quoted Qin as saying. China would conscientiously abide by the convention so that copyrights were effectively protected. China's first copyright law went into effect in June last year.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / SIB reviews rules for life policies THE SECURITIES and Invest-ments Board has decided to review its controversial disclosure rules for the sale of life insurance products. The move is certain to anger the life insurance industry. It reflects widespread criticism from consumer groups and the SIB's expectation that the Office of Fair Trading will reject key elements of the disclosure rules as anti-competitive. The disclosure rules, announced in May after consultation with the industry and consumer groups, will not take effect until the OFT has determined that they sufficiently promote competition. In December 1990 the OFT said a previous set of disclosure rules did not meet that objective and asked the SIB to reconsider. Mr Andrew Large, the SIB's chairman, is said to have privately expressed concern that the present rules, agreed last May under Sir David Walker, his predecessor, still fail to protect the public adequately from high-pressure sales tactics. In particular, the OFT is expected to challenge the SIB's decision not to require sales agents to disclose their commissions to prospective customers. It will also challenge the basis for illustrations of prospective charges and investment returns. The SIB will announce later today that it has retained Mr Tim Miller, formerly marketing director at M&amp;G Group, the unit trust company, as a consultant. Mr Miller's role will be to examine whether the present rules ensure that the public is not sold unsuitable products. Mr Miller, a long-time critic of life insurance sales tactics, resigned earlier this year from the board of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the industry, over its support for the SIB disclosure regime. He objected in particular to allowing companies to show prospective customers industry-wide averages of costs, rather than showing their own projected costs.</p>

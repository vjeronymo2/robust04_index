The  procedures are the same: corruption of police and public  servants, terrorism against those fighting it, and social  donations to obtain accomplices in the society. During the final  phase of consolidating its power, there is the assassination of  judges.    The drug traffic has set up its activities in the border  towns, the final stopping places leading toward drug consumption  in the United States.    The unequivocal phase in Tijuana is that of the struggle  between two rings to seize exclusive control over the traffic.  To establish their supremacy, the phase includes corruption of  judicial authorities.    Tijuana, currently governed by the PAN [National Action  Party], as it was in the past by the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party], is the obvious territory for entrenching  the drug traffic's power, because of the land and sea routes to  the United States. This situation is the one associated by the  attorney general of the republic, Diego Valades, with the  general features of the crimes preceding the one now attracting  the public's attention. That precedent, with its tragic  continuity, is explained by the goals sought by the two rings  fighting for Tijuana.    Initially, during the 1970's, Felix Gallardo, now imprisoned  at Almoloya, Mexico State, was the leader of those now  comprising rival groups: Hector Palma Salazar, aka "El Guero  Palma"; Joaquin Guzman Loera, "El Chapo Guzman," also  imprisoned; and the Arellano Felix brothers, who are fugitives.  The ring moved from Sinaloa to Guadalajara, where its members  operated as a cartel, unquestionably associated with the group  in Cali, Colombia. The scope of its operations has included the  states of Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sonora, and Baja  California. Insofar as organized crime is concerned, it is a  vast domain. This is the cause of the violence for gaining  power, with the principal chiefs imprisoned. [passage omitted]    The latest incidents have been the confrontation in Tijuana  on 3 March of this year, and the murder of Federico Benitez  Lopez, public safety director, who went to the airport based on  an anonymous tip concerning an alleged bomb on that site.    The last two episodes are identical from the standpoint of  the criminals' deployment and their brutality toward their  victims. It is a war to the death for criminal power in Tijuana,  with the complicity of police and state authorities, as one  infers from the incidents on 3 March, particularly, and on 28  April.    What occurred in March is public knowledge: Commander  Alejandro Castaneda Andrade and six agents under his orders were  riding in two PGR [Attorney General's Office] vans toward a  residence in which it was suspected, with reason, that a meeting  was being held by the Arellano Felix ring, when several vehicles  drove by in tandem. Andrade and agent Arturo Morales caught up  with the last one, ordering the driver to stop. The response  came with shots fired at them pointblank. Andrade was killed,  and Morales seriously wounded. Shots were fired from the van  following Andrade, and the agents managed to overcome four  survivors. Three died, and another, wounded, was taken to the  IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute] hospital.    Within minutes, State Judicial Police agents and Tijuana  municipal police whose help was requested by the federal forces  arrived on the scene of the attack. The state [deputy] attorney  general, Sergio Ortiz Lara (whose detention has evoked protests  from Governor Ruffo Appel and from the PAN national leader,  Carlos Castillo Peraza), was accompanied by the agent from the  State Public Prosecutor's Office, Carlos Guerrero Zermeno, and  other police agents. Playing their last card against the federal  police, the latter took with them Ortiz Lara, and one of the  four in custody, later identified as Ismael Higuera Guerrero,  aka "El Mayel," from the Arellano Felix ring. At that point, two  persons emerged from another van, firing at the federal agents,  one of whom was seriously wounded. All those who were in custody  disappeared. Jesus Hernandez Tejeda, a State Judicial Police  member, was captured later.    Remanded for these acts were the deputy attorney general,  Ortiz Lara; the State Public Prosecutor's Office agent, Guerrero  Zermeno; five State Judicial Police group chiefs; and a  commander from the Public Safety Directorate. The remand was  based on "probable guilt of the commission of four crimes, and  others that may result from the investigations."    It is known that, when Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara  was  summoned regarding the incident, he displayed an amparo, which  explains why the subsequent order for his capture, executed on  Wednesday of this week, came from the Second Unified Court of  the 15th Circuit in Tijuana.    The criminal under arrest, apparently protected by Deputy  Attorney General Ortiz Lara, escaped from that town.    These facts, part of a criminal process, do not authorize  anyone, much less the governor of Baja California Norte, Ernesto  Ruffo Appel, to describe as irresponsible the historical comment  made by the attorney general of the republic concerning the drug  traffic in Tijuana. Those records explain that there is a  criminal organization here, with networks in other countries;  and that, consequently, from Sicily to Colombia, Honduras, or  Bolivia, their procedures are the same: subjugating the police  and judicial authorities with bribes or terrorism, to create the  legal vacuum and to have their crimes left unpunished. [passage  omitted]    One cannot infer from Diego Valades' statement any political  intention other than strict application of the law, based on  demonstrable facts. If the Second Unified Court of the 15th  District issued the order for the deputy attorney general's  detention, the arguments for ordering it must have been  irrefutable, according to law. Hence, it is inexplicable that  Ruffo Appel, in his complaint, omits this fact that, in itself,  refutes the political interpretation. It is a legal procedure  for preserving peace and the rule of law in Tijuana.    The governor's verbal attacks unfortunately coincide with  Carlos Castillo Peraza's correct statement, claiming: "It is of  little use to build and consolidate the necessary governability  (the action of Attorney General Diego Valades), when confronted  with the challenges that such events pose for all Mexicans." The  best service that could be given to the Tijuana cartel would be  to dispute a legal act with senseless political interpretations.    No one, even if he should propose it in an agitated state,  could take the PAN to task publicly for incidents in which it  obviously is not an accomplice, such as the governor defending  the deputy attorney general, not as a public servant but rather  as a fellow party member.    If the deputy attorney general is innocent of the charges  brought by the Attorney General's Office, why does the governor  consider the others captured (the agent from the State Public  Prosecutor's Office, Guerrero Zermeno, who accompanied the  deputy attorney general at all times, five State Judicial Police  group chiefs, and a Public Safety Directorate commander) to be  blameworthy? He did not even mention them in his protest.    This case in Tijuana is not a minor one, because it reveals  the confusion besetting the country. Legal proceedings are being  disrupted to prevent an understanding of the real situation.  Therefore, the action of the Attorney General's Office is seen  as a political maneuver to discredit the PAN; whereas the facts  prove that the undeferable intention is to fight, in Tijuana and  throughout the country, against the legal vacuum that would  heighten the drug traffickers' power.    The dilemma is between the law and coexistence with  organized  crime.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tobacco stocks collapse SHARES in international trading group BAT Industries dived after Philip Morris, its US tobacco rival, surprised the market by announcing a profits warning and signalled the start of a cigarette price war to boost sales of its Marlboro brand. The first half of the session saw strong demand for BAT which sent the shares climbing 16 to 1015p. Enthusiasts expected a further advance in the afternoon ahead of a clutch of brokers' recommendations early next week. However, the announcement from Philip Morris sent BAT plunging on fears that a price war might have a severe effect on the group's current year profits. The shares closed near the day's low, down 71 1/2 at 927 1/2 p, with a hefty 14m traded by the close. Hoare Govett moved the stock from a buy to a hold and indicated it could be shaving the current-year forecast by around Pounds 120m to about Pounds 2.1bn. But, Mr Chris Alexander at Lehman Brothers remained confident about the underlying performance of the company and said yesterday's price fall 'had been overdone given BAT's exposure to the US market.' Rothmans was also affected. The shares fell 18 to 657p.</p>

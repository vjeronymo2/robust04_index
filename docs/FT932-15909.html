			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat Comforting though it is that Queens Moat Houses still has positive net worth, that addresses only part of the concern. The company also faces the task of generating enough cash to service debts which must easily exceed Pounds 1bn. Hotels traditionally generate little cash, which perhaps explains why many chains are part of diversified groups and why Queens Moat, as a pure hotel business, had recurrent need for outside funds. Its cash problem is now compounded by the downturn in Germany and by self-inflicted damage from its manager incentive scheme. One solution would be a programme of disposals. That would worry other operators because of its impact on the already depressed values of UK provincial hotels. Nor would it necessarily help Queens Moat. The easiest hotels to sell would be those generating most cash. Without them, its liquidity problem could worsen. An elegant alternative would be for Forte to satisfy its diversification ambitions by buying Queens Moat's European portfolio. The best of these hotels operate under the competing Holiday Inn franchise, though, and Forte may use the the Queens Moat crisis as cover to cut its own - uncovered - dividend next week. Rebasing the payout could open the way to an eventual rights issue. But funds would mostly be needed to repay debt leaving room for little more than a nibble at Queens Moat. Bank lenders may end up effectively running the company for some time. Since they will be squeezing out what cash they can, competitors can expect some pretty aggressive pricing.</p>

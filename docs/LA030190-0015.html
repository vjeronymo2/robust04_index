			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BIOLOGIST REJECTS PRESIDENCY OF SALK INSTITUTE  </P> <P> The Salk Institute has failed to persuade Dr. James E. Darnell, a prominent  East Coast biologist, to become the research institution's next president.  However, Renato Dulbecco, who became president in late 1988, has agreed to  remain in the post until it is filled.  </P> <P> The Salk board of directors learned Monday that Darnell, who was strongly  endorsed by the institute's faculty, had opted to remain at Rockefeller  University in New York. The Salk board offered the presidency to Darnell in  November, after a nationwide search.  </P> <P> Eventually, the institute's faculty will caucus to determine if another  candidate should be nominated for the board's consideration, Dulbecco said.  </P> <P> Dulbecco, a Nobel Prize-winning researcher, agreed to leave the laboratory and  become president in 1988, after Frederic de Hoffman, the longtime Salk  president, retired. Dulbecco intended to serve only a short time, then return  to research.  </P></p>

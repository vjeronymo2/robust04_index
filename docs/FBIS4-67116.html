Referring to the subjects discussed at the conference,  Vasile  Troneci, head of the National Interpol Bureau, told us: "Since  1984, Interpol has facilitated the rapid transmission of  information on cases of international terrorism among member  countries. Right now, Interpol is paying particular attention  to money laundering operations, organized crime, and trafficking  in stolen cars, which have assumed great proportions in Central  and Eastern Europe. We noted that, with each passing year,  Romanian citizens are committing increasingly more crimes  abroad. Last year, 38 Romanians were arrested for drug  trafficking and five for arms trafficking. Some 980 Romanian  citizens committed crimes abroad in 1991; their number grew to  almost 1,500 in 1992 and 2,435 in 1993. Last year, we issued  international warrants through Interpol for 87 people, of whom  only 12 were caught and brought home."    Vasile Troneci said in conclusion: "On a proposal from  Germany, a Regional International Police Organization of the 12  EU countries, called EUROPE, was set up some three to four years  ago. This body is paying special attention to drug trafficking  and terrorism cases and is in constant touch with Interpol."</p>

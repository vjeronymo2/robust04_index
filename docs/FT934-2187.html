			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Little knowledge is a dangerous thing: UK vocational education is under fire in a new report, write John Authers and Lisa Wood An employment consultant listening to Mr Kenneth Clarke's announcement in the Budget that the UK government would introduce a 'modern' apprenticeship scheme suggested to his wife that their son might like to pursue such a route. 'My son . . . an apprentice?' she screamed. 'He is bright and will go to university.' This kind of traditional academic snobbery is one of the biggest problems facing British manufacturing today. Deep-seated skills problems threaten to stifle recovery and leave the UK vulnerable to competition from both European and increasingly high-tech Asian economies. A report* published today pinpoints the crisis. It says the system of vocational qualifications phased in by the government over the past three years is a 'disaster of epic proportions'. Professor Alan Smithers and his team from Manchester University's Centre for Education and Employment concentrate their attack on two reforms: national vocational qualifications (NVQs), which are work-based and measure an individual's ability to do a task, and the general national vocational qualification (GNVQ), intended as an alternative to A-levels mainly for students in full-time education. Both qualifications - introduced in workplaces and schools - are based on what a student can do, rather than the knowledge or theory acquired about a particular subject. In comments which will intensify the debate between adherents of the new system and its critics, Prof Smithers claims both NVQs and GNVQs are inferior to previous training schemes and to comparable European courses. Response to the report has been swift. Mr Tony Webb, director of training at the Confederation of British Industry, one of the driving forces behind the new qualifications, said: 'There is a great deal of misunderstanding about what NVQs are. To an employer it is what somebody can do that matters.' In marked contrast, Professor Sig Prais, of the independent think tank, the National Institute for Economics and Social Research, a noted critic of NVQs, said: 'The government may now be sufficiently embarrassed in order that it reconsider the whole system.' Such a move is highly unlikely despite the fact that training for 16-to-19-year-olds in the UK is unco-ordinated and controlled by different government departments. GNVQs, for example, are an education department responsibility, while NVQs come under the employment department. Both departments are trying to give more status to the new qualifications. For instance, the apprenticeship scheme announced in the Budget, under the employment department, will be based on NVQs. Meanwhile, the current review of the National Curriculum for 14-to-18-year-olds, by Sir Ron Dearing for the education department, is expected to recommend a stronger emphasis on GNVQ. So what has the government been trying to do with its vocational education standards and provision? Mr Tim Boswell, further education minister said: 'We believe the broad structure is right and that we can build on it to have a really powerful range of qualifications.' Nevertheless the problem is plain. Britain's workforce is under-educated and under-qualified. Only 18 per cent of the UK workforce, for example, is qualified to craft level - skilled carpenters for example - whereas in Germany the figure is 56 per cent, France 33 per cent and the Netherlands 38 per cent. Other international comparisons are revealing although direct contrasts along the lines attempted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (see accompanying graph) are difficult because countries use different training schemes. Prof Prais points out that the German figure for 16-to-18-year-olds in full-time vocational educational is swollen by the numbers of apprentices on the country's 'dual scheme', who spend most of the week with their employer, spending only one or two days at a college. However, his own figures also rank the UK's vocational provision low compared with its main economic competitors. He says that 64 per cent of the British workforce has no vocational qualifications, compared with 26 per cent in Germany, and 23 per cent in Switzerland. An awareness that there is a shortage of skilled workers has forced the government to rethink vocational education. It has sought to establish three routes into the world of work for young people: a work-based route built on NVQs; the GNVQ (now renamed 'vocational A-levels' by the education department); and the 'A' level. An effective, competence - based qualifications system is critical to reform, the government believes. But here is the rub - deciding what amounts to competence pits academics such as Prof Smithers against business bodies such as the CBI. According to Prof Smithers, the educational theory of NVQs 'is loosely derived from behavioural psychology, and argues it is what people do that counts, their competence (to perform a task)'. Examiners assume that what pupils know or understand can be inferred from what they do. By contrast, Prof Smithers and other conservative academics believe that both practical ability and trainees' theoretical grasp of their tasks must be tested. In most European countries, trainees take practical and written examinations, both of which must be judged acceptable by external examiners, before they can gain a qualification. The added theory can be vital, critics of the current system claim. One college lecturer suggests that a young NVQ-qualified craftsman could build a brick wall, but 'because he had never been taught about the effects of freezing weather on water, he would not know what to do when it was cold, and neither would he know what to do in hot weather. So your wall would probably fall down within a couple of years.' Testing on the continent is also more rigorously linked to the needs of the workplace. In Switzerland, for instance, trainees lose marks for taking more than a fixed time to complete work, and must produce consistent quality. Prof Prais says that in the UK, examiners are more concerned to ensure candidates can reach a certain standard - not necessarily that they do so consistently - and do not set a time limit for the work. According to Prof Prais: 'It's vital for the economics of production for someone to be trained to do something reliably and punctually. We have given up testing for that kind of thing.' A National Institute study of workplace practices in Europe found serious UK inadequacies which could be attributed to training: Machinery maintenance was found to be routine on the continent, but in Britain was left to smaller 'firefighting' teams of qualified craftsmen. Normal machine operators did not understand how to practise good maintenance. In the clothing industry, qualified German workers could reach an efficient working speed on a new garment within three days, while an English worker would typically take three weeks. On this evidence, British employers seem sorely let down by the education and training system. Even though they may recruit workers who are competent in their immediate tasks, they will not in the long run have a workforce with a broad range of flexible and competitive skills. Changing the system to satisfy their needs along the lines identified in Switzerland and Germany requires both clarity of government objectives and a recognition by employers that their best interests lie in a deeper commitment to high-level training. Prof Smithers report shows that consensus on the way forward is as far away as ever. * All Our Futures - Britain's Educational Revolution: Prof Alan Smithers, Channel Four, PO Box 4000, London W3 6XJ; free with sae</p>

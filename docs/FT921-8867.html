			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: In the firing line for brickbats whatever is decided - Peter Lilley's dilemma over referring Tarmac, Steetley and Redland to the MMC MR PETER Lilley, Britain's trade and industry secretary, won a small historic victory on Wednesday when he persuaded the European Commission to give up its right to consider the proposed merger of the UK brick, clay tile and concrete product businesses of Tarmac and Steetley. It is the first time the EC has given up its rights to investigate a proposed large merger since new competition rules came into force in 1990. Mr Lilley - having won the argument that British regulatory authorities should deal with what is a domestic merger with no continental European impact - must now determine how he will exercise his new won authority. Crucially he must decide whether to refer for investigation to the Monopolies and Merger Commission (MMC) two rival proposals affecting the ownership of Steetley, a large British brick and clay tile manufacturer and France's biggest aggregates producer. The UK Office of Fair Trading is already considering whether to recommend an MMC investigation of a rival hostile Pounds 600m bid for the whole of Steetley by Redland, another large British building materials group. The Tarmac deal, by comparison, would leave Steetley retaining its UK and French aggregate and ready-mix concrete businesses. The outcome of the Redland and Tarmac proposals will affect future ownership, structure and employment within a UK brick industry still suffering massive over-capacity despite previous job cuts and plant closures. Both Redland and Tarmac/Steetley have said they would axe significant capacity if their plans are allowed to go ahead. An argument against a full scale MMC investigation is that it might delay plans for a rationalisation of the companies brick plants. On the hand it might be politically embarrassing if Mr Lilley were simply to clear both 'bids' after having gone to the trouble of persuading Brussels to give up its right to consider the Tarmac/Steetley joint venture. It is thought unlikely that Mr Lilley would want to treat the rival proposals differently on the grounds that it might be unfair to leave the field clear for one side to pursue merger plans while the other was bogged down by an MMC investigation. An alternative would be for the trade secretary to seek undertakings which would require the merged companies to dispose of selected businesses in markets where it was deemed they had a dominant market position. The option to seek an undertaking on disposals, rather than trigger a full-scale MMC inquiry lasting several months, was included in the 1989 Companies Act. The option has been exercised five times since August 1990 on bids involving Rank for Mecca; Hillsdown for Strong &amp; Fisher; International Marine for Benjamin Priest; Williams Holdings for Racal and Trafalgar House for Davey. Over the same period the trade secretary has launched full MMC inquiries into another 16 takeover offers. A bid automatically lapses when an inquiry takes place. Mr Lilley in his approach to the EC regulatory authorities identified both brick and clay roof tiles as markets where UK competition problems could arise as a result of merger plans. A takeover of Steetley by Redland would leave the combined companies controlling about 46 per cent of the clay tile market; a Tarmac/Steetley joint venture would have a 39 per cent share. Both ventures may be able to offer undertakings on clay tiles which would circumvent a monopolies probe. Bricks, however, may provide a more difficult problem. Any undertakings must involve disposals rather than closures. Potential purchaser of unwanted brick plants are few and far between in this market. On the basis of national market shares it is difficult to see why bricks should be included in any monopoly considerations. Tarmac and Steetley between them control about 17 per cent of the UK brick market. Redland and Steetley would have about 16 per cent. Mr Lilley, however, has indicated that he will be looking at production capacity in regional markets - despite protests by Redland, Steetley and Tarmac that they sell into a single national market determined by price and not where bricks were made. Low haulage costs in Britain mean that bricks can be easily transported, and manufacturers say that sales are a better measure of regional market share than local production capacity. Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, nonetheless noted this week that a Tarmac/Steetley joint venture would control a high percentage of production capacity in north-east and south-west England. He said that there was danger that 'the merger would create a dominant position' in those markets. On current figures Tarmac and Steetley control almost 80 per cent of local capacity in the north-east and approaching 50 per cent in the south-west. Redland argues that a monopolies probe on the basis of brick manufacturing capacity would not be justified in its case, even on regional grounds. A merger with Steetley it says would leave it with only 23 per cent of brick capacity in south-east England, its biggest market. Steetley has few plants in south-east England but 'exports' a large number of bricks to the region. Combined brick sales of Redland and Steetley in the south-east, therefore, will be much higher than local production capacity would indicate. Nonetheless, Redland might find it easier to give undertakings on brick and clay tile disposals than Tarmac and Steetley. The success of the Tarmac/Steetley joint venture is wholly dependent upon their ability to rationalise these UK businesses. Redland wants Steetley's French aggregates business and its UK building materials. Who gets what could depend upon what Mr Lilley decides.</p>

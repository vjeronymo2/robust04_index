			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shipping lobby renews tax relief campaign THE cross-party campaign urging tax breaks for Britain's shipping industry has been renewed in the run-up to the Budget. An all-party Commons motion, launched by the Ulster Unionists and signed by 33 MPs so far, calls for the establishment of a maritime enterprise zone and reiterates the industry's call for 100 per cent capital allowances and relief for employers on income tax or national insurance contributions on seafarers' earnings. Signatories include Mr David Shaw, the Tory MP for Dover, and Sir Rhodes Boyson, a member of the executive of the 1922 Tory backbench committee. The last serious attempt to win tax concessions for the industry came in the 1991 budget process when more than 100 Tory MPs supported the proposals. Although campaigners believe that 30 Tory MPs is a more realistic target this time, as the suggestions put forward are more specific, the government's overall Commons majority of just 21 MPs means that even about a dozen Tories determined to pursue the matter could cause difficulties. Tory MPs with an interest in shipping are already raising the issue in their individual pre-Budget discussions with Treasury ministers. After a meeting next week between representatives from the Chamber of Shipping, the industry's trade association, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, the MPs will consider whether to make representations directly to the prime minister. Campaigners have been cheered by the fact that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has asked for details of their complaint of unfair competition in European shipping, with other EC countries giving greater incentives. The industry believes its cause is helped by the position being starker than before, and warns that unless help is given there will be no British-flagged ships by the next election.</p>

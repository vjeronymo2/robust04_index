			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BFI says US practices would cut Attwoods' eps Under US accounting practices for goodwill, earnings at Attwoods, the UK waste services group, would be more than halved. That is one of the main points stressed in the offer document for the group published yesterday by Browning-Ferris Industries, the Texas-based waste management group, which launched a hostile Pounds 364m bid last month. BFI is offering 109p cash for each ordinary share - just above the year's low of 105p. But using US accounting methods, estimated 1994 earnings would be cut from 5.3p to 2.5p, the document says. At that level, the offer represents a premium of more than 115 per cent, BFI claims. If the group were to trade at the average multiple for US waste companies of 19 times, 'Attwoods shares should be valued at around 50p'. In the US, goodwill is written off through the profit and loss account over up to 40 years. In the UK it is taken through the balance sheet. At the end of July 1993 Attwoods had Pounds 179.1m of goodwill written off. BFI, which attacks Attwoods financial record as 'dismal', says that as the company makes 65 per cent of its operating profits in the US, a proper comparison with other US waste companies should reflect US accounting standards. 'All we are trying to do is compare apples with apples,' said Mr Greg Muldoon, senior vice-president at BFI. 'Attwoods earnings are inflated by US standards.' Attwoods yesterday said the offer document provided 'no further justification for the wholly inadequate offer outlined in its original press announcement.' Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive, said BFI was making its offer to address its own weaknesses in Attwoods markets. It was 'an unintended compliment to our strengths.' BFI also argues that Attwoods is not prepared to meet the challenges facing the waste management industry, and would perform much better if it were not standing alone. It criticises Attwoods' narrow focus on waste collection in North America. At the same time BFI sees Attwoods UK business, which is more integrated, as an important step in its plans to expand into Europe. BFI has already won the support of Laidlaw, of Canada, Attwoods' largest shareholder with 29.8 per cent of the ordinary shares and 73 per cent of the preference stock. Laidlaw, which has three of its directors on Attwoods' board, has agreed to sell its ordinary shares at Dollars 8.50 per American Depositary Receipt - equivalent to five ordinary shares - and its preference shares at 85p even if a second bidder entered with a higher offer.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW USE FOR THE HAIR OF THE DOG;  </P> <P> ANIMALS: SOME PET OWNERS HAVE TAKEN UP SPINNING FUR INTO YARN FOR SWEATERS.  THEY SAY IT'S WARM AND MAKES FOR A NICE MEMENTO.  </P> <P> This yarn is about dog yarn.  </P> <P> Liz Kusak loves her aging dog so much that she turns the hair it sheds into  sweaters she can wear.  </P> <P> She spins the hair into yarn on an old-fashioned spinning wheel and then knits  it into shawls, vests and cardigans.  </P> <P> When Kusak weaves an Afghan, it's actually keeshond. When she wears her  creations around her Canoga Park neighborhood, she adds a new dimension to  walking the dog.  </P> <P> "Some people cringe when you tell them it's a dog sweater," Kusak said. "Others  love it. My grandchildren love it. They say, 'Oh, you're wearing Cindy!' "  </P> <P> Cindy is a 12-year-old keeshond -- a long-haired, gray-and-black dog who dozes  peacefully at Kusak's feet while she operates her wooden spinning wheel.  </P> <P> The wheel is turned by a simple foot treadle. It twists short clumps of dog  hair into a long strand of yarn. The yarn is washed and dried before it is  knitted or woven into a garment.  </P> <P> "I have a domestic 'sheep.' Except this one is housebroken, is a good watchdog  and a great companion," said Kusak, a retired aerospace metalographic  technician. "Long after Cindy's gone, I'll have her sweaters."  </P> <P> Unlike wool, dog sweaters do not attract moths, Kusak said. Or fleas. They are  attracting increasing numbers of fans, however.  </P> <P> Dog Fancy magazine recently reported that "more and more people are discovering  the beauty and warmth" of what it labeled "chiengora chic." (Chien is the  French word for dog.)  </P> <P> "What you can make with your yarn is limited only by your imagination and your  supply of yarn," the magazine said. But it warned that "flea powders and heavy  dirt in the hair can pose health hazards . . . discard any hair that has a lot  of grass in it."  </P> <P> Dog-yarn spinners say some breeds are better than others at growing sweater  material. Collies and other long-haired dogs whose fur has a slight crimp to it  produce the best yarn; smooth fur from such dogs as cocker and Maltese spaniels  and Shih Tzus pulls apart too easily, they say.  </P> <P> But dog sweaters leave many people cold.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't wear one," said Jan Dill of Bellflower, who wore a red wool sweater  as she shopped recently at the Beverly Center. "It's bad enough that my dog's  hair is always getting on my sweaters."  </P> <P> Westchester resident Joe Smith, wearing a brown cotton sweater sporting a maple  leaf, shuddered at the idea. "How would you know that it wouldn't attract  fleas?" he asked.  </P> <P> People who wear dog-hair sweaters say those who make such comments are barking  up the wrong tree. They say more and more dog lovers are making and wearing  them.  </P> <P> Dog breeder Joanie Fraser, who lives in a geodesic dome in the mountains 80  miles north of Los Angeles, said she uses a keeshond sweater she knitted all  winter long.  </P> <P> "It's like wearing a heating pad around my neck," she said. "The men in town  just crack up when I tell them what I'm wearing."  </P> <P> Her dogs recognize the sweater, too, Fraser said. "They get excited when I wear  it. They jump all over and kiss and nuzzle me more. After they're gone, I'll  have a constant memory of them."  </P> <P> Calabasas schoolteacher Gay Latta said that her two Samoyed dogs "probably know  it's them" when she wears a white sweater knitted with dog hair she spun from  their thick fur. They shed so much that she has collected enough for a second  sweater.  </P> <P> "Some people assume a negative connotation at first. They say, 'Ugh . . . dog  hair.' But you win them over when they touch it. It's a real nice memento of  your dogs. I've spun yarn for two people whose dogs have died."  </P> <P> Dog-grooming school operator Nick Jamieson said dog lovers often ask if there  is a use for the fur he piles daily into a 33-gallon trash can at his Canoga  Park shop.  </P> <P> Approached by Kusak, Jamieson agreed to set aside some of the clippings for her  and others. Jamieson is not interested in wearing a sweater knitted from dog  yarn, however.  </P> <P> "I own a cat," he said.  </P></p>

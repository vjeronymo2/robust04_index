			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: Crucial point missing about Mexican air traffic control affair Sir, Your article, 'Mexican air traffic control deal upheld', (March 3) misses one crucial point. You report my saying that the Mexican government has carried out no more than a perfunctory investigation of my allegations that government officials solicited money from me. This in itself is perfectly true, but it ignores the government's strenuous efforts to discredit me, beginning before any investigation could possibly have been launched into the truth of my allegations. This speaks volumes about government priorities. The sum total of the 'investigation' into my report was limited to a half-page fax. It confined itself to one simple question: did I know the names of the people who tried to squeeze a bribe out of me? I do not know their true names, which has led the government to conclude that the allegations were unfounded. According to the Mexican government, the fact that a witness to a crime does not know the names of the culprits means that no crime has taken place. By the same curious logic, it also proves that the witness is lying and should be threatened with imprisonment. Kaveh Moussavi, 56 Old Road, Oxford OX3 7LL</p>

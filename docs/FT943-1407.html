			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Court backs Nadir plea to block Polly Peck sell-off A lawyer representing Mr Asil Nadir said yesterday that an interim court order had been made in Istanbul preventing administrators from selling any assets of Polly Peck International in Turkey. Mr Nadir fled to Cyprus in May last year while facing 13 charges of theft and false accounting involving Pounds 34m. The administrators in London yesterday said that they had not seen full details of the order and therefore could not comment on its potential effect on the administration. However, they added that they thought the move was 'the latest in a series of spoiling tactics adopted by Asil Nadir to delay the progress of the administration'. They stressed that the action would not 'deter them from their responsibilities to PPI creditors'. Mr Zeki Inanli, representing Mr Nadir, said the interim order had been given by the court at Kucukcekmece, a suburb of Istanbul, on September 16. He said the order was based on the legal opinion that Turkish and British insolvency laws were contradictory and that the PPI administrators therefore had no legal status. Mr Inanli said that the action, brought by Mr Nadir, aimed to annul all transactions made so far by the administrators in Turkey. He said the case would continue after the interim order. He added that the fugitive businessman had brought the case because the administrators' actions would have a negative effect on the Turkish economy. Mr Nadir has run a campaign in Turkey to win public support against the administrators and prevent them from disposing of the remaining PPI companies in Turkey and northern Cyprus. Among the assets of the now bankrupt fruits-to-electronics conglomerate is Meyna, the Turkish fruit and packaging business which contributed most of PPI's reported profits in the near and Middle East. Last year the privately owned Ozgorkey Group of Izmir, Turkey, was in talks with the administrators to buy the company. The administrators for PPI - who were appointed in 1990 - are Mr Michael Jordan and Mr Richard Stone from Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Mr Chris-topher Morris of Touche Ross.</p>

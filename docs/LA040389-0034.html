			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The Glasnost Film Festival, a package of 22 Soviet documentary films said to be  uncensored and covering such themes as the Afghanistan war, Stalin's  repressions, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, alcoholism, religion and women's  rights, is making its way across the United States. Playing on campuses and in  art film theaters, the project is designed to provide Americans with a candid  view of life in the Soviet Union. The festival previewed in Washington where  "the audience could not believe what they were seeing -- that Russians could  make such documentaries," said tour coordinator Michael Brainerd of the Citizen  Exchange Council. The tour will end at UC Santa Barbara on May 5, and includes  a stop in Los Angeles on May 1. ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHE WRITES WHAT SHE KNOWS -- LOSING AT LOVE  </P> <P> Leslie Caveny rummages around in her purse and pulls out a large pink clock on  a rope. "It's my biological clock," she says blithely, hanging it around her  neck. "Of course, most people's biological clock is about getting married and  having babies. This is just about having someone to sleep with. So maybe it's a  hormonal love-life clock. Someday, somewhere, somebody will want to be with  me."  </P> <P> It is -- and isn't -- as tragic as it sounds. In her "Love of a Pig" (through  Aug. 13 at Studio City's Theatre West), Caveny, 27, traverses the rocky  wasteland of singlehood and one-sided love in a way that is at once comical,  sad, terrifying, mortifying and exhilarating. It is also achingly real. Working  with a quick-change chorus of cohorts, Caveny plays Jenny, an engaging  violinist who is head-over-heels for Joe, a churlish, self-involved bass  player.  </P> <P> Ostensibly a piece of fiction, the writer's own love life is the obvious -- and  unabashed -- source. "How pathetic have I been?" says Caveny, giggling. "Very  pathetic."  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> The titular reference, she says, denotes "a guy who does not treat you well,  and you take it. He may not treat you any way at all, and still you want him. I  know a lot of women like that -- and a lot of men. So it's not a man-hate  thing. I spent a lot of years blaming men. Finally, I realized if I blame them,  I don't have any control. But if I take some of the responsibility, I can  control it, I can change it. I can change what I'm willing to put up with."  </P> <P> That includes societal pressures.  </P> <P> "I've been accused of being an Amazon. I've felt guilty too, like, 'Oh, I'm not  feminine enough; my body's not a certain way.' I think I'm past that now. I'm  liking myself more in that way." And yet she says firmly, "I'm not someone  who's dying to be married. I mean, in the least few years, I've been asked out  on more dates. So I'm not panicked in the sense that nobody's showing any signs  of interest at all. It's just that so far, all my relationships have been  unhealthy."  </P> <P> How unhealthy?  </P> <P> "I always felt I was very strong, independent, capable, happy," she says wryly.  "But in relationships, I'd become nothing. My longest relationship was 11  months; the average is six months. There've also been times I couldn't get a  date to save my life. I once went a year and a half without a hug, kiss,  anything. Then I'd meet someone who'd want to be taken care of. So I'd get in  there, try to fix their lives; they'd need me and want to be with me all the  time -- and I'd think that was love. But it was never about me."  </P> <P> The love match in this play is one of those lopsided scenarios.  </P> <P> "It's based on a particular man who I was obsessed with," Caveny says, nodding.  "I chose to pretend the relationship was something completely different. If he  just looked at me, I'd think, 'Yes, he loves me!' " For months, she nursed her  crush from afar, as friends egged her on, persuading her that his passivity was  not disinterest but shyness. Then one night, out of the blue, he made his move.  She was wary but succumbed. The next morning he didn't speak to her. ("Major  pig.")  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> Growing up in New Jersey and Alabama, Caveny recalls writing poems and stories  from childhood on. At 15, she developed a bad case of acne and persuaded her  parents to let her transfer to a boarding school. "High school was very hard  and very cruel," she says soberly. "Being made fun of and teased. Looking back,  I realize they probably didn't say as many things as I thought. But I was so  self-conscious. And I felt so hideous."  </P> <P> At Boston University, Caveny studied playwrighting with Derek Walcott but got a  bachelor of fine arts in theater performance. "I always wanted to be a writer,"  she explains, "but I decided I couldn't try to do both. So writing went on the  back burner. But I always took creative writing classes, and did some short  stories." She pauses. "I believe in my acting abilities 100%, and I love  performing. But there's a separate pride I have about writing. It just feels  more . . . important."  </P> <P> A move to New York after college was short-lived: "I spent my time auditioning,  trying to pay the rent and running from scary people. A guy put a knife to my  throat in the subway. That had been my biggest fear -- and now it was coming  true. I thought, 'I'm going to die like this? This is ridiculous.'  </P> <P> Since arriving here in 1985, Caveny has become a member of Theatre West's  acting and writing workshops, and also ventured into doing stand-up comedy  around town. In the stand-up work, she says, "I do one character predominantly,  kind of an alter-ego. But it works out very nicely. 'Babs' can be as pathetic  as she wants -- and nobody ever thinks it's me."  </P> <P> Displaying her private pain publicly, Caveny says, has never fazed her. "I  guess I don't worry about peddling my guts on stage," she says with a shrug. "I  worry about physical danger. I don't want to pretend that people can't hurt my  feelings. Of course they can. But when we did this for the Theatre West Fest,  so many people came up to me and told me how they related to it, it blew my  mind. They all knew Joe. The funny thing is, none of the men ever think they're  Joe."  </P></p>

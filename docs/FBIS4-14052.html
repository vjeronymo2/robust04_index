			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal] </F>   [Excerpt] Last night, the Tzomet Central Committee  approved the new party constitution by a majority of 58 to 30.  Only 90 of the 250 committee members attended the vote.    Sources in Tzomet said that the fact that the constitution,  which was supported by Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan, did not  win a sweeping majority is a further indication that Eytan is  losing his power in Tzomet.    According to the new constitution, the chairman may appoint  party functionaries, and his only obligation is to report the  appointment to the party council and management. It was also  decided that the chairman will be the party's candidate for  prime minister and will be authorized to select and appoint  candidates for the posts of minister and deputy minister,  needing only to present the list to the Central Committee  without asking for its authorization.

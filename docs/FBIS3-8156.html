New elements appeared in the relations of the  PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] with those parties,  including a new context of negotiations for a new political  climate and the possibility of establishing a broader framework  of parliamentary cooperation, which does not mean inclusion in  government.    Ion Iliescu noted that these negotiations were assessed as  interesting, constructive, and capable of opening up a new stage  in the development of political life which would grant more  substance to the joint efforts of all political parties.    Asked by one of the journalists to reveal whether in the  near  future the establishment of a government team with the  parliamentary opposition is possible, President Ion Iliescu said  that in a democratic system, regardless of participation or  nonparticipation in the government, all political forces are in  one way or another drawn and absorbed into the joint effort to  achieve the country's reconstruction.    In a democratic practice, Iliescu said, the opposition has a  constructive role, even when it is very virulent and aggressive  toward the ruling party, and it makes a useful act of active  political and social criticism.    Romania's president further said: I believe that we can  enter a stage of normality, of civilized and constructive  dialogue, which will serve everybody. A government with the  opposition is another question that presumes other steps to  achieve a possible platform for unity in a broader government  team. It would not be wrong to achieve such a thing, said Ion  Iliescu, who added that he has always been open to such a  formula. This presupposes a better platform and he will follow  the current talks between the PDSR and the other parties. Ion  Iliescu also said that he believes that before talking about a  government coalition, it is necessary to achieve a platform  through agreement.</p>

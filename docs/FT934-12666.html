			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Decline in London rush-hour travel THE NUMBER of people travelling to work in central London in the morning rush-hour has fallen to its lowest level for more than 30 years, the Department of Transport said yesterday. Fewer than 1m people entered central London between 7am and 10am each day last year. This represents a fall of 14 per cent from the peak year of 1988. This mirrored a drop of 500,000 to 3.5m in the total employment available in London over the same period. Public transport use has also fallen from 1988 with declines of 8 per cent on Underground miles travelled, 10 per cent on rail mileage and 7 per cent on buses. In the period 1989 to 1991 Londoners travelled an average of 5,600 miles a year on personal business, an increase of 28 per cent on 1975-76. This largely reflected increased car ownership - car travel made up two-thirds of the total distance travelled. In 1991, 52 per cent of people living in outer London travelled to work by car while 35 per cent used public transport. In inner London the picture was reversed with only 30 per cent of commuters using cars and 51 per cent using of public transport. Road traffic speeds have fallen since 1968 and vehicles now move at an average of just over 10mph during the day in central London. However, the most recent figures for inner London showed a slight increase in traffic speeds from just under 12mph in 1986-1990 to just over 13mph in the morning rush-hour in 1991. Underground mileage travelled is at its highest level for 30 years while the increased use of midi and mini-buses has boosted mile-age travelled by the bus network.

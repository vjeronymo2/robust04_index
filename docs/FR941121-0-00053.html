			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b. Illinois also proposed a provision at 225 ILCS 720/3.15(e) which clarifies that the requirement discussed in finding 2.a does not preclude application of responsible land management practices if they are deemed necessary and approved by Illinois. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although section 515(b) of SMCRA does not contain a similar provision, this provision is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(4) and 817.116(c)(4) which allow approval of selective husbandry practices without restarting the responsibility period for revegetation if the regulatory authority obtains prior approval from the Director that the practices are normal husbandry practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Illinois program contains counterpart regulations which allow approval of selective husbandry practices at 62 Illinois Administrative Code (IAC) 1816.116(a)(2)(C) and 1817.116(a)(2)(C). Illinois limits its approval to normal conservation and land use management practices for the State of Illinois that are included in its regulations at 62 IAC 1816.116 and 1817.116. The selective husbandry practices included in the Illinois program have been approved by OSM as normal husbandry practices in accordance with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(4) and 817.116(c)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director finds Illinois' proposed provision at 225 ILCS 720/3.15(e), when read in light of the regulatory limitations at 62 IAC 1816.116(a)(2)(C) and 1817.116(a)(2)(C), is not inconsistent with the requirements of section 515(b)(20)(B) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(4) and 817.116(c)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. 225 ILCS 720/9.07 Fees and Forfeitures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Illinois revised 225 ILCS 720/9.07(a) by requiring all fees and civil penalties collected under the State Act be deposited into the Coal Mining Regulatory Fund instead of the general revenue fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revision was proposed to comply with new requirements in the State Finance Act (30 ILCS 105). Illinois Public Act 88&hyph;599 established the Coal Mining Regulatory Fund and added section 6z&hyph;36 to the State Finance Act. Section 6z&hyph;36 requires all moneys collected as fees and civil penalties under the State Act be deposited into the Coal Mining Regulatory Fund. The moneys in the fund will then be annually appropriated to the Department of Mines and Minerals for the enforcement of coal mining regulatory laws and rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no direct Federal counterpart to 225 ILCS 720/9.07(a). However, the proposed amendment is not inconsistent with the general requirements for permit fees at section 507(a) of SMCRA or 30 CFR 777.17 of the Federal regulations, which establish provisions for permit fees. Also, the proposed amendment is not inconsistent with the general requirements for civil penalties at Section 518 of SMCRA or 30 CFR 845 of the Federal regulations, which establish provisions for assessment of civil penalties. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed revision to 225 ILCS 720/9.07(a) is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to speak at a public hearing, no hearing was held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Illinois program. No Federal agency comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). None of the revisions that Illinois proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative Record No. IL&hyph;1551). EPA responded on September 27, 1994, that it had reviewed the proposed amendment and had no comment to offer (Administrative Record No. IL&hyph;1554). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> State Historical Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM is required to solicit comments from the SHPO and ACHP for all amendments that may have an effect on historic properties. By letter dated September 21, 1994, OSM solicited comments from the SHPO and ACHP (Administrative Record No. IL&hyph;1553). The SHPO gave its written concurrence with the proposed amendment on October 18, 1994 (Administrative Record No. IL&hyph;1557). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Director's Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by Illinois on September 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director is also taking this opportunity to make a correction to 30 CFR 913.10. The Department of Mines and Minerals was empowered by the State Act at 225 ILCS 720/9.02 (formerly Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 96 1/2, Section 7909.02) to act as the regulatory authority for the State of Illinois under SMCRA. Therefore, the existing designation at 30 CFR 913.10 which deems the Department of Mines and Minerals, Division of Land Reclamation as the regulatory authority in Illinois is being removed. The Department of Mines and Minerals is designated as the regulatory authority in Illinois, and 30 CFR 913.10 is being revised to reflect this decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, June 5 (AFP) -- Egyptian police have detained  10 leaders of the outlawed Moslem Brotherhood and plan to hold  them for 15 days for questioning, Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi said Sunday.    He told the semi-official newspaper AL-AHRAM the men were  rounded up "a few days ago" on charges of hampering the  execution of court rulings. He refused to identify the men and  did not specify the charges.    Although the Moslem Brotherhood was banned in 1954, it has  been largely tolerated by the Egyptian government because of its  non- violent stance.    Some of its members have in the past joined the parliament  in  coalition with other parties.    But the government has lost patience with the group after it  took part in rallies last month protesting the death of lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani, who died while in police custody.    Four members were also arrested last month for allegedly  distributing anti-government leaflets. Brotherhood leader Hamid  Abu-al-Nasr was questioned on Sunday on the same charges, after  answering a summons.    Moslem militants have been waging a two-year campaign to  topple the government of President Husni Mubarak in which close  to 400 people have been killed.</p>

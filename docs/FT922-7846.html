			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Wizards no more in a fading docklands Oz - Praise, profit and potholes along the road to Canary Wharf THE MESSAGE 'We built Canary Wharf' was stretched across the ballooning body of a workman basking in the heatwave. The T-shirt had long since ceased to fit and the words were fading yesterday as fast as the Reichmann brothers' vision of a docklands Utopia. The workman was approaching the Canary Wharf pier yesterday morning as the Riverbus discharged about a dozen passengers. Most were tourists. Behind him in the spring sunshine the buildings of Canary Wharf rose majestically like the beaming city of Oz, shorn of its yellow brick road. The City was just a traffic jam away. Mr Allan Paull, a retired professor from Toronto was visiting the centre with friends while on holiday in London. 'This place is a big talking point in Canada. I really can't see it fail but I wouldn't say that about the Reichmanns.' While the Reichmanns may be facing a financial showdown, the people they have installed at Canary Wharf seem surprisingly upbeat about its future. The greatest sadness among the office workers and the shopowners yesterday was that they might lose O&amp;Y as their landlords. Mr Peter Wagg, who runs the newsagent in the small shopping mall at Cabot Place, said: 'Yesterday we had 3,146 customers and that's a lot of income. When I came in October I was expecting to have to subsidise the business for two years. Instead I had to subsidise it two weeks.' Like all the shops at Canary Wharf, his rent is based upon a percentage of turnover. 'I'm now paying more per square foot than I would be in Oxford Street but I'm quite happy to do so on the level of business I'm getting.' Whether O&amp;Y survives or not, he said, he was planning a second unit in the development. His greatest fear is whether the quality of service would be maintained if the running of Canary Wharf were taken out of O&amp;Y's hands. He said: 'I don't understand why this place has received such a bad press. It seems to be a British trait that anyone who gets to the top, whether a pop star, sports star, or O&amp;Y, we have to knock them down.' Mr Stephen Yeates, the owner of the Lady Gwynfred, a Thames Barge converted into a floating restaurant moored in the Wharf, said: 'You only have to look at Tobacco Dock and the mistakes they made with shops which were available on every high street, to realise that O&amp;Y has got it right here. They have gone for quality. The infrastructure has been planned and is on its way. The debatable question is whether it should have been installed beforehand.' The only place where the transport links have been completed is in the models of the development displayed in O&amp;Y's marketing suite on the 30th floor of the tower. The private view is not for everyone. Not even the viewing platform of Europe's second tallest building is open to the public. With the press of a button, a pulse of light brings to life the unfinished Limehouse link road and the proposed extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line. A mile away where the Isle of Dogs meets the river, Mr Ted Adams a former chairman of the Association of Island Communities, looked ruefully across the water. 'The infrastructure is coming far too late. It should have been installed now and should have been given more thought.' His arm followed the flow of the river. 'Look at this,' he said. It goes right into the heart of London. It's maintenance-free and it's swept by God twice a day. This river should be part of a proper integrated transport system.' Mr Adams was one of the East End residents who raised barricades on the Isle of Dogs in 1970. 'We declared UDI. We'd had enough,' he said. 'There is a feeling here that to some extent the War never ended. After the bombs had fallen we had the slum clearance and the re-building then the reclamation of the docks. They have been building and knocking down buildings for 50 years. When is it going to come to an end?' Mr Adams recalled the plaque that remembers Sir Christopher Wren, the architect in St Paul's Cathedral, his finest creation. It says: 'Si monument requiris, circumspice - If you are seeking a monument look around you.' He said: 'They would never leave a plaque like that in Canary Wharf. I don't think these buildings were made to last.'</p>

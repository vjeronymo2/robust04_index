			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Alekseyev, corresponding member of </F> the Russian Academy of Sciences and chairman of the Research  Council of the Center for Private Law, conducted by Vitaliy  Yaroshevskiy; at the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial office, date not  given: "The Civil Code Is Superior to All the Napoleonic  Victories"]    [Text]    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Sergey Sergeyevich, the CIS states are  now  looking for optimal ways and means of integration. One of these  means is called the law. What is this: Yet another declaration,  or something real?    [Alekseyev] Our former state adhered to unnatural factors  that united various peoples, nations, and ethnic groups in its  framework. Authoritarian power figured as the main factor for  everyone. It was this that determined political principles not  only of the former imperial state, but of society as well. There  is no such factor today. Therefore, we should not foster  unrealizable hopes associated with the creation of a new Union.  This is already impossible. Nor will the institutions of foreign  administrative power, on which some politicians set their hopes,  "jump into action." Heads of state and members of their  governments assemble, adopt various documents and statements  about integration, but there was none and is none. Although this  does not mean that integration is impossible, or is not  necessary. Consequently there is a need to find a universal and  effective factor of unification that is comprehensible to  everyone. Strictly speaking there is no need to search for it.  This is the law and the creation of a unified rule-of-law space  that does not depend on the whim of leaders or any kind of  official persons whatsoever.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] However, what does law mean? This, after  all, is a very multidimensional concept, which in many ways is  tied to the specific nature of the existence of one or another  state.    [Alekseyev] But I am talking about strictly specific things.  I have in mind a legal principle that ORGANICALLY operates in  practically all states and determines a significant part of  their mutual relations. This is private law. The same that is  based on Roman law and eternal legal values: property law,  freedom of contract. Roman law, which spanned the entire history  of human civilization, has not lost its influence on modern  jurisprudence. But there is a reason for saying that Rome  conquered the world three times. First, with force, then with  religion, finally, with law. It is precisely the postulates  developed by ancient Roman jurists that unite West Europe today.  I am asserting this not without proof, but based on my  experience in work in the court of the European Community in  Luxembourg and contacts with colleagues who are prominent  Western jurists in this work. And all of this because this law  in turn originates from trade and the market economy. This is  also the main path of integration for the CIS countries. At  least, because nothing better has been devised.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Yes, but with all their similarity,  different systems of law operate in the Commonwealth states.    [Alekseyev] I agree. But a working organ already exists that  could resolve the "problem of disjunction." It is not necessary  to reinvent the wheel. There is a center for research on private  law in Russia. Its activity can be applied to the entire  territory of the CIS. The task of the center: To develop a draft  law concerning civil law (and this, really, is private law),  which in its totality would form a certain unified system.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] But, after all, CIS members might not  like  your draft law.    [Alekseyev] Of course. If draft laws of this kind lack  quality. But the center guarantees precisely quality, inasmuch  as they are being prepared and will be prepared by the very  highest class of specialists. Moreover, Nazarbayev has already  expressed his opinion in the sense that Kazakhstan is preparing  its Civil Code with the help of Russian jurists. In addition,  the private law center, even in its strictly Russian role, is  inviting prominent jurists from the former Union republics to  collaborate. We are working with Professor Basin from Almaty,  Professor Krupnyy from Kyrgyzstan, and Ukrainian jurists. Thus,  we are talking about giving the center the status of an  organization within the scope of the entire CIS.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] But what is to be done with the pride of  the leaders of the republics? They will want strictly THEIR OWN  national Civil Codes?    [Alekseyev] They will not be able to oppose absolute  necessity. No matter what they say, market relations inside the  CIS are a reality. They cannot exist outside the law. This means  that they need an adequate juridical rigging, a form, if you  wish. But it has turned out historically that there simply is no  other form, besides the Civil Code, that is built on the  principles of private law. Otherwise all these discussions about  a new economy, a free market economic system, and  entrepreneurship are pointless. As the saying goes, there is no  alternative. In the whole world, civil society (and all CIS  members want this) began with Civil Codes. While already in  exile, Napoleon claimed that the Civil Code of France, which was  established with his direct participation, was superior to all  his 40 victories.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Andrey Krushinskiy comment: "Discovering a </F> `New Continent': Start of Li Peng's Tour of CIS Asian  Countries"]    [Text] Beijing -- "Deepening mutual understanding,  furthering the development of equitable, mutually beneficial  cooperation, and raising relations to a new level" is how the  aims of the trip by PRC State Council Premier Li Peng to four  countries of Central Asia and Mongolia which started 18 April  are described in China.    Kazakhstan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Turkmenistan, and  Uzbekistan constitute for the time being almost an unknown  continent for Chinese politics and economics. And an impressive  "continent," one which combines a large market with very rich  reserves of strategic resources and a quite well developed  industry created during the Soviet years which promises to  become a pretty important "pole" in world politics. Mutual  understanding and cooperation between China and this region are  still only in the formative stage: The exchange of goods is  worth only millions of dollars and does not match up to its true  potential.    By all accounts, economics will be the focus of attention at  the upcoming meetings. Li Peng is accompanied by a large group  of Chinese businessmen. Incidentally, present-day China is  capable of giving these countries almost all they need,  including both consumer goods and the products of heavy machine  building. In other words, much of what those countries now lack  as a consequence of the rupture of the many links that existed  within the USSR.    There is no doubt that the interests of those states'  relations with Russia will be taken into account during the  upcoming talks in the four Central Asian capitals. Li Peng  notably said at a press conference just before his trip began  that his visit "could have only a positive effect" on those  countries' relations with Russia and "could not exert a negative  influence." China, according to him, would like the four  countries of Central Asia also to maintain friendly relations  with Russia." There is no doubting the sincerity of those  words: Calm, stability, and prosperity in the region are really  in the long-term interests of both Russia and China. However,  in an economy (especially a market economy) competition in some  form or another is an inescapable feature. However, I do not  think that the chances enjoyed by the two states in this market  are even. On the one hand, you have Russia, which was until  recently powerful and influential but which is now rent by  internal conflicts and is squandering its resources and  destroying its economy, while, on the other hand, you have a  stable, dynamic, and self-assured China which is rich not just  in terms of export potential but in the practical experience of  "shock-free" economic reform. In the eyes of many Central Asian  politicians China is an attractive partner and patron.    China's growing political and economic influence in Central  Asian countries is bound to work to their benefit and to the  stabilizing of the general situation in the region. It is  important, however, that this should not happen at the expense  of the region's traditional relations with Russia; that,  however, depends not on China but on Russia itself.</p>

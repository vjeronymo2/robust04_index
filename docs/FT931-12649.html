			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: All eyes on complicated reshuffle - Machinations in the Anglo family SO FAR it is unclear why the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa is reshuffling its world-wide assets again. All that is known for certain is that Charter Consolidated, the UK industrial conglomerate, is deep in negotiations to sell most of its 38.4 per cent shareholding in Johnson Matthey, a stake acquired in 1979 during another Anglo assets shuffle. As far as most of the investment community is concerned, both Charter and JM are part of Anglo's extended 'family', a family controlled via a convoluted chain of minority holdings and the careful selection of directors. There is also a widespread belief that Anglo wishes to continue its influence over both JM and its US competitor, Engelhard. The question is how might this be achieved. The complex manoeuvres, outlined below and suggested by some analysts as the answer, says a great deal about the way in which Anglo is perceived to operate. According to the analysts, Charter might start the ball rolling by selling most of its 29.9 per cent Johnson Matthey stake (just under the level which would automatically trigger a bid under UK takeover rules) back to Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, from whence it came 14 years ago. This would cost JCI about Pounds 276m, which would have to be raised outside South Africa because of restrictions on foreign exchange. To raise the necessary cash offshore, JCI might sell its shareholdings in the Anglo 'family' diamond trading companies. The latest balance sheet values these assets at R582m (roughly Pounds 127m). But, even with the diamond market in recession, a good case could be made for their sale at well above book value. The obvious buyer of these shareholdings would be De Beers, which controls 80 per cent of the world's rough (uncut) diamond business. However, De Beers is not exactly flush with cash, because of the state of its market, whereas Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted overseas investment arm of the Anglo clan, has more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 0.6bn) readily available. De Beers could raise some money by selling some Minorco shares back for cancellation. More money might be switched into De Beers if Minorco bought the former's shareholding in Anglo American Corporation of South America. This would be a logical purchase of assets because Minorco is being transformed into an operating company with 'hands on' control of its mining interests. Meanwhile, Charter would use the money from the Johnson Matthey sale, plus its present cash pile, to buy back its own shares from Minorco for cancellation. It would then be entirely divorced from Anglo and its influence. Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnaise Laing, suggests that, if something of this sort happened, Minorco would benefit the most. 'Minorco would sell its holding in Charter at well above net asset value, while it would buy back its own shares at a considerable discount to asset value. It would boost Minorco's assets per share and its earnings per share.' At the same time, 'Charter might think gaining its indepen-dence was worth the price.' After all this, Minorco would still have plenty of cash to act as Anglo's spearhead as the group moves back into the Zambian copper industry, which that country plans to privatise, he suggests. In case anyone needs reminding, it would be inappropriate for Minorco to take the simple route and buy the JM stake itself. Minorco already has a direct shareholding in Engelhard and anti-trust authorities both in the US and the European Community would certainly object to it having such a huge influence over both platinum marketing groups. Also (as the chart shows) Anglo's influence extends to Rustenberg, the world's leading platinum producer. Platinum is widely employed as a catalyst in the oil and chemical industries and its use in catalysts to cut pollution from car exhausts is growing very fast. Mr Rob Weinberg, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, says it is possible that anti-trust pressures have reached the stage where Anglo may have to let either JM or Engelhard move outside the group's influence. Anglo bought its Engelhard shareholding because of friendship between Mr Charlie Engelhard and Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose family company is still reputed to influence any important decision within Anglo. 'If it comes to a choice, I believe Engelhard will re-main with Anglo while there is an Oppenheimer on the Anglo board,' says Mr Weinberg. While it is tempting to believe that a few elegantly-groomed executives at Oppenheimer and Co and Anglo pull the strings which set the potential asset reshuffle in motion, many analysts believe that the impetus came from Mr Jeff Herbert, the former British Leyland executive who was appointed Charter's managing director in 1988. He is known to be uncomfortable about the way Anglo exerts its influence at long range and is not happy that that influence has forced Charter to keep about 40 per cent of its assets in a passive investment (Johnson Matthey). It is also said that he positively dislikes the executives who until recently were managing Minorco. Mr Richard Stuart, analyst with Martin and Co, suggests: 'Herbert is forcing Anglo's and Minorco's hands. He has called their bluff. He has thrown down the gauntlet and said he has a bid that is in the interests of all shareholders and challenged them to say no.' Other observers think it is also relevant that two of Minorco's three managing directors departed this month as part of a radical board shake-up which might have been sparked by a massive row - perhaps about the treatment of the Johnson Matthey stake. There have been previous Anglo 'family' quarrels. When Minorco was given Anglo's approval for a dramatic change in style in 1988, its first move was to bid for Consolidated Gold Fields, perceived in Johannesburg to be another family member. Gold Fields refused to play ball, mounted a spectacular and often vitriolic defence and Minorco not only lost the battle but is still nursing its wounds. Anglo must sincerely be hoping that there will be no repetition of that fiasco caused by the JM share sale. However, it would certainly provide some entertainment in these dull winter days for the rest of us.</p>

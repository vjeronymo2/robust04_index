			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] St. Petersburg Fifth Channel Television  Network in Russian at 1605 GMT on 3 June broadcasts the  "Weekdays" current affairs program, which this week visited a  Russian battalion of peacekeeping forces formed on the basis of  the 129th Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment, and soon to be  deployed in South Ossetia after completing specialist training  near St. Petersburg. The program is 12 minutes long.    Interviewed at the beginning of the feature, Major-General  N.F. Tkachev, commander of the Russian peacekeeping motor rifle  division, comments on the status of his command: "We are an  ordinary Land Forces unit, a motor rifle division, which is  charged with carrying out the duties of a peacekeeping unit, an  essential function that arose when conflicts in our former  republics on the borders of Russia began. We are guided by our  training program for peacekeeping forces subunits, which was  developed by the Land Forces General Staff. Unfortunately, it  has to be said that we still have no legal documentation to  establish the status of our duties. There is an order by the  defense minister which determined additional privileges on the  basis of Russian legislation for those soldiers who carry out  their duties in conflict areas. So far there is no other  document."    On the proportion of soldiers serving by contract in  conflict  areas, Tkachev says: "We have conscripts and we have contract  servicemen. In the battalion that is in Tskhinvali at the  moment there are about 70 contract servicemen. Officers and  warrant officers are practically all on contracts. Other ranks,  conscripts, naturally carry out the same duties as they do.  Today we only send volunteers, be they on contracts or  conscripted, and only after careful training. That is, all  those who are now being sent to the conflict zones have served a  minimum of six months."    A major, identified by caption as "AP Prilepin, regimental  psychologist," explains in an interview that volunteers for  service in conflict areas are carefully screened and selected  for given specialities in particular units, with unsuitable  candidates being rejected. His duties also include  psychological support for soldiers, he says: "The peace-keeping  duties that face us are of a kind that demand the development  and provision of a whole complex of measures, including  essential psychological rehabilitation during and after service  there."    Vox pops with individual soldiers on their fears at being  sent to a conflict area then follow. The soldiers emphasize  that they are volunteers and satisfied at having received  additional training to fulfill their new role, but said they  have little idea of what awaited them in their new posting.    Captain K.P. Samosyuk, company commander, agreed that  training could be improved to take account of local conditions.  "Additions to the training program for peacekeeping forces are  essential. More specialized training should be introduced, and  physical training. Because the soldiers serving here are mostly  conscripted from Leningrad, Arkhangelsk, Vologda Oblast, and so  on, while the peacekeeping mission has to be carried out--our  division is in the Caucasus, in Moldavia [Moldova], mountainous  places. And 18 months ago one battalion was sent to Tajikistan,  another region a long way from our forested boggy part of the  world."

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / The peace prize: Investment in N Ireland could benefit Britain As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, addresses the international investment conference in Northern Ireland next Wednesday, he will almost certainly be aware that Britain could reap considerable dividends from peace in the province. The UK exchequer currently subsidises Northern Ireland to the tune of Pounds 3.5bn annually. This is the net subvention after taxes and other receipts, and excludes the direct costs of the British army presence, which could add a further Pounds 500m to the bill. In total, the province is costing UK taxpayers the equivalent of about 2p on income tax. Government spending per head of Northern Ireland's 1.6m population is about 50 per cent higher than for the UK as a whole. Security does not account for all of this difference. Public spending per head is also higher in industry, agriculture, health and education. Subsidies to these areas, with spending on security deducted, accounts for approximately 20 per cent of the province's gross domestic product of nearly Pounds 12bn. The evidence of such large subsidies is manifest. The modern port at Larne is considered more efficient than Dublin's, and handles much of the Republic's exports. Some of the new housing estates in inner-city areas rate among the best in the UK. The transport system is heavily subsidised, and the capacity of the province's road network far exceeds traffic needs. The province also receives money from the European Union, under the Objective 1 programme, targeted at areas on Europe's fringes with per capita income of less than 75 per cent of the EU average. The province is due to receive Pounds 1bn between 1994 and 1999 from EU structural funds under this programme. Objective 1 finance paid for a recent expansion of Belfast International Airport, which is now handling 2.3m passengers a year on direct flights to 11 destinations. It also funded the installation of electricity on Rathlin Island, the only inhabited island in the province. The moves towards peace are generating further aid commitments. EU leaders are expected to agree new aid to bolster the peace plan at today's Essen summit. These peace grants could total Ecu300m (Pounds 233m) between 1995 and 1999. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, has been a tireless and successful fundraiser for Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in setting up the multinational International Fund for Ireland, which promotes cross-border co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. This fund has drawn contributions from the US as well as the EU, and now stands at Dollars 150m. Sir George Quigley, former permanent secretary at the finance department of the Northern Ireland Office and now chairman of Ulster Bank, defends the level of spending, claiming that in Northern Ireland special factors are at work. 'Given the unique situation here with sectarian divisions, and employment problems it has been necessary to spend money to achieve a degree of stabilisation. It is important to try and mop up unemployment.' In education, for example, extra spending is needed to fund three different kinds of schools: church schools, predominantly Protestant state schools and non-sectarian state schools, he says. He also points out, as do many others, that Northern Ireland has the best A-level results in the UK. Spending on health and hospitals has been necessary not just because of the violence, he says, but also because Belfast and Londonderry have suffered from inner-city deprivation, leading to higher than average levels of ill-health. However, Sir George concedes that Northern Ireland has become a largely public sector economy - described by many commentators as a dependency culture. Forty per cent of those in work are employed by the public sector, double the UK average. In particular, the security industries have been an important provider of jobs, especially for Protestants, with 12,000 full- and part-time members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There are also 6,300 full- and part-time members of the locally recruited Royal Irish Regiment. Jobs in the police mean income and mortgages and money pumped into local economies. And Northern Ireland has the highest level of unemployment in the UK. Its traditional industries such as shipbuilding, engineering and textiles have been in long-term decline, with manufacturing accounting for 18 per cent of employment. The violence created difficulties in attracting outside investment, and inward investment has been drawn only through the liberal use of grants. This year the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland will spend Pounds 148m in attracting new investment, in one of the most expensive job creation schemes in the UK. However, the alternative - unemployment - has also placed a heavy burden on government spending. At 12.7 per cent, the jobless rate in Northern Ireland reflects the higher proportion of women in the labour force than in the rest of the UK. But it has also been exacerbated by the birth rate, which is the highest in western Europe - higher even than the Republic of Ireland. This has generated a constant stream of young entrants to the labour market, even after allowing for emigration. Against this background, Sir George estimates that a lasting peace could mean a loss of 20,000 jobs, which would be a considerable addition to the 100,000 already out of work. Ultimately, peace will mean a reduction of the public sector's role. Of course, the job losses would not happen all at once; the dependency would not end overnight; and Mr Major cannot expect to cut the public bill very quickly. In the longer term, employment is likely to be created in a revived tourism industry and from closer integration with the Republic, but it will not compensate for jobs lost in the public sector unless there is considerable inward investment. Hence next week's conference.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Two Insurance Firms Barred From State: Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie  has ordered two Illinois insurers to stop doing business in California.  Following a financial review, the Department of Insurance alleges that both  companies, Mead Reinsurance and Amalgamated Labor Life, are threatened with  insolvency. Department adjustments to Mead's financial reserves show a negative  policyholder surplus of more than $47 million, with further estimated reserve  shortages from $50 to $100 million. The Department order against Amalgamated  Labor Life follows action by the state of Illinois in May placing the company  under a notice of impairment. A financial review by Illinois regulators reduced  a reported $3 million policyholder surplus to a negative $2 million.  </P></p>

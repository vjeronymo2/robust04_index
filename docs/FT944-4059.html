			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Bosnia clouds EU summit hopes on eastern Europe EU leaders open a two-day summit in Essen, Germany, today to discuss future integration of eastern Europe, an issue clouded by the Bosnian crisis. The summit is also affected by Spanish threats to block the entry of Austria, Sweden and Finland into the Union next year unless Madrid receives, improved fishing rights. These 'hostage-taking' tactics were denounced this week by Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission and possible contender for the presidency of France. With host Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he is expected to be central to the summit. At a meeting of the European socialists in Essen yesterday, Mr Delors said he would try to convince EU leaders to consider new ways to combat unemployment. But the 'intellectual laziness and traditionalist ideas of some' would make it difficult, he said. The focus of the Essen summit is a German paper on the integration of six former communist countries - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - into the European Union. Leaders of the six will tomorrow be offered further modest trade liberalisation, broader political contact, and promised guidelines, next spring, for adapting their economies and legal codes to the single European market. However, the package avoids a commitment to reform the common agricultural policy and regional aid funds, without which the cost of admitting the east Europeans would be prohibitive. 'This is one of the big weaknesses in the document,' said a senior EU official. This reflects intra-EU tensions over the German-led desire to secure stable borders to its east. A Franco-German compromise committing minimum sums of Dollars 6.7bn over the next five years to the east Europeans, and Dollars 3.27bn to North Africa and the Middle East, is likely to be agreed. Despite Chancellor Kohl's consensus-building skills, senior diplomats predict difficult discussions over Bosnia. The UK and France have contributed the bulk of European forces in the UN peace-keeping effort, and are nervous about possible German support for lifting the UN arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslem government. They believe that this would force a humiliating withdrawal of UN troops, fuelling tensions within Nato and with Russia, which has become bolder in its support for the Serbian government headed by President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>

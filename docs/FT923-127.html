			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Management: When the show must go on Destruction of life and property on the scale caused by the IRA bomb blast at the Baltic Exchange in the City of London in April (above), is not, fortunately, an everyday occurrence. Nevertheless, increasing numbers of organisations are engaging in 'business continuity planning' just in case disaster should strike. According to a Gallup survey commissioned by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants and management consultants, 62 per cent of the top 500 UK companies now have an emergency plan, up from 48 per cent a year ago. However, that still leaves a significant proportion of organisations with no contingency plans for staying in business should the worst happen. Moreover, among companies which did have plans, almost half focused exclusively on what would happen in the event of the loss of a computer system. As Coopers &amp; Lybrand points out: 'Any disaster that affects an organisation's main computer systems will, in all likelihood, impact all of the business functions located in the same building.' There is little point organising manual systems to replace computers if staff have no back-up offices to work in or equipment. Only 52 per cent of existing plans make specific provision for handling customer enquiries during a disaster, highlighting 'the extent to which existing plans focus too heavily on systems recovery rather than the needs of the business'. Perhaps most surprisingly, only 2 per cent of companies in the manufacturing sector appear to have any arrangements for alternative manufacturing facilities in the event of a disaster hitting the main plant.</p>

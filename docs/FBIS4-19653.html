			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "High Fidelity Government"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- "There are no legal constraints, no  obligations: The under secretary for the Prime Minister's Office  does not have to be a member of parliament." Yesterday the  constitutionalists consulted by [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi  gave the go-ahead: If he so desires, Gianni Letta can follow him  to the Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's seat]. Such a role seems  ideally suited to Berlusconi's top adviser, the man who  virtually taught him politics and who followed and held meetings  with all national leaders. Berlusconi wants him at all costs:  He trusts Letta, knows his working timetable (every day from  0800 hours until late in the evening, skipping breakfast in  order to make telephone calls) and his total commitment. Letta  will work at the Prime Minister's Office together with spokesman  Antonio Tajani. They will be flanked by two deputy leaders --  the National Alliance's Giuseppe Tatarella and the League's  Roberto Maroni. However, it is not yet clear whether the League  will be satisfied with responsibility for the secret services  and federalism: It is possible that Maroni (like Claudio  Martelli before him) will demand and secure a prominent ministry  for himself.    It will be a three-headed government, a government led by a  businessman who has already revealed his allergy to the slow  pace of bureaucracy. A government whose absolute priority is to  get rid of all previous ministers and to reshuffle hundreds of  bureaucrats and officials, perhaps as many as a thousand.  Assuming it goes ahead, this operation will require a task  force, a front firing line to deal with the many difficulties,  the innumerable traps that exist in the Rome administration.  Forza Italia's leader is pondering all this, very anxious about  having to use so many newcomers. For instance, he wants to give  further thought to his choice of parliamentary group leaders.  Until the government is formed, Cesare Previti will lead the  Senate group, while it has been decided to appoint a temporary  leader to the lower house for a three-month trial period, after  which a final decision will be reached. Two names are being  mentioned -- Vittorio Dotti, the attorney (though he may be  given a government post) and Pietro Di Muccio. The latter has  been a senior Senate official and is well acquainted with  parliamentary rules. Berlusconi's dream is to appoint his two  lawyers to two very prominent posts -- Previti to the Interior  Ministry and Dotti to the Justice Ministry. However, the  National Alliance seems unenthusiastic and has ruled out the  granting of both the Interior and the Justice Ministries to the  same party.    Forza Italia also plans to assign a key role to political  scientist Giuliano Urbani, maybe the Ministry for Relations with  Parliament and Institutional Reforms (merging two portfolios),  though this post could also go to Francesco D'Onofrio (who is  also in the running, albeit unenthusiastically, for one of the  four deputy speakerships of the lower house). But Berlusconi's  secret trump card is the creation of an economic superministry,  by merging the Treasury and Budget Ministries, a position made  to measure for Lamberto Dini, Director General of the Bank of  Italy. Failing any last-minute surprises, the Foreign Ministry  will go to Antonio Martino (Giovanni Spadolini is unlikely to be  brought back). One strange fact emerging from remarks by all  four representatives of the pole for freedom is that there is  one post in the next government that nobody wants -- the Labor  Ministry. To meet the promise to find a million new jobs is  something that frightens even the "newcomers." We shall see who  comes forward.    The former Christian democrats of the CCD [Christian  Democratic Center] have set their sights on two important  ministries: the Defense Ministry for Clemente Mastella, who was  under secretary for four years, and the Ministry of Posts for  Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli. Gianfranco Fini, however, having  secured the deputy premiership for his trusted Tatarella, will  put forward Publio Fiori for the Health Ministry and Domenico  Fisichella for the Education Ministry. The League would like to  appoint Deputy for Brescia Vito Gnutti to the Industry Ministry  and Giancarlo Pagliarini to the Finance Ministry. (The latter  has said: "I will go where I can do a job that I know how to do  -- accounting.") But the Finance Ministry could also be given  to a Pact member such as Giulio Tremonti if negotiations between  the prospective premier and the Popular Party prove successful.  No decision has yet been reached on the Family Ministry; until  yesterday the candidates were Alberto Michelini and Roberto  Formigoni, though it could also go to someone outside parliament  if, as seems likely, the Popular Party defers a decision until  after its congress. Though Vittorio Sgarbi is rumored to have  put himself forward for the Cultural Heritage Ministry, it is  not yet clear what role will be played by Liberals Alfredo  Biondi and Raffaele Costa. Some would like to appoint Costa  deputy lower house speaker, together with the National  Alliance's Adriana Poli Bortone (who is already assured of the  post), while others take it for granted that Biondi will be  appointed chairman of the lower house Foreign Affairs Committee.  The pole has made official its nominations for the two deputy  speakerships of the Senate: the National Alliance's Romano  Misserville and the League's Marcello Staglieno. The lower  house and the Senate will have two deputy speakers chosen by the  opposition, by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the  Popular Party, respectively. All elections in parliament have  been deferred until 21 April, while the race for the committee  begins at 1600 hours today, and of course those excluded from  this first round can still hope for a ministerial post.</p>

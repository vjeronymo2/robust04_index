			<p>BFN     [Text] Labor ministers today decided to pass control of  the Histadrut labor federation to Ramon's list in an orderly and  dignified way. Contacts on this issue will commence on Tuesday  [17 May]. In a meeting of Labor ministers today, Prime Minister  Rabin said the transfer of power must be completed quickly in  order to prevent a feeling of procrastination. Our party  affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that Minister Liba'i  proposed to remove Hayim Haberfeld and Nisim Zvili from the  negotiations team. Minister Qeysar reacted angrily to this  proposal. Minister Ora Namir also said that Haberfeld should  not conduct these negotiations. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer said the  elections proved that the age of ideology is over, and the only  thing which remains now is the media. Foreign Minister Peres  said the elections do not merely constitute a defeat for the  Labor Party, but also signal the end of the Histadrut.</p>

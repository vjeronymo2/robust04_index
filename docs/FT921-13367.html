			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Foreign Affairs: Democracy, not expediency - The reaction to the Algiers coup could affect the west's credibility with developing countries Governments, like individuals, are frequently guilty of inconsistency and double standards in their behaviour and moral attitudes. But today, when the triumph of democracy over communist authoritarianism is being trumpeted almost daily, the discreet official western reaction to recent developments in Algeria is unfortunate. The sigh of relief which went up from Washington and European capitals when, following the resignation of President Chadli Bendjedid, the second round of the Algerian elections was postponed indefinitely, was almost audible. The fact that the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was thus deprived of an almost certain victory, was clearly considered to be of much greater importance than the unconstitutional manner in which the deed was done. To deplore the absence of western condemnation of what was essentially a military coup, does not mean that the fears of seeing an Islamic regime rule a country on the threshold of Europe were unjustified. Judging by some of the statements made by FIS leaders, it was entirely possible that, once in government, the fundamentalists would have dispensed altogether with the democratic system which had allowed them to come to power. That, however, could not be considered a foregone conclusion. Algeria has a strong presidential system, under which the directly elected head of state has considerable leeway to thwart the designs of any government, unless prevented from doing so by illegal means. Infinitely more important as a reason for condemning the Algiers coup is that the outcome of any genuinely democratic election should be accepted, however unpalatable it might appear to those in power or interested third parties. The failure on the part of western governments to take a clear stand on the subject is not only a denial of their own oft-proclaimed principles, but could have unfortunate consequences for the credibility of their policies and relations with developing countries. During the past two or three years, western donors have increasingly linked their aid to political reform, in addition to economic adjustment programmes in the recipient countries. In the past, strategic and ideological factors such as the desire to halt the spread of communist influence in Africa, Asia and the Middle East were the main political considerations in the use of aid. But following the collapse of communism and the break-up of the Soviet Union, the emphasis has switched to the promotion of 'good government', including notably democratic political systems and the respect of human rights. These policies have been set out with commendable clarity by the main donor governments. In a speech in June 1990, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, spelled out his government's policy in the following unambiguous terms: 'Countries which tend towards pluralism, public accountability, respect for the rule of law, human rights, market principles should be encouraged. Governments which persist with repressive policies, corrupt management, wasteful and discredited economic systems should not expect us to support their folly with scarce aid resources which could be better used elsewhere.' French President Francois Mitterrand was equally outspoken when he addressed a summit of francophone African heads of state at about the same time. France would be less generous towards regimes which acted in an authoritarian manner 'without accepting evolution towards democracy'. Similar criteria for aid were laid down by both the US and Germany, while Japan, the world's biggest aid donor, last year expressed its intention to reduce foreign aid to those countries which spent too much on defence. There are obvious economic motives: countries with democratic and free market regimes are generally considered to manage their economies more efficiently than centralised socialist systems, although the transition from command and one-party systems is often long and painful. But this has by no means been the only consideration. The new world order, to the extent that it has been defined at all, assumes that international co-operation will take place between free and open societies. If the (English-speaking) Commonwealth made anything clear at its last heads of government meeting in Harare in October last year, it was this essential principle. Moreover, aid recipients have been left in no doubt that western donors are not just posturing. The linkage of aid to political reform in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe has been mirrored in policies concerning the developing world, sub-Saharan Africa in particular. With some exceptions, the donors have been prepared to 'punish' those that have failed to liberalise their political regimes. The US and the Scandinavian countries led the way in the case of Kenya by adopting a tough position on human rights violations in that country and by making it clear that they would suspend their aid in the absence of progress towards more open and democratic government. The UK, for long a strong supporter of Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi, followed suit somewhat belatedly and, together with other donors, last November suspended all new aid commitments. It had already cut off aid to the Sudan, Somalia and Burma and suspended new aid to Ethiopia and Sri Lanka for similar reasons. The French, too, have modified their traditional policy of providing financial and military aid to their former colonies, regardless of the iniquities perpetrated by their dictatorial regimes. Thus, France, as well as Belgium, suspended their aid to Zaire following persistent human rights abuses and the refusal of President Mobutu Sese Seko to introduce meaningful political reforms. French troops are still sent periodically 'to protect' French nationals during riots in countries such as Gabon and Zaire. But 'Paristroika', as it has been dubbed, has gone as far as depriving even France's closest friend and ally in Africa, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, of French military assistance when his position was threatened by an army mutiny in May 1990. The 'good government' policies adopted by the donor countries since the beginning of 1990 would doubtless have remained a dead letter during the Cold War, when recipients could play off the west against the Soviet Union. But in the new international climate they have proved remarkably effective, in spite of the persistent objections of countries such as India and Malaysia that they are tantamount to an infringement of national sovereignty. Deprived of alternative patrons and faced with the bankruptcy of a communist system which served as the model for many regimes, an increasing number of developing countries have begun to apply the new political and economic norms. The trend has been particularly marked in sub-Saharan Africa. Although many authoritarian regimes remain in place, single-party systems are no longer in favour. Long-standing African democracies such as Botswana, the Gambia, Mauritius and Senegal have been joined by newly independent Namibia, Cape Verde, Benin and Zambia, where the 'father of the nation', Mr Kenneth Kaunda, was voted out of the presidential office he had held since the country's independence. Even Mr arap Moi has finally committed himself to multi-party elections, although no date has been set. The west, which has enthusiastically supported these developments in sub-Saharan Africa, should be equally firm in backing democratic change in North Africa. As in Algeria, there is always a risk that the result of democratic elections will be viewed as undesirable. But if political expediency rather than democratic principle is to become the main criterion for judging such polls, western nations will forfeit the growing support for their 'good government' policies in the developing world.</p>

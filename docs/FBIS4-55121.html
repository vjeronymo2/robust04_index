			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 5--Chairman of the National Radio and  Television Council Ryszard Bender has sent a letter to Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak in which he asked the prime minister if  his criticism of the information policy of the Telewizja Polska  S.A. public television included in his recent address in the  Sejm was of an official nature. Bender, holding a press  conference on Thursday, said that in case of an affirmative  answer the council will react to the complaint.    Council member Marek Siwiec added that the councils failure  to take a stand "on the existing conflict is something like  hiding one's head in the sand."    Ryszard Bender, recently appointed the head of the council  by  President Lech Walesa to replace Marek Markiewicz, took the  advantage to state that he has also received letters in which TV  viewers protested against moving the "Prosto Z Belwederu"  (Directly From the Belvedere) programme, a weekly review of  activities of the Polish president, to late evening hours.    Lech Dymarski, also of the council, said that the council  has  still not adopted a regulation concerning the air time limits  for political parties and union organizations to be granted by  public TV and radio before the June local elections.    The Council, according to Dymarski, is waiting for opinions  of programmatic councils of the Polish Television and the Polish  Radio.</p>

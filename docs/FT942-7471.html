			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney investors set for debt vote Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday called its shareholders to an extra-ordinary general meeting on June 8 to vote on proposals for a FFr13bn (Dollars 2.3bn) emergency financial restructuring. The meeting, which will be held at the EuroDisneyland theme park on the northern outskirts of Paris, will be something of a formality. Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that orchestrated the restructuring, owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney's equity, thereby ensuring that the proposals will be approved. However, the meeting is expected to be stormy, as it offers a rare opportunity for Euro Disney's other investors to air their views. These investors, many of whom have sustained heavy losses on the steep fall in Euro Disney's shares, face dramatic dilution in the value of their holdings because of the FFr6bn rights issue which is a key part of the restructuring.</p>

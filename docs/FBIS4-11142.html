			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F>   [Text] The most probable date for the implementation of the  real is not 1 June. The proposals are now centered on 1 July,  but a lot of people inside and outside the government consider  it possible that the new currency will be put into circulation  on 1 August.    As the government imposed upon itself the regulation that  the  public be informed of the launching of the new currency with 35  days' notice, the first decisive date is 27 April. The  government thus has 10 days to evaluate whether the conditions  exist for putting the real into circulation on 1 June. That is  very little time for resolving the many problems the economic  plan is facing.    There are at least two basic conditions to be met before the  real can be implemented. The first condition is that the  economy should be operating in URV's (real value units). The  second is that inflation in real cruzeiros remain stable, that  is, the same inflation rate should be repeated for a reasonable  period of time, such as, for example, three months.    The first condition is far from being accomplished. The  (energy, fuel, and telephone, etc.) utility rates will not be  converted into URV's until the end of May, according to Finance  Minister Rubens Ricupero.    These utility rates are important factors in the production  costs of any merchandise. It will thus not be possible to  conduct internal economic activity in URV's until after the end  of May, when the utility rate values are known.    Aside from this, industry and commerce do not yet conduct  their business in URV's. Commerce, which paid industries in  installments and collected cash from consumers, obtained  financial profits by putting the money received on the financial  market. This profit will disappear with the URV.    In turn the industries, knowing they would receive their  money in 30 or 60 days, added to their prices the financial cost  of the expected inflation. In sales in URV's this financial  cost will have to be eliminated -- that is, industries should  give discounts.    It is just that commerce wants a discount that is large  enough to compensate for the losses it will suffer with the end  of the market gains. And the industries, of course, want to  give the smallest discount possible. As long as this is not  defined, the economy will not be stabilized.    The other condition for the implementation of the real --  the  stabilization of inflation -- can only be evaluated in June.  During the first month of the URV, that is, in March, inflation  in real cruzeiros varied between 41.9 percent and 45.7 percent.  This means that inflation in URV's was 43.5 percent. It is  possible that this index will be repeated this month, indicating  there is no new inflation.    In May, however, the prices of winter clothes may make the  inflation rate surpass 43.5 percent, and then it will be  necessary to wait for the inflation of June to verify whether  other factors are fueling inflation.    The government is not in a hurry. The rules for issuing the  real are not even defined, according to statements by Central  Bank President Pedro Malan. He denies that the government is  being delayed. "We are not lost," he said, "we are benefiting  from the time the debate is taking."</p>

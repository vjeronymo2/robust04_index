			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Unit trust sales increase sharply: Funds under management at record Pounds 66.1bn THE unit trust industry had its best month for more than two years in January, with net sales of Pounds 505m pushing funds under management to a record of Pounds 66.1bn. The sector is benefiting from the recent highs in the UK stockmarket and from the fall in base rates, which have persuaded savers to consider alternatives to building societies. The effect of the 1987 stock-market crash has now dropped out of the five-year performance statistics which unit trusts are required to show investors. A change in the Personal Equity Plan rules may also be helping. Until the last Budget, investors could put only Pounds 3,000 per year into a unit trust Pep compared with Pounds 6,000 for a general plan. Now the full allowance can be placed in a unit trust Pep and many investors who previously invested in direct equity-based Peps may be switching to unit trust plans. Since Pep sales are normally strongest in February and March, and the most recent base rate cut was too late to affect January's sales, the positive trend for the industry may well continue. The best individual sector for sales was UK smaller companies, which made net gains of Pounds 79m as investors hoped that economic recovery would bring the long-awaited rally in small stocks. Gross sales of unit trusts in January were Pounds 1.114bn compared with just Pounds 555m in their recent nadir of August last year. Repurchases from investors were Pounds 609m, giving the net figure of Pounds 505m. If net investment ran at this rate throughout the year, the industry would nearly match 1987's inflow of Pounds 6.33bn. Net investment for the whole of last year was just Pounds 646m. Further good news for the industry was that the number of unitholder accounts, which had been declining steadily since 1987, rose from 4.35m to 4.39m. The number of trusts also rose to 1,474 compared with 1,137 in 1987. The Securities and Investments Board yesterday issued a consultative paper on unit trust regulations. It was aimed mainly at redrafting the rules on the use of futures and options.</p>

[Sarcevic] Let me first actually say I would not consider  myself a key figure in the deal. I was just one of those that  helped, but the key figures were different. I would say that a  key figure on the Croatian side was Minister Granic, and of  course, President Tudjman. And it was a very crucial role of  Ambassador Redman, and of course, the host State Department and  Secretary Christopher on one side, Premier Silajdzic on the  other side, and also the representatives of the Croatians from  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Zubak and (?Atmatic).    [Snow] And you were doing your bit, ambassador?    [Sarcevic] I was also there, yes, and I was part of the  process, but as I said, I have to clarify that.    [Snow] Now why should it work? Because, I mean, relations on  the ground are still dreadful.    [Sarcevic] Yes, and this is nothing new in these kinds of  cases. It was possible to stop fighting previously in other  parts of the world, so why should we not stop fighting in  Bosnia-Herzegovina among Croats and Muslims? And so, I am  really not pessimistic; I really feel that there is such a  chance and more than a chance. The atmosphere in which we  negotiated was very friendly, was toward a peaceful settlement,  and that made it possible.    [Snow] Well now, do you have an agreed position between you  as to what should happen with the Bosnian Serbs?    [Sarcevic] You already heard the various statements made by  Secretary Christopher and Premier Silajdzic that this agreement  is open also to the Serbs. This agreement is making no actual  changes on the framework of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state. That  means the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina stays as it was, as an  internationally-recognized state, and this agreement of a  federation of Croats and Muslims will mean only that they have  found a way to administer and to manage their living together.    [Snow] But you see, the stumbling block with Lord Owen has  always been the maps and has been what should happen on the  ground. Does this agreement mean that you foresee a situation  which maybe the Serbs would join in a process in which you all  agreed to leave everything as it is for how long?    [Sarcevic] No, we will settle our...[pauses] as I  understand,  the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims from  Bosnia-Herzegovina will actually settle issues among them which  where, until now, crucial for a peaceful settlement and peaceful  living together. So from that point view, I see no problems.    [Snow] That is where it gets so difficult for us to  understand how you can progress from this point?    [Sarcevic] Well, you have to start from somewhere. You know,  it has proved to be very difficult to bring all three parties to  a kind of state of mind where they are accepting the idea that  it is necessary to negotiate a peaceful settlement.    [Snow] Do Lord Owen and the maps come into play again?    [Sarcevic] No, because we will settle the various issues  between Croats and Muslims. Now the question is, what will be  the position of Serbs in regard to territories they occupied or  where they clashed with the Muslim population or the Croatian  population? And this will then be discussed when they come into  play, but they have to be aware that Bosnia-Herzegovina as a  state still exists and that Croats and Muslims will live  together peacefully, and if they want to stop the aggression  that will be something they will have to decide. They will have  to understand the international community is not willing to  accept this kind of behavior any longer.    [Snow] Finally, ambassador, in a word, when do you think you  might see the Serbs at the table?    [Sarcevic] We were not talking about that. This was not the  aim of this negotiation. Our aim was to find a way of settling  various issues among Bosnian Croats and....    [Snow, interrupting] But that is the critical thing, is it  not? Getting them now to respond to what you have done?    [Sarcevic] Yes and no, because this is something we have to  settle among ourselves, and that is what we did. Now, whether  they want to join, whether they want to negotiate a civil kind  of living together, that is something they will have to decide,  and they are invited to do so.    [Snow] Ambassador, thank you very much.</p>

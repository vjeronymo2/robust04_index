The enemy's long-range artillery has not been  quiet today, the 28th day of the aggressor's offensive against  the Bihac region. Artillery and tank attacks on the defense  lines on Hacin Vrh and Vrsak and on Cazin have intensified since  midday. The chetniks also launched fresh attacks on the Grmusa  plateau, where fierce fighting is under way as I am filing this  report.    At the same time artillery attacks on the fringes of Cazin  have been intensified. Several howitzer shells have fallen in  the area of the town while the suburbs on the right bank of the  river Una have been continuously shelled all day. According to  unofficial reports there are several casualties. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, 6 May (AFP)--Outspoken Greek European  Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos condemned Thursday [5 May]  the Maastricht Treaty, which laid the foundations of the  European Union [EU], calling it "intellectually bad" and  "inadequate."    The controversial minister, whose country currently holds  the  EU presidency, made the comments in a speech at the Royal  Institute of International Affairs here.    "Many of the provisions of the Treaty are today outdated,  others are inadequate, while many of the critical present and  future problems have not been taken into account," he said.    The ``unacceptably high level of unemployment threatens to  de-stabilise our society and democratic institutions.... We are  facing one of the biggest economic crises of the last decade.    ``Our inability to anticipate these developments, to study  the new facts and trends of the international economy, leave  their marks on our society and institutions,'' he said,  describing the treaty as ``intellectually bad.''    The Maastricht Treaty, signed in December 1992, provided the  framework for the single European market which came into force  in January 1993, and the European Union in November last year.    In the past Pangalos has caused diplomatic incidents by,  notably, accusing Germany of being like "a giant with bestial  force and a child's brain" over its policy in former Yugoslavia.    Last month Pangalos said his time as European Affairs  minister during Greek EU presidency had been "four months of  nightmare.... There are only two months left, I will get through  it."</p>

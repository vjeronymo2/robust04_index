			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND AT AFI FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's and Sunday's schedule of  the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with  commentary by the film reviewing staff.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> Highly recommended:  </P> <P> "KILLER OF SHEEP"(U.S., 1979; Director: Charles Burnett; AFI Mark Goodson, 2  p.m.). This was the film that revealed Charles Burnett as one of our shy,  stubborn poets, finding beauty and even hope in the rubble of the inner city.  See this, which Burnett shot as well as produced, wrote and directed, for its  remarkable performances, particularly Harry Gale Sanders, for its beauty,  flashes of wit and amazing tensile strength.

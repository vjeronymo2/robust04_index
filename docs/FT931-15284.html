			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Norwegian institution in novel Dollars 100m launch EXPORTFINANS, Norway's export lending institution, has launched a Dollars 100m issue of preferred capital securities, a new commercial paper developed with Goldman Sachs, lead-manager of the issue. Preferred capital securities are designed to allow access to tier one core capital. The issue, launched in the US, boosts Exportfinans' capital adequacy from 38 per cent to 46 per cent. 'For us the challenge was to find a structure acceptable to US authorities which would also qualify as tier one core capital as defined by Norway. It was also important for us to get a dollar element base,' explained Ms Mai-Lill Ibsen, executive vice-president of Exportfinans. Exportfinans is the first Nordic institution to use PCS to access regulatory capital in the international markets. The issue, set to yield 8.70 per cent, closes tomorrow and is co-lead by Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Paine Webber.</p>

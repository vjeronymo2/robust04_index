			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Israelis resist plea for deportees MR AMR MOUSSA, Egyptian foreign minister, yesterday met Israeli leaders in Jerusalem in an attempt to remove the threat to Middle East peace talks posed by Israel's expulsion of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon, but gave little indication of a breakthrough. 'We have discussed ideas and that is all,' he said after meeting Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister. Israel and all the Arab parties to the peace talks want them to resume, but Mr Rabin has so far refused to reverse last month's expulsions which the Palestinians say is a condition for their return to the table. Israel is also concerned to deflect Arab pressure for further UN action to enforce Security Council Resolution 799 calling for the return of the deportees, which has escalated since US-led air strikes resumed on Iraq for its non-compliance with UN resolutions. Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, told the BBC yesterday the exiles' two-year expulsion term could be 'shortened dramatically' if they renounced terrorism. 'We are open to any other suggestions,' he said. But after meeting Mr Moussa, Mr Rabin reiterated his determination to stick to the expulsion decision. The government argued in the Israeli High Court yesterday that reversal of the decision would be 'a mortal blow to the security establishment'.</p>

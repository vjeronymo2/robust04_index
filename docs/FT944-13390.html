			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S African industrials make gains Shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ended mixed with gold shares closing lower as buyers turned their attention to industrials. The industrial index turned around from a weak opening to close 34 points up at 6,572, offsetting a 21 point fall on the gold index to 2.280. The overall index improved 5 to 5,706. Brokers said that buyers returned to industrials on bargain hunting based on the view that the fall in recent days had been overdone. Among golds dealers said prices continued to drift lower as the price of bullion failed to recover above Dollars 390 an ounce. Barlows rose R1 at R32.00 while the petrochemical group, Sasol, finished 65 cents higher at R35.90.</p>

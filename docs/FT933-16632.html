			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Fund managers move to in-house research INSTITUTIONAL fund managers are increasingly bypassing stockbrokers and making direct contact with companies' senior management, according to the Extel Survey of Investment Analysts. More than one-third of the fund managers questioned said they were paying more visits to companies, with most of the trips initiated by themselves rather than the company or the broker. The trend towards more direct contact with companies will add to the competitive pressure on smaller stockbroking houses, already been hit by institutions reducing the number of brokers they use. Mr Geoffrey Osmint, consulting editor of the Extel survey, said fund managers were doing more in-house research on their own ideas, and spending less time talking to brokers. 'It used to be the case that no-one would invest a penny in smaller companies without seeing the colour of the management's eyes.' Increasing numbers of institutions were now applying the same rigour to investing in larger companies. Some of the 122 fund managers who responded had made several hundred company visits. One institution recorded 600 visits. Overall, two-thirds of all company visits were initiated by the managers or the company and not the broker. The fund managers said the quality of research had generally improved. They would prefer to see fewer 'overnight notes' - sometimes produced in haste after a big event. They needed more research on medium and smaller companies and more 'thematic pieces'. Research covering the UK economy was 'least useful'. Last year's enthusiasm for pan-European markets had been replaced by a need for more research on emerging markets. SG Warburg Securities took the title of top stockbroking research company for the third year in a row. James Capel reclaimed the number two slot from NatWest Securities. Credit Lyonnais Laing and Smith New Court were voted as having shown the most improvement in quality.</p>

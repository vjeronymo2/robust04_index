			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEWARDS HANG ON TO LEGS OF PILOT ALMOST SUCKED THROUGH WINDSHIELD  </P> <P> A British Airways captain was sucked partway through a windshield that blew out  at 24,000 feet on Sunday, but other crew members managed to cling to him while  the co-pilot made an emergency landing, the airline said.  </P> <P> The pilot, Tim Lancaster, was hospitalized with serious injuries but was  expected to survive, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police said eight passengers were treated for shock.  </P> <P> "I could see a body hanging out of the window with two men and a woman hanging  on to his legs. They were trying to stop him being sucked out," said passenger  Margaret Simmonds.  </P> <P> The incident occurred as the British-built twin-engine BAC-111, carrying 81  passengers and six crew members, was en route from Birmingham, England, to  Malaga, Spain.  </P> <P> A British Airways spokesman said a steward was in the forward galley when he  heard a loud bang and saw Lancaster being pulled from his cockpit seat.  </P> <P> But he managed to grab the pilot's legs. A second steward rushed to his  assistance "and they held onto him," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The co-pilot turned back and made an emergency landing at Southampton Airport,  70 miles southwest of London.  </P> <P> The airline spokesman did not know what caused the windshield to shatter. The  Civil Aviation Authority was investigating.  </P></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE VIEW from the derivatives market took a turn for the better yesterday as the December contract on the FT-SE Index returned to a premium, but volume remained poor as the markets awaited a lead on UK economic strategy, writes Terry Byland. Confidence was not helped by the progress of the Conservative party conference where government ministers came under pressure. At the day's peak, the December contract turned back from the 2,571 levels regarded as an important testing point, and some disappointment was expressed by futures strategists. However, in late dealings, the December contract tested this significant benchmark level again, indicating possible support at today's opening. December closed at 2,557, a rise of 46 on the previous session and a 9-point premium to its fair value of around 32. Volume was 9,139 contracts. Volume in traded options rose sharply, and the final total of 35,995 contracts compared with only 24,648 on Tuesday. The Euro FT-SE contract recorded 3,993 contracts as traders sought to benefit from trends in European markets. The FT-SE contract traded 16,152, while Barclays topped the stock options list with 5,756 contracts in reaction to downgradings from a French broking house.</p>

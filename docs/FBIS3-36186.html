The President stated this at the  Vnukovo-2 airport before his departure for an official visit to  Georgia. The President admitted that situation in South Ossetia  and Abkhazia "create problems which should be solved on the  step-by-step basis."    Answering the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question on the main  aims of his visit, the President said: "First of all, we are  trying to stop bloodshed in Georgia. Russia cannot wait  indifferently for things to sort themselves out over there."

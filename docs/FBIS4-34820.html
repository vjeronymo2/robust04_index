			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Legislator Maria Eugenia Lima has asserted that  three Ecuadoran Indians were killed in clashes with soldiers who  were enforcing the state of emergency by clearing the country's  highways.    She said that two of the three people were killed when  soldiers evicted a group of Indians from a Catholic church in  Guamote, Chimborazo Province, last night. The Guamote church was  occupied by approximately 100 Indians early this morning. The  Indians have the support of Victor Corral, the bishop of the  diocese.    Luis Macas, the president of the Confederation of Indian  Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, said that the third death  occurred when soldiers forced the Indians to return to their  communities in Tungurahua Province last night. Conaie reported  last week that three other Indians had been killed by  paramilitary personnel who work for land owners in Canar  Province; however, other reports attribute those deaths to  merchants who charged that their stores had been looted by  demonstrators. Conaie also reported the first death of an Indian  in Tungurahua, who was killed by a driver attempting to evade  the barricades. These events took place 18 hours after the state  of emergency was declared. In total, seven people have been  killed.    Meanwhile, the Court of Constitutional Guarantees, TGC,  declared the law unconstitutional and suspended it. TGC  President Carlos Jaramillo said the six tribunal members had  unanimously resolved to suspend the law completely because it  contained flaws of form and substance. The TGC declared the law  unconstitutional and suspended it. Carlos Jaramillo said that he  ordered the resolution to be sent immediately to the Supreme  Court in order for the law to definitely be suspended.    Indians have charged that they have been repressed and  assert  that they will not quit until the law is repealed. Conaie and  Episcopal Conference Indians are trying to start a dialogue to  resolve the crisis started by the agrarian law. Peasant leaders  have confirmed that they will not end the revolt until the law  is repealed.    [Begin unidentified peasant leader recording] We know that  eight comrades received blows and were injured in Chimborazo  Province. We also know that helicopters are bombing Azuay and  Guayas Provinces. Those are actions against our comrades [words  indistinct]. We totally reject the mobilization decree, which  has exacerbated the conflict instead of resolving it. We know  Article No. 79 of the Constitution stipulates that national  mobilization can only be decreed in the event of an  international conflict. [end recording]    The Indians also charged that they have been victims of acts  of aggression by the military and asked that the TGC repeal the  mobilization decree issued by President Duran Ballen.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> COORDINATOR HIRED FOR RECYCLING PLAN  </P> <P> Although the Moorpark City Council has not approved a curbside recycling  program, the city has hired a coordinator to begin setting up the program,  officials said.  </P> <P> Carolyn Greene, a former consultant to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy  and to the city of Beverly Hills, was hired earlier this month to begin putting  together a recycling plan, said Susan Cauldwell, assistant to the city manager.  </P> <P> Greene, 44, was selected from 100 applicants and will be paid $33,648 a year,  Cauldwell said.  </P> <P> Cauldwell said although the City Council has not approved a curbside recycling  program, the city needed to hire Greene to set up a trash reduction plan. State  law requires all cities to devise a plan by the end of the year to reduce the  flow of trash into landfills by 25% within the next five years and by 50%  before the end of the decade.  </P> <P> The council is expected to approve a recycling program within the next few  weeks.  </P> <P> Several other Ventura County cities, including Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks,  Fillmore and Ventura, have curbside programs in place.

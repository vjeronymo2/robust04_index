			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 20 Apr (MENA) -- Informed Palestinian sources  have stated that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has entrusted Fatah  Central Committee member Sakhr Habash, alias Abu-Nizar, to  prepare a list of names of the Palestinian fighters who will  enter Gaza and Jericho as a police force as well as a list of  the names of the civilians who will enter the area in the early  stages as a prelude to an agreement with the Israeli Government  over these personnel. These sources said that a committee  chaired by Abu-Nizar has been formed and comprises eight  members, including Fatah Central Committee member 'Abbas Zaki  and Fatah Revolutionary Council members.    These sources stated that many PLO leaders, cadres, and  members will move to the temporary self-rule area in Gaza and  Jericho in the next stage. They noted that this issue was  recently discussed at a Fatah Central Committee meeting and that  it was decided that the families of Palestinian fighters and  civilians would enter Gaza and Jericho.    The sources said that 'Arafat notified the Palestinian  leadership that the national authority would establish schools,  hospitals, and other vital utilities in the Jericho area because  it is sparsely populated and lacks such services. This is a  sign that there is an intention to let the families of most  Palestinian fighters who will work in the police force enter  Jericho.</p>

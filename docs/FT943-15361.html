			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / The Long View: Some bitter home truths An engine of the British economy has lost power. The housing market, which gave such a spectacular push to the economic boom of the late 1980s, has failed to gather momentum during the past year's economic recovery. The Nationwide and Halifax building societies, which publish the two leading house price indices, are at odds over whether house prices rose or fell slightly in June, but they are united in calculating that the rise over the past 12 months has been only 1 per cent. Forecasts are being trimmed. Halifax has cut its 5 per cent estimate of 1994 house price inflation to 2 or 3 per cent and John Wriglesworth, of the City investment bank UBS, has halved his 7 per cent forecast. My own cautiously-wide forecast of 0 to 5 per cent, which I made here in October, is still on track but I am surprised at the weakness of prices in the past few months. Opinions in the London area have been influenced by the mini-boom which has been proceeding in some areas in reflection of soaring incomes in the City. Up-market property in the more desirable areas of London and the south-east has been shifting quite fast, and at rising prices. But, plainly, that is not true of the country as a whole. Generally, personal incomes have been far from buoyant and the tax increases effective in April have, obviously, made people more reluctant to take on big new commitments. That was evident, too, in the relative weakness of consumer credit in May. Moreover, mortgage interest rates have gone up sharply since February - at any rate, if you look at the fixed-rate loans which have become popular. Mortgages fixed for five years now cost about 9 rather than 7 per cent (measured by the annual percentage rate); and although variable rate loans are available at about 8 per cent, no less a figure than Bank of England governor Eddie George has given notice that such rates linked to short-term money market rates may go up quite soon. Long-term measures of the fundamental value in housing are now giving reasonably positive messages. The ratio of average price to average income is under 3.5, and close to a 'normal' level. The TSB first-time buyer 'affordability' index is significantly more favourable than it has been since the early 1980s. But the average first-time buyer must take on a 90 per cent mortgage of Pounds 41,000. And a great many home-owners have been through a terrible experience since 1989. A recent survey, financed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found that a third of householders in Luton knew someone whose home had been repossessed. The statistics of housing market agony, such as those of repossessions and negative equity, are moderating but the failure of the forecasts of rising prices to come true will come as a bitter disappointment to those still trapped in over-mortgaged homes. Although negative equity has been declining since its estimated peak of Pounds 12bn in the first quarter of 1993, it was still Pounds 7.6bn at the beginning of this year, according to the Bank of England. Some 70 per cent of that was concentrated in London and the south-east. Mortgage lenders expressed disappointment this week with the Pounds 1.5bn level of net new lending in May, less than in April and little higher than May last year. But outstanding mortgage debt is now Pounds 365bn, about 50 per cent higher than at the peak of the boom in mid-1989. Mortgages account for most of the UK's comparatively high level of personal sector indebtedness (debt is 80 per cent of income, twice as high as in Germany). There is a limit to the burden that ordinary people will take on. They now know that inflation will not bail them out: those who borrowed themselves into a financial trap in 1988 or 1989 are mostly still stuck there. Real interest rates are high, and the tax relief on interest payments is now fairly trivial: the cost to the government of Miras peaked at around Pounds 8bn in 1990-91 and is expected to be down to just Pounds 2.5bn next fiscal year. The exposure to this debt burden is highly skewed: it is borne mostly by young people, especially in the south of the country. Only 50 per cent of northern home-owners have a mortgage, compared with 60 per cent in the south. In the past, southerners have been ready to borrow more - both absolutely and as a proportion of the house price - than their northern counterparts. This was the price of taking part in the booming southern economy; and, anyway, the more you borrowed, the more profit you would make - wouldn't you? Some of the forecasts of house price recovery have been based on the supposition that the southern differentials would be, at least partly, restored. But suppose, instead, that southerners act like cautious northerners in future? Moreover, the Rowntree Foundation report (called The Challenges for Housing Policy) argues convincingly that home ownership has been a disaster for too many young people and families, and that first-time buyers continue to be lured into the market with loan-to-value ratios still as high as at any time since 1982. More housing for rent, and the deferment of house purchase until later in life, as in Germany, might reduce the risks to individuals of future housing market booms and busts. Booms and busts are, of course, what chancellor Kenneth Clarke is aiming to avoid. But the loss of momentum in the housing recovery is one of the early effects of the rise in long-term interest rates, and it poses a threat to the pace of the economic upswing in general. Clarke might also wonder how the Tories will be able to win the next general election without a feel-good contribution from some degree of house price buoyancy within a year or two. One of the more curious statistics in the Rowntree survey is that most homeowners, when questioned in 1993, thought their houses were worth more than in 1989. But buyers, it seems, have a very different view. That is why the price recovery is scarcely happening.</p>

Top priority has rightly been assigned  to the study of living nature and food products, water, and air.  However, in the latter case only the aftereffects of pollution  are being studied and not their causes and sources. Therefore, a  specialized geological-economic study has been undertaken of one  of most active environmental polluters, namely the  electroplating industry. According to data from the Ministry of  Environmental Protection, the annual waste within Ukraine  comprises 550-560 million cubic meters, while the total  accumulated volume is estimated to be 20 billion cubic meters.  The greatest contributor is the mining industry which uses only  12 percent of its output as compared to developed countries  which use two thirds of the output. The electroplating,  chemical, radio technical, and electronic industries have  significantly lower volumes of industrial waste, and therefore  are not always counted in the inventory. However, it is these  very wastes which contain significant concentrations of toxic  and useful metals. It is also important to note that these  industries are located throughout the entire territory of  Ukraine, although the substantive composition of the wastes is  far from being well studied. In one respect this limits the  possibility of practical utilization of individual valuable  components, and in another the lack of special sites for storing  harmful substances results in their being dumped into sewage  systems or landfills which are harmful to agriculture, surface  and subterranean waters. Thus the Ukraine State Committee has  assigned the Ukraine State Committee on Geology and Utilization  of Minerals to carry out the development of land evaluation of  industrial enterprises producing toxic metal wastes;  identification, based on preliminary study of substantive  composition of wastes which contain high concentrations of  valuable components, especially metals; develop a listing of  those enterprises which produce wastes deserving of  laboratory-technical investigation to provide an evaluation of  the possibilities and prospects for extracting valuable metals;  preparation of a list of enterprises whose wastes require  storage at special sites. In the present work the problems,  methods and preliminary results of geological-economic study of  electroplating wastes at the Cherkaskiy and Lvovskiy Oblasts  were examined and the economic aspects of extracting metals were  evaluated. Recommendations are provided for conducting further  research.</p>

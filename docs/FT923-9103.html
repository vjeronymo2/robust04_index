			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / GM sees tough second half GENERAL MOTORS, the US motor group in the throes of a radical restructuring, yesterday reported reduced second-quarter losses but its shares fell as it warned that the second half of the year looked tough. The figures underlined the slow recovery from recession of the US vehicle market and Detroit's concern that trading conditions between now and December could be difficult, given both the fragility of the US market and a slowdown in Europe. Mr Robert Stempel, chairman, said GM's big cost-cutting programme should mean a significant improvement in second-half results over the final six months of 1991. But he added: 'Sustaining the rate of progress we experienced in the first half of this year . . . appears extremely challenging.' GM reported a net loss of Dollars 357m (Pounds 186.9m), or 66 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 784m, or Dollars 1.44 a share, in the same period of last year. Sales and revenues rose from Dollars 31.3bn to Dollars 35.2bn. However, the group earned Dollars 392m, or 31 cents a share, when a previously announced special Dollars 749m restructuring charge, taken by its GM Hughes Electronics subsidiary, was excluded. This move into the black depended heavily on the group's three non-motor businesses. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the group's financial services arm, made Dollars 286.9m, up from Dollars 283.6m; Electronic Data Systems made Dollars 157.1m, up Dollars 17.3m; and GM Hughes made Dollars 164.6m, up Dollars 114.3m, before the restructuring charge. The results were not far from market expectations, but GM shares slipped Dollars 2 to close at Dollars 37 1/8 , amid concern about the second-half outlook. GM's board expressed displeasure with the pace of change under Mr Stempel last April when it staged a coup which reduced his powers and promoted Mr Jack Smith, head of international operations, to president. He was given a mandate to introduce his successful management practices at GM Europe into the loss-making North American vehicle operations. Mr Stempel said North America's figures had been helped in the quarter by a 12 per cent year-to-year increase in factory unit sales and cost controls.</p>

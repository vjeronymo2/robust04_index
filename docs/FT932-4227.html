			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Joe Egg' and 'The Pan Beaters' - London Fringe Theatre If you missed the 1960s, just hang around. You'll soon catch. Flares and long hair are back. Radio 3 has run a series of 10-minute meditations about 1968's iconic songs. And several 1960s plays have been making return appearances: such as Billy Liar at the National this winter, Total Eclipse at Greenwich last month, and now Peter Nichols's A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1967) at the King's Head. The last two (so dissimilar) have both been excellently directed by Lisa Forrell. A Day in the Death is the bitterly funny story of a family triangle. Severely handicapped 10-year-old child; young parents Sheila and Brian. At regular intervals, both parents are doting parents to the 'vegetable' Josephine, keeping up conversation to her, for her, about her, as if she followed their every word. So it is the more appalling when (repeatedly) they focus on themselves, often talking as if she could never understand. Brian - very Billy Liar - keeps switching out of his home life's emotional claustrophobia into black fantasy humour. What makes Nichols's play so striking is its daring and fluent construction  -with characters coming forth to confide in us as if we were neighbours. As Sheila winds up a monologue addressed to the audience, Brian enters and says 'What are you telling them?' - as if she had been sneaking. Clive Owen is a wonderful Brian - ironic, expansive, urgent, sexy, cynical. Though it looks unlikely that Elizabeth Garvie's tight-lipped Sheila has enjoyed many previous lovers (as stated), she has a real talent for nervous tension, both for comic and poignant ends. Katey Crawford Kastin (Josephine), John Warnaby, Gabrielle Cowburn (friends) and Pauline Delany (mother-in-law) keep the level high throughout. Never in a million years could I have imagined that the story of Phaedra and Hippolytus would be told as a will-the-show-go-on musical about a Trinidadian steel band. (Phaedra sins not only by seducing her stepson but, worse, in keeping him from rehearsals.) Never in a million years did I expect to see Phaedra and Hippolytus aboard the Harley Davidson motorbike she has just given him, with him saying (to her as much as the bike) 'I'm going to ride you hard to Hell', while (get this) the pan-beaters of his band play Act IV of Swan Lake. Oh yes. But you know what? The show is a hit. Not, however, a hard-hitting hit. 'Pan', as we initiates have just learnt to call steel band music, is hardly the kind of music to help a tragedy along. Pan is sensuous stuff, buoyant and lotus-eating. (It's the main reason the audience has a good time.) And the story, as told here, is paced like a comedy about illicit love that (cf. Carmen) gets drastically out of hand. Theseus, now a rich businessman, returns to his native Trinidad with his white American wife Phaedra. Neglected by him, she finds his black son Hypolite (sic) an easy lay. The play is not interested in the erotic affliction that makes Phaedra a tragic heroine. Here she is mere interloper. The Pan Beaters, directed by Felix Cross, is about Trinidad and its black menfolk. Theseus has forsaken the culture of his roots for self-advancement, he has lost touch with both Hippolytus and himself, and now he pays the price. As black drama, there is no special power or depth here. But the re-telling of the old story keeps up a certain suspense. And - apart from Joanna McCallum's blousy Phaedra, heaving an American accent like a boulder - its performers are always lively and cute. A Day in the Death of Joe Egg at the King's Head Islington until July 10; The Pan Beaters at the Greenwich Theatre until July 17</p>

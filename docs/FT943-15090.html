			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Santer favourite to head Commission The contest to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission has entered the last lap, with Mr Jacques Santer, the long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg, emerging as a clear favourite. The deal is not yet done; but Mr Santer has gained ground after better-known candidates such as Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain have either been blocked or have withdrawn. 'It is a candidacy of the lowest-common denominator,' said a former senior Belgian minister. This may be too harsh a judgment. Mr Santer is an experienced politician who has served as prime minister since 1985 and finance minister since 1979. He is a free-trader, supports Union enlargement and an advocate of subsidiarity - the doctrine of devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate level in the Union. 'He is not Little League,' says one senior diplomat, 'he is middle-rank.' Yet the prospect of Mr Santer coming to Brussels is viewed with some trepidation at the Commission. Memories of the drift under Mr Gaston Thorn, the Luxembourger who preceded Mr Delors between 1981-85, remain strong. 'Santer would mean a weak Commission,' says a senior Eurocrat. Mr Delors will not comment on potential successors; but he is said to be worried that a malleable president could encourage France, Germany and the UK to 'cut the Commission down to size.' In Brussels yesterday, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the young Luxembourg finance minister, denied that Mr Santer was a candidate. But Mr Juncker, a likely successor to Mr Santer, added that Mr Santer could be the candidate of other EU member states. This was probably a reference to Germany whose position is pivotal. Chancellor Helmut Kohl remains determined to strike a deal before or during a special EU summit in Brussels on Friday, so the Commission President-designate can appear before the newly-elected European Parliament on July 19 in Strasbourg. Failure to break the deadlock would create a crisis with the European Parliament, possibly encouraging MEPs to draft their own candidate. It would reinforce an impression of disarray in the EU, undermining Mr Kohl's image ahead of the October general election. So who is Mr Santer, and why should he be more acceptable to the British than Mr Dehaene, the candidate pushed by Bonn and Paris who stumbled as a result of Mr John Major's veto at the Corfu summit last month. A fellow Christian Democrat portrays the Luxembourger as solid, practical, and sensible - not an idealogue. He also has a tough streak  - resisting German pressure to scrap the Grand Duchy's tax privileges for foreign savers. Yet Mr Santer lacks the flair of a Felipe Gonzalez or the imagination of a Pierre Werner, his fellow Luxembourger who in the 1970s was the father of the project to create a European monetary union. In Mrs Margaret Thatcher's memoirs, which run to 914 pages, Mr Santer merits just one reference - a swipe at the enthusiasm of smaller European countries to sign up unthinkingly to Franco-German plans for economic and political union. She describes the Luxembourger's rhetoric on EMU as 'cloudy' and 'unrealistic' but adds, tellingly: 'We were correct in believing them to be lacking in realism; where we were mistaken was in underestimating the determination of some European politicians to put them into effect.' The search for someone 'reliable' on European integration is the chief calculation in the mind of the French and Germans as they seek agreement on a new candidate. The future Commission president must prepare for the Maastricht review conference in 1996; deal with the consequences of enlargement of the Union to 16 or more members; prepare the ground for EMU; and lay the ground for the next five-year EU budget in 1999. It is a daunting agenda. But member states appear to be leaning in favour of a quieter life after 10 years of Mr Delors. A Mister or Madame X may yet appear; but Mr Santer may just fit the bill.</p>

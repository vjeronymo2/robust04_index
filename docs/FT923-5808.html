			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: VNU sees 5% increase in year-end net profits VNU, the Dutch publisher, said yesterday it expects full 1992 net profit to be some 5 per cent higher than the Fl 117m (Dollars 73.8m) posted in 1991, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. For the first half of the year the group reported net profit ahead by 5.6 per cent to Fl 54.0m from FL 51.1m a year ago. Sales fell to Fl 1.22bn from Fl 1.25bn last time, a decline of slightly more than 2 per cent. The group said that expected the percentage rise in full-year net profit to be of the same order as in the first half. VNU said that first-half profits rose due to lower paper prices and efficiency measures which were starting to bear fruit. Profits were markedly improved at the Dutch and Belgian magazines group, graphics operations and business information services in the US. Higher advertising income at television station RTL4, in which it has a minority stake, also helped earnings. But lower magazine advertisements depressed results in the business press group as well as the newspaper group. In March VNU posted a 20 per cent decline in 1991 net profit to Fl 117m which was in line with its forecasts. The company then blamed the profit fall on a sharp decline in advertising volume in the UK and the Netherlands, which hit its business press sector and its Dutch daily newspaper businesses.</p>

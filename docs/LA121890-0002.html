			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIAN LINKAGE ISSUE  </P> <P> In response to Graham E. Fuller's column "Steal Iraq's Thunder on 'Linkage' "  (Commentary, Dec. 10):  </P> <P> Fuller has an excellent point. This is an opportune time to arrange a peace  treaty in the Middle East.  </P> <P> I agree with his general thinking with additions: Since Jordan has more than  half of its population as Palestinians, another million or more would make  little change there. This would give Israel more assurance of peace, if the  West Bank and Gaza Arabs were accepted in Jordan. I'm sure Israel would help  with the prosperity of Jordan if this could be arranged. This, too, would help  towards a long-lasting peace in the region.  </P> <P> I would like to go one step further: Include Iraq in the Arab/Israel peace  treaty. The more Arab countries that join, the better the treaty. That is after  Iraqis pull back from Kuwait and they are denied any gain in their aggression.  </P> <P> Too, I would suggest the Arab countries that join in a peace treaty agree to  include "democracy" as their future form of government, giving each citizen the  right to vote and have an education. The percentage of illiteracy is too large  in most Arab countries.  </P> <P> I pray that President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker are smart enough  to take advantage of this momentous opportunity.  </P> <P> A.J. WHITE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

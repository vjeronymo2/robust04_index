			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of </F> Cambodia"; dated 11 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] After receiving a statement dated 10 June from His  Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of  Cambodia [KOC], in which His Majesty expressed concern over the  continued destruction and bloodshed in the KOC, the Royal  Government of Cambodia [RGC] would like to issue the following  statement for national and international public opinion:    The RGC voices its support for this statement by His  Majesty.  This is because the continued massacre, sabotage, and  destruction of the national and people's property are the causes  for the losses of property and human lives and a major obstacle  hindering the process for national reconciliation and for the  nation's restoration and reconstruction.    The RGC also wants to recall that it has all along displayed  genuine goodwill in pursuing the policy of peace and national  reconciliation of His Majesty the King, especially his superb  initiatives to bring about an immediate end to the massacre in  Cambodia. The RGC has always expressed its support for all the  superb ideas of His Majesty the King, particularly the king's  proposals and pleas for a complete, immediate, permanent,  irreversible, and unconditional cease-fire throughout the  country.    But unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge obstinately have refused  to abandon their strategy to prolong the war and have continued  to massacre, menace, and destroy the peaceful life of the  Cambodian people.    The Khmer Rouge have resorted to all schemes and means and  raised all sorts of illegitimate and unreasonable proposals and  arguments, which run counter to the wish of the Cambodians and  world community, in an attempt to hinder His Majesty the King's  lofty ideas for peace and national reconciliation and unity,  particularly his proposal made at the roundtable meeting held in  Chhanghsu-on Palace on 27 and 28 May 1994 calling for a  complete, immediate, and irreversible cease-fire on the spot to  be observed everywhere on 15 June, beginning at noon.    Firmly adhering to the spirit of love for peace and national  reconciliation of the RGC and the people throughout the country,  the RGC fervently expresses its desire for the coming roundtable  meeting on 15 June to achieve success in bringing about a clear  specification on the schedule for a complete, immediate,  on-the-spot, and permanent cease-fire.    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 11 June 1994</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEEL  </P> <P> I thought your editorial "Steel's Bad Habits" (Feb. 11) was an interesting  discussion but perhaps a bit oversimplified and a might short of the mark.  </P> <P> It should be noted that the import restrictions you refer to are known as the  Voluntary Restraint Agreements and were negotiated by the executive branch of  our government as a means of combatting unfairly traded imports of steel  products. In short, the dumping of imports that were subsidized by foreign  governments.  </P> <P> During the period of 1982-1984, domestic steel producers, complying with  existing U.S. trade laws, filed a massive number of unfair trade cases against  many importing countries. The Administration, recognizing that the courts would  rule these cases valid, elected to initiate voluntary restraint discussions  with key foreign governments in order to encourage domestic producers to  withdraw their complaints.  </P> <P> Having over 30 years of experience with the steel industry on the West Coast, I  can assure you that the glut of excess worldwide steel capacity and the actions  of foreign governments to subsidize their own industries is, indeed, the very  root of the problem. Realistically, should our domestic steel industry be  expected to suffer injuries inflicted by unfair foreign traders seeking a share  of the U.S. market through the use of predatory practices?  </P> <P> The VRAs are starting to have the effect of leveling the playing field and  should be extended.  </P> <P> W.L.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, today met with leaders and  representatives of political parties and organizations. He  briefed them on the latest developments in the situation on the  national, political, and military fronts. He also briefed them  on the efforts that have been exerted on the foreign level and  the nature of the talks that have been held with Lakhdar  Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general.    The brother president explained that from the outset, our  country stressed its abidance by UN Security Council Resolution  No. 924 and its full readiness to implement it. He added that  our country proposed five cease-fire initiatives to stop Yemeni  bloodshed and to give those who have been misled a chance to  join the ranks of unity and legitimacy.    The brother president said the leaders of rebellion and  secession insisted on (?rejecting) all initiatives because the  UN Security Council resolution did not serve their inhuman and  anti-unity objectives. They continued to violate the cease-fire  and to escalate the military situation in order to prolong the  war and internationalize the Yemeni issue.    The brother president praised the political parties and  organizations for their principled stand on the challenges  facing national unity at this delicate phase in the history of  the homeland. He also praised their commitment to national  issues. He said that the challenges facing the homeland have  proven the credibility of the people's national stands and  cohesion as they confront the enemies of the homeland, unity,  and democracy. He stressed that our country will continue to  adhere to the option of unity and democracy as an irreversible  option to build a modern Yemen based on the principles of  political and party pluralism, economic freedom, the freedom of  expression, respect for human rights, developed local  government, and progress and comprehensive development  throughout Yemen.    The brother president indicated that the next phase requires  cooperation and cohesion among our people to rebuild what the  treasonous, rebellious gang has destroyed in all fields,  starting with supporting the families of the martyrs' and  victims in all governorates.

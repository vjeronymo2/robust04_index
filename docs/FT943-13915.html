			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK offer on airline routes Britain has offered US airlines two new routes across the Atlantic, from Manchester to Los Angeles and from Stansted via New York to Chicago. Transport secretary John MacGregor said the offer was being made to maintain services for travellers and to show Britain's interest in getting a new air services accord with the US. American Airlines withdrew from the Stansted-Chicago route last year and British Airways will suspend its Manchester-Los Angeles service in the autumn. The US broke off negotiations on air routes last December, claiming Britain was not offering US airlines enough slots at Heathrow in return for better US access for British airlines. Under the 1991 accord only American Airlines, United Airlines, British Airways and Virgin can serve Heathrow on the two nations' transatlantic routes.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / People: IT at Revenue The Inland Revenue's huge computer services operation has a new chief. John Yard, 48, takes over as director of the Revenue's Information Technology Office, succeeding Geoff Bush. He will be responsible for all the IT needs of the Inland Revenue, including 2,600 staff, a budget of Pounds 250m a year and the 13 regional computer centres. John Yard is one of the diminishing band of top civil servants who has worked his way up from the bottom of the ladder, having joined the civil service in 1962 as a clerical assistant in the Ministry of Labour. He transferred to the Inland Revenue, becoming a tax inspector in 1971 and working as a district inspector in the west end of London. In 1988, he became deputy director of operations, in charge of developing systems for the Revenue's local office network. For the past nine months he has been running a new change management group planning strategy for the department in the 1990s. Geoff Bush remains with the ITO, concentrating full-time on the Revenue's search for a partner from the private sector to jointly develop IT in the Inland Revenue.</p>

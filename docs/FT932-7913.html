			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Statement soon on tourism chief THE GOVERNMENT is poised to announce a new head of the British Tourist Authority, amid criticism from industry leaders that there was insufficient consultation about suitable candidates and that ministers took too long to make the appointment. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, is believed to have sent the name of the new BTA chairman to Mr John Major, the prime minister, for approval. An announcement is expected today or early next week. The new BTA head will also chair the English Tourist Board. The joint chairmanship is a two-day-a-week post with an annual salary of about Pounds 35,000. Tourist industry executives yesterday criticised the government for not consulting them. BTA board members had not been told yesterday who their new chairman would be. One leading tourist industry figure said: 'I find the whole thing disappointing. You'd think they'd come and talk to us to get a bit of advice on how the industry would feel and whether they've got the right sort of person.' The government has known since last January that Mr William Davis, the previous chairman, would not be continuing when his three-year term finished at the end of March. Since his departure the BTA and ETB have been without permanent heads. The authority has also been without a chief executive since Easter, when Mr Michael Medlicott left to join Delta Air Lines, the US car-rier. The government appointed headhunters Tyzack Accord to find suitable candidates and they submitted a shortlist of three before the end of March. The delay in making a decision has left the tourist industry leaderless in the approach to the summer season. Mr John Lewis, the authority's interim chairman, was considered a possible candidate for the permanent post, but is understood to have withdrawn his name.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- The fourth working  talks between the Chinese mainland Association of Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Taiwan-based Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) opened in Beijing today.    The two sides discussed in detail the draft agreement on  three issues including repatriation of those who have entered  the areas of the other side in violation of relevant regulations.    Sources said that the two sides made progress in their talks  but differences remained.    According to the arrangement of the talks decided upon by  the  two sides yesterday evening, today's morning session covered the  topics "Repatriation of Hijackers Across the Taiwan Straits" and  "Repatriation of Those Who Have Entered the Areas of the Other  Side in Violation of Relevant Regulations."    The afternoon's topic was "The Settlement of Fishing  Disputes  at Sea Across the Straits."    Sun Yafu, deputy secretary-general of ARATS, said that the  common understanding and opinions voiced by the two sides are  serious and responsible.    He said that the fourth talks aimed to finalize the written  form of the agreement as soon as possible.    On repatriation of hijackers across the Taiwan Straits, Sun  said that the issue had been discussed three times. During the  last talks in Taipei, the two sides reached a basic framework  for an agreement.    He said that now the talks were focusing on arrangements  regarding factors that might crop up.    Liu Huiyou, SEF's deputy secretary-general, said that both  sides maintained the original understanding on the issue, that  is, that hijackers should be prosecuted.    Liu also mentioned differences on the issue, such as the  application of the provision about non-repatriation, time limit  for repatriation and other related issues.    Sun Yafu pointed out that the mainland side will not accept  the term that people of their own side shall not be repatriated  as it is the refurbished version of extradition between states.    He said that as a matter of fact, repatriation of criminals  or suspects between the two sides can be conducted according to  the "Jinmen Agreement", which still remains valid.    The two sides also differed on the issue of the settlement  of  fishing disputes, according to Sun.</p>

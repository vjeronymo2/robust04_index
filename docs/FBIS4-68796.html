			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Pankov: "Will Russia Die From Tights </F> and Chewing Gum?"]    [Text] [begin box]  <H5>  These Statements Are Not Zhirinovskiy's... </H5>   To the editors of the newspaper KURANTY    In the issue of your newspaper for 16 December 1993 you  attributed the following statements to me: "We must provoke war  among the tribes," "we should think about colonies," "we must  force our republics to return"--which do not belong to me and  which could be perceived by the readers as propaganda for war  and violence.    [Signed] Chairman of the LDPR faction V.V. Zhirinovskiy    Such was the letter our editors received from V.  Zhirinovskiy. We were forced to publish it since the  correspondent who submitted the article to us did not keep the  dictaphone recording tape. And although he was prepared to  affirm wherever necessary that the LDPR leader did say all these  words, alas, verbal assurances cannot be tacked on.    [Signed] The editorial board. [end box]    ...But these statements do belong to V. Zhirinovskiy.  And he made them not in some back room or in a small group but  at a congress (already the fifth) of his own Liberal Democratic  Party held recently in Moscow (the texts are from a stenographic  report of the congress).    One can understand why V.V.Zh. sent us this letter: The  procuracy had begun to study his statements to see the extent to  which they approached violating one law or another. V.V.Zh.  tries to look angelic: He is concerned about the well-being of  the Russian people and at the same time he does not want to  offend any other people. What kind of provocation of conflicts  and wars is there in that? What kind of violence? What kind of  degradation of other peoples?...  <H5>  Such a Gentle V.V.Zh. </H5>   "Here we are before you, delegates to the Fifth LDPR  Congress. We are not preparing for war. We are not seizing  foreign territories, we are not offending anyone. We are  speaking about our position and relying on constitutional  support from our constituents."    "We are making it a point to express ourselves in gentle  terms so that people will fear us less. We always speak this  gently, but people fear us so much in Russia and abroad that I  do not know which tender and kind words to choose..."  (Applause)    But if such harmless creatures have gathered in the LDPR  under Zhirinovskiy's banners, why is it that many normal,  psychologically balanced people when hearing the gentle  statements of V.V.Zh. feel their skin crawl and have only one  association: Zhirinovskiy means war?    Actually, there could be nothing epochal in the speech of  the  chairman of the LDPR. It was neither an accountability report  nor a report on the current moment. It was really not a report  at all but a "speech," that is, a spontaneous spate of words  typically in the spirit of V.V.Zh. It did not contain even a  hint of a program of actions with the exception of a distant  objective--in the next elections to be president and a  closer-range objective--to establish a personal dictatorship in  the party. And all the rest was words, words, words...    I want to apologize to our readers: I perceived so  ironically  V.V.Zh.'s empty, Khlestakovian promises, his attempts to change  from a toad into a prince--the new savior of the Motherland; I  believed so strongly in the political acuity of the readers, in  their inherent lack of receptivity to any attempts to return to  totalitarianism that I have never once spoken out about the  activity of the LDPR and its creator. Moreover, I have not  considered it especially necessary for any publicists to take up  space on the pages of KURANTY to fill this void. My only excuse  is that many other people made wise by life have ended up in the  same position.    It is quite obvious to me that the phenomenon of V.V.Zh. is  another instance of the phenomenon of Mussolini, Hitler, and  Lenin-Stalin. How did they reach the political heights? With all  the particularities of this ascent, they still have something in  common.    In all of their countries there was a postwar  crisis--economic confusion, loss of confidence in authority,  and, as a result, uncontrollability. And hence--all-encompassing  FEAR.    Further. None of the "ascendants" was in power; moreover  they  were persecuted, they were viewed as ODD BALLS, as completely "a  breed apart," degraded and pushed aside in the same way...  (Remember when V.V.Zh. shouted at a rally: "I am one of you!")  And who does not suffer in a time of universal hard times...    All of them made the sweetest promises of any kind. All of  them were like MESSIAHS. It would all come true, everything  would be all right. If only...we come to power.    And you had better believe it! Rip out the tongues of the  doubters. All of them are sent by the enemy, agents of  imperialism, communism... Only boundless devotion and blind  faith! No, they will not be saved by collective reason but a  leader--a general secretary, Il Duce, der Fuehrer, the  CHAIRMAN....    The scenario is familiar, it has been studied, read and  reread, it is printed in thousands of kilometers of artistic and  documentary film--and on you: The hungry, Russian people have  taken the live bait once again.    It is nauseating to talk about this. But necessary.  <H5>  Whipping Up Fear </H5>   "The country has been suppressed as a state--it has fallen  to  pieces, the economy has been plundered, the national question  has been presented in the most distorted form: When Russians are  protected, that is fascism, but when Russians are murdered or  insulted and degraded--that is democracy. None of the  ideologists of the past could have come up with such a monstrous  lie. (Applause) There have been conflicts among  states and among groups of states, but to cut into the Soviet  Union so successfully, to place the accents so well that we are  in a state of war, but there is no war. We are perishing, the  population is decreasing, we are going hungry, we do not have  enough medicine, there are no places for recreation, science is  not developing, and the population is getting nervous, but there  is no war...    "This is a well-considered large provocation of a worldwide  nature. The Americans are the good guys. They have learned the  mistakes of Bonaparte, the mistakes of Hitler and other  conquerors of the West and the East who came to Russia with a  sword and ultimately died by that sword. It is better to come to  Russia with tights, with chewing gum, with McDonald's, with  pornography, with horror films, and you will be welcomed. They  will be glad to see you. The word 'dollar' will enter the  child's consciousness, and instead of going to school he will be  glad to take a rag and wash other people's cars in order to earn  this green paper...."    "The country is in agony, the regime is perishing, the  regime  will leave the political stage and as it leaves, wounded, it  will take as much as it can with it to the grave..."    "...The country is constantly in a state of covert civil  war,  on the threshold of more possible putsches, coups, and strains  on the scale of the state...."  <H5>  Russians--The Odd Men Out </H5>   "And everything is done very efficiently, it is camouflaged,  covered by pretty-sounding, correct slogans: 'democracy, law,  justice, human rights'--but the result is expressed in that  again the best part of society has been destroyed or cast aside.  They dealt their main blow to the CPSU. This party and some of  its leaders did indeed make enormous mistakes, but the CPSU  during all the 70 years of the existence of that regime  recruited the best of society, and therefore for us, for  Russians, it was important for these best people to continue to  work for the new Russia. But the blow was planned in such a way  as not to give them a chance to work, having developed  anticommunist propaganda, anti-Russian propaganda, because  Russians made up the majority of Russia...."    "On the territory of the Soviet Union states were illegally  created, states which had never before been on the political map  of the world. In not a single historical reference work, in not  a single encyclopedia could you ever find the name of such a  state as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, etc. All this was  territory of the Russian state." (Applause)    While the Lithuanians picked for themselves the year 1938  and  restored the 1938 Constitution, the Georgians liked 1921 and  they chose it as the year that was best for the Georgian state,  and in Central Asia they returned generally to the 14th and 15th  centuries, we too have the right to determine for ourselves the  point to which we will return so that there will be a point of  departure, where the borders of Russia...." But let us recognize  the borders of Russia, say, from the 13th century.  <H5>  I Came To Bring You Happiness </H5>   "...Our Fifth Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia is a congress of winners. We have won not only within the  framework of Russia, we have won on a worldwide scale. Never  before in the history of mankind has there been a political  party that has achieved such phenomenal success, never...."    Dear Vladimir Volfovich, that was enjoyed by Iosif  Vissarionovich--the congress of winners. And the dear Ilich  shouted in his guttural voice: "There is such a party!" You went  too far regarding the victory too: You have not yet won in  Russia (otherwise I would not be writing these lines, if I wrote  them they would not be printed legally). That, excuse me, is  nonsense, since a victory is a minimum of 51 percent in the  State Duma, and you.... Well, you yourself know how many. So you  can fool old auntie Dunya from Shchekov. But a victory on a  worldwide scale.... Even Khlestakov himself would not have  risked saying such a thing, in fear of being ridiculed, if only  by Osip who was strictly a subordinate.    "We wanted these times of trouble to pass as quickly as  possible, these times when our people are dying every day, every  day if they are born they are frequently born sick and deformed.  Millions of women of Russia are suffering to this day, to this  day they are living poorly, they have no husbands, they have no  children, they have no means of existence. Therefore our task is  to save our women, daughters, sisters, our children, to create  more realistic prospects for our grandchildren and not build  castles in the air. We will be able to start to improve life  during the first months after we come to power. During the first  years, and if we had been given the nine years that were in the  hands of other political forces, Russia would be a prosperous  state today." (Applause)    Taught by the bitter historical experience of building the  most just society, I now want to know not the final goal (it is  the same for everyone) but the methods of achieving it. And  V.V.Zh. game me an answer to the unasked question:    "We will put a stop to the genocide against the Russian  people, against Russians and any other nationality, we will stop  the collapse of the economy, we will make the borders peaceful,  just, and legal and eternal."    And it was as though he drove the last nail into the coffin  of the enemies of the Motherland: "Russia's historic mission is  to save human civilization." As a citizen of Russia and a  Russian as well, I am--for it. It is just that this phrase  reminds me of another: "Deutschland Uber Alles!"    And here is another thing our half-Russian-half-lawyer-son  promises us: "We will give you an assignment like children in  school: Ladies and gentlemen, let us divide up the spheres of  influence once and for all." And who will agree to a new  repartition of the world right now? Is this "assignment" not an  appeal for oppression of other peoples, will it not provoke  tension?  <H5>  We Say--Party, We Mean... </H5>   Etc.--according to the well-known classical scenario of  socialist realism. That is the way things went at the LDPR  congress as well.    "I hope that you all understand quite well that the leader  and the party are the same thing... (Applause) But  you must understand that if the leader of the party, like a good  helmsman on a ship, could steer this ship through the  reefs...and we have no rivals near us...in order to keep a  stronger hold on the wheel of this fighting ship farther through  the expanses of ocean until we reach the port of victory with  the word "president" above it, we must make it possible for the  helmsman to hold this wheel more tightly."    "Therefore the party congresses will take place once every  three years and the authority of the chairman of the party will  be raised to the authority of the congress.... This is being  done in order to promptly make a decision which previously,  according to the regulations, could be made only at a party  congress...    "Therefore in the new version of the regulations the party  congress will elect only one elective organ--the chairman of the  party. All the rest of the elective leadership organs and top  leaders will be appointed by the party chairman..."    Where would this lead? Well, let dictatorship be  dictatorship  (or--authority, merits, etc.) but there must also be arguments  for the doubters. They are very simple.    "All this is related to the democracy under which we are  developing--when there is a gangster economy in the country,  when all norms and constitutional rules are being flouted, when  they fire at the parliament from tanks... Under these conditions  of dictatorship, violence, and arbitrariness the LDPR has to  exhibit a dictatorship of the party leader in order to break the  resistance of forces that are hostile to the party...in order to  definitely reach their final goal--to make the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia the ruling party...to form a  one-party government and occupy the highest post of Russia--the  post of head of state."    "Hostile forces"--that is quite Bolshevist, even Stalinist.  And, of course, these forces are: the CIA, British Intelligence,  the Mossad, the Germans, the Japanese--all of them, naturally,  are pitted against "our party" to ruin it, to ruin its leader.  And, of course, nothing will keep them from sending their  agents. They do not name names but they hint at those  "renegades" who recently tried to rebel against the leader who  has overstepped his authority.    "...If we allow them to rise higher in the party hierarchy,  obtain deputy mandates, go to the parliament, then they will  begin to bare their fangs, to show that they are wolves in  sheep's clothing...."    So stop talking nonsense, Ivanushka, sit there and be quiet,  or you will turn into a beast...    And if this is how he talks to his fellow party members,  those who believe as he does, what will he do if he comes to  power along with people who think differently?  <H5>  It Is a Terrible Weapon--Demagogy </H5>   Like almost any other politician, V.V.Zh. resorts to devices  of demagogy or else he simply makes things up. I have already  mentioned his party's "victory" in the elections. But what kind  of victory is it if, according to the complaints of V.V.Zh.  himself, the LDPR is not now in a position to change anything:  He says, give us power.    "We (meaning the LDPR--A.P.) are free because Russia has not  attacked anyone in the 20th century, has not committed  aggression. And if Russian and Soviet troops turned up  somewhere, 90 percent was for real aid. They took preventive  measures to save the civilian population from the threat of  destruction that was hanging over their heads."    And there was no attack on Finland or Poland? And our troops  were protecting "our interests" in the Baltics? And our  "advisers" were not involved in Korea, etc.?    "There is no extremism in our party, no fanaticism. There  has  never been a single drop of blood, a single political action  which would cause uneasiness in our society. The most peaceful  rallies, the most peaceful news conferences, the most peaceful  party congresses. Never once has anything happened."    And to call for redefining our borders, restoring them to  what they were in 1975--is that not extremism? And the threat  against the leaders of Estonia because of their Parteigenosse  [party members]--is that not fanaticism? And the brawl between  the deputy and the correspondent--is that "nothing" too? And the  withdrawal of a whole group of deputies who were members of the  LDPR from the faction, at which he himself even hinted at the  congress?...    Like those who voted for V.V.Zh. and his party, I can admit  that I am prepared to agree with certain of his statements. Yes,  the "party program" is based on the backwardness of society.  Yes, the present government itself could be sent into  retirement. ("And the longer this inept government remains in  power, the more votes our party will receive in all subsequent  elections.") But even with these points of contact I would never  vote for V.V.Zh. and the LDPR. Since it is quite obvious to me  (and this can be seen from V.V.Zh.'s speech at the congress)  that the party's goal is to seize power, and not in defense of  the interests of the people.    And regardless of how mixed the "people" may be, they have  one common desire--to pass through the mine field of reform  without shock waves. The heirs of the totalitarian Fuehrers will  not give us this guarantee. On the contrary. The danger from  them is much more real than the one from imported tights and  chewing gum...</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Investors could be spoiled for choice - Richard Gourlay looks at the spate of impending stock exchange flotations INVESTORS LOOKING for some excitement will be spoiled for choice from the raft of new companies about to be floated on the stock exchange. Those with memories that stretch back to the pre-big bang spate of flotations may remember that they frequently either went spectacularly well or were comprehensive flops. This time around, the flotations are likely to be different. In the first place, the size is generally significantly larger than those in the mid 1980s. Many of them, like GPA, Wellcome and 3i are long established companies rather than new entities that have grown rapidly and are coming to market with relatively little following. In short, the markets and the companies are likely to be better understood and pricing should be more competitive - that is to say, there will be less opportunity for huge premiums after flotation. In that sense, analysts say, many of the flotations will resemble recent privatisations where the companies generally operated in known markets with known managements. From the companies' point of view, many will be floating to reduce management buy-out gearing and to allow managements to emerge from under the shadow of personal guarantees secured on their houses to an altogether rosier world. But for others there is a very 1990s motivation. As the economy moves into recovery, they are being forced to finance their growth from internal resources as the big banks' are far less willing to lend. There is no central register of flotations so the chart belowmay not be comprehensive.</p>

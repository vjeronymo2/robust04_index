			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Bumpy road likely for Swiss investors - A market that is far from boring It is getting more difficult to accuse the Swiss of being dull. The tense proxy battle last month between the board of Union Bank of Switzerland and BK Vision, its largest shareholder, attracted wide attention and whetted investors' appetites for further displays of shareholder aggression against complacent boards. Analysts are also scratching their heads over the extraordinary strength of the Swiss franc. Its big rises this year against the dollar and leading European currencies have done a lot of damage to earnings statements of Swiss multinationals. But that means there could be some hefty positive effects on next year's earnings if exchange rates return to more moderate levels. Add to that the uncertainty over the impact of the introduction at the beginning of the year of value added tax, both on inflation and on corporate margins, and you have lots of food for both bulls and bears. This year, the bears have clearly been in control. The all share Swiss Performance Index is off 9 per cent on the year and 15.7 per cent down from its end January peak. The blue chip SMI index has done even worse, plunging 19.3 per cent since the peak, reflecting a widespread downgrading of the Swiss market as a whole in most international portfolios. It finished up 1.5 at 2577.5. After three years of sparkling rises, this setback was hardly a surprise, although few expected it to be so brutal. The rise of the Swiss franc and the drastic slump in earnings from the big three universal banks counted for a lot in the deterioration of sentiment. For the moment, the view is that the Swiss market is not going to be an outperformer in the next few months. 'We think that valuations are still quite high,' says Mr Bernhard Tschanz, head of Credit Suisse investment research in Zurich. 'Our market recovered very early in the cycle, long before the economy started to improve, and most of the earnings are in the prices.' Mr Tschanz sees the SMI up 10 per cent in a year's time to around 1,880. Mr Martin Newson, of Goldman Sachs International in London, says the Swiss market could put on between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in the next year, 'assuming that other European markets are also rising'. And on that basis, he is maintaining a slight underweighting for Swiss stocks. Mr Frederick Hasslauer, of Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich, also wonders if the Swiss market will suffer from the fresh focus cast on its political isolation by recent decisions in Sweden and Finland to join the European Union. Mr Simon Marshall-Lockyer, of Kleinwort, Benson, is more optimistic, putting the case for a strong rebound in earnings next year thanks to a significant weakening of the Swiss franc. Mr Marshall-Lockyer says the Swiss current account surplus could tumble to SFr12bn this year from last year's record SFr27bn, and fall substantially again next year, taking considerable pressure off the currency. He sees Swiss interest rates staying flat in contrast to rises in the US and the UK. 'I think this is likely to result in an upgrading of earnings,' he says, and points in particular to multinational industrials, such as power engineers ABB Asea Brown Boveri, aluminium, packaging and chemicals group Alusuisse-Lonza, and the cement giant Holderbank, as promising shares. Holderbank has attracted a wide following in recent weeks on the strength of higher earnings and the announcement this week of a less onerous fine from the European Commission than expected for restricting competition. The Holderbank bearers at SFr1,045 on Thursday were 12.5 per cent higher than they were at the beginning of the year, and Mr Hasslauer sees further potential as a result of strong earnings growth next year, thanks partly to the weakening Swiss franc. Other analysts share enthusiasm for cyclical stocks for investors willing to take a longer view. 'We think this will be a very long cycle, carrying on until 1997, and underlying inflation will be low,' says Mr Tschanz. The fallout from the battle over the future governance of the UBS is still difficult to assess. The lingering effective 12 per cent premium on the UBS registered shares appears to reflect a suspicion that some compensation for the loss of their extra voting power may still be won, perhaps in return for a withdrawal by BK Vision of its legal appeal of the bank's now approved plan to convert the registered into bearer shares. UBS insists that it cannot legally offer any compensation. On fundamental grounds, there is no enthusiasm for any of the banks' shares, in spite of their steep falls this year. The SPI banking sub-index is off 24.3 per cent since the January peak. 'Yes, the stocks are down, but so are the earnings,' says Mr Newson. On one point there is unanimity - that in the wake of the UBS battle, most Swiss companies will feel increasing pressure to provide higher returns to shareholders. 'In such an environment, big companies will sell parts of their businesses to focus on their core businesses and increase return on equity,' Mr Tschanz says.</p>

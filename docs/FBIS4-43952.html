			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today  in Corfu--where he is staying in light of the EU summit--that  the Greek Government is dealing calmly with statements by  Turkish officials who are cultivating a climate of artificial  tension; our Government wants to cool it off. Athens' message  to Ankara is clear: There can be no form of bilateral dialogue  as long as Turkey continues to make provocations in the Aegean.  In any case, no possible dialogue can be held on the so-called  overall Greek-Turkish relations, because Athens firmly believes  that the only difference is on the limits of the continental  shelf and referring it to the European Court in The Hague. The  spokesman said: Everything else involves unilateral Turkish  pursuits, violations of Greek national airspace and the Athens  FIR [Flight Information Region], or violations of international  law. If there are issues needing discussion outside this  framework, they are welcome.    The spokesman confirmed that the Greek ambassador in Ankara  recently lodged demarches with the Turkish Government because of  violations by Turkish aircraft in the Aegean. He said: There is  no Muslim minority issue. Greece fully respects the Lausanne  Treaty. Venizelos noted that mutual respect for this treaty  could be the only issue of discussion.    New Democracy Vice President Ioannis Varvitsiotis asked  Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou to raise the issue of Turkish  provocations at the EU summit. Varvitsiotis said: Greece's  borders are also European borders. Papandreou must not let this  opportunity go to waste. He must finally realize that he must  forestall events, not follow them. The issue of Greek-Turkish  relations cannot tolerate any additional wrong moves. He  stressed that lately, Turkish provocations have peaked  dangerously with the tolerance of the Greek Government, which is  taking the path of guilty silence. The violations of Greek  national airspace exceed those of the past. Greek reaction  against the armed Turkish fighter planes is leniently subdued,  if not nonexistent. Varvitsiotis concluded: Turkish Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller recently confirmed in the most provocative  manner the Balkan countries' fears that the mission of the  Turkish troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina is to support the Muslims.  This fact is really explosive for the Balkans.</p>

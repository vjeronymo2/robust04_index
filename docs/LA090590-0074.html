			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> ART SHOW RIBBONS GIVE PATIENTS A BOOST  </P> <P> The ribbons have been awarded and now the fun begins, said Jack Cheney, the art  therapist at Camarillo State Hospital.  </P> <P> For the past week, patients at Camarillo have been stopping in Cheney's little  studio tucked in a corner of the hospital to pick up their works of art, a  small cash prize and ribbons from the Ventura County Fair.  </P> <P> According to Cheney, nearly 140 paintings, sketchings and pastels created by  mentally ill and developmentally disabled patients at the hospital received  awards.  </P> <P> About 240 works were entered in the annual competition. Forty-one received blue  ribbons.  </P> <P> He said he encourages patients to enter their works in the fair because the  recognition gives them a boost.  </P> <P> "It's a real good showcase for their art," he said.

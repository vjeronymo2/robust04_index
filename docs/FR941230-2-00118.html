			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Develop and Conduct a National Safe Boating Campaign <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Coast Guard seeks grantee to develop and conduct 1997 year-round National Safe Boating Campaign that targets boater market segments and issue-specific recreational boating safety topics. This year-round campaign must support the organizational objectives of the Recreational Boating Safety program, as well as the nationwide grassroots activity of the many volunteer groups who coordinate local media events, education programs and public awareness activities. Deliverable will include, but is not limited to: situation analysis, evaluation processes, measures of effectiveness, marketing strategy, and distribution plan. All print, audio and video material will be designed to emphasize multiple year-round boating safety and accident prevention messages. Highlights of the Calendar year 1996 national campaign, will be special select materials and activities to support National Safe Boating Week and the Summer Olympic games. A specific portion of allocated grant funds will support a National Boating Accident Reporting Awareness component designed to reach all boaters with a message on the importance of reporting all boating accidents. Efforts will be coordinated with other national transportation safety activities, in particular those which focus on operating under the influence of alcohol or drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Recreational Boater Survey <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Coast Guard seeks grantee to conduct initial states of a comprehensive National Boater Survey to determine boat occupant exposure hours and profile typical boater outings. Grantee will define required exposure data elements; determine existence, collection methods and status of data elements; identify missing data, and produce a data collection plan for needed data. The grantee will also recommend a plan of action in proceeding with the next stage of the survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Electronic Information Transfer Technology Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Coast Guard seeks grantee to assess and integrate previous and ongoing efforts with recently developed technologies to allow receipt of information from our customers and to provide information to them via electronic mediums. Goal is to allow states, other Federal agencies and the public to access and interact with a relational database management system and to provide a standard format for converting current print literature into an electronic media format. Technology should allow the public to down load complete forms, publications, and manuals from an electronic bulletin board. Electronic information transfer and interaction will also permit transmission of data, correspondence, reports, and standardized forms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Boating Risk Analysis Model <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The grantee will develop an appropriate computer based analytical model that can be used to analyze and manipulate boating accident data using accepted statistical methods to detect relationships between variables and important changes or trends in accident data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Boat Accident Investigation Training and Field Manual <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Coast Guard seeks grantee to develop instructional materials and to conduct ten, forty hour, nationwide training courses for boat accident investigators.

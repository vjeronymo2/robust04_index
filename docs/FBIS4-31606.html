			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["D. K."-initialed report: "Karadzic: We Do Not Wish </F> Anyone To Be Our Hostage"]    [Text] Banja Luka 9 June -- In light of the statement by  [FRY President] Zoran Lilic that the citizens of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia cannot be the hostages of the political  leaders from the republic of Srpska, the republic of Serbian  Krajina, or the FRY, Radovan Karadzic in a statement for JAVNOST  emphasized:    "We do not believe that President Lilic referred to us when  he spoke about sabotage of the negotiations. As regards  Yugoslavia distancing itself from this problem, we have always  favored something of the kind. We do not wish anyone to be our  hostage, however, we will, by the same token, not accept the  fate of Mica Ljubibratic, the leader of the Herzegovina  uprising, or the outcome of the Berlin Congress."    "Therefore, we do not accept any custody over us. We have  created our own state and our aim is to unite with Serbia into  one state. If this is not possible, then with Yugoslavia as a  federation, and if even this is not possible, then we will  remain an independent state until the unification with our  mother country is facilitated for us."</p>

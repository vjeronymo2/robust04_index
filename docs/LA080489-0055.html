			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Legislation that prohibits ex-felons from owning or possessing all firearms,  including rifles and shotguns, has been signed by Gov. George Deukmejian. The  measure by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) conforms state  law to federal law, which prohibits people convicted of a felony from owning or  possessing a firearm. California law had barred ex-felons from having  concealable weapons -- handguns -- but did not outlaw rifles and shotguns.  "It's been a criminally absurd exclusion for years, and it's costing us human  lives," Speier said. The new law makes it a crime that could be charged as a  misdemeanor or felony, depending on the circumstances. Speier's bill was backed  by a number of law enforcement agencies including police departments, sheriff's  departments and district attorneys' offices throughout the state.  </P></p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / BT nears evenings work deal: Engineers set to change shifts Radical new working-time arrangements which will make British Telecommunications engineers available to customers in the evenings, early mornings and Saturdays, are likely to be accepted by union members over the next few weeks. The proposals, which have been negotiated for more than a year, would mean four- or even three-day weeks for engineers who volunteered for the most anti-social weekend shifts. Engineers would continue to work a 37 1/2 -hour week but instead of normal hours being 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, the shift pattern (for which overtime would not be payable) would become 7.30am to 7.30pm Monday to Saturday. Working the new shift times will be voluntary, but both sides seem confident that there will be enough volunteers attracted. An official of the NCU communications union said: 'There are drawbacks with the new system but a lot of people will be thinking about how empty the golf course is on Tuesday compared with Saturday.' The union wants a more unequivocal commitment that the changes will be voluntary and that there will be an across-the-board reduction in hours to 36 a week. However union officials say that BT has moved some distance in negotiations over the new system - called the Customer Service Improvement Programme - and that there is now a much wider range of options for staff. The negotiations, covering 27,000 engineers, are at a sensitive stage and neither BT nor the National Communications Union wants to discuss them in public. BT has, however, agreed to offer an inducement of Pounds 1,000 for those who opt for weekend work and Pounds 400 for those who do early morning or evening shifts. BT had said that those payments are dependent upon endorsement of the package by the NCU executive. It now seems probable that the NCU will not back the deal, which is extremely unpopular with some branches, but neither will it recommend rejecting it. BT is determined to get the deal, which will mean less inconvenience for domestic customers. Competition from Mercury and other telephone companies is becoming more intense and BT may therefore turn a blind eye to the union's non-committal position. The NCU is not recognised by Mercury but a delegation from the union recently presented a formal request for representation. Mercury managers said that the proposal would be put to the board and the union would be informed of the response before the end of June. No response has been made yet. The NCU has agreed to recommend a 2.9 per cent pay offer for its 100,000-plus members in BT. The Union of Communication Workers has also agreed to recommend acceptance of the same offer for its 10,000 members.</p>

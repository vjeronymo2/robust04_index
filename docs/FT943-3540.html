			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Public sector workers face third year of pay squeeze Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is preparing to impose for the third consecutive year a squeeze on the pay of 5m public sector workers. In evidence to be delivered tomorrow to the independent public-sector pay review bodies, the Treasury will insist that there can be no automatic presumption of a pay rise next year for central government and local authority workers. The move implies another freeze in the government's pay bill, with any increases in wages for particular groups of workers dependent on efficiency savings. Mr Clarke will accept that, as this year when most received an additional 2.7 per cent, workers covered by the review bodies will be eligible for modest pay awards when justified by productivity. He will insist that the promise of permanently low inflation means that the annual public-sector pay round can no longer be seen as an automatic entitlement. The pay review bodies, whose recommendations will be published early next year, cover 1.4m nurses, doctors, teachers, members of the armed forces and senior government employees. But the freeze on the pay bill will apply also to the much larger number of workers in central and local government. The expectation in Whitehall is that the 3.5m workers outside the review bodies will face a still tougher squeeze. The Treasury has identified local-authority spending as a particular target for further cuts. Mr Clarke's decision follows a warning to his cabinet colleagues that the windfall savings expected in spending from faster growth and lower inflation must be used to cut the government's borrowing requirement. He is concerned to damp expectations that it will be easy to repeat in the November Budget his success last year in cutting Pounds 10bn from the government's spending targets. Several special factors - including unusually small contributions to the European Union budget and low local-authority borrowing - that helped the Treasury to cut spending this year will be reversed in 1995. Mr Clarke is determined that savings on the government's 'cyclical expenditure' - notably unemployment benefit - is not simply transferred to fund 'structural' spending by Whitehall departments. He has told cabinet colleagues that the overall spending figures set out in his Budget last November represented 'ceilings' rather than targets. The Treasury set a global Whitehall figure of Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and Pounds 272bn for 1996-97, representing increases in real terms of less than 1 per cent each year.

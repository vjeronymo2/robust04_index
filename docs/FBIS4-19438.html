			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Army Captain Danny Van Puyvelde, </F> formerly responsible for the Kigali airport operation, by  correspondent Eddy Allcock, at the Tielen Army barracks, upon  Van Puyvelde's return from Rwanda, "this morning" -- recorded]    [Text] [Allcock] Captain, there are still blue helmets in  Kigali and we know that their evacuation will not be easy. It  has been reported that they can go either by air or by land. Is  it indeed so difficult to withdraw these 450 blue helmets from  there?    [Van Puyvelde] During the few months of the UNAMIR [UN  Missionin Rwanda] operation, much equipment has been amassed in  and around Kigali, and it obviously will be very difficult to  get this equipment out speedily via an airlift to Nairobi or  Belgium. That is why the land route solution is being opted  for. Obviously, this route can only be followed if the  situation is safe.    [Allcock] It is not safe?    [Van Puyvelde] As things stand now, there is a chance that  they will go overland. So, the situation is considered to be  safe.    [Allcock] And all the equipment, or at least as much a  possible, will be recovered.    [Van Puyvelde] Yes, obviously.</p>

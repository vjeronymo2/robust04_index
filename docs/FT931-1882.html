			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Algerians protest at growing terrorism AN ESTIMATED 80,000 Algerians marched through the centre of Algiers yesterday to protest against the growing wave of terrorism sweeping the country. Similar marches were being held nationwide, called by politicians, trade unionists, employers, doctors, women's groups and other associations. 'Neither Tehran nor Khartoum,' shouted the crowd, referring to two capitals which Algerian leaders and the press have often accused over the past year of sheltering and helping radical Islamic groups. The government closed state companies and bussed in thousands of employees to join the Algiers demonstration. But some in the crowd shouted anti-government slogans. The wave of repression and terrorism which followed the cancellation, 14 months ago, of elections that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, has claimed more than 1,000 victims among the security forces and the fundamentalists. The terrorism took a new turn last week when two senior civilians and a surgeon were killed and a fourth just escaped with his life. Until now, radical Moslem groups have not targeted civilians, even those associated with the government. Despite the mounting violence, the High State Council (HCE), Algeria's five man collegiate presidency, has invited political parties to join in a dialogue aimed at finding a common platform for discussions on a new constitution. The two moderate Islamic parties, Hamas and Nahda, and the former single ruling party, the FLN, have indicated their readiness to talk. But the two lay parties, the Front des Forces Socialistes and the Rassemblement pour la Culture et la Democratie have declined.</p>

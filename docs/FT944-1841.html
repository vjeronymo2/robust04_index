			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Motoring: Chancellor should come clean - Stuart Marshall complains that Kenneth Clarke has ignored the evidence on diesel The anti-diesel car lobby still has the ear of Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke. That much is obvious from his latest Budget, which took away the tiny differential in excise duty which, until nearly three weeks ago, had favoured diesel marginally over unleaded petrol. Now, the duty rates are the same. For every litre of unleaded or diesel bought by motorists at an average pump price of 54 pence, 30.44p goes into the chancellor's pot. Britain is Europe's odd man out. Everywhere else, diesel is cheaper than unleaded petrol - sometimes spectacularly so. Why? In his Budget speech, Clarke said a differential between petrol and diesel 'is clearly becoming very difficult to justify in economic, health or in environmental terms'. Clearly to whom? Obviously, to his advisers, who strike me as perverse and contradictory. But not at all clearly to expert opinion in the motor industry - including independent (and thus unbiased) sources like Ricardo Consultants, a British automotive think-tank of world renown. Diesel cars produce much less carbon dioxide than petrol vehicles because they burn less fuel - and not just carbon dioxide. A study Ricardo carried out recently for Mercedes-Benz revealed that a car diesel engine without a catalyser produced fewer air toxics (harmful emissions) than a petrol engine with an elaborate catalyser. Add a simple kind of catalyser - which many diesel cars now have - and the emissions were twice as clean as those from a catalyser-equipped petrol engine. There is a lot more where this came from. Petrol cars with the most elaborate catalysers emit vastly more benzine - a known carcinogen - than a non-catalysed diesel, the fuel of which is almost benzine-free. In urban driving conditions, diesels reduce fuel consumption (to which carbon dioxide emissions are linked directly) by up to 40 per cent. And although research into cleaning the emissions from diesel engines began far later than it did for petrol power plants, much has been achieved and further large gains are in prospect. With diesels, the one fly in the ointment is the emission of particulates - that is, smoke. But petrol cars also can emit up to 0.02gm of particulates a kilometre - 'not much less than can be achieved with advanced prototype diesel engines', says Ricardo. Cheaper fuel, though, is only the icing on the cake for diesels. They use so much less of it that they still make economic sense, especially for high-mileage drivers and those who do a lot of stop-go driving in traffic. My present car, a Citroen Xantia turbo-diesel manual, averages 39.8mpg (7.09 l/100km). A Citroen XM turbo-diesel automatic gave me 34.05mpg (8.29 l/100km), and a Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5 automatic produced 36.14mpg (7.82 l/100km). These are realistic figures over several years' motoring, with plenty of the short trips and cold starts that ruin a petrol car's economy. On motorways, I keep up with the pack. In spite of the government's anti-diesel car stance, their market share has grown steadily and they account for around 22 per cent of all British registrations. I cannot see this changing. The dearer fuel becomes - and we all know that excise duty can only go up - the greater the diesel car's appeal. Pump prices of diesel vary more than those of unleaded. Within 20 miles of my home in Kent, I have seen 7p a litre difference at diesel pumps on the same day. And do not pass a supermarket filling station if your tank is half-empty. They are usually so much cheaper that they can even be worth a detour.</p>

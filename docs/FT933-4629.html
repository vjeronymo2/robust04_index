			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Free market breaks up the family Sir, Lord Lawson is still fighting yesterday's battles against socialism ('A paean of praise to capitalism', September 4/5) and fails to recognise that freedom of the marketplace is acting to undermine the family values he espouses, not support them. The pursuit of self-interest; the increasing economic and social liberation of women and men; the market's need for occupational and geographical mobility and its lack of adequate valuation for a sense of community and permanence all operate to assign a low price and priority on long-term social relationships, ie families. Fewer and fewer people are willing to subordinate their own personal interest to that of their family, as Lord Lawson commends. A dynamic, competitive, atomistic market system causes families to break up. It is happening all around us; hasn't he noticed?

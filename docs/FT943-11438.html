			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / China gives hope of Gatt deal China said yesterday that it expected to begin 'the final stage' of its negotiations to re-join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at the end of next month, when it plans to file improved offers on market access for products and services. Speaking at the end of two days of talks with Gatt members in Geneva, Mr Long Yongtu, Beijing's chief negotiator, said his government was ready to negotiate on the offers in September and would work constructively for an agreement on accession. The sense that the eight-year-old talks with Beijing were approaching a decisive phase was reinforced by the closing statement by Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the Swiss economics ministry official who chaired this week's working party. He said the working party had before it for the first time 'major parameters' which could serve as the basis for negotiating a draft protocol for China's Gatt accession. He hoped to call the next meeting in late September or early October. Mr Girard indicated that prospects at that meeting were likely to depend on progress made in the meantime in bilateral discussions between individual Gatt members and Beijing. However, he emphasised that though some progress had been made towards convergence on the issues raised by China's accession, there were still many points of difference. Though China has previously said it wants to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, due to succeed the Gatt early next year, Mr Long failed to reiterate that ambition in his statements this week. One western diplomat who participated in the meeting suggested China had begun to realise that WTO membership - which would mean subscribing to the provisions of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement - required far more complex negotiations than simply re-joining the Gatt. Though Beijing has said it is ready to accept all the obligations of WTO membership, it presented this week's meeting with a 10-point list of 'non-negotiable' demands. Earlier this month, officials in Beijing accused the US of blocking China's application and threatened to call off the negotiations if Washington does not drop its insistence that it joined as a developed country. Observers are unsure whether China's public posture is part of a deliberate strategy, or whether - as some western diplomats in Beijing believe - it reflects political problems rooted in deep divisions in its bureaucracy. Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice premier in charge of the economy, has emerged as a leading 'Gatt-sceptic' and is said to be insisting that negotiators yield little on China's demand to join as a developing country. His stand may be connected with political manoeuvring in the Chinese leadership. He is under pressure from conservatives unhappy about his liberalising policies, and without his support compromise on sensitive Gatt issues will be difficult. 'The Chinese can't seem to get their act together,' said a western diplomat in Beijing. 'It is going to take very hard negotiations, and they are not used to hard multilateral negotiations.'</p>

He said  that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP) concluded similar deals  "whose sources of financing are unknown." He stressed that the  YSP has closed the airspace in the southern and eastern  governorate to receive arms shipments from Russia and East  European states, which include helicopters and various types of  [military] equipment.    Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih expressed his  confusion  between "external orders" and "internal demands" vis-a-vis the  efforts being exerted to contain the crisis between the  (northern) General People's Congress [GPC], which is led by him  -- and the YSP, whose secretary general is Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, before the problem worsens and turns once again  into an armed confrontation, especially after the failure of the  military committee, which is led by Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah,  deputy chief of staff, to disengage the forces in Abyan  Governorate.    This came in the president's meeting with a number of  dialogue committee members the day before yesterday evening.  The meeting was described by a spokesman for the GPC as "an  effort by the dialogue committee to renew its legitimacy after  the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, in order to  resume its work to implement the document." [passage omitted]    Salih stressed his commitment to implementing the Pledge  Document. He urged the need for the Council of ministers to  convene in Sanaa or to authorize the committee dialogue to  supervise the work of the government and the military committee.    The Yemeni president said at the meeting that Yemen does not  now have military forces -- an indication that it is "easy" to  implement the security part of the Pledge and Accord Document,  thus opening the door to the YSP's return. But some participants  told him that these forces have been moved to the fringe areas  to reinforce deployment on the partition border -- which further  worsens the political crisis, instead of making a move to end it  and eliminate its effects.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> For the final rule, we will recalculate the FY 1995 update factor on the basis of the June 1994 update of HCRIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that the effect of the update on the Federal rate is limited by the requirement of budget neutrality until FY 1996. Thus, although the update factor for inflation is 2.22 percent, the FY 1995 Federal rate is lower than the FY 1994 Federal rate because of the effects of the budget neutrality adjustment. We also note that the FY 1995 budget neutrality target is determined by the estimate of FY 1995 capital costs, not by the 2-year average update factor applied to the FY 1995 Federal rate. We further discuss the basis for the budget neutrality target in section III.A.4 below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Outlier Payment Adjustment Factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 412.312(c) establishes a unified outlier methodology for inpatient operating and inpatient capital-related costs. A single set of thresholds is used to identify outlier cases for both inpatient operating and inpatient capital-related payments. Outlier payments are made only on the portion of the Federal rate that is used to calculate the hospital's inpatient capital-related payments (for example, 40 percent for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995 for hospitals paid under the fully prospective methodology). Section 412.308(c)(2) provides that the standard Federal rate for inpatient capital-related costs be reduced by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments under the Federal rate for outlier cases, determined as a proportion of inpatient capital-related payments under the Federal rate. The outlier thresholds are set so that estimated outlier payments are 5.1 percent of estimated inpatient operating payments. The inpatient capital-related outlier reduction factor is then set according to the estimated inpatient capital-related outlier payments that would be made if all hospitals were paid according to 100 percent of the Federal rate. For purposes of calculating the outlier thresholds and the outlier reduction factor, we model all hospitals as if paid 100 percent of the Federal rate because, as explained above, outlier payments are made only on the portion of the Federal rate that is included in the hospital's inpatient capital-related payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the September 1, 1993 final rule, we estimated that outlier payments for FY 1994 would equal 5.46 percent of inpatient capital-related payments based on the Federal rate. Accordingly, we applied an outlier adjustment factor of 0.9454 to the Federal rate. Based on the thresholds as set forth in section II.A.4.d of the addendum, we estimate that outlier payments will equal 6.28 percent of inpatient capital-related payments based on the Federal rate in FY 1995. We are therefore proposing an outlier adjustment factor of 0.9372 to the Federal rate. When we modeled the combined operating and capital outlier payments, we found that using a common set of thresholds resulted in a higher percentage of outlier payments for capital-related costs than for operating costs. We believe the increase in capital-related outlier payments for FY 1995 results from a combination of the lower proposed capital standard payment amount and the change to a fixed loss threshold for cost outlier payments. As a result, estimated capital outlier payments for FY 1995 represent a higher percentage of total capital standard payments than in FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The outlier reduction factors are not built permanently into the rates; that is, they are not applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. Therefore, the net change in the outlier adjustment to the Federal rate for FY 1995 is .9913 (.9372/.9454). Thus, the proposed outlier adjustment would reduce the FY 1995 Federal rate by 0.87 percent (.9913&hyph;1) compared with the FY 1994 outlier adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

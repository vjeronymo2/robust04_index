It also warned U.S. citizens not to travel in Serbia and  Montenegro, two republics now claiming themselves as the part of  a new Yugoslav Federation.    State Department Spokeswoman Maeve Dwyer said the move was  taken "because of the ongoing conditions in Bosnia and the  potential repercussions for travelers."    The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade has contacted private U.S.  citizens in the country and offered to help if they want to  depart, Dwyer said.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization issued an ultimatum  Thursday that the Bosnian serbs remove their heavy weapons from  around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, within 10 days and all  three sides stop shelling Sarajevo, or risk NATO air strikes.    It was feared that possible NATO air strikes may have  backlashes for foreigners in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

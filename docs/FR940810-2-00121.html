			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. The Application states that making the Fund available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts, and that this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing, which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges. Applicants believe that mixed and shared funding should provide several benefits to variable contractowners. Mixed and shared funding would eliminate a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds. Mixed and shared funding also would provide the Fund with a larger pool of funds, thereby promoting economies of scale and permitting increased safety through greater diversification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicants see no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts historically have been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds which have not been affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account. Applicants do not believe that mixed and shared funding will have any adverse Federal income tax consequences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the requested order is granted, Applicants consent to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the ``Board'') shall consist of persons who are not ``interested persons'' of the Fund, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification, or bona-fide resignation of any director or directors, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a) For a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon Application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Board will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the contractowners of all Separate Accounts investing in the Fund. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable Federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of any series are being managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contractowners and variable life insurance contractowners; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard the voting instructions of contractowners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Participating Insurance Companies and G.R. Phelps will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board. Participating Insurance Companies and G.R. Phelps will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues raised. This includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance Company to inform the Board whenever contractowner voting instructions are disregarded. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts to and to assist the Board will be a contractual obligation of all insurers investing in the Fund under their agreements governing participation in the Fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contractowners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or a majority of the disinterested directors of the Board, that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, then the relevant insurance companies, at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors), shall take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict, up to and including: (a) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Separate Accounts from the Fund or any Portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium, including another Portfolio of the Fund, or submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contractowners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> annuity contractowners or life insurance contractowners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contractowners the option of making such a change; and (b) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard contractowner voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the insurer may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw the insurer's Separate Account's investment in the Fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contractowners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this Condition 4, a majority of the disinterested members of the Board shall determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict, but, in no event, will the Fund or G.R. Phelps be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. No Participating Insurance Company shall be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contractowners materially adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This amendment is prompted by results of a safety review, which revealed that in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser could result in a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective August 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

That action proposed to require tests of the thrust reverser system, and repair, if necessary; installation of a modification that would terminate those tests; and repetitive operational checks of that installation, and repair, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boeing requests that specific references to page numbers and revision dates of the Boeing 757 Airplane Maintenance Manual (AMM) be eliminated from the proposed rule, and that the proposal be amended to include copies of the required test procedures so that reference to the AMM would not be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boeing explains that the AMM's are customized for each operator to reflect all of the equipment in that operator's fleet. Therefore, the number of pages for any given procedure is variable, depending on the number of different equipment configurations documented in an operator's AMM. Boeing also indicates that AMM procedures are revised periodically for non-technical reasons. Boeing adds that changes to the structure of the procedures are necessary to accommodate an upgrade of the publishing system that is currently under way, which, in addition to repagination, will necessitate the issuance of revised AMM pages.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boeing states that the effect of specifying AMM page numbers and revision dates in the AD is that operators may be unable to use the procedure contained in the AMM to perform certain tests required by the AD. Each operator would be required to maintain an obsolete version of the procedure, or to request FAA approval of an alternative method of compliance with the AD that would allow the use of the current version of the AMM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs partially. In light of the information submitted by the commenter, the FAA finds that specific AMM page numbers and dates should not be specified in the final rule. Therefore, such references have been removed from paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the final rule. However, for those paragraphs, the FAA does not agree that copies of the specific procedures should be included in the final rule. Therefore, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the final rule have been revised to cite only the appropriate section and task title specified in the AMM for accomplishment of the tests required by those paragraphs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA's objective in proposing periodic operational checks of the sync-lock device, as specified in paragraph (c) of this AD, is to ensure the integrity of the locking function. However, subsequent to the issuance of the proposal and the receipt of Boeing's comments to the proposal, Boeing has submitted to the FAA separate procedures for accomplishment of the operational check of the sync-lock integrity. These procedures have been defined in paragraph (c) of the final rule; therefore, the AMM references specified in paragraph (c) of the NPRM have been removed from the final rule. Additionally, the procedures for the operational checks are accomplished independently of the other thrust reverser system tests specified in the proposal. Accordingly, the FAA has revised paragraph (c) of the final rule to require periodic accomplishment of operational checks of the sync-lock integrity only, and has removed the requirement for accomplishment of other tests specified in that paragraph of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, states that, while ATA members are not opposed to accomplishing the operational checks specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal as part of their maintenance programs, these members are opposed to accomplishing the checks as part of the requirements of an AD. The commenters believe that the adoption of paragraph (c), as proposed, is equivalent to issuing a Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) item by means of an AD.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA adds that, if the FAA finds sufficient justification to include the requirement for operational checks in the AD, an alternative to accomplishment of the checks should be provided in the final rule. ATA reasons that an alternative is justified because no data exist to show that repetitive checks of a modified thrust reverser cannot be handled adequately through an operator's maintenance program. The suggested alternative follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing the sync-lock installation, revise the FAA- approved maintenance inspection program to include an operational check of the sync-lock. The initial check would be accomplished within 1,000 hours time-in-service after modification. The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that have acceptably revised the maintenance program. Operators choosing this alternative could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 91.417 or 121.380 (14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Retail survey adds to fears of slowdown in recovery MR Kenneth Clarke's Budget dilemma over taxation and the public finances has been heightened by a cautious report on retail trading from the Confederation of British Industry today and a gloomy Gallup survey, pointing to weakening consumer confidence. The two reports, which give new impetus to fears that Britain's recovery may be losing steam on a broad front, come as the chancellor will today face calls from cabinet colleagues to avoid jeopardising economic growth by imposing large tax increases in next month's Budget. But a full-scale cabinet debate of the options for November 30 will also hear a warning from Mr Clarke that the government's borrowing requirement is still on course to reach a record Pounds 50bn this year. In its latest monthly survey of distributive trades, the CBI reports that retail sales rose in the year to September, but the growth was slower than in the preceding three months and disappointed traders' expectations. Gallup said yesterday its latest consumer confidence survey, conducted in the first 12 days of this month on behalf of the European Commission, found 'a severe decline' in the public's assessment of Britain's economic performance and increased pessimism 'on almost every economic indicator'. Together the surveys suggest Britain's recovery could be faltering in the high street as well as in the factories. After last week's figures showing falling manufacturing output and rising inflation during the summer, they cast doubt on the underlying strength of UK consumer demand. Official figures yesterday showed that Mr Clarke's budgetary problems are as intractable as ever: Britain's public sector borrowing requirement increased to Pounds 5.88bn in September from Pounds 4.01bn in September last year. The budget deficit of Pounds 24.2bn in the first six months of the current financial year did little to support the view of some City commentators that the PSBR in 1993-94 would be significantly below the Pounds 50bn forecast by the government in March. However, the recent bad economic news found no echo in UK equity markets where hopes of lower interest rates around the time of the Budget and strong gains in Hong Kong and continental European markets pushed the FT-SE 100 index to an all-time closing high of 3,167.6, up 16.8. Expectations of a Budget-time cut in interest rates also affected sterling. It lost  1/2 pfennig from Friday to close at DM2.4375 in London and dropped nearly 1 1/2 cents to close at Dollars 1.4980. In New York, sterling weakened just over 2 cents against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4867, and finished the day at DM2.4378. The Bank of England's trade weighted sterling index was 79.9 at yesterday's close against 80.3 on Friday. The CBI says last month's slower growth in retail sales was offset by a strong growth in wholesale turnover and growth of sales in line with expectations in the motor trade. The report says all three groups expect further year-on-year growth in sales this month. However, Mr Nigel Whittaker, the chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, notes that retailers' expectations have been over-optimistic in five of the past six months. The survey's findings suggests that 'the upturn in high street demand remains fragile', Mr Whittaker says. Yesterday, one senior minister said unless the economy showed stronger signs of growth additional tax rises of more than Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn would risk a backlash from Conservative MPs.

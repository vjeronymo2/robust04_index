			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Greece begins bugging probe THE Greek parliament began setting up a powerful committee yesterday to investigate charges that leaders of the ruling conservative party illegally bugged their political opponents, Reuter reports from Athens. Party leaders began selecting those who will sit on the 35-member committee to inquire into allegations that the ruling New Democracy party systematically eavesdropped on an array of rivals during a political crisis from 1988 to 1990. They also plan measures to control bugging.</p>

These possible benefits can include changes in racial, ethnic and income-related housing patterns that may have taken place during the testing period, increases in awareness and changes in lending, or sales and rental practices which result in fairer treatment for persons protected by civil rights statutes. Particular emphasis must be placed on measuring and comparing the costs and the benefits of the present system of HUD AFHM Plan processing and the clearinghouse concept being tested under this NOFA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) A description of how the clearinghouse will be of continuing use in dealing with housing discrimination after the completion of the demonstration. In this section, the proposer shall explain how the clearinghouse plans to continue its existence after the expiration of this grant, describing the public and private sources of financing and the services which are both similar to and different from the services to be offered during the period of this grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) HUD Form 2880, Applicant Disclosures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) The applicant must submit a certification and disclosure in accordance with the requirements of section 319 of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act (Pub.

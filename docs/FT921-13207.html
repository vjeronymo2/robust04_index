			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: J&amp;J to fund development of contraceptive vaccine JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals group, said it was seeking to develop a new contraceptive vaccine for women that could last for at least two years. The company has entered a licensing agreement with the University of Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology, which has been working on the vaccine. Johnson &amp; Johnson, already an important manufacturer of birth control pills, will finance the Virginia centre's testing of the vaccine on baboons. It is hoped that human trial will begin within two years. The contraceptive vaccine works by stimulating a woman's immune system, causing it to develop antibodies to a protein molecule found in sperm. The antibodies destroy the sperm's ability to fertilise eggs. The contraceptive, which may be administered by pill or injection, could last for as long as five years, according to the company. The Johnson &amp; Johnson research project is not the first of its kind; contraceptive vaccines are also being developed at universities in New Delhi and British Columbia. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has also patented a vaccine that is being developed. News of the vaccine project did not excite investors on Wall Street, where Johnson &amp; Johnson's share price fell by  7/8 to Dollars 104 1/8 .</p>

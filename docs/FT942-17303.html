			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Indonesian debt warning Indonesia says its rising foreign debt, now Dollars 90bn (Pounds 60bn), requires serious attention because it is nearing the psychological level at which international donor confidence is reduced, Reuter reports from Jakarta. If the debt level went beyond the Dollars 100bn mark, it usually had a psychological impact, Mr Saleh Afiff, economic co-ordinating minister, was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency yesterday. The World Bank, which has praised Indonesia for sound economic management since the late 1960s, heads a consultative group of donors which last year pledged Dollars 5.1bn in fresh development aid. Indonesia said on Monday it would avoid taking any surprise measures, including devaluing the rupiah.</p>

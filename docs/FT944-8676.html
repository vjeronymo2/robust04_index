			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland rises 44% Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers, the publishing and retail group, increased pre-tax profits by 44 per cent from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 5.39m in the 26 weeks to October 1. Turnover grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 60.9m (Pounds 54.9m). While the publishing side rose by just 6 per cent to Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 31.3m) retailing was up 17 per cent at Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 23.5m). However, Mr Charles Brims, chief executive, reiterated that the next two years would be difficult and that profit growth would slow. 'We are going through a transition stage,' he said. A contract to print the northern editions of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, which contributed one third of turnover in the printing business last year, ended in October. A contract to print the Independent expires in February 1996. Although the group was pursuing new contracts, none was imminent, Mr Brims said. Earnings per share rose to 28p (20.2p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.51p (3.12p). The shares closed up 44p at 650p.</p>

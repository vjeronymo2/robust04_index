			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Outdoors: A cast full of characters - Fishing When it comes to machismo in fishing, one bearded figure springs immediately to mind - that of the ultimate macho fish slayer, Hemingway. It is difficult to imagine that Ernest would have regarded any of our freshwater fishes as exemplifying masculinity, or - much more to the point - being capable of challenging his. For him, the battle took place at sea, with fish huge enough to shatter a man's strength and break his spirit. They must be muscled monsters, lords of the ocean, creatures such as sawfish, mako shark, broadbill tuna, or the marlin of The Old Man And The Sea. The fish of our rivers, lakes and ponds are Lilliputian by comparison. The tench, for instance: to Walton, it was the physician, curing the ailments of other fish with the balm contained in its slime. Utter tosh, of course. And neither is the tench an elemental force of the deep. Rather, it is a lovely, golden-olive, smooth-scaled bottom-feeder; a quiet, peaceable inhabitant of placid canals and dark, reed-fringed ponds. Ruminating anthropomorphically, I could indeed see the tench as a GP in a country practice: solid, respected, a source of sound advice and well-tested prescriptions. He is sensible enough, but in terms of brainpower must yield to the carp, which is undisputed as the fishing world's repository of wisdom. The carp is large, ponderous, with great mailed flanks, vast rubbery mouth, and a mighty tail. He, too, is a fish of still waters, old moats, monastery ponds and the like. His authority and reputation for sagacity spring from his size, and the difficulty anglers experience in catching him. I see him as the senior partner in a long-established law firm - a fair and moral influence, but sharp-witted too; and much respected in the community for his work on local charities and as chairman of the school governors. The carp rubs along nicely with the tench, for philosophically they have much in common. But he has a powerful prejudice against his nearest rival in terms of size - the pike. He sees him as a dangerous, troublesome element in society: a savage, greedy, unscrupulous predator, immune to civilising influences. For his part, the pike fears the carp for his superior learning, and despises him for eating worms and grubs when there are more substantial meals around. The pike is a ruthless and dynamic businessman - a property tycoon, perhaps, or hungry asset-stripper. I admire him for his dash, but think the carp would make a more reliable friend. I would be happy to make another friend of the chub. I like chub - most anglers do. He could be a customs man, an electrician, even a hack. It would not really matter. The thing about the chub is that he is a family man, can take a joke, is keen on rugby and cricket, always stands his round in the pub. I like perch, too. They are handsome fellows, with their black stripes across olive sides, and red fins. They bristle with pugnacity and commonsense - would make good police officers, backbench MPs of the no-compromise tendency, teachers of the old school. The roach, on the other hand, is fastidious and delicate - in publishing, I should say, or playing woodwind in a symphony orchestra. Bream are slab-sided and boring, making dull speeches at dull council meetings. Eels are slimy and sinister: offering loans to the gullible at murderous rates of interest. In the main, the coarse fish are professional types. The gilded nobility, of course, is drawn from the salmonidae, with the salmon, inevitably, as monarch; the trout in its finery as prince and princess; the grayling as top-drawer aristocracy. But how might I see myself, were I to be catapulted into an underwater world? I should like to think that I combined the wisdom of the carp with the athletic glory of the salmon, the natty elegance of the chalkstream trout with the hidden menace of the pike, the explosive power of the marlin with the . . . But no, not really. I would be content as a chub, or better still, as a barbel: big but not bloated, handsome but not effete, strong but definitely not macho, thoughtful, even a bit moody at times, but at bottom (which is where the barbel feeds) a thoroughly decent, dependable, yeoman farmer type.</p>

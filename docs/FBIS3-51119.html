			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 6 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina stated today that he trusts the Mexican people  will be able to find the best and least traumatic solution to  the armed conflict that has broken out in the southern State of  Chiapas.    "Cuba is maintaining absolute respect for something which  has  been the main feature of our foreign policy -- that the Mexicans  may find the best solution to the internal problems which have  developed at this time," Robaina added during a news conference  shortly before starting on an official visit to Switzerland and  five African nations.    For the past six days at least 12 communities located  throughout the Mexican State of Chiapas have been the scene of  clashes between the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and  government troops.    With respect to reports appearing in the Chilean newspaper  EL  MERCURIO related to that country's government not reestablishing  diplomatic relations with Havana before 21 March, the Cuban  foreign minister pointed out that Cuba is not "impatient or  proposing any date or deadline.    "It is a decision that only the Chilean Government can make  whenever it considers it convenient and we respect that," the  Cuban minister stated.    When asked about Cuba's presence at the new Honduran  president's inauguration scheduled to take place on 27 January,  Robaina indicated that his country had not yet been invited.  Nevertheless, if there is an invitation, he indicated, Cuba  will not be absent.    "In any Latin American setting our country will not turn  down  an opportunity or an invitation," the Cuban minister emphasized.    In reference to prospective relations between Cuba and the  United States in 1994, Robaina believes that there will be no  substantial changes. He added that even though Washington's  tone toward Havana has been less aggressive, a more severe  blockade is still in place.    On the other hand, he mentioned new possibilities in  political and economic ties with Europe, Latin American, and the  Caribbean.    The Cuban foreign minister said that "Cuba's situation is  very difficult, but we are not at a dead end yet."    Robaina believes that although 1994 will not entail any  significant changes in the country's internal situation with  respect to 1993, it may be that the [downward] spiral will begin  to reverse.</p>

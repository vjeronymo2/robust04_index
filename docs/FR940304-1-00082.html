			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this rulemaking, the rebound effects assumed were: 30 percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct heating equipment and mobile home furnaces, 20 percent for room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioners, and 10 percent for ranges and ovens. These percentages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent the amounts by which the potential energy savings from standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is, however, an argument that the usage elasticities/rebound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects for at least some household uses of energy may be substantial. Within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a household, the price elasticity of demand will be an average of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elasticities of demand for each end use, e.g. appliance. For example, suppose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the price elasticity of demand at the household level is .3. If some levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of appliance usage (say refrigerators) are insensitive to price changes, i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero elasticity, then at least one other use must have an elasticity in excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of .3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the usage elasticity for a product is identical to the price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elasticity of demand for the energy the product uses, then it follows that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weighted average of the usage elasticities of all household uses must equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household price elasticity of demand. Since the appliances subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy efficiency standards account for more than 80 percent of household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption, it would be unlikely that all appliances would have usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elasticities less that the overall household price elasticity of demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Energy Information Administration, the household price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elasticity of demand for electricity is about .15 in the short run and upward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of .7 in the long run. Thus usage elasticities, should, on average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximate these estimates. The Department seeks comments on this argument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Marginal Electricity Rates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Natural Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defense Council, and Washington Gas Light all urged the Department to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marginal electricity rates rather than average ones. (American Council for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6; Natural Resources Defense Council, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13 at 18; and Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 3). American Council for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Efficient Economy and Natural Resources Defense Council both stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that since room air conditioners are run disproportionately during periods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peak utility load (when rates are the highest), the use of average electricity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates will undervalue the electricity savings from improved efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that use of average electricity prices can produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inaccuracies and does attempt to use energy prices specific to each end use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, electricity rates have been assumed higher for air conditioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than for other end uses, based on survey data of consumer expenditures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disaggregated according to equipment ownership. The consumer analysis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposed rule continues to distinguish energy prices by end use, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such survey results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington Gas Light added that in addition to using marginal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electricity prices, the Department should use the All-Ratepayers Test when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring the cost effectiveness of a standard level. This test was developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the California Public Utilities Commission, and it measures the impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an action on all ratepayers, including non-participants in the conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity. (Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this program the Department examines the effect of energy conserved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by each purchaser of a more efficient appliance, but does not examine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects that the aggregate conservation effects would impose on the rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged within a given utility. The impacts on any system's rates from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased energy standards would depend on the participation rates of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customers in the conservation activity and the particular financial position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the utility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments discussed the impact of energy conservation standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on low-income people. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern Union Gas Company, No. 46 at 1; Laclede, No. 55 at 5; Oklahoma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 5; and Public Service Company of North  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 5). While the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with improved energy efficiency, the prices of used appliances could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to decline in the short run, the other comments all stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher prices that would be caused by improved efficiency standards on new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units would have price-increasing effects on used appliances and, therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be harmful for lower-income and elderly consumers on fixed incomes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Mixed quarter at US energy groups Texaco, the US energy group, reported higher operating earnings for the third quarter as a recovery in its international exploration and production business more than made up for the industry-wide slip in downstream refining and marketing profits in recent months. Chevron, meanwhile, saw operating earnings drop in both upstream and downstream operations. Earnings reports from the big US oil groups this week have generally reflected an increase in earnings from exploration and production on the back of higher oil prices. Profit margins from refining and marketing, although below the high levels of a year ago, have caused less damage to earnings than generally expected, giving a fillip to oil stocks. Texaco's shares climbed Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 63 while Exxon rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 60 7/8 . Shares in Mobil, meanwhile, jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 1/4 , following an announcement that the company was moving ahead with a restructuring programme to reduce costs. At Texaco, international exploration and production profits rose to Dollars 83m from Dollars 15m a year ago (before one-off items). This was due to higher production of both oil and natural gas in the UK sector of the North Sea, lower exploration expenses and higher oil prices, the company said. Upstream income in the US slipped to Dollars 127m from Dollars 138m. Marketing and refining profits, meanwhile, slid to Dollars 167m from Dollars 200m. After one-off items in both periods, Texaco reported net income of Dollars 281m, down from Dollars 317m in the 1993 period. At 98 cents a share, earnings were well ahead of most forecasts. Chevron, meanwhile, said earnings in upstream operations to Dollars 255m in the latest period fell from Dollars 332m, while downstream businesses recorded a fall to Dollars 163m from Dollars 243m (all figures are before one-off items). Although operating earnings rebounded from the second quarter, benefiting from higher refined product margins in the US and the absence of refinery operating problems, overall profit margins fell short of the strong 1993 third quarter, said Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive. One bright spot was provided by Chevron's chemical business, which reported earnings of Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 6m a year ago. Net income overall was Dollars 425m, or 65 cents a share, compared with Dollars 420m, or 64 cents a share, in the 1993 period.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Archaeology in the pipeline - The discovery of an Iron Age man The body was found in a curled position, as if the Iron Age man had been seeking protection from the harsh Humberside winds. Scattered around him were the flint tools he had used more than 2,000 years ago and fragments of pottery which once held offerings left by grieving relatives. The skeleton might have remained undisturbed for another 2,000 years, had not Kelt Energy, the UK-quoted independent, set upon the Humberside wolds for its latest onshore gas venture. The Caythorpe field, which produces the first onshore gas to be sold to an independent marketing company, was opened by Kelt and its partner, DSM Energy, last month. The opening was accompanied by an exhibition of artefacts - ranging from a brightly enamelled Roman brooch to a crude 4,000-year-old flint saw - discovered in an eight-week excavation sponsored by Kelt. The archaeological dig was less the result of Kelt's philanthropic tendencies, than a preventive measure to ensure the smooth passage of planning permission for its 4.5m pipeline. Following Department of the Environment guidelines issued in 1990, planning committees are increasingly likely to consider heritage concerns to be as important as other environmental issues. This has placed new strains on many companies such as Kelt. The Caythorpe region is a minefield for any developer. 'This area has one of the densest concentrations of archaeological sites in the country,' says Peter Cardwell, a partner of Northern Archaeological Associates. However, Kelt sought to pre-empt planning objections by hiring the archaeological consultancy at an early stage of Caythorpe's development. The pipeline's route was determined only after aerial photographs and in-depth research had pinpointed the main archaeological sites to avoid. The route was then subjected to magnetic soundings. More sites were discovered, and Kelt duly altered the initial pipeline path. The company then decided to fund the excavation of sites which it could not avoid. The guidelines are vague as to who has to foot the bill; however, the local council can force a developer to find financing for both the excavation and subsequent analysis of the finds. Kelt took the view that it would be quicker - and, in the end, cheaper - to fund the research itself. 'The excavation added about Pounds 50,000 to our costs,' says Paddy Spinks, a director, somewhat ruefully. Post-excavation research brings the total spent to Pounds 120,000, about 2 per cent of the total production budget for Caythorpe. But for that price, the company had roughly halved the time it might have taken to gain planning permission and won the council's support. 'Our relationship with Kelt has been very good,' says John Crook, senior planning officer with Humberside County Council. 'The work they did before submitting the planning application did help to ensure a relatively smooth passage.' For the region's archaeologists, development was offset by the enticement of funding. 'It was almost certainly the largest excavation in the area in the past year,' says Cardwell. Sites were discovered which would otherwise have gone unnoticed or unfunded. A study prepared for the official opening of Caythorpe cites the most important findings: a previously unidentified Roman settlement, dating from between 100 AD and 410 AD; the fact that this particular site was continuously occupied through the Anglo-Saxon period, to about 600 AD, set academic hearts aflutter. Until that discovery, there had been no evidence of such continuous occupation in the region. Kelt may have had to sacrifice time and money to get Caythorpe going. However, the unexpectedly good finds, combined with the site's encouraging output - at the top end of forecasts for between 5m and 10m cubic feet a day  -is already making such concerns less material.</p>

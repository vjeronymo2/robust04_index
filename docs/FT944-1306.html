			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Court raps government over night flights The Department of Transport was yesterday forced to reconsider its current controls on night flights into Heathrow and two other airports after the High Court ruled that the manner of their introduction had been illegal. A judge ruled that Mr John MacGregor, the former transport secretary, had acted unlawfully in failing to provide proper public consultation over the latest controls on night-time take-offs and landings at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. The judge said a consultation paper issued by the Department of Transport in January last year was misleading because it did not make clear that the new arrangements would mean an increase in noise levels at Heathrow. The ruling was welcomed by the local authorities which brought the court action against the department. Mr Richard Buxton, the authorities' solicitor, said the ruling would force the government to reconsider its current quota system for night flights. 'Seldom is a government department found by the courts to have misled so many people over such an important environmental issue. The government essentially has to go back to square one,' he said. The department was given leave to appeal over the ruling. A spokesman said the judgment would be studied carefully before a decision was taken over the appropriate response. However, he said the controls would remain in place until March 26 next year. Although ministers were yesterday digesting the detail of the judgment, officials conceded that a fresh round of consultations was now inevitable. The consultation paper published in last year stated that under the proposed controls noise levels would not exceed those for summer 1988. However, this ignored the fact that the actual noise levels for 1988 were two-thirds of levels allowed for in theory under controls in place at the time. Mr Justice Latham said: 'I do not consider that consultation based upon a document which can mislead in this way can be described as full and fair consultation in the sense that (local authorities) could legitimately expect.' The controls phased in this winter are based on a mixture of a quota system intended to encourage greater use of quieter aeroplanes and a ceiling on the number of individual flights. It was intended these controls would apply until summer 1998. The successful legal challenge was brought by the borough councils of Windsor and Maidenhead, Hounslow, Hillingdon, Richmond and Slough, and Surrey County Council. The department is expected to draw up new night flight regulations to cover next summer's flights.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> POLICE UNION SUES SAN JOSE  </P> <P> The San Jose police officers' union has filed suit against the city, charging  that inadequate staffing contributed to the shooting death of a police officer  by a crazed gunman last month. "The situation probably would have been resolved  if there had been two officers there," said Carm Grande, president of San Jose  Police Officers' Assn. Officer Gene Simpson, 45, was killed Jan. 20 after he  responded alone to a call that led to a confrontation with a mentally unstable  suspect outside a downtown doughnut shop. After overpowering Simpson, the  suspect used the officer's .357 Magnum service revolver to shoot him in the  head.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 'FURIOUS' AT POLICE OVER QUESTIONING  </P> <P> Barbara Nagy, I feel what happened to your students is par for the course  ("Teacher Angry After Police Search Latino Youths Invited to Her Home," The  Times, Sept. 9). It has happened to me too many times not to believe it is so.  </P> <P> For example: Last week while my daughter and I (teachers) stopped at Manhattan  Mall for a quick purchase, her Latino husband waited in the car, in the back  seat.  </P> <P> Two Manhattan Beach policemen questioned him. Why was he here? Who owned the  car? Did he steal it? Did he have a gun? Did he have any drugs? Was he waiting  for an accomplice to run out? Why was he eating in the car? He showed his ID  and they left. But why did they question him? He was just sitting there!!  </P> <P> I've become so anti-police, but I have to remind myself that most police are  young and very naive -- still think in prejudicial stereotypes.  </P> <P> I'm still furious.  </P> <P> MARY CAMPBELL  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

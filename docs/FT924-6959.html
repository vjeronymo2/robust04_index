			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Thames given Channel 5 deadline THAMES Television has been given two weeks to come up with evidence of firm funding for its attempt to launch a fifth television channel in the UK. The Independent Television Commission was expected to make a decision on Channel 5, which should reach 70 per cent of the UK population, at its meeting in Manchester yesterday. Instead a decision was deferred until its next meeting on December 17. It is believed that the postponement was at the request of Thames - which is the main driving force behind Channel Five Holdings, the only company to bid for the franchise. The company is in advanced negotiations with a number of potential investors. They are understood to include Time Warner, the US media group, Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, and two unidentified British media companies. The ITC said yesterday that Channel Five Holdings had been invited 'to provide further information on its funding arrangements no later than 4 December in order that the commission can conclude its overall arrangements'. A court hearing set for November 30, at which Thames will claim that it should retain the rights to several hundred feature films for showing on Channel 5, could also have a bearing. The chances are that Thames will be able to satisfy the ITC that a big problem facing Channel 5 - retuning video recorders, which otherwise would suffer from interference - can be solved if enough money is raised.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WIFE, ACCOMPLICE KILLED FILM PRODUCER, D.A. SAYS  </P> <P> A Woodland Hills woman and an alleged accomplice were charged Monday with  murdering the woman's husband, an X-rated film producer shot to death on a  Northridge street last August.  </P> <P> Sharon Snyder, 39, and Victor Diaz, whose address was not immediately  available, were charged with murder and conspiracy to murder Theodore J.  Snyder, 47, of Woodland Hills, part owner of Video Cassette Recordings and Mark  V International adult video companies.  </P> <P> Snyder was shot Aug. 1 at Blackhawk Street and Wilbur Avenue in Northridge.  Sharon Snyder and Diaz were arrested Friday by Los Angeles police detectives  and are being held without bail in city jails pending arraignment today in San  Fernando Municipal Court, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles  County district attorney's office.  </P> <P> The murder charge carries a special circumstance allegation of murder for  financial gain, which makes it possible for prosecutors to seek the death  penalty or life in prison without possibility of parole.  </P> <P> Further details were not available because law enforcement officials could not  be reached for comment Monday evening.  </P> <P> At least one law enforcement source said after the shooting that Snyder's ties  to organized crime might have led to his death, but police publicly said no  clear motive had emerged in their investigation.  </P> <P> Diaz, whose occupation was not immediately known, also is charged with one  count of possession of a machine gun, Gibbons said.  </P> <P> Court affidavits showed that Snyder's company did business with and owed money  to a firm allegedly controlled by Martin Taccetta, a man linked by federal  prosecutors to the Lucchese crime family.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Philipp Gollner contributed to this story.  </P></p>

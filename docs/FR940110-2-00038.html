Questar states that the investment associated with the facilities to be abandoned is $15,129. Questar states that because these facilities function solely to reduce delivery pressures for individual downstream sales and transportation delivery meter stations, no actual deliveries were made directly through these facilities. Questar states that following abandonment, the 3-inch Huntington Tap will remain in service. Questar states that because Mountain Fuel will continue to deliver to its customers via individual meter and regulating stations along the length of J.L. No. 44, there will be no abandonment of gas service to Mountain Fuel or its customers as a result of granting it permission to abandon the HU0005 DRS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> February 17, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

These countries have escaped penalties because of friendly  relations with the United States, said a government official who  declined to be identified.    These countries are on a list of nations that failed to  convince the U.S. that they have cooperated with the U.S.  efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs, and, consequently,  failed to receive U.S. certification last year, which is a  condition of receiving U.S. anti-drug aid, the official said.    Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard told reporters  Wednesday [9 February] that the administration also was  considering countries that may not receive the certification on  the annual April 1 deadline.    Gelbard said this when he briefed reporters on the  international component of President Clinton's new 13.2 billion  dollars national drug control strategy, which places greater  emphasis on domestic treatment and prevention rather than  international intervention.    Drug producing and trafficking countries that do not make an  effort will face increasingly serious economic and other  sanctions, according to Clinton's plan.    Clinton's new budget proposes increasing money for the State  Department's anti-drug efforts by 80 million dollars to 252  million dollars.    To underscore the U.S. emphasis on cooperation, Secretary of  State Warren Christopher on Wednesday told several dozen  ambassadors from drug production and transit countries and a  number of other European and Latin American countries that  cocaine and heroin are not just American problems, saying that  drugs are a global menace....[ellipses as received] The grip  drug dealers have on many governments is just terrifying.    The United States in recent years has focused attention on  curtailing coca leaf production and cocaine trafficking in Latin  America, but Gelbard and other officials also cited the  burgeoning heroin trafficking that followed the breakup of the  Soviet Union.</p>

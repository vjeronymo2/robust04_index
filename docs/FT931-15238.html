			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: UN hopes for brief operation UNITED NATIONS delegates greeted news of the air strike almost with a sense of relief that the allies had finally taken action to call President Saddam Hussein to account for his persistent defiance of Security Council resolutions. At the same time, several third world members voiced the hope that the operation would be brief and confined exclusively to strikes against military targets. The US formally notified the president of the Security Council, Mr Yoshio Hatano of Japan, that the allies had resumed hostilities. There was no immediate response from the president's office. Mr Hatano had said earlier that he was willing to engage in 'a dialogue' with Iraq, as was proposed late on Tuesday by Mr Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi ambassador. Yesterday Mr Hamdoon said his country was halting the removal of materiel at the Umm Qasr naval base which lies partly in Kuwait, but it was unclear whether that decision preceded the allied military action. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, was in Paris yesterday where he discussed the Iraqi crisis, among other issues, with Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, who is also visiting the French capital.</p>

The organization aims for real integration  of women into society, promotion of Haitian culture, returning  self-confidence to women through specific programs to provide  them access to health, education, and productivity.    The inauguration of the Movement for Integration of the  Haitian Woman [Mouvement pour L'Integration de la Femme  Haitienne] was marked by a reception at the El Rancho Hotel. On  this occasion, presentations were made on the situation of women  in Haiti, their role in the economy and in the family.    Researcher Gilbert Valme calls for a new social contract  between the patriarchal and matriarchal systems, a way,  according to Mr. Valme, of assuring a better future for Haitian  children. Other speakers, engineer Ginette Mathurin and Attorney  Mireille Durocher Bertin, spoke of the role of women in the  economy, in the peasant environment, and of their legal status.

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Ex-communists try to capitalise: Germany's PDS draws hope from its showing in the Saxony-Anhalt election The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor to the former east German communist party, is taking no chances. Hours after it had won 20 of the 99 seats in Saxony-Anhalt's parliament, Mr Gregor Gysi, the party's most prominent personality, was on the campaign trail. He and his 130,000 members are determined to capitalise on last Sunday's success. The question is whether the votes the PDS won in the state elections can be carried over on to the federal level when elections are held in October. To get into the Bundestag, the PDS needs to obtain 5 per cent of the federal vote, or else win three constituencies outright. Mr Lothar Bisky, the leader of the PDS, reckons that the party will win three mandates in east Berlin and could even clinch a seat in Rostock, in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and in Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. 'At the present rate, we could get 6 per cent of the vote,' he said earlier this week. Translated into seats, it would amount to 40 in the Bundestag. Despite attempts by west German politicians - with the exception of President Richard von Weizsacker - to repeatedly accuse the PDS of being a communist party in disguise east Germans continue to support the party. The main reason is that the PDS is seen by east Germans as their party which understands the traumatic affects unification has had on eastern Germany. 'East Germans do not think of going back to the old days. They do not think of us as a communist party. The point is they know us. We are one of them. The Wessis (west Germans) cannot accept this,' added Mr Bisky. Another reason is that the PDS, for the moment, is seen as the left party for the east Germans, unlike the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). Not only has the SPD been unable to set up a strong grass-roots organisation in the east; its policies seem indistinguishable from those of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats (CDU). Mr Rudolf Scharping, head of the SPD, is all too aware of the weaknesses in eastern Germany where it governs just one of the five states. That is why, rather than immediately form a CDU-SPD grand coalition in Saxony-Anhalt, the SPD, with just 36 seats, one less than the CDU, is considering a minority government with the Greens, who have five seats. 'In such a case, an SPD-Green coalition would have to depend on the PDS for support,' said Mr Bisky, adding that this would legitimise the PDS as a genuine opposition left party. The SPD, however, is calculating on the basis that disaffected voters would in October drift back to the SPD and the Greens if they believed a Red-Green coalition was possible at the federal level.</p>

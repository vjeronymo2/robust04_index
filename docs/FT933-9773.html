			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises in advance of budget vote Wall Street Good economic news and a sharp rise in Eastman Kodak shares helped US stock markets post modest gains yesterday, in spite of continued doubt over the fate of President Bill Clinton's first budget, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.46 at 3,560.43. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.55 firmer at 448.68, while the Amex composite finished up 0.81 at 436.34, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.58 at 718.08, a new record. Trading volume on the NYSE was 222m shares. The week ended with the markets' attention focused on Washington DC, where Mr Clinton was fighting to ensure that his first budget passes through Congress. Although the House of Representatives narrowly approved his deficit-reduction package on Thursday night, the senate was not due to vote until late on Friday night. Although most observers expected the budget to be passed, the outcome of the vote appeared to rest in the hands of one Democratic senator, who was refusing to say which way he would vote. Consequently, equity investors were reluctant to commit funds to the markets while the budget's future was still in the balance. Analysts feared that if the budget fell at the last hurdle, bond prices would drop sharply when the markets reopen on Monday, and stock prices would quickly follow suit. Even some rare bullish economic news failed to spur much buying. The July employment report showed a 162,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, and a bigger-than-expected decline in the national unemployment rate from 7 per cent to 6.8 per cent. The big story was Eastman Kodak, which jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 58 5/8 in volume of 5.4m shares after the company announced its chairman, Mr Kay Whitemore, was stepping down. Investors hope that the change at the top of Kodak will trigger a revival in the company's fortunes. Other Dow stocks were in mixed form. IBM fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 43 1/4 , Philip Morris rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 , and International Paper climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 66. Car stocks, which have been much in demand since the Big Three manufacturers announced big improvements in second quarter earnings, ran into profit-taking. General Motors fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 47 3/4, Chrysler slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 42, and Ford dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 5/8 . On the Nasdaq market, the big technology issues were mixed. Apple fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 29 1/4 and Microsoft Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 73 1/4 , while Intel rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 1/2 . Canada TORONTO share prices closed higher in quiet trading. The composite index was up 12.38 points to 3959.96, for a loss on the week of about 7 points. Advancing issues led declines 386 to 302. Volume of 43.597 was below Thursday's 53.077 and trading value declined to CDollars 441.9m from CDollars 576m.</p>

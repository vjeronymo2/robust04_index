			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: Clear instruction GRAMMAR AND STYLE by Michael Dummett Duckworth,Pounds 8.95,125 pages WHAT is the difference between a participle and a gerund? When is it appropriate to use a semi-colon in one's writing, and when a colon? How should prose style best serve readers' interests? The answers to these and many allied questions are to be found in this instructive and entertaining essay by Michael Dummett on the fundamentals of good English. Until his retirement two years ago Dummett was Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford. Goaded by signs of increasing illiteracy among university examinees, he intended this concise guide to English for students. But the prevalence of bad English in the quality press and broadcasting media - and among his fellow dons - prompted him to offer it more widely. He performs a valuable service. For, in just over a 100 pages, he provides most of what anyone needs to know about the anatomy and physiology of English: which is to say, its basic grammar and its proper use. There is much talk about the problem faced by school-teachers in giving their pupils a proficiency in written English. In my view the best way is to make Latin compulsory to GCSE standard and to have all pupils write weekly essays. In the current educational environment, with its flabby attitudes and reluctance to make demands on schoolchildren, such a proposal will get nowhere. The remedy is to encourage anyone who writes, by choice or necessity, to check their use of language. Dummett's first two chapters introduce grammatical basics. Without some grasp of these no-one can hope to write accurately. The diseases of inaccuracy, ambiguity and illogicality flourish when language is ignorantly employed, and this subverts the end for which it exists; namely, communication. The remaining chapters deal with the science and art of writing. Shades of meaning, prose style, the importance of correct punctuation and the niceties of orthography are all considered and counselled. Dummett's wry humour is liberally mixed with instruction throughout. Commenting on a tiresome contemporary cliche he says: 'The sole lasting accomplishment of the now defunct Social Democratic Party seems to have been to induce everyone to misuse the tag 'breaking the mould.' It comes from Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, in which the poet says of the Scottish hero, Zerbino, that 'Nature made him, and then broke the mould', so that she could never make his like again. To break the mould is therefore, in general, a deplorable, not an admirable, thing.' For Dummett, the fundamental rule of good writing is that it should leave readers free to concentrate on the thought. Well-mannered prose does not obtrude on the reader's notice; it is a transparent medium. It must therefore say what the writer means, without ambiguity and without forcing the reader to hunt through a tangle of inversions and dependent clauses to extract a sense. And it should be free of such irritations as cliches, mixed metaphors and misused terms. Dummett gives many examples of poor English, many drawn from respectable sources. Critics of Dummett have in the past claimed that his writings - mostly huge philosophical treatises, although he has also written about voting systems and card-games - themselves fail as models of clarity. This is unfair; Dummett's philosophical work deals with extremely complicated ideas, but always in forthright fashion. Dummett's best-known books, it is true, are scarcely the stuff of bedtime reading; but it is the difficulty of the issues they deal with, not the language they are written in, which makes this so. The best book ever written on how to use English well is the classic by Robert Graves and Alan Hodges, The Reader Over Your Shoulder. Its two authors randomly selected passages from Bertrand Russell, H G Wells, T S Eliot, J M Keynes and others, and subjected them to devastating analyses for faults of logical weakness, irrelevance, over-emphasis, false contrast, misused terms, inappropriate and mixed metaphors, circumlocution, awkward inversion, and a rash of other blemishes and errors besides. The lessons they teach are unforgettable. That book is very difficult to find now, but Dummett's guide is a worthy substitute. By its help the written tongue may yet survive its present grim malaise.</p>

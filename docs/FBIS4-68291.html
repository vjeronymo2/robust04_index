			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Petr Altunin: "While the Future of the </F> Countryside is Being Debated, 100 Military Sovkhozes are  Planting Grain"]    [Text] Passions are boiling on parliamentary podiums and in  the press: What road is our agriculture to travel? The one thing  that's clear now is that the reforms carried out in this area  have not produced results. In comparison with 1992, in 1993 the  area devoted to cereal crops "slimmed" by 4 percent, that  devoted to potatoes decreased by 17 percent, and that for  vegetables decreased by 21 percent. Experts predict that this  year there will be not more that 85-90 million tons in the  granaries, which is significantly less that in recent years. The  numbers of farm animals and birds declined dramatically due to  the shortage of feed.    How in this situation is food being supplied to the armed  forces? To put it briefly, the servicemen are receiving their  full allotment. The fact that the structure of the food  assortment often changes, with some products being replaced by  others, is another matter.    "Commanders and rear services have to display maximum  shrewdness to buy cheaper in one place and to ask for credit yet  another time in some other place, thus balancing the food  situation," said Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Savinov, chief of  the Central Food Directorate of the Russian Federation Ministry  of Defense. "It is becoming increasingly more evident today that  the military budget is not going to grow any in the immediate  future. This means we have to count on our own strengths to a  considerable degree. What strengths are these? You can't send  soldiers out into the fields--there aren't enough of them for  the combat subunits. Our hopes lie with the military sovkhozes.  They must become one of the guaranteed sources of food support  to the army and navy."    What is their position today? The army's is favorable on the  whole. Today, its pennants fly over as many as 100  sovkhozes--more than the 67 that survived the USSR's  disintegration, and there are another dozen waiting in the  wings. What is attracting them to the army? Order. Given the  imperfect legislation and the continuing verbal battles "at the  top" on the fate of the kolkhoz peasantry, villages and towns  suffering the effects of privatization are floating downstream  with no idea of how to get to shore.    In the meantime, rural laborers believe that the army could  help with equipment and fuel, set up social, cultural and  personal services, and take food products in trade. This is the  way new sovkhozes came to the Moscow Military District and to  the missile and aerospace forces. And the Northern Fleet, which  possesses four livestock sovkhozes that had recently been  feeling an acute shortage of feed, stretched its arm all the way  out to Volgograd Oblast and took in eight steppe sovkhozes and  one in Kursk Oblast (that one, by the way, even has its own  name--Krasnaya Zvezda) under its flag of St. Andrew.    The defense ministry also concerned itself with the legal  basis. By a government decision, military sovkhozes were  proclaimed to be federal property, and not subject to  privatization. This year in addition to other farms of the  country, they are being granted preferential loans.    There is of course a limiting factor affecting the desire to  take as many farms as possible under the wing of the armed  forces--money. During recent zonal conferences of directors of  army agricultural enterprises organized by the armed forces rear  services, the idea circulated that rather than focusing on the  quantity of sovkhozes, we need to transform the presently  existing farms into highly profitable ones.    What needs to be done for this today? The most practical  problems, which have generally been around forever, have be to  solved. Ones like scientifically substantiated crop rotation,  sensible fertilization of the soil, rational selection of plants  and animals, protection of the harvest from pests, and so on.  For this, we need to awaken the sense of ownership in each  person, teach him to keep track of every ruble spent and of the  return enjoyed from it, and provide good wages. It is precisely  because of this approach to the work that good results are being  enjoyed at the Yubileynyy, Novaya Lyada and Podlesnyy farms  (Moscow Military District) where, for example, last year's  potato harvest was 108, 140 and 107 centners per hectare. And  Military Sovkhoz No 14 is regularly producing 4.71 kg of milk  from every forage-fed cow.    Auxiliary farms contribute strong support to the  "foundation"  of military sovkhozes. Last year they produced 8,000 tonnes of  meat, 8,500 tonnes of milk, 9.6 million eggs, and over 22,000  tons of potatoes and vegetables. There are even units able to  provide meat and other food products for themselves half a year  or more into the future--for example those commanded by  Lieutenant Colonels Aleksandr Makarov and Aleksandr Babarykin  and Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Vaskin.    Recently, of course, an alarming trend has appeared: Some  auxiliary farms have started surrendering. There are objective  reasons for this: The army is undergoing reorganization,  personnel strength is decreasing, and then there's that same old  problem--feed. The military sovkhozes could provide considerable  assistance to their "lesser brothers." This is already being  done in many of the districts.    And of course, you can't get anything done without order and  executive discipline. Another obstacle today is the "outside  criminal"--racketeers are making their way into the military  sovkhozes: Brandishing weapons, in Saratov Oblast they meet  loaded vehicles demanding tribute, and Chechens are raiding  pastures of Prokhladnyy Sovkhoz (Kabardino-Balkaria), where they  hogtie the herdsmen and rustle the livestock. One would think  that the army could come to the aid of its breadwinners.    One hundred military sovkhozes, plus 34 special dairies, and  3,456 auxiliary farms. They work 370,000 hectares of farmland,  and maintain 98,000 head of cattle, 200,000 pigs, 137,000 sheep  and 864,000 birds.    It this a little, or a lot? The food products that have been  produced are enough to supply the armed forces for 2.1 months  with meat, 4 months with eggs, 2 months with potatoes and  vegetables, and an entire year with milk. If these indicators  are increased by 1.5-2 times in the immediate future, this will  certainly be impressive support additional to the food supplied  to the armed forces on the basis of state orders.    Spring is at its peak, and it was late this year at that.  This is why the schedule of field work is extremely tight. Every  day, every hour of daylight is precious to us. Laborers of the  military agricultural enterprises all understand this well.  There is the immutable truth, after all, that a year's supply of  food hinges on a single spring day.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: Visions of the horror of the century - War and Peace (Populist social history and glimpses of hell) / Contemporary artists feel a need to respond to the legacy of concentration camps, writes Lynn MacRitchie In visual art, there is a face of war. Goya saw and drew it, and it could be glimpsed throughout A Bitter Truth, Richard Cork's survey of the art of the first world war which has just closed at the Barbican. It was also evident in the paintings and drawings Peter Howson produced as official war artist in Bosnia, shown at the Imperial War Museum this autumn. This face, usually that of a man, stares out, a living skull, huge eyes locked wide open, too many horrors witnessed for them ever again to close in peaceful rest. For the most part, this face is absent from After Auschwitz, the first exhibition in Britain of contemporary art responding to the Holocaust, which opens in London in February. Concentrating on work produced in the past five to ten years, curator Monica Bohm Duchen has rejected work she describes, reluctantly but accurately, as 'Holocaust Kitsch' - over-familiar images exploiting the viewer's responses in too obvious a way. Trusting to aesthetic criteria alone, she reduced down to 20 a list of several hundred artists, which included famous names such as RB Kitaj as well as unknowns suggested by Jewish and Holocaust organisations contacted all over the world. Of these artists, three are Holocaust survivors. Zoran Music, born in Slovenia in 1909, is not a Jew, but was imprisoned in Dachau for resistance activities. He made more than 200 drawings in the camp, but the exhibition concentrates instead on work from the series 'We are not the last', begun in the 1970s. Music, like the two other survivors, was unable to deal directly with the subject of the camps in his work until many years had passed. In his paintings, that 'face of war' recurs set stunned and staring atop sketchily suggested piles of bodies. Kitty Klaidman, born in Czechoslovakia in 1937, now lives in Washington. Recently, she returned to the Czech village where, as a child, she was hidden in a storeroom. Her stylised monochrome paintings refer to the architecture of her hiding place, and especially to the attic, which allowed her the occasional glimpse of the outside world. Daisy Brand, born in Czechoslovakia in 1929, now lives in Boston and worked as a professional potter for many years. As a girl of 14, she experienced seven camps in one year. Since the 1980s she has been making wall sculptures relating to her experiences, using earthenware, porcelain and other media. In the triptych 'The Broken Promise' three earthenware boxes contain Torah-like scrolls made of porcelain, two of which have been unrolled to show drawings of an abstract, many-chambered interior and a railway track running into the distance. The well-intentioned argument that only those who have direct experience of terrible historical events such as the Holocaust have any 'right' to speak of them fails to address the need felt by many others to deal in their work with what George Steiner called 'the black mystery of what happened in Europe'. In a world where nationalist wars are raging and both neo-fascism and anti-semitism have re-emerged as political forces in Germany, the continuing struggle to understand the significance of the Holocaust has a particular urgency. Shimon Attie, born in the US in 1957, now lives and works in Berlin, making a series called 'Writing on the Wall'. He projects slides of pre-war photographs of Jewish residents on to the walls of the buildings standing at the same locations today, photographing the results. Thus in 'Almstadstrasse', 1991, the figure of a religious book salesman of the 1930s peers from a crumbling doorway next to a block of modern apartments. The juxtaposition, while poetic in its poignancy, is also shocking. The German photographer Henning Langheim, in his series 'Memorials', takes black and white pictures of the sites of places of atrocity as they are today. His most recent work includes an image of the extermination camp of Maly Trostenets. The empty landscape is dotted with pieces of bodies, which on closer examination turn out to be the discarded remains of demolished statues of Soviet heroes; the liberators of yesterday, become fallen oppressors in their turn. The exhibition's title refers to Theodor Adorno's maxim that 'to write a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric'. In her catalogue essay, Duchen points out that Adorno's phrase dates from 1949, 'when the shock of the camps was still fresh'. She suggests that artists would be 'foolhardy' to ignore the moral issues raised by the relationship between culture and barbarism. Since one of the greatest difficulties in approaching the subject of the Holocaust is to find a way of grasping a horror on a scale that defies imagining, Duchen is clear that we need to find means other than the merely documentary to help us to understand 'not just with the mind but also with the heart'. She suggests that 'art's ability - or otherwise - to deal with the most significant event of the twentieth century can be seen as a crucial gauge of art's credentials in post-war society.' A mixed exhibition of work by artists of such varied experience and background may be hard pressed to rise to the challenge. But the recognition that artists still feel that they must try to understand this manifestation of the heart of darkness is a welcome acknowledgement of their place as participants in the exploration of the nature of humanity.

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilt edged market's attention will be focused on Wednesday's auction of Pounds 2bn of conventional 6 1/4 per cent long dated stock due 2010. The auction is the first of stock maturing beyond 10 years since January and will be watched closely for signs of interest among international investors, who might be tempted by hopes of a currency gain. Although recent indicators suggest economic growth above the long-term trend, worries about inflation are unlikely to be sufficiently pronounced to upset the sale. The issue came at the lower end of expectations in terms of size and is likely to meet demand from such traditional UK investors as pension funds and insurance companies. It also follows a period of improving sentiment in the market, which has seen yields on 10 benchmark bonds drop to around 8.3 per cent from about 9 per cent six weeks ago. The big question is whether the market's fortunes have changed for the better or whether we have seen a rally in a bear market. Mr Kevin Gardiner, Morgan Stanley's UK economist, is pessimistic and forecasts that yields will be back at 9 per cent in December. However, Mr Adam Chester of Yamaichi International expects yields to fall to 8 per cent by the year's end, reflecting a benign inflation environment.</p>

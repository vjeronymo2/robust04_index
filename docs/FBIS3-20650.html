			<p>Language: <F P=105>Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Summary] The Nuclear Power Institute of China (NPIC) has  made encouraging progress on the AC-600 pressurized-water  reactor (PWR), a key science and technology issue of the Eighth  Five-Year Plan.    The development of China's industry and agriculture requires  energy and while the development of nuclear power is attracting  more and more attention from the Party and the State, growth in  this area is restricted by the industrial base and by the  State's financial resources. As a result, the State hopes to  develop a next-generation PWR that will be safer, simpler, and  more economical.    Since 1986, experts and S&amp;T personnel from NPIC have  learned  from China's successful nuclear power research and design and  have intensely followed the leading edge technologies of  improved foreign reactors; they have now completed the research  and design process for an improved 600MWe PWR, the AC-600. This  reactor has a core with a higher safety margin, less complicated  systems, and non-dynamic systems safety measures which have  earned the approval of international atomic energy organizations.    It is now known that the conceptual design was completed in  1987, and the independent feasibility study for the AC-600 was  completed in 1990, pushing forward the 1991-1995 development  plan; the China Nuclear Industry Corporation and the State  Science and Technology Commission have both signed off on this  plan.    According to this plan, in 1995 the NPIC will have completed  the testing and analysis of the overall design of the AC-600  reactor, the low flow velocity, critical heat flow density, and  other crucial items. To date, the key item in the overall  design, the critical heat flow density, has been completed and  the three non-dynamic safety systems are being assembled with a  projected date of completion of 1995; work on other items is on  schedule. Based on preliminary analysis and the current  developmental work, the AC-600 could be China's next-generation  PWR power plant in the year 2000.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: Flexible pay for job security Sir, Most of us have seen able, experienced staff made redundant. The individual suffers, and the business loses valuable skills which are usually costly to replace when things get better. Is not the inflexibility of payroll costs a main cause of this inefficiency? I have taken a straw poll which suggests that many employees would exchange flexibility in pay for greater job security. My suggestion of 75 per cent of salary as a guaranteed minimum, with 100 per cent paid in a normal year, and 125 per cent in a good year seemed to be an acceptable range. Is now the time for employers to offer such contracts? Richard Tweed, 10 Lyndhurst Close, Croydon, Surrey</p>

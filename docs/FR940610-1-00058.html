			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flexibility:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have to reduce the burden of paperwork, streamline reporting systems, recognize regional and economic differences and offer schools different approaches to designing menus that meet the Dietary Guidelines. To do this, we must use technology more effectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Investing in people:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We must provide schools and school food service directors with the training and technical assistance they need to bring about nutrition changes in the school meals programs and build the nutrition skills of our nation's children, and thereby improve their health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Building partnerships:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To meet our national health responsibility to American children and to increase cost effectiveness, we must forge partnerships throughout the public and private sectors. This includes continuing collaborative efforts with our federal partners at the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services and building bridges to consumer and industry groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guided by these five principles, USDA constructed a comprehensive, integrated framework for action:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eating for Health: Meeting the Dietary Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> School meal nutrition standards will be updated and expanded to include the Dietary Guidelines for Americans with standards for fat and saturated fat as well as required nutrients. The current meal planning system which requires that certain types of foods be served in certain quantities will be replaced by a more flexible system that allows schools to concentrate on serving a variety of foods in amounts that are suitable for children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Making Food Choices: Nutrition Education, Training and Technical Assistance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not enough to change the food on the plate. We must also provide the knowledge that enables children to make choices that lead to a nutritious diet and improved health. It also is vital that local meal providers receive training on how to improve meal quality. This dual initiative to educate children and assist meal providers offers many opportunities to influence both what foods are offered by schools and what foods are eaten by children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Maximizing Resources: Getting the Best Value. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By marshalling all available resources and strengthening partnerships with our state and local cooperators, we will stretch food dollars and cut costs while improving the nutritional profile of commodities. We will enhance access to locally grown commodities and better use regional agricultural resources. And we will provide assistance, training and the power of federal purchases to help school administrators manage school meals programs in a more cost-effective manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Managing for the Future: Streamlined Administration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is necessary to reduce paperwork and administrative burdens of local administrators. We will streamline procedures and emphasize administrative flexibility to free state and local food program managers to concentrate on nutrition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Framework for Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulatory proposals that follow are intended to support the Department's goal of promoting the long term health of children through updating nutrition standards to include the Dietary Guidelines. In addition, several of the proposals reflect the Administration's desire to streamline administration of government programs through increasing State and local flexibility and making better use of advanced technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to recognize, however, that these regulatory proposals are but one part of the Department's overall plan for improving the quality of school meals. The Guiding Principles and Framework for Action described above grew out of public comment and the recognition that it is not enough just to change the food served to children on their plates. What is required is a much broader approach that includes significant administrative actions initiated by the Executive Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the Department is committed to investing in people_both the State and local professionals who operate the program and the children who participate in it. This investment will take the form of nutrition education to build the skills necessary to make healthful food choices, training for food service workers and technical assistance. The Department has already committed existing funds toward the development of improved recipes for school meal service, a computerized data bank of standard nutritional values for foods served in the school meals program, and a demonstration project on the use of Nutrient Standard Menu Planning. On the nutrition education front, the Department has already announced a strategy that includes challenge grants to localities to develop community-based, comprehensive approaches to nutrition education and a nutrition publication directed at grade school children. The Department is also assisting local school food service professionals in working with chefs, farmers and others to harness all of their unique skills to make school meals appealing and healthful, and to educate children about food and cooking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Looking to the future, the Administration's budget proposal for Fiscal Year 1995 contains a request for $18.4 million in additional funds to support nutrition education and technical assistance. Plans for these funds include extensive training for local school meal providers on how to plan and prepare nutritious and appealing meals as well as launching a national media campaign directed at building children's skills at making wise food choices for life-long health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All these initiatives are being undertaken with the support of USDA's Federal partners at DHHS and DOE. This collaboration extends to addressing issues of common concern such as reducing redundant paperwork requirements, integrating nutrition education into school curriculum and exploring ways to integrate the school meals program more fully into the school environment and into school-based health initiatives. Within the Department, there are also plans to strengthen ties with the Food Service Management Institute and, indeed, with private organizations so that as many resources and as much creativity as possible can be brought to bear on this important issue of improving children's health through sound nutrition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

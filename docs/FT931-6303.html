			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Lilleshall advance LILLESHALL, the industrial distribution and building products group, lifted pre-tax profits by 30 per cent, from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.1m, in the year to December 31 1992. The rise was mainly due to the acquisition in January 1992 of Crystalware Products, the plastic housewares and garden products manufacturer, and the purchase of Bradgrange Packaging in February. The shares closed up 3p at 133p. Lilleshall's stock, which had fallen below 100p, has been climbing since late December. Barlow Fastener Centres was acquired too late in the year to affect profits. The acquisitions brought gearing to 33 per cent by the year end. Currency movements on the group's French franc borrowings also increased gearing and pushed interest payments from Pounds 33,000 in 1991 to Pounds 539,000 in 1992. Mr John Leek, chairman, said that since the year end gearing had reached 40 per cent but was budgeted to come down as more stocks were taken out of the business, especially from industrial consumables which it said was overstocked. Group turnover rose from Pounds 36.7m to Pounds 52.1m and a final dividend of 2.65p is proposed, making a total of 4.25p (4p) for the year. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 15 per cent from 8.5p to 9.8p. The building products division recorded a small drop in operating profits from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 2.3m. The plastics and engineering division produced higher operating profits of Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 446,000) with most of the increase from the Crystalware acquisition. The group recorded reduced losses on industrial consumables of Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 628,000). There was an exceptional gain of Pounds 81,000, masking a Pounds 522,000 provision against stocks following refocusing of the fastener division. This was offset by gains including Pounds 230,000 proceeds from litigation and a Pounds 202,000 release of pension provisions. These were released because the company closed its defined benefits pension scheme (which relates pension income to final earnings) and invited all employees to join a contracted out scheme. The group does not expect to pay out less as a proportion of gross income but said the move had been prompted by possible changes in pensions law.</p>

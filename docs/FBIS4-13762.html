			<p>BFN     [Text] Kabul, April 23 (AFP) -- At least 158 people were  injured in an overnight battle that erupted in Kabul between  rival forces fighting for and against President Borhanoddin  Rabbani, officials said here Saturday [23 April].    Troops exchanged artillery and heavy weapons fire during the  clash, but government troops said they had "repulsed" renegade  fighters of Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hektmatyar.    They also claimed that "heavy casualties" were inflicted on  the troops of Hekmatyar and Uzbek fighters of militia warlord  'Abdol Rashid Dostam, the premier's main battle ally.    "The attack started at 7 p.m. (1430 GMT) and reached its  peak  at 10 p.m. lasting till midnight," a government soldier told AFP  in the scarred Microrayan housing estate, situated near the  former diplomatic enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan.    Rabbani's troops on Kabul's eastern front said troops of  Hekmatyar and Dostam's Uzbek warriors attacked them at several  points.    Hekmatyar's Shiite ally, the Hezb-i-Wahdat faction, also  joined the battle, engaging Rabbani's troops at the city's  south, the government troops said.    Reports of deaths from the clash were not immediately  available but the Jamhurriat hospital here said three civilians  died of their injuries while a 10-year-old boy with a bullet  wound in the chest was in a critical condition.    During Friday's fighting a phosphorus shell slammed into the  International Committee of the Red Cross complex but did not  explode, but it ignited when Western demining experts were  extracting the ordnance, relief workers said.    A few civilians still residing in the remaining Microrayan  apartment estate said they spent the night in makeshift shelters  or in the basements as shells whined overhead and bullets  scoured homes.    Residents in one Microrayon block said only four of the 60  apartments there were occupied as most residents had fled since  rival forces turned the residential district into a regular  battle ground four months ago.    Troops of Dostam, Hekmatyar and Rabbani are battling since  January to take control of Microrayon, a sprawling residential  enclave built by the former Soviet Union for its Red Army  officers after it invaded Afghanistan in 1979.    Angry Microrayon residents came out of their homes to hurl  curses at the United Nations, Western nations and the Afghan  mojahedin for their woes as a lull in the battle set in  Saturday, witnesses said.</p>

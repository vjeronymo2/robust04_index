			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, May 18, INA--Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq  'Aziz now in New York condemned the attitude of the countries  insisting on continuing the blockade against Iraq. He  emphasised the aim behind their policy was harming the people of  Iraq and depriving it of requisites of life.    Mr. 'Aziz also said, in an interview to the U.S. CNN  screened  last night, those who insist on maintaining the blockade on Iraq  were badly harming the people of Iraq and its right to live  normally. He stressed it was necessary for the big powers  influencial in the Security Council to respect Iraq's right to  independence and sovereignty.    Mr. Tariq 'Aziz had pointed out that in the Security Council  there is an apparent majority recognising and admitting the  distances Iraq had passed in implementing the international  resolutions. And he accused the United States as the country  inside the Security Council hindering the raising of the  blockade imposed on Iraq.    The Iraqi deputy premier reviewed the negative impact on the  people of Iraq owing to the obstinacy of some countries in  maintaining the blockade and said children and women and elderly  people were dying because of the severe shortage of medicine.</p>

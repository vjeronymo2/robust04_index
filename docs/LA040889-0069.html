			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE ASKS COURT TO DECLARE REFINERY A 'PUBLIC NUISANCE'  </P> <P> The city of Torrance, alleging the "potential for a massive disaster" at the  Mobil Oil Corp. refinery, filed suit Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court  seeking to have the refinery declared a public nuisance and giving the city  authority to regulate it.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that an uncontrolled release of acutely toxic hydrofluoric  acid from the refinery could threaten the lives or health of hundreds of  thousands of South Bay residents.  </P> <P> Torrance, in its 40-page complaint, asked the court to declare the facility a  nuisance, issue an injunction barring Mobil from polluting the air with the  acid and other toxic chemicals and order the company to operate the refinery  safely.  </P> <P> Torrance officials did not specify what action the city might take as a result  of such a court order. Mayor Katy Geissert said the city might force Mobil to  stop using hydrofluoric acid if the court gives Torrance such authority.  </P> <P> Mobil officials had not seen the lawsuit late Friday and refused to comment on  its specific allegations. Spokesman Mark Cohen said the legal action was  expected and "we will defend ourselves against it."  </P> <P> Torrance City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson said he does not underestimate the legal  resources at Mobil's disposal. "This doesn't scare me. This doesn't scare the  City Council. We honestly think there is a safety problem," Nelson said.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt that they could completely overwhelm us, but we think we  have a good case and I have a lot of faith in the judicial system."  </P> <P> The lawsuit signals that Torrance does not accept Mobil's repeated assurances  that the facility is operating safely. It also is designed to protect the city  from being sued by Mobil for regulating the refinery, or by the public should  an accident occur, city officials said privately.  </P> <P> It represents the latest step by the City Council to respond to a series of  explosions, fires and accidents that have claimed three lives and caused more  than a dozen serious injuries at Mobil since 1987. The suit alleges that there  are "severe problems with safety conditions and procedures at the refinery."  </P> <P> Nelson suggested that a month ago, Exxon would have argued to Alaskan fishermen  that a massive oil spill in the pristine waters of the Prince William Sound  could not occur.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Human Error' Feared  </P> <P> "Yet it happened because of human error," Nelson said.  </P> <P> The city's lawsuit contends that a November, 1987, explosion and fire at the  Mobil refinery was caused by human error. An estimated 100 pounds of  hydrofluoric acid was released during the explosion, but authorities said none  escaped the refinery grounds and no one was injured by the release.  </P> <P> "The potential for human error exists at the (Mobil) refinery and if one of the  more devastating mistakes were made, we could have a really serious disaster,"  Nelson said.  </P> <P> "This is not your modern refinery," Nelson said. "This is an old refinery  across the street from people's homes and a quarter-mile from schools. It is  not in the backwoods of Louisiana or the plains of Midland, Tex."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Are Concerned'  </P> <P> Cohen rejected the lawsuit's contention that Mobil is operating the refinery in  a "callous and indifferent" manner. "We are concerned about the safety of our  employees and the safety of the people of Torrance," he said.  </P> <P> The Mobil spokesman noted that the oil company "recently submitted a risk  management prevention plan to the city of Torrance which shows the risks  associated with our use of hydrofluoric acid to be insignificant. We plan to  prove this in court."  </P> <P> But in the lawsuit, Torrance alleges that the risk management plan released by  Mobil last month contains "glaring deficiencies," including the complete  omission of a "worst-case scenario" of the life and health impacts of a  hydrofluoric acid release.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that "if a 1,000-gallon release occurred at the refinery,  hundreds of thousands of persons could be killed and double that number could  be severely injured."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cloud Hugs Ground  </P> <P> Industry-sponsored tests conducted in the Nevada desert in 1986 showed that the  release of 1,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid forms a toxic gas cloud that hugs  the ground and moves with the wind. The tests showed that the gas could be  lethal to all exposed within five miles and immediately dangerous to the life  and health of those within a 7 1/2-mile radius. An estimated 29,000 gallons of  acid is stored at the refinery.  </P> <P> Mobil refinery Manager Wyman D. Robb, who was named in the complaint, has  estimated that it could cost $100 million to convert the refinery to use  sulfuric acid instead of hydrofluoric acid to boost the octane of unleaded  gasoline. Mobil is the only major Southern California refinery that uses  hydrofluoric acid.  </P> <P> Robb has said sulfuric acid has its hazards because much greater quantities are  needed, which means more rail and truck transport. The sulfuric acid process is  more costly and, unlike hydrofluoric acid, produces toxic wastes, he has said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that a hydrofluoric acid accident at the Mobil facility  could lead to "a disaster of Bhopal-like proportions."  </P> <P> More than 3,000 people died and tens of thousands of others were injured when a  different chemical, methyl isocyanate, leaked from a Union Carbide plant in  Bhopal, India, in December, 1984. Chemical experts say hydrofluoric acid is as  toxic as methyl isocyanate.  </P> <P> As Torrance officials have learned more about the refinery, council members  have become concerned that the city could be liable for damages in an accident.  Geissert said the lawsuit proves the city wants to protect the public.  </P> <P> The suit "puts on the record that we are mightily concerned about the potential  for a catastrophic event," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Initiative Campaign  </P> <P> The lawsuit caps a week that saw Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker launch an  initiative campaign to qualify for the city ballot a measure that would  effectively ban the use of hydrofluoric acid at the refinery.  </P> <P> Council colleagues have denounced Walker's ballot measure as a self-serving  move to advance the councilman's political career and instead filed the  lawsuit.  </P> <P> The lawsuit retraces the history of 127 incidents at Mobil since December,  1979, when three people were killed, including a passing motorist, in an  explosion and fire at a Mobil tank farm.  </P> <P> "The mere frequency of such incidents, many of which are attributable to human  error, indicates severe problems with safety conditions and procedures at the  refinery," the suit said.  </P> <P> The suit also alleges that Mobil does not have adequate emergency equipment to  contain an uncontrollable release and has failed to respond to the city's  inquiries about emergency preparedness  </P></p>

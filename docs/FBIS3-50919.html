			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>   [Text] The ruling parties' alliance failed because it is  made up of parties that have united for "electoral" purposes  with the sole objective of grabbing a slice of the "government  pie", said Ernesto "Toro" Perez Balladares, presidential  candidate for the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party  (PRD).    Perez Balladares said the ruling parties have no interest in  meeting the people's needs. On the contrary, the only thing  that unites them is their desire to continue taking advantage of  public finances.    "We don't lose any sleep over alliances because we are  interested in sharing our government platform with political  parties and organized groups that are interested in serving the  people," the PRD leader said.    The PRD presidential candidate made those statements  yesterday during a morning radio talk show hosted by radio  commentator and journalist Mario Velasquez.    Perez Balladares recalled that alliances were created by  former liberal leaders to oppose the candidacy of former  president Arnulfo Arias Madrid.    "One party would split into many groups to get more  representatives at the polling table, thus making it true that  whoever counted the votes would decide who wins," he added.    Regarding the role that the Christian Democratic Party (PDC)  will play in the May 1994 elections, Perez Balladares said the  Christian Democrats turned out to be a failure because they are  not fit to rule, only "to be among the fallen" opposition.    Referring to the Papa Egoro Party and Ruben Blades'  candidacy, the PRD leader said Blades is a capable man with good  intentions but he lacks political experience. "They are on the  right track. They have a meaningful movement that is critical  of the status quo, but they lack political realism," he added.    Regarding the renegotiation of military bases proposed by  Ruben Carles, Perez Balladares said such a negotiation is  unnecessary, because the U.S. people are not even interested in  remaining in Panama.</p>

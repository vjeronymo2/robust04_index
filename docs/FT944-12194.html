			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iron ore recovery forecast Iron ore prices have reached their nadir, and should begin to edge up next year, according to a study released by Sydney-based AME Mineral Economics. It suggests a nominal one per cent increase in benchmark prices for fines in 1995, followed by rises of 5 and 6 per cent in the next two years. This would reverse the trend of the past three years - when prices fell by 4.9 per cent, 11 per cent and then 9.5 per cent. AME also suggests that there is potential for a more significant upswing in the price of premium lump ore, where supply constraints are tighter. Here, AME sees a rise of 4 per cent price in 1995, followed by 5 per cent in 1996. The study argues that two factors will have a major bearing on world iron ore prices. The first is the decreasing dependance of Australian on its traditional Japanese customers, which could begin to undermine the annual globalised setting of iron ore prices through contract negotiations with the Japanese steel mills. The second is the premium placed on high-grade lump ore, which is favoured by many large steelworks. Looking further forward, AME sees a gloomy future for the sector. Fast-growing Asian demand should sustain iron ore producers through to about 2005, it says. 'In the longer-term, however, Asian regional requirements may not be sufficient to counterbalance increasing efficiency in steelmaking, new technologies and the structural decline in traditional highly industrialised markets.' Turning to the supply side of the equation, AME says: 'Although some high-grade deposits in Australia and Brazil are nearing exhaustion and their production rates will decrease, there are sufficient known reserves in every case not only to maintain but to increase production.'</p>

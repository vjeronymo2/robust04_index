			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Observer: Yankees Americans don't have the same sort of hang-ups about choosing their chairmen of the Federal Reserve. Indeed it is hard to imagine the circumstances in which a Rockefeller, or the boss of J P Morgan or Goldman Sachs, for example, would be regarded as in the running to head the US central bank. Americans are worried by concentrations of financial fire-power and bend over backwards to avoid conflicts of interest. Hence professional bankers, like the UK's Sir David Scholey, are ruled out. Instead, Fed chairmen tend to come from a much wider background. They know their way around Washington, and have often made their name as academics. William McChesney Martin, by far the longest serving Fed chairman, first made his mark as head of the New York Stock Exchange. Arthur Burns was president of the Council of Economic Advisers before Nixon tapped him for the Fed. Paul Volcker worked at Chase Manhattan before moving into the US Treasury. Today's chairman Alan Greenspan is another economist who headed the CEA. Even so, the system of choosing Fed chairmen is far from foolproof. Jimmy Carter, for instance. made a mistake when he picked Bill Miller, the chief executive of Textron. Miller only lasted 17 months and was shunted over to be US treasury secretary in 1979 after he failed to stop US inflation taking off.</p>

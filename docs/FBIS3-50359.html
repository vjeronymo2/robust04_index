			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Jozef Huebel </F> in Warsaw on 24 January: "There Are No Contradictions; We Just  Do Not Know"]    [Text] On the occasion of the visit by Slovak  President Michal Kovac to Poland on 25-27 January, Polish  President Lech Walesa answered four questions from SME via our  collaborator in Warsaw, STV correspondent Jozef Huebel.    [Huebel] Mr. President, there are many unsolved problems  between Poland and Slovakia: We have only nine border  crossings, while there were 40 of them before the war. Slovak  korunas cannot be legally exchanged in Polish banks and, vice  versa, your zlotys cannot be exchanged in Slovak banks. Neither  the "Carpathian Euroregion" nor the "Tatras Euroregion" projects  have made any progress. A joint Polish-Slovak bank still does  not exist, and signatures are also missing on the treaty on  prevention of double taxation and protection of investments. We  have not correlated our customs policy. When are these problems  going to be solved?    [Walesa] I said once that, by the year 2000, Poland will  remove all borders that separate our country from its neighbors.  The border should be marked only by good directional signs and  computers so that every traveler can choose the best alternative  route for the remainder of his trip. I am doing everything in  my power so that no border stands between us by the year 2000.  Only, we must even our standards by then. People are like  communicating vessels: If there is a difference in levels, a  Niagara Falls forms. He who has seen them knows how the water  thunders, falls heavily, and finally shatters. If the levels  match, however, there is no movement, and it is completely safe.  That is one of the reasons we should well consider our  differences, so that we can reach this safety. If we even up  wages, prices, standards, roads, and computers, our unification  will be so fast we will not even notice it. Therefore, let us  collaborate to even up the standards of our communities, and the  border will not be needed.    [Huebel] I will ask a somewhat unpleasant question now: Why  do the representatives of our countries--Poland and  Slovakia--meet so infrequently? After all, the Slovak Republic  has been here for more than a year, you have not come for an  official visit, the Polish prime minister has not been there,  either, and this visit by President Kovac is the first  significant visit in our mutual relations. Will that be amended?    [Walesa] Yes, of course. I have said many times that both  you and we have numerous domestic problems now and are engrossed  in them. It has to be kept in mind, however, that we are  building an economic and legal structure, and the presidents and  the other officials have so many worries that they do not have  time for anything else. We will try to rectify this, but we can  manage only if we succeed in solving our problems. We will then  have time also for "external" issues.    [Huebel] Mr. President, would it not be possible to use  precisely the Polish-Slovak cooperation as an example to the  West that something exists here and that the Visegrad Group has  good prospects because of this cooperation?    [Walesa] Of course, I take it! The situation calls for  this. It calls for our initiating something. It calls for our  relations to be the best, better than between other nations.  Again, however, it must be done. There is no doubt that the  politicians and the leaders understand each other. We really  get along well and speak as in a single voice. On the other  hand, we have no idea of technical, ministerial, and directorial  solutions--i.e., of a technical concept how to do all of this.  Unfortunately, so far we have not found a method to accelerate  it all. There are no contradictions; we just do not know.    [Huebel] The stability of our region and the success of the  cooperation of the Visegrad Four depends to a great degree on  Hungarian-Slovak relations. How do you feel about the problem  of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia and the "Gabcikovo" issue?    [Walesa] This problem is here to stay. If the process of  European integration were faster, this problem would not exist.  That is because the European principles and various treaties  state that everyone has the right to freedom and his  characteristic features--but within the borders of integral  Europe. Under such circumstances, no one would attempt a  division, even if certain groups wanted to preserve their  specific features, but, as I say, in a single house! Because  these attempts at agglomeration are not very successful, new  attempts at division ensue. Therefore, I believe that we will  be able to enter Europe together, rather than go on subdividing.  These partitions are not necessary.</p>

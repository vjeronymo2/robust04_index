			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Daimler denies it may link with DAF DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicles maker in which British Aerospace holds a 16 per cent stake, will today disclose significant losses for the first half of 1992, although lower than in the corresponding period a year ago. The latest financial setback, which has driven the DAF share price to a record low in recent days, comes amid mounting speculation in The Netherlands that the group is holding discussions with Daimler-Benz, which could possibly lead to the German automotive and aerospace group taking an equity stake in DAF. Dutch television said last night Daimler-Benz was considering taking a substantial minority stake in DAF, and that an eventual full takeover was not ruled out. A spokesman for Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz and the world's biggest truck maker, denied the Dutch TV report and said no talks were going on at present with DAF. DAF, which is expected to repeat today that it is still interested in collaboration with other commercial vehicle makers, refused to comment on the Dutch TV report last night. A spokesman said, 'We always talk to everyone in this business. That is the nature of the automotive industry, but we do not comment on speculation.' The AP-Dow Jones news agency reported last night that an unnamed senior official from the Industriebond FNV, a Dutch union confederation had confirmed that DAF and Daimler-Benz had 'been talking very seriously for some time'. DAF plunged deeper into loss last year with a net deficit of Fl 394.5m (Dollars 212m) compared with a loss of Fl 228m a year earlier. It has been hit hard by the severity of the recession in the UK, its main market, where truck sales have fallen to the lowest level since the early 1950s. The group said last month that it was close to completing negotiations to secure loans of Fl 200m from a Dutch and a Belgian bank in an effort to strengthen its balance sheet.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commenting on Security Council Resolution 904  condemning the Hebron massacre, a Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] official  spokesman stated the following:    Once again, the United States of America confirms its  position that is hostile to our Palestinian people and nation  through its absolute bias in favor of the Zionist entity.  Security Council Resolution 904 exemplifies this U.S. tendency,  established by consecutive administrations in the White House.    Following lengthy discussions and a U.S. delay, the Security  Council issued a resolution carefully drafted by the United  States. As a result, it lacks any real material or political  value that can end the policy of murder and massacre directed by  the Zionist enemy against our people. The resolution satisfies  the Zionist desire to deny any of our people's rights in their  land and even avoids the minimum level of previous resolutions  relating to the Palestinians of the 1967 occupied territory.  Resolution 904 considered that part of Palestinian territory as  merely disputed territory.    The PFLP-GC spokesman adds: After three weeks of watering  down, the U.S. [as heard] Security Council adopted a resolution  designed to absorb the wave of anger that swept through the Arab  and Muslim arenas, while at the same time practically  encouraging the Zionist settlers to commit further massacres.  While the resolution condemns the massacre, and urges the  Zionist entity to take measures to ensure the safety of  Palestinian civilians, it ignores the fact that the Zionist  entity's measures and policies are the arms of the settlers and  the canopy that protects their Nazism.    We in the PFLP-GC feel that the U.S. [as heard] Security  Council resolution confirms the following facts:    a. The United States is only an ally of the Zionist entity  and cannot in any way be a fair mediator or partner.    b. The double standards policy is now governing  international resolutions in view of the U.S. hegemony over it  and its various standards. While the Security Council denies  our people the right to enjoy armed international protection  that would guarantee their safety and security from the  massacres of the occupation, we see the same council allowing  itself to interfere in the affairs of an independent, sovereign  state. Under the pretext of protecting the Kurds in Iraq, it  sends troops for reasons that have become very well known.    c. A host of events that preceded the Madrid-Oslo-Washington  course and which were part of the settlement process confirmed  that the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement has encouraged the occupation  soldiers and settlers to go even further in their disdain of our  people and their rights.    d. Those who welcomed Security Council 904 and considered it  a moral and political achievement for the Palestinian people  worked in collaboration with the Clinton administration on  drafting this resolution in order to escape their crisis and  circumvent the position of our masses, who believe the  negotiations and their continuation represent treachery against  our people and our homeland.    h. As we declare our rejection of Resolution 904, we stress  that the real decision is our people's response, awareness, and  rejection of all maneuvers and deceptions that aim at continuing  the negotiations and entrench the occupation. This is what our  people are exercising through their escalating intifadah, which  has confirmed the depth of their faith in the inevitability of  victory and their understanding of the conflict's nature and  reality.    We pledge to continue the revolution until the liberation of  land and man.    [Signed] The PFLP-GC</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD Unemployment Report: Risk to democracy and world trading system The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has laboured hard for two years to produce its jobs report. And the document that was presented to the press and public yesterday is just the tip of the iceberg of its efforts. Some 50 pages long, it makes a deliberate attempt to avoid economic jargon. Perhaps because of this, it goes some way to making clear just how dangerous and damaging the current high levels of joblessness are in the industrialised nations. The organisation says that 35m unemployed in the 24 nations covered in the report 'represents an enormous waste of human resources, reflects an important amount of inefficiency in economic systems and causes a disturbing degree of social distress.' Underemployment in the form of involuntary part-time work, short time working and the discouragement of job seekers from looking for new employment could add 40 to 50 per cent to the jobless total. 'Today's unemployment is causing damage in ways that cannot be measured by the sheer numbers,' the report says. 'It brings with it unravelling of the social fabric, including a loss of authority of the democratic system and it risks resulting in the disintegration of the international trading system.' Although the report ducks the issue of a link between unemployment and crime, it notes that unemployment is associated with health problems, lowers self esteem, is demotivating and creates insecurity and resistance to organisational and technical change. The central problem, according to the OECD, is an insufficient capacity among the industrialised nations to adapt to change. This must be rectified if the OECD member countries are to overcome the jobless problem. The study makes clear that Europe's weak employment growth but high productivity and the US experience of creating large numbers of low skilled, low productivity jobs over the past two decades are two sides of the same coin. Neither pattern of job creation is desirable. Only Japan has adjusted relatively well to such changes as globalisation and the spread of new technologies but it too is now having to deal with substantial problems. The OECD stresses that Europe faces a much more difficult task than the US or Japan. Europe has to deal with rigid labour markets, a failure to encourage entrepreneurship and private sector jobs, and social security systems that in many cases hamper the creation of new jobs. Most European countries also have a poor record in the high-tech industries. Although Germany and Sweden, along with Japan, are considered leaders on the use of information technologies for advanced manufacturing, most European countries have failed to increase the share of production and exports taken by high tech products. On this score, Japan has been well ahead, creating a 4 per cent increase in manufacturing employment in the 1970s and 1980s. US manufacturing employment increased 1.5 per cent over the same period while in the European Union countries it fell by a fifth. At first sight, the UK appears to have boosted its comparative advantage in high tech products But this reflected a fall in Britain's market share for low and medium tech products in the 1980s and not growth in its sales of high tech products. The importance of adapting to new technologies explains why there is great emphasis on improving skills and life-time learning in the OECD's long list of policy recommendations. In this way, people can adapt to six or more job changes in a working life. The report sets out to slay some misconceptions and the idea that there are any quick fixes. There is no evidence that technological change is destroying jobs. The idea of 'jobless growth', popular a couple of years ago, seems wrong. It also takes issue with the idea that imports from low wage countries in Asia are responsible for much of today's unemployment. 'In practice, most of the competition in OECD countries comes not from low-wage countries but from the OECD countries themselves.' The OECD's message is that change will have to be promoted throughout its member economies and societies to overcome unemployment. There can be no taboo areas: social security systems and labour markets and some cherished rights will have to come under review. The report notes at one point that: 'To many, change is wrenching.' But in his introduction, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary general, observes that trying to slow the pace of change 'would only make delayed adjustment more painful'.</p>

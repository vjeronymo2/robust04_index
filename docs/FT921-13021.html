			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Observer: Blacked puddin' As always, Rabbie Burns had a phrase for it: 'The De'il's awa wi' th'Exciseman'. But prime haggis-exporter John MacSween didn't pause to quote the bard, an exciseman himself, on hearing that US customs had blacked a consignment of best sheep's stomach stuffed with offal and oatmeal, as unfit for human consumption. 'I think it's damn ignorance,' growled the managing director of Charles MacSween and Son, of Edinburgh. Alas, it is not only in the US that officialdom is denying expatriate Scots their authentic haggis for Burns Night on Saturday. A consignment to Tokyo was even seized and burnt. While MacSween sees that as political - reflecting Japanese distaste for imports generally, rather than for the great chieftain o' the puddin' race in particular - food regulations specifically exclude it from Australia and New Zealand. And while Switzerland will admit portions of up to 2 kilos, Italy won't bite at all. It is the transatlantic ban, however, that most irks the Edinburgh exporter, who claims US policy is inconsistent. Packages air-freighted to Boston have been let in without a glance; so was 20 kilos taken to New York as hand-baggage, passing through not only customs but the airport X-ray machine without a hiccup.</p>

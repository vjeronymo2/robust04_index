			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Dark cloud of devaluation gathers over Mexico: Stephen Fidler and Damian Fraser examine an issue increasingly preoccupying business and government DESPITE THE broad and widely-applauded economic reforms of the government of President Carlos Salinas, concern about a devaluation over the next two years is growing among Mexican bankers, businessmen and - though loath to admit it - government officials. 'I've a lot of clients in the US and elsewhere and all they are talking about is the exchange rate, the exchange rate, the exchange rate,' says Mr Jonathan Heath, who heads Macroeconomia Asesoria, one of Mexico City's largest private economic consulting firms. The reason is an expanding current account deficit, widely forecast to rise to Dollars 27bn (Pounds 19bn) this year (about 8 per cent of gross domestic product) from an estimated Dollars 21.5bn in 1992. Imports have been growing at 24 per cent a year since 1989; the figure for exports is 7 per cent. Unlike in the early 1980s the problem is not the government running a budget deficit, but the private sector. It is, nonetheless, a potential government problem. The current account deficit is expanding even as economic growth is slowing, from 3.6 per cent in 1991 to an estimated 2.7 per cent last year. The government has to keep interest rates high and the budget in surplus to ensure that capital continues to flow into the country to finance the deficit, a policy that is further slowing growth and partly explains recent declines in the stockmarket. For now the flows are continuing. However, a significant proportion - an estimated third to a half - is unstable capital. Mexican and foreign investors are switching funds out of dollars to invest in Mexican Treasury bills, local currency deposits and other short-term funding to take advantage of interest differentials between the US and Mexico. 'The cost of current policy is that Mexico is very vulnerable to capital flows. The picture can change in less than 30 days,' says Mr Heath. Some economists think the government would be well advised to devalue the currency sooner rather than later - the usual suggested figure is by 10 to 20 per cent - in an atmosphere of calm, rather than risk a crisis next year when Mr Salinas steps down. Mr Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a private consultant based in Mexico City, thinks that if the currency is devalued early, accompanied by further structural reforms, then Mexico could again enter a virtuous cycle and the government would no longer be so vulnerable to capital flows. It would also allow interest rates to fall and government spending to increase, giving growth a push. The government made an unexpected change in exchange rate policy last October. It switched from a pre-set daily devaluation against the dollar equivalent to 2.4 per cent a year, to an exchange rate target range which widens daily. If the peso falls to its lowest permitted point, the new policy would permit a 9 per cent depreciation of the peso this year. Government officials say that under pressure they would widen the target band to allow for a faster depreciation. But Mr Ramirez reckons this could be the worst of all worlds: higher interest rates would be needed to compensate investors for increasing exchange rate uncertainty, without removing the threat of a devaluation. However, the idea of a steep devaluation faces strong opposition, led by Mr Pedro Aspe, finance minister, in the Mexican cabinet. 'It would be like committing suicide because you're afraid of death,' said one senior official last week. He said a devaluation would probably be reflected in higher inflation rather than increased competitiveness, and rejected claims that the size of the current account deficit suggested a weakness in the economy. On the contrary, he argued, the government's economic reforms had resulted in a faster and deeper structural adjustment in manufacturing industry than expected. But this had meant that more old factories were being closed - indicating a swifter depreciation of existing capital stock - and had raised demand for new investment (and imports). The structural adjustment, by increasing productivity, should be worth a 10 per cent devaluation in terms of competitiveness and, once completed, should allow the economy to grow at an annual 5 per cent rather than 3 per cent, the official said. However, some observers think the government's resistance to devaluation has much more to do with politics than with economics. 'Politics aside, a devaluation would be a good thing economically,' says Mr Heath. 'Politically, it would be a disaster: nearly every Mexican devaluation has been accompanied by the resignation of the finance minister and central bank governor.' Mexican public opinion, moreover, is not sensitive directly to increased interest rates because people have little access to credit or mortgages. On the other hand, opinion is more sensitive to inflation, since only a minority has access to interest-bearing bank accounts to cushion its effects. Furthermore, a devaluation would damage the annual pact between government, labour and business which had trade unions agreeing to keep wage rises below 10 per cent this year. Devaluation to make Mexican goods more competitive might also harm efforts to get the North American Free Trade Agreement ratified by the US Congress this year. Indeed, Nafta is the key from the government's point of view. With the uncertainty about its ratification removed, more direct investment would be expected to flow into Mexico, bolstering confidence and providing an anchor for more short-term capital. If Nafta were called off, the shock would make a devaluation all but inevitable.</p>

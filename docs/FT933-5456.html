			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Security groups plan prison bids THE ANNOUNCEMENT by Michael Howard, home secretary, that the management of a further 10 prisons is to be contracted out to the private sector won widespread plaudits yesterday from companies hoping to win a share of the new business. Three contracts have so far been put out to tender, with one - for Strangeways prison in Manchester - being won by the in-house team. That means that only two prisons are currently managed by the private sector. The new privatisations were regarded as long overdue by businesses that have invested significant resources in building up capacity to run prisons and prison escort services. Group 4 is spending Pounds 900,000 a year on maintaining a development team to bid for contracts, according to Mr Jim Harrower, the UK chief executive. So far the private security company has won the contracts to run the Wolds remand prison on Humberside and to provide prison escort services in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside. The company gained notoriety earlier this year after four of its customers escaped during the first days of the prison escort contract. Group 4 has done much to prepare for the new prison work. It has recruited high-ranking staff from the public sector to manage its operations, including Mr Charles Erickson, a senior executive from the Home Office, Mr Walter MacGowan, a former governor of Strangeways, and Mr Michael Hirst, former chief constable of Leicestershire. The other company running a British prison is UK Detention Services, which has been managing Blakenhurst, a new medium-security local prison in Hereford and Worcester, since May. UKDS is a consortium formed by two construction companies, Sir Robert MacAlpine and John Mowlem, and the Corrections Corporation of America, the largest provider of private prison services in the US. Mr Roger Sainsbury of Mowlem welcomed yesterday's announcement by the home secretary that the design and building of two future prisons would be put out to tender with the management. Another company hoping to win a share of the new contracts is ManCare, a wholly owned subsidiary of the French company Sodexho, which runs five prisons in France. ManCare was formed in March to bid for private prison work in the UK. Its director of prisons is Mr Roger Kendrick, who served as governor of several prisons in the UK, including Brixton, Dartmoor and Pentonville. He was director of security and operations in Northern Ireland during the 1980s. Securicor, the private security company, plans to form a consortium with a construction company and merchant bank to bid for contracts to finance, build and manage prisons. Construction companies such as Wimpey and Tarmac also said they would be interested in bidding for the contracts to build future privatised prisons.</p>

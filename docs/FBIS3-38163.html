Cetin said a "joint delegation" will go to Serdest [as  received] village, in Iran, where allegedly civilians were hit.    He was speaking to an A.A. reporter in Davos where he was  attending the World Economic Forum meetings.    He said he held two telephone conversations with his Iranian  counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati on Saturday on the issue, adding  he has reassured the latter that the strike was not directed  against Iranian territory.    "According to Turkish military officials no harm should have  been done in the region, but necessary action will be taken if  it is determined by the committee that nine were killed and 19  wounded," he said.    He said Iran has not asked for any compensation, but if  there  is such a case of civilians killed, Iran should be compensated.</p>

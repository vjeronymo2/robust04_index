			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Bush hopes buoyed by US growth PRESIDENT George Bush drew solace yesterday from official figures indicating the US economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent in the third quarter, a more robust performance than expected, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. Mr Bush hailed the figures as 'encouraging for the American people'. It was the 'sixth straight quarter' of growth following a contraction in the winter and spring of last year. The figures were the best economic news in months for Mr Bush, but may be too late to alter the pessimism over jobs and living standards that has played into the hands of Governor Bill Clinton, Democratic frontrunner. Financial markets shrugged off the figures in the belief that they gave an exaggerated impression of the economy's underlying strength. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 8.38 at 3,235.73. Bond prices rose, mainly in reaction to a report indicating that consumer confidence fell again this month. Analysts said the growth figures reflected an unsustainable pace of consumer spending, which grew at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent against a 0.1 per cent fall in the previous quarter. The turnaround partly reflected a sharp fall in the personal savings rate to 4.5 per cent. Doubts about personal spending grew after a report showed the fourth consecutive monthly decline in consumer confidence. The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its confidence index fell four points to 53.0, its lowest reading since February and about half the level in a healthy recovery. The increase in gross domestic product was sufficient to raise output above the previous peak reached in the autumn of 1990, prompting some economists to claim that a 'real' recovery was at last under way. Most forecasters had expected growth of about 1.5 per cent at an annual rate. Growth was spurred by strong business equipment investment, which grew at an annual rate of 8.5 per cent, higher defence spending, and a rebuilding of corporate inventories.

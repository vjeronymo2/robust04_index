			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, chief of the PLO </F> Information Department, by Faridah al-Shubashi; place and date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-Rabbuh] The Palestinian leadership held a  meeting last night to discuss the results of the massacre in the  holy Ibrahimi Mosque. The Palestinian leadership believes that  the decisions made by the Israeli Government do not meet the  minimum requirements under these circumstances for the  resumption of the talks. These decisions are an insult to the  blood of the Palestinian martyrs and encourage the settlers and  their gangs to continue their hostile acts against the  Palestinian people, as well as their daily violations and  crimes. This stand has been communicated to all concerned  parties. We do not believe that the talks can be held while  this serious and explosive situation is being ignored. This  situation is caused by the settlers' acts and crimes in the  Palestinian territory. The Israeli Government should put an end  to the role of the settlers' and their activities. They also  should put an end to the presence of a number of settlements in  Gaza and the West Bank, particularly in Hebron -- where Qiryat  Arba' represents a hotbed of terrorist and criminal activities  against the Palestinian masses.    [Al-Shubashi] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said  today that the Palestinians do not have any option other than  that of returning to the negotiations with Israel. He added  that the Israeli Government has taken firm measures to avert  violence, assassinations, and attempts to wreck the peace  process, although the entire world has seen footage of the  settlers attending Goldstein's funeral ceremony, in which he was  deemed a hero and a martyr.    ['Abd-Rabbuh] The real option before us and before all those  who want to achieve peace is to end the role of settlers in the  Palestinian territories. We cannot conceive of a peace  agreement at a time when there is an additional army of  terrorists and killers engaged in the perpetration of the most  heinous crimes on the Palestinian territories, and enjoying the  official support and protection of the Israeli Government. The  Palestinian leadership is continuing its contacts and work in  this regard. At present, we are working to ensure the passage  of a UN Security Council resolution providing for international  protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories. Such a resolution must also condemn the settlers'  activities, and deem their presence illegal as established by  previous resolutions issued by the UN Security Council. These  demands currently constitute the required guarantee for reaching  a peace agreement, and indeed, for implementing the peace  agreement on the ground. Consequently, the option raised at  present is that of providing the requirements of true peace, the  requirements that would help achieve such peace. Broad sectors  of the world community are aware that it is impossible to  achieve coexistence, and to create circumstances conducive to  peace as long as settlements exist and as long as the time bomb  called settlers and their armed groups remain.    [Al-Shubashi] Does this mean that the choice will also be a  diplomatic one? Peres said your only option is to resume the  negotiations, and you are saying that the other option is to  mobilize world public opinion or to contact the world following  this massacre to support the Palestinians. What about the U.S.  stand?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] In the next two days, we will dispatch an  envoy  to Washington to discuss all these matters with the U.S.  Administration. The issue is not about resuming talks just to  show that the peace process is continuing. What is required is  to link the resumption of talks with effective measures to stop  this cancer, because the presence of settlers undermines peace  opportunities. Both issues -- the settlements and the resumption  and success of the talks -- have become intertwined.    The option is not only a diplomatic one. In order to protect  themselves -- and given the protection provided by the Israeli  occupation forces to the settlements' activities and role -- the  Palestinians now have the right to carry weapons to defend  themselves. Within this context, we call for a large-scale Arab  and friendly campaign to support the Palestinian people in the  occupied territory, particularly since the Israeli Government's  decisions, which include some individual and limited measures  against a few number of the settlers just to throw dust in the  eyes, also include measures to maintain the siege and collective  punishment against all the Palestinian people in the Palestinian  territory. This means the continuation of the starvation war  and comprehensive terrorism. The victims are punished  collectively, individual or light measures are being taken  against some criminals only to avoid crisis and strong reactions  by world public opinion.    [Al-Shubashi] Has the Palestinian leadership accepted  President Clinton's invitation to resume the talks with Israel  next week, as has been reported?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] I have said that we will send an envoy to  Washington to explain our stand, a second envoy to Moscow, and a  third to some European countries to explain that there is more  to the issue than resuming the talks. The important issue is  that it is impossible to ensure the success of the talks when  there is a time bomb jeopardizing them -- the presence of  settlers, their daily acts of sabotage, and the threat they pose  to the lives of Palestinians.    [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Mr. Yasir.    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank you.</p>

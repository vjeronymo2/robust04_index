			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / European leaders pledge to make EC more open EUROPEAN Community leaders last night agreed to give a new look to the EC, pledging to make it more open and democratic to recapture the confidence of ordinary European citizens. The blueprint was portrayed as vital to win popular and parliamentary support in the UK and Denmark for ratification of the Maastricht treaty and bolster the Community image as a vehicle for economic recovery. But the one-day summit in Birmingham called by Mr John Major to address last month's convulsions in the money markets was overshadowed by Britain's increasingly serious political crisis and signs of divisions between France and her EC partners over prospects for a deal in the world trade liberalisation talks. Mr Major, chairing the meeting, was pushed on the defensive after the UK's 1 percentage point cut in interest rates. The surprise move caused some European officials to predict that it would hasten the development of a 'two-tier' Europe and make it more difficult for sterling to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism. But the summit declaration ruled out the prospect of an 'inner-core' of stronger EC economies and more federally minded countries moving at a faster pace to political and monetary union. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said everybody wanted to ratify Maastricht and put it into action without changes. Mr Major said it was confidence that we needed to restore' after the 'body-blow' delivered by the uncertainty over Maastricht and money markets turmoil. A world trade agreement which would add 'an extra Dollars 200bn in wealth every 10 years' was needed to boost confidence. Mr Major said recent EC-US talks aimed at concluding the Uruguay Round of trade talks had made 'far more progress than for a long time indeed'. But a senior French official said: 'The gap is not as narrow as they would like you to think.' The bulk of yesterday's summit was devoted to reforming the way the Community does business and selling the EC to European citizens. In a self-critical draft declaration, the Twelve pledged to make the Community more open, to respect national culture and traditions, to keep the public better informed, and to make clear that 'citizenship of the Union' brings 'our citizens additional rights and protections without in any way taking the place of their national citizenship.'

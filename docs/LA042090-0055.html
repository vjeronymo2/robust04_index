			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LISA' A SLASHER EPIC WITH A SITCOM SHEEN  </P> <P> Which is better: bad movies that are up-front about their crumminess, or bad  movies that try to cover up the sleaze with silks and polish?  </P> <P> "Lisa" (citywide) is a piece of pre-digested pathology. It's a psycho-thriller  about a 14-year-old girl who carries on an anonymous phone flirtation with a  crazed serial sex killer, a maniac who eventually gets her address and tries to  murder her mother. Forget the standard absurdities that fuel this story;  underneath it's a pretty rank, gamy fantasy. It flirts with pedophilia, sadism,  maybe even necrophilia.  </P> <P> Yet, the director, Gary Sherman, and his highly gifted cinematographer Alex  Nepomniaschy, drown the movie in TV-commercial swank, creamy colors and coy  sitcom jabber. The script has been shaped to exclude most of the blood and  guts, the slasher arias, until the last scenes.  </P> <P> The movie plays up the pubescent cuteness of the central character, pretty-pure  demure-brunette Lisa (Staci Keanan) and her giggly little chum, Wendy (Tanya  Fenmore), who has frizzy black hair and a smile wider than Annette Funicello's.  In the central scenes, Lisa and Wendy -- like the madcap teens in the old Peter  Sellers comedy, "The World of Henry Orient," tail this killer around Los  Angeles. Later, Lisa carries on a husky, honey-voiced phone seduction. The  killer listens like a coiled cat, predatory, ready to pounce.  </P> <P> This killer, Richard (D. W. Moffett), is an oddball concept, a charming,  male-mannikin Angeleno restaurant manager, who carries on candlelight  seductions of his victims as he throttles them. Newspapers call him "The  Candlelight Killer." He lives in a bare room, awash in blue light, works out,  and when he kills, he first establishes himself with a message on the answering  machine -- "I'm in the room and I'm going to kill you" -- before popping out of  the woodwork. In a way, Richard is an L.A. joke, a restaurant joke, an  answering-machine joke. A joke is what he remains.  </P> <P> "Lisa" is a modern fear-of-sex thriller -- in the "Fatal Attraction," "Blue  Velvet," "Jagged Edge" mold -- and it's plain that it was made by people who  are aware of all the complaints about slasher movies: that they're anti-female,  exploitative, drenched in cadenzas of perverse violence. Perhaps because of  this, Sherman plays up a quasi-feminist angle. His heroines, mother Katherine  (Cheryl Ladd) and daughter Lisa, live alone, without male protectors. They have  to face this ravaging seducer-slayer by themselves -- with only Mace and  cliches to defend them. They have a chummy, open relationship -- and at one  strange point, there's a scene where Lisa seems to be dangling her mother in  front of the killer, deliberately tantalizing him.  </P> <P> Katherine is an unwed mother keeping Lisa from boys because she's afraid she'll  suffer the same fate. That makes "Lisa" a cautionary tale of sorts. It suggests  that post-Baby Boom mothers, who went through the orgiastic '70s, shouldn't  repress their kids because they'll wind up carrying on phone flirtations with  serial killers. The movie toys with some provocative ideas and then muffles  them. Impish Wendy is the dark force that tempts Lisa to sexual revolt, then  she lectures her to quit. Lisa is demure and repressed, then she swears like a  spoiled-rotten brat.  </P> <P> "Lisa" left me feeling queasy and cheated -- mostly because of the dialogue,  which is the usual bright, empty TV chitchat, vacuous and thinly programmed  with giggles and zingers and everyday blah -- but also because I had the  feeling that, if the subject were done properly, it would be offensive, should  be offensive, and that to try to clean it up like this made it even more so.  </P> <P> Sherman, who co-wrote this script with Karen Clark, may be a director who  shouldn't write, or even co-write, his own scripts. He has interesting visual  ideas -- like the "behind-the-mirror" underworld he and the effects people and  Nepomniaschy conjured up in "Poltergeist 3" -- but his plots are polyethylene,  his characters are dull chrome and his ear for dialogue is glued to his TV set.  "Lisa" (rated PG-13, despite violence, sex and language) isn't ineffective.  It's shaped in the usual sadistic way that leaves some audiences howling with  blood-lust by the climax. But it's basically a nasty movie that tries to end up  nicey-nice: a house-cat of a sex-thriller that wants to claw the hell out of  you and then curl up to warm milk and velvety hugs.  </P> <P> 'LISA'  </P> <P> A United Artists presentation of a Frank Yablans production.

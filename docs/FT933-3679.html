			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Brittan tests US resolve over Gatt SIR LEON BRITTAN, the EC's chief trade negotiator, will today test whether the Clinton administration can offer new flexibility in the Gatt talks amid signs that the French campaign to re-examine the Blair House farm trade accord is making headway. European Community foreign ministers are hoping that Sir Leon can persuade his US counterparts to allow 'clarification' of certain aspects of the Blair House agreement, while avoiding a formal renegotiation. The delicate task of mollifying France while avoiding a further political crisis within the Community dominated two days of informal talks in Bilzen, east Belgium, which ended yesterday. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said France had 'psychological' difficulties with Blair House. He described French threats to veto the draft US-EC farm trade accord as 'deadly serious'. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said plans for an EC summit on October 29 to celebrate ratification of the Maastricht treaty might fail if the Community did not resolve internal disputes over the farm trade accord. Sir Leon, who attended the Saturday session, will meet Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, and Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, on his US tour. His most important talks are scheduled tomorrow, when he holds a one-to-one session with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Brussels officials said Sir Leon faced the tricky task of persuading Mr Kantor of the mutual EC/US interest in securing a Gatt deal, while also exploring whether the administration might be willing to risk the wrath of US farmers and Congress by offering some concessions to the French on Blair House. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, suggested that Sir Leon should explore whether there was room for manoeuvre on the 21 per cent reduction in the volume of subsidised exports, primarily by subtracting humanitarian food aid, processed products and existing silo stocks from the list of cuts. One idea being canvassed at the weekend meeting would be to add a separate protocol or interpretation of Blair House. This might meet some of France's reservations, while avoiding the charge that the Europeans wish formally to reopen the draft accord. Until recently, EC negotiators had hoped that the French were only bluffing in their threat to veto Blair House and that negotiations on other parts of the Gatt deal, such as market access, could proceed toward the mutually agreed deadline of December 15. At that point France could consider Blair House in the context of a comprehensive Gatt deal covering goods, services and agriculture.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel The time has come for Eurotunnel to break the impasse bedevilling its relationship with its builders. The disagreement over Pounds 1.4bn of cost over-runs has already besmirched the reputations of both parties. It is now in danger of inflicting real financial damage too. Eurotunnel's shareholders, who are unlikely to receive a dividend until the next century anyway, will be severely disadvantaged if the tunnel's opening is delayed further. With huge debts to be serviced, Eurotunnel's bankers cannot remain disinterested. Despite the heated rhetoric, the difference between the two parties may not be great. At one stage, Eurotunnel was prepared to pay Pounds 1.2bn in paper and cash. The outstanding disputed sum may be less than the revenues lost because of delays in opening. Eurotunnel would be unlikely to recoup the difference through separate litigation for damages from the contractors for late opening. It has already reduced its projected revenues for 1994 by Pounds 244m. That may yet prove too optimistic. An agreement would benefit both parties. Eurotunnel could achieve a phased opening of services and obtain operating licences faster than currently predicted. The 10 contractors, some of which are strapped for cash, would receive their money earlier. This week, Eurotunnel's shareholders can air their views at the annual general meeting. Some seem prepared to challenge their board's stance questioning whether the game is worth the candle. They are surely right to do so.</p>

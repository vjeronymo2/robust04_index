			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China and Kyrgyzstan  will start drafting a border agreement, according to separate  but similar press communiques issued by the two sides here today.    The communique, issued by the Chinese side at the end of  premier Li Peng's four-day official visit to Kyrgyzstan, says  that the two sides will continue to negotiate an early agreement  on the unsettled border issue.    Pending a resolution of the issue, both have agreed to take  steps to maintain the status quo of the border, so as to  guarantee peace and stability in the border areas, the  communique says.    Leaders of the two countries positively assessed the border  talks between the Chinese delegation and the joint delegation of  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan as well as talks  on measures of mutual troop reduction in their border areas and  confidence-building in the military field, according to the  communique.    Meanwhile, the two sides are willing to expand the scope of  bilateral cooperation in the political, economic, trade,  cultural and other fields, it says.    They have agreed to further develop their trade and economic  cooperation, including direct links at regional, provincial,  city and border area levels, the document adds.    They will work for better conditions, including improved  legal basis and economic infrastructure, for diversified forms  of this cooperation, according to the communique.    Both sides have also expressed their willingness to  strengthen cooperation in the building of a modern "silk road,"  holding that such collaboration would help expand the central  Asian nations' economic and cultural exchanges with the East as  well as with the West, the communique says.    During the visit, Premier Li had in-depth exchanges of views  with Kyrgyz President A. Akayev, Prime Minister Abbas  Dzhumagulov and Parliament leader Medetkan Sherimkulov [spelling  of name as received] on ways of furthering bilateral relations  and on regional and international issues of common concern.    The two sides have reiterated that they will strictly abide  by the five principles of peaceful co-existence and maintain a  long- term stable and friendly relationship of  mutually-beneficial cooperation, which they said is in keeping  with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and will be  conducive to peace, stability and development in Asia, the  document says.    It says that the two sides believe that the situation in  Asia- Pacific region is moving towards relaxation of tension and  stability in general, and the maintaining of peace and stability  in Asia conforms with the common interests of all countries in  the region.    Both are willing to work for the safeguarding of peace and  security in Asia in the light of its conditions and  characteristics.    Furthermore, the two sides adopt a positive attitude towards  multilateral economic cooperation in Asia, the document says.    Political stability and economic development of the central  Asian nations not only serve the fundamental interests of all  the peoples in this region, but are crucially important for  preserving peace in Asia and the world at large, the communique  says.    It also says that the Chinese Government supports  Kyrgyzstan's efforts to stabilize domestic and regional  situation and to develop the national economy.    In the communique the two sides have also agreed to continue  frequent contact between leaders of the two countries.</p>

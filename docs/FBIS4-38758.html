			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Orlov report: "Pasture Abandoned"] </F>   [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- More than 20 agricultural  enterprises in the Nizhniy Novgorod area have not carried out  sowing work this spring. Sowing is unprofitable this year,  their leaders say. Bank loans are extortionate and the state  does not buy your output.    The renaming and reorganization of kolkhozes is not saving  them from collapse. Meat and milk production is a loss-maker  under current economic conditions. For instance, the  "Ptitseprom" owes more than 10 billion rubles for mixed feed,  and poultry factories are on the point of collapse.    Requests from farmers for partial compensation for their  expenditure and for concessionary rates for energy fall on deaf  ears. The oblast administration considers its most important  task to be not to ensure stable provision of home-produced food  to the population, but to divide up the land, creating a huge  number of landowners...with spades.</p>

This was  reported to journalists by the head of a parliamentary group and  State Minister for Nationalities Sergey Shakhray.    He said Communists, Liberal-Democrats, Democrats and the  Agrarian Party voted against the debate as they felt the matter  should be settled by the president himself. "These groups are  either afraid of Dudayev, or of a controversy about the matter",  Shakhray announced.    Shakhray came out with the initiative of discussing the  matter in both houses of the Federal Assembly.</p>

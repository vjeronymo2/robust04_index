			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nigeria police has declared as illegal any  political programs outside those of the Federal Government. In  a statement in Lagos today, the inspector general of police,  Ibrahim Commassie, warned that any attempt to install another  government other than the present federal military government by  any person or group of persons, will be repelled with force.  The inspector general of police said that the federal military  government, in its genuine effort to return the country to a  democratic rule, has set in motion a program to achieve the  goal. He said the fact that the present military administration  has continued to guarantee freedom of expression, should not be  used to cause public disorder. The police therefore advised  members of the public to go about their lawful businesses as  their safety is guaranteed.    The statement added that the Nigerian police and other  security agents, are fully prepared to deal decisively with any  person or group of persons who decide to break the public peace  or stand as an obstacle to the march toward a lasting democracy.</p>

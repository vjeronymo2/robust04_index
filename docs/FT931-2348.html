			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Letter: Widely differing views on long-term effect of Budget measures on cost of pensions (1) Sir, The changes to advance corporation tax put forward in the Budget will have an effect on the return on equities. This has implications for pension funds as has been pointed out by Lex ('UK equities', March 17). It is important that this effect is not overblown: the income yield on equities will fall from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent as a result of the reduced amount of tax that will be recoverable from the Inland Revenue. However, this reduction in yield represents probably no more than 0.1 per cent or 0.2 per cent of a typical pension fund. The difference between the performance of a good investment manager and one that is not so good is often very substantially more than this and I doubt very much that actuaries will advise any significant change to be made to pension fund contributions as a result of such a small change. Indeed one would hope to see the effect of increased cash flows and the general recovery in the economy producing investment returns which would amply justify a continued investment in equities as against bonds. One can only hope that dealers in markets as a whole will take a similarly long-term view of the attraction of equities.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris (DPA) -- On Friday evening [29 April] in  Paris Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf  Scharping called for a more active European policy by the German  and the French governments. Regarding economic, monetary, and  financial policy, Germany and France "must make sure that they  switch to an economic offensive," Scharping said during a  meeting with Socialist Party Chairman Michel Rocard.    The European Union must play a bigger role, and Bonn and  Paris must coordinate their foreign and security policy more  closely. German-French friendship must be expanded. "The status  quo must not just be preserved," Scharping said.    Rocard, who enters the European election campaign as the top  candidate of the French Socialists, said that things are going  pretty well between Germany and France: "So well that one can  still do more against unemployment and for an efficient Europe."    Scharping wished Rocard, who is strinving to become French  president in 1995, "as much success as possible." So far, the  German-French relationship has "not" been determined "by party  policy constellations." "However, common thinking, common  feeling, and common values are beneficial for the development  into the future," Scharping said. Rocard paid tribute to the  SPD chairman as a "man of principles and ethics."    In view of the election successes of the neofascists in  Italy, Scharping vehemently came out in favor of a "complete  isolation" of parliamentarians and miters of right-wing  extremist and neo-fascist parties in Europe. "Any decent  person...must contribute to having neo-fascism,  xenophobia...socially and politically ostracized," Scharping  said.</p>

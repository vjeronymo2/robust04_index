			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (2): Giants with a deadly breath - Russia's smelters SOME western aluminium producers claim their survival is threatened by Russia's determination to push out exports of the metal to earn desperately-needed hard currency. Russians are also paying a high price. Conditions are so poor in some Russian aluminium smelters that the average life expectancy of their workers is only 47 years. If Russia's own anti-pollution regulations were enforced every one of its aluminium smelters would either have to close or curtail output substantially. The cost of bringing these smelters up to date - to meet western standards for emissions and efficiency - is prohibitive under present circumstances: about Dollars 6.6bn to upgrade Russia's four biggest smelters alone. Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing, for VAW Aluminium, who made this calculation, also suggests that Russia's aluminium fabricating industry requires huge sums to convert plants, originally set up to satisfy the country's defence industries, to the production of consumer products such as aluminium for cans and packaging materials. He says at least one new 700,000-tonnes-a-year hot mill is necessary, which would cost Dollars 500m and about the same amount is required for other downstream projects. Meanwhile, the aluminium industry in Russia and the rest of the Commonwealth of Independent States is crumbling. How long it can hold off near total collapse is anybody's guess. Russian bauxite mines are being depleted and most will run out by the turn of the century. More and more alumina (produced from bauxite and the raw material from which aluminium is made) is having to be imported from the west. Only half the 5.25m tonnes of alumina capacity in the CIS is based on the modern Bayer process. The rest uses Pyrogen and Nepthaline processes which are completely uneconomic. Mr Peters suggests that, as CIS energy costs are permitted to rise to world market levels (as they must do if the CIS is to meet International Monetary Fund membership requirements), most of the alumina plants will become highly uncompetitive. Alumina could be imported but the cost of shifting it across Russia from port to smelter would be as much as Dollars 400 a tonne. Russia's aluminium plants are short of spare parts, and other essential materials such as petroleum coke and pitch. Accident rates are unacceptably high. When tested with all this, one Russian plant manager grinned and said: 'You should have seen the smelters under the Communists.' He implied that managers are used to working miracles to keep plants going. Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminium Company of America, which sent an investigating team to the CIS recently, speaks of the Russian industry as 'able to produce high-quality products in ghastly operating circumstances'. The Alcoa team was impressed by the high level of education throughout the CIS smelter workforces and by some of the technology it found - arising from the former Soviet Union's willingness to provide unlimited resources for any material needed for military use. Mr Stewart Spector, a New York-based aluminium industry consultant, points out it is virtually impossible to determine the real cost of CIS aluminium. The Russians claim it averages Dollars 500 a tonne. But there has been no power rate set by the Russian government. About 2.4m tonnes of Russia's 2.9m tonnes of capacity uses hydro-electric energy. Mr Spector estimates the cost of this power is probably one mill per kwh and 'for political reasons this power will probably be subsidised and rates kept very low in future'. Wage rates are also low. 'Even if you throw in all the non-productive labour cost which is usually part of a CIS smelter operation, unit labour cost ranges from one (US) cent to two cents a lb. That's less than the wage costs in most third world countries where there are aluminium smelters.' The CIS has one of the world's biggest aluminium industries. Its total primary aluminium smelting capacity is about 3.8m tonnes while output last year was 3.25m. Estimates of last year's exports vary, but Mr Spector estimates they included well over 1.1m tonnes of aluminium of all types, most of it destined for western markets. This year the CIS target is to export 843,000 tonnes of primary aluminium and possibly 943,000 if it can find the raw materials for the extra tonnage. 'The only way CIS plants are at present able to maintain production is with the help of western trading organisations willing to assume the financial risk of bartering alumina and other raw materials in exchange for aluminium ingot,' Mr Spector suggests. The damage done by the virtual doubling of CIS exports since 1986 has placed the western industry - which is being forced to close environmentally friendly smelting capacity to make room for metal from Russia's mega-polluters - in a quandary. Dumping allegations are out of the question because the international aluminium price is set by the London Metal Exchange. The European Commission is, however, 'monitoring' the situation but the North American industry's position is summed up by Alcoa's Mr O'Neill who says: 'It would be difficult to square the principle of free markets and open world trade by asking the Russians to curtail exports.' Some western companies believe their best bet to obtain relief from Russian export pressures is to help the CIS industry to modernise its smelters (this would automatically entail some cuts in output for some years while the work was done) and to convert fabrication plants to products for the CIS's domestic market. 'The industry needs to help with the conversion of Russian fabricators to the production of peace time products they need,' says Mr Randy Reynolds, executive vice president, international, of Reynolds Metals. His company is involved in an aluminium foil project which will take molten metal from the Sayansk smelter in Siberia. This project is led by Fata, an Italian company. Reynolds is supplying technology and will sell some foil in western markets to repay loans and the rest in the CIS for food and cigarette packaging. Reynolds is also talking to the Russian navy about using prefabricated aluminium housing developed by the US group to accommodate personnel released following the end of the Cold War. The foil project was started before the Soviet Union collapsed. Mr Reynolds says: 'Of course doing business in Russia is difficult. The decision-making process is difficult - there are many laws to prevent you doing business. The central bank does not exist any more. Some of our former partners don't exist any more. But it is to Russia's advantage to see it through.' Others are not so enthusiastic. Mr O'Neill says: 'I don't know if there is a place for Alcoa in the CIS. We are not willing to sacrifice our values to do business in an unseemly way in life-threatening circumstances.' 'There is only one certainty,' suggests Mr Spector. 'CIS production will trend down over the next several years. However, there is no way of figuring just how quickly or how soon it might decline. I am left with the feeling that one day production will grind to a halt.'</p>

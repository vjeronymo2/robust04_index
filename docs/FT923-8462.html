			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Accountants agree payout ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the ac-countancy firm, is to pay up to Pounds 1.44m in compensation to shareholders in Sound Diffusion, the failed electrical equipment manufacturer to which it was auditor and adviser. The firm has agreed to offer all shareholders in Sound Diffusion 25 per cent of the value of rights exercised in a Pounds 9.94m rights issue in May 1988, seven months before the company went into receivership. Mr David Wilson, national marketing partner at Ernst &amp; Young, emphasised yesterday that the firm did not accept any liability, but felt it had a 'moral responsibility' to offer the same terms as those agreed with one shareholder in a legal action concluded last month. In early July it agreed to pay Pounds 1.35m to Tunstall Group, the security and communications equipment supplier, which bought Pounds 1.7m of Sound Diffusion shares in the rights issue. Mr Wilson said shareholders should contact Ernst &amp; Young's solicitors, McKenna &amp; Co to make their claims. Arthur Young took over as auditor to Sound Diffusion from Ernst &amp; Whinney in 1987. The two firms merged in 1989 to become Ernst &amp; Young. A Department of Trade &amp; Industry inquiry into Sound Diffusion said: 'Arthur Young either failed to identify or otherwise accepted serious defects in the company's lease accounting practices and did not adequately audit the amount receivable under finance leases.'</p>

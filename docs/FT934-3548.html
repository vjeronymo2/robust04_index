			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BSS advances 24% to Pounds 5.06m BSS Group, the heating, plumbing and process control supplier, lifted pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.06m for the six months to end-September, despite the continuing recession in construction. Turnover rose from Pounds 112.5m to Pounds 123.3m. Industrial and commercial sales rose from Pounds 74.9m to Pounds 78.5m. Mr Alan Milne, finance director, said the group had increased its market share while the overall market had fallen. Operating profit in the division rose from Pounds 5.38m to Pounds 6.88m. Sales in the domestic division, now the UK's second biggest distributor to the heating market, increased from Pounds 37.6m to Pounds 44.8m, reflecting in part the acquisition of Cadel last year. But the division fell into the red to the tune of Pounds 567,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 172,000. In July BSS put Cadel and two other recent acquisitions together to create Zenith Plumbpoint. Mr Milne said there were signs of a small upturn in the domestic division's depressed market. Overall, Mr Milne said the group had seen the bottom of its market, and profits would rise. It would continue to increase market share, improve margins and improve its domestic business. Interest payable fell from Pounds 776,000 to Pounds 515,000. Earnings per share increased from 11.4p to 12.3p, reflecting the increased number of shares in issue after last year's rights. The interim dividend is maintained at 5.75p.</p>

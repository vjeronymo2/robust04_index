			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 200,000 ANGRY CZECHS;  </P> <P> NATION'S BIGGEST PROTEST CALLS FOR END OF REGIME;  </P> <P> POLICE KEEP HANDS OFF; NO VIOLENCE  </P> <P> More than 200,000 angry demonstrators marched through downtown Prague today in  the largest protest ever against their hard-line Communist government.  </P> <P> For the first time in decades major protests involving tens of thousands of  citizens also broke out in other cities, according to state-run Czechoslovak  television. The demonstrations were peaceful.  </P> <P> The protesters met in central Wenceslas Square, then set out across town for  Hradcany Castle, the residence of President Gustav Husak, in a noisy, triumphal  procession for democracy.  </P> <P> "It's the end, Milos!" and "Jakes out!" the protesters cried, referring to  Communist Party chief Milos Jakes. They also called for free elections and  loudly supported a general strike called by students and artists for Nov. 27.  </P> <P> The march was the fourth major protest in Prague in as many days and indicated  severe trouble for the Communist government, which until recently had faced  only small demonstrations. Leaders have rejected reforms that have swept  through neighboring Communist countries in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Police did not stop the march, but they blocked bridges across the Vltava River  leading to the castle. Many demonstrators changed course and continued on to a  major plaza, Old Town Square, chanting "We are the people." Later, they  dispersed peacefully.  </P> <P> The small police presence today contrasted sharply with last Friday, when  security forces severely beat demonstrators, prompting widespread outrage.  </P> <P> "The bell tolls for you!" the crowd chanted. Some carried banners reading,  "Democracy for all" and "Red murderers to court."  </P> <P> The marchers jeered as they passed the offices of the Communist trade union  daily, Prace, crying "Are you Czechs?"  </P> <P> "Here it happened!" they yelled, as they passed the site where police beat  demonstrators on Friday. Several candles marked the spot.  </P> <P> Trolley cars rang their bells as the protesters passed, and bystanders jingled  their keys, adding to the noise.  </P> <P> In an unusual move, the state-run news agency CTK reported the demonstration  quickly and in objective language. It noted that protesters "express strong  disagreement at the action taken by riot police" on Friday. Czech television  reported 200,000 people along the path of the march.  </P> <P> Also today, students began a sit-in strike at Prague universities to protest  police attacks on demonstrators, and a Communist leader for the first time  condemned the bloody crackdown Friday.  </P> <P> East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz postponed a visit to Prague that  had been scheduled for Tuesday. And Britain summoned the Czechoslovak  ambassador to protest the police beatings of two British journalists. It called  the weekend violence "disgraceful and gratuitous."  </P> <P> In Washington today, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said of the  events Friday: "By attacking peaceful demonstrators, Czechoslovakian  authorities further damaged their credibility at home and abroad."  </P></p>

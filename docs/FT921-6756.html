			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Stock losses scandal emerges in Tokyo JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance is examining disclosures that stockbrokers manipulated losses on client portfolios to help the customers window-dress their accounts. The affair could further erode investors' faith in the Japanese stock market, which was last year hit by scandals involving brokers' links with gangsters and the payment of compensation to favoured clients. The Nikkei index rose yesterday by 52 points to 21,025.55, but securities companies' stocks fell. The ministry's probe will centre on accounting practices which have brought significant losses to some brokers, among them Cosmo Securities, a medium-sized company. Cosmo's chairman and vice-president have resigned to take responsibility for a Y36bn (Pounds 160m) loss, which has wiped out about a third of Cosmo's shareholders' capital. Daiwa Securities, one of the Big Four companies, and Yamatane Securities, another medium-sized house, have also disclosed similar disputes over portfolio losses with clients. Daiwa has settled a dispute with Tokyo Land, a leading real estate group, by paying out Y3.5bn. Yamatane is still negotiating with two clients over a claim for Y690m. Brokers say disclosure of similar cases in the next few months is inevitable, particularly with many companies closing their books at the end of the financial year in March. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, told journalists yesterday that following last year's arguments over the payment of loss compensation it was over-optimistic to think that disputes between brokers and clients had ended. The latest disclosures involve brokers transferring loss-making stock portfolios from one client to another to help the first client window-dress annual accounts. The second client accepts the portfolio in return for a fee and a guarantee that the broker will buy back the portfolio. In the past, such portfolios were transferred from one client to another, with few hiccups. By using clients with different book-closing dates, brokers could keep the network going for a long time in the hope that a recovery in stock prices would eventually pull the offending portfolio out of the red. Although such window-dressing is frowned upon by the Finance Ministry, brokers were under great pressure from clients. In some cases, they may also have felt obliged to arrange repurchase agreements because of no-loss guarantees given to the original clients. In other words, brokers window-dressed client accounts to save their own as as well as the customers' skins. However, the transactions seem to have run foul of the revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, which followed last year's scandals and which outlawed the practice of brokers' guaranteeing to buy back stock at a pre-set price. No longer could a broker promise to buy back shares  - even if the pledge only covered a short period of time when shares were parked with one client on behalf of the other. In Cosmo's case, the broker transferred a loss-making portfolio from an unnamed company to the account of Skylark, a restaurant operator. The unnamed company refused to take the securities back so Skylark sued Cosmo and settled for Y36bn compensation. According to Cosmo, the transactions were the work of an individual employee who forged papers needed to transfer the losses to Skylark. Daiwa also said its dispute involved the work of a single employee carrying out unauthorised transactions. The disclosures highlight the scale of losses suffered by investors in the Japanese stock market since shares plunged in early 1990. 'These cases are the tip of the iceberg,' said Mr Peter Tasker, research manager at the Tokyo office of Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. The total capitalisation of companies listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange has dropped from Y590,000bn at the end of 1989 to less than Y350,000bn. For smaller houses, which are operating deeply in the red because of the slump in stock exchange turnover, heavy portfolio losses may spell the end of their independent survival. The Securities Bureau of the Finance Ministry, which in the heyday of the bull market, staunchly opposed the entry of banks into the securities market is now changing tack. Seeing banks as potential saviours of loss-bound broking companies, it is considering raising from 5 per cent to 50 per cent the maximum stake a bank can hold in a securities company. Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has concluded the country's six biggest corporate groups are becoming less reliant on in-house dealings and their extensive cross-shareholdings do not lead to exclusionary business practices, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo. The findings will be presented in Washington today to a follow-up meeting for the US-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative, designed to remove 'structural' barriers to trade with Japan and cut the US-Japanese trade deficit. The corporate groupings, or keiretsu, head a list of US concerns about access to the Japanese market; it is unlikely the FTC report, based on a study of the groups' dealings in 1989, will satisfy Washington.</p>

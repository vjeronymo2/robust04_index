			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Battle for a king's crown: Leonard Barden reports on Kasparov and Short's latest game play THE body language says it all. Kasparov is perpetually restless, shifting to and fro in his chair, striding off to his rest-room, or consulting his score-sheet. Short sits stiffly, throbbing vein in his forehead, looking tense and stern. On Thursday night, when Kasparov had recovered from a dubious middle game to an endgame initiative, Short even started muttering to himself as if cursing his ill-luck. So far, the British champion has lost the first game on time in a near-winning position after Kasparov completely spoilt a decisive attack, while the second game was drawn after Short dominated the early stages. The problem is that Short is jinxed against the Russian. Since he scored his solitary tournament win over Kasparov in 1986, Nigel has met him 15 times with the dreadful outcome of four draws and 11 defeats. His frustration at such a sequence will be greater since their two games at the Savoy Theatre have featured the best positions he has had against Kasparov during the seven years. The main hope for Short on the evidence of the first two games is that so far Kasparov has played below his awesome best. He missed simple wins by his own high standards in game one, while in game two he was outplayed for the first 20 moves, with his king stranded in the centre of the board unable to castle. Still, the overall impression is that Kasparov is just slightly misfiring, like a sports car revving-up to full power. Short said before the match that he was under no pressure and could simply enjoy the game. The pressures, however, are inescapable. First, he needs a win, and soon, to convince himself that he can score against Kasparov. If he performs well, the tension of approaching the greatest upset in world championship history will mount; if he does badly, there is the constant problem of containing Kasparov's lead. Only in the final few games, if he has no chance of the title but is losing by an honourable two or three points, can he truly relax. Kasparov's situation is already more comfortable. He has added, albeit unconvincingly, a point to the cushion he enjoys as title-holder of retaining his crown in the event of a tied series. The champion is an overwhelming 5-1 on favourite with bookmakers, although spread betting firms, which effectively offer odds about the margin of victory, report that most of their clients are backing Short to lose by a narrower margin than the six or seven points over 24 games that was predicted before play began. Offboard, Channel 4, with three transmissions each playing day, has recovered from a shaky start against BBC 2's half-hour programme. The BBC has a lively commentary team, film of the rival Fide world championship in the Netherlands, and featured a splendid confrontation between Florencio Campomanes, the Fide president, and Dominic Lawson in his role of Short's Boswell. Channel 4 has exclusive access to Kasparov and Short and its longer air-time provides interesting running commentaries during play, aimed at beginners and committed chess fans. The first two games have been well attended but the crunch for The Times's optimistic seat-pricing (Pounds 20-Pounds 55, reduced from the original Pounds 45-Pounds 150) will come when the novelty wears off and especially if Short is trailing. I shall not be surprised if spectators can watch the later games for a more realistic Pounds 7 or Pounds 10, so if you are thinking about a visit to the Savoy and are deterred by the cost then wait till the second half of the match in October. The rival Fide world championship between Anatoly Karpov and Jan Timman is also under way in the Netherlands. Fide is the established world-ruling chess body supported by 130 national federations, while the PCA of Kasparov and Short is a new breakaway group. Nevertheless, Karpov v Timman is widely seen as a reserve match. Both players were soundly defeated by Short in the Fide eliminators, while the Pounds 900,000 finance for the Fide match comes solely from the Sheikh of Oman, where the second half will be played, after the Netherlands was unable to raise its half of the prize money. Kasparov rubbished the rival series at his pre-match Press conference, saying: 'I think more people will come to see us than the citizens who watch Karpov and Timman.' However, the games at Zwolle have been played to packed audiences of nearly 1,000 daily and enthusiasm is growing after a promising start by Timman, who was regarded as a no-hoper in view of his poor record against Karpov. The score is 1-1, with one draw.</p>

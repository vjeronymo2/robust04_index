			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this notice of final rulemaking action, EPA is announcing its approval of the control measures, excluding the permit limits for Purina Mills and Electron Corporation, contained in the June 7, 1993 Denver PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP and subsequent submittals noted above for their limited purpose in strengthening the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four sources/source categories were identified as contributing to the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment problem in Denver and, therefore, were targeted for control in the SIP revisions. Control measures were developed for the following area sources: residential wood combustion, street sanding and sweeping of paved streets, and mobile sources. In addition, controls reducing emissions from stationary sources were also developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reductions in the Denver PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area: (1) Colorado Regulation No. 4 which regulates residential wood burning; (2) Colorado Regulation No. 16 which sets sanding and sweeping requirements; (3) the federal tailpipe standards, which provide an ongoing benefit due to fleet turnover and Colorado Regulations 12 and 13 which were developed independently from the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP but are included because of their particulate emission reduction benefit; and (4) Colorado Regulation No. 1, which provides stationary source emission control regulations for particulates, smokes, carbon monoxide and sulfur oxides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions and their associated control measures (including available control technology) can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Denver moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area SIP (58 FR 66326). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that the control measures on which EPA is taking final action on today serve to strengthen the existing SIP by advancing the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  air quality protection goal of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted, EPA is finalizing the control measures contained in Colorado's June 7, 1993 SIP submittal and subsequent SIP submittals for the Denver PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area, excluding the permit limits for Purina Mills and Electron Corporation which will be acted on at a later date. This action is explained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 66326&hyph;66334) and associated TSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Final Action_Limited Approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document announces EPA's final action on the limited approval rulemaking proposed at 58 FR 66326. As noted elsewhere in this action, EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed action to approve the control measures for their limited purpose in strengthening the existing SIP. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation No. 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1513&hyph;1515), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for the State of Colorado.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice proposed approval of an oxygenated gasoline program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The formal SIP revisions were submitted by the State of Colorado  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on August 6, 1990 and November 27, 1992. (The November 27, 1992 revision supersedes the August 6, 1990 submission. EPA mentions the August 6, 1990 submittal as historical information. EPA is taking action on only the November 27, 1992 revision.) The revisions included amended versions of Colorado's Regulation 13. These regulatory changes were adopted by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission. A more detailed analysis of the state submittal was prepared as part of the proposed action and is contained in a TSD dated September 25, 1993, which is available from the Region VIII office listed in the Addresses section of this document. Other specific requirements of the oxygenated gasoline program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the proposed rulemaking and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

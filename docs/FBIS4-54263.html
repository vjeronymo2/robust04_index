			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh AKP May 26 -- Malaysia is supplying  munitions to Cambodia to enable government troops to launch a  major offensive to finally crush the Khmer Rouge, THE NATION  quoted an Asian diplomat as saying.    He said he believes Malaysia has already "arranged large  quantities" of munitions for Phnom Penh, in preparation for an  all out attack on the Khmer Rouge next month.    The diplomat said the arms build-up is proceeding despite  the  fact that Cambodian leaders and the Khmer Rouge are scheduled to  meet for peace talks in Beijing [as received] later this week.    He said that Malaysian weaponry is sophisticated and  probably  the best of all Asian countries.    Last week a grenade was thrown into the compound of the  Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh. Nobody was injured and damage  was limited.    But the attack is being linked to a report that the United  States, Australia and France, which are considering supplying  weapons to Cambodia, are pressuring Malaysia to join them.    The envoy noted that Cambodia's first and second prime  ministers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, had proposed to  King Norodom Sihanouk that a cease-fire be called for June 13.    "It is possible that government troops, with military aid  from Western countries and Malaysia, will launch a massive  attack on the Khmer Rouge in an effort to eliminate them before  the cease-fire," he said.    The three Cambodian leaders, Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen and  Chea Sim, have agreed to meet the Khmer Rouge nominal leader  Khieu Samphan in Beijing on Friday.    The meeting has been called by King Norodom Sihanouk with  the  declared objective of securing a cease in hostilities between  Phnom Penh and the guerrillas who still command large tracts of  the war- torn country.    Khieu Samphan, according to the diplomat, is scheduled to  meet King Sihanouk Wednesday in Beijing to discuss the conflict  before he meets the Cambodian premiers and National Assembly  Chairman Chea Sim on Friday.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Observer: Maude's move Meanwhile, the fates have also looked unkindly on politician Francis Maude. Only a month ago he was financial secretary at the Treasury and tipped as a coming man. Now, the 38-year-old has not only lost his parliamentary seat but is under attack for becoming a part-time adviser to the chairman of the Hongkong Bank in its battle for the Midland. Maude points out that he is not taking up the job as someone who has retired from public office on a pension. He is willy-nilly out of work, even though he prefers to call it 'involuntarily privatised'. So he has no qualms about taking sides in what's likely to be one of the most politically sensitive bid battles for a long time. He certainly knows his way around the DTI and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but insists he had no responsibility for banking matters while at the Treasury. Suggestions that his new post raises concerns about conflicts of interest are 'deeply silly', says Maude who thinks that the Hongkong Bank is a 'nice outfit'. He has been hired for his expertise in areas such as competition policy rather than for his influence with the government in power. Anyway, he needs to make some money while he plots his political comeback, and takes comfort from the fact that his old dad's political ambitions did not suffer when he took a mid-career break from the Commons in 1959. But that misses the point. His father Angus Maude stepped down voluntarily and disappeared to the other side of the world to edit the Sydney Morning Herald for a while. There must be a suspicion that young Francis has taken the first well-paid job which comes along without thinking. After all he could have gone back to being a barrister.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Speaking the language of Europe - In A Nutshell Machinery which crosses European Community borders will have to be accompanied from January 1, 1993 by instructions drawn up in the language of the country where it is to be used. Exporters have apparently been confused by the relevant EC Directive (89/392/CEE) but the European Commission has confirmed that instructions will have to be in the customer's language, according to Transtelex*, a translating company. Even if the contract between an English exporter and, say, a German exporter stipulated that the language of the contract was English, this does not absolve the exporter from having the manuals translated into German, it said. Customers could, in theory, refuse to accept delivery while customs officials could use the absence of a manual to block entry. British companies do not have a good record for providing foreign language manuals and last-minute orders to produce manuals inevitably lead to delays and to higher costs, says Peter Green, Transtelex's marketing manager. *Tel 071 381 0967.</p>

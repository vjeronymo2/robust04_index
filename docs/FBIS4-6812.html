			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said yesterday he  will contact Cambodian leaders this week to discuss border  conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia and "do my best" to  clarify any misunderstanding between the two countries.    Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong was talking to reporters  at  the end of a border inspection visit that took him to Surin, Sa  Kaeo and Chanthaburi provinces.    The Foreign Minister said the information from the  fact-finding trip was very useful and he would do his best to  resolve problems with Cambodia.    The Foreign Minister was satisfied with the role of Thai  authorities along the border, saying "they conducted themselves  in accordance with Government policy."    Sqn Ldr Prasong was briefed by senior Army commanders during  his visit to Chong Chom Pass in Surin, Khlong Luk-Poipet border  in Sa Kaeo and Saptari Pass in Chanthaburi.    He said the morale of Thai soldiers in the region was high  and they wanted to see peace along the border.    In Surin, the Foreign Minister was briefed by Maj-Gen Sanan  Maroengsit, commander of the Suranari Task Force in Buriram,  Surin, Sisaket and Ubon Ratchthani provinces.    The commander said a total of 26 artillery shells had landed  in the area and the Task Force had evidence to prove that they  were fired by Cambodian government forces.    "We have pictures to prove our point but they (Phnom Penh  troops) have steadfastly denied it," Maj-Gen Sanan told during  the briefing.    Besides, the commander added, his units had to tackle  Cambodian bandits who often crossed into Thailand to steal cars.    From there the Foreign Minister proceeded to Aranyaprathet  district in Sa Kaeo province where he was briefed by Maj-Gen  Niphon Pharannit, commander of the Burapha Task Force there.    Maj-Gen Niphon told the Foreign Minister that he had  prepared  counter measures to deal with any spillover of the fighting  between Cambodian government forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas  into Thai territory.    He pointed out that the conflict with Phnom Penh soldiers  arose particularly from the fact that they used a different map  to identify the border demarcation line.    Thailand and Cambodia use different maps to identify the  borderline, he said.    In addition, Maj-Gen Niphon added, there was the problem of  Cambodians fleeing the fighting into the province, kidnapping  and smuggling.    The Foreign Minister reiterated that the Government did not  think that the problem of Cambodians fleeing the fighting into  the province were just refugees and would be returned to their  country in a few days when the situation was safe.    He said the checkpoint between Khlong Luk and Poipet would  not be opened until fighting in Cambodia stopped to ensure the  safety of Thais entering the country.    In Chanthaburi, the Foreign Minister visited Saptari  checkpoint in Soi Dao district and met high-ranking officers of  the Chanthaburi-Trat Task Force and senior provincial  authorities including Governor Amon Ananthachai.    The governor urged the Foreign Minister to discuss the  possibility of opening temporary checkpoints to transport logs  from Cambodia.    Gem traders also sought help from the Foreign Minister to  bring back their equipment confiscated by the Khmer Rouge.    Meanwhile, fighting between the Cambodian government and the  Khmer Rouge will escalate as both sides are mobilizing their  forces in other parts of Banteay Meanchey province opposite Ta  Phraya and Aranyaprathet districts, military sources said  yesterday.    Government soldiers and the guerrillas exchanged fire early  yesterday in Thmar Puok, the sources said.    The exchange of fire broke out after the guerrillas launched  an attack with mortar and artillery shells in an attempt to  seize the Seventh Division Battalion headquarters about 20  kilometers inside Cambodia from the Thai border in Ta Phraya.    Casualties were not known.    People living near a Khmer Rouge base at Phnum Malai are  building new bunkers and repairing old ones to prepare for  possible artillery shelling from fighting in Cambodia.</p>

Sources in his close entourage said he is staying in his  countryside residence in order "to quietly, without emotions  consider what has happened and how to act".    Spokesman of the Belarusian parliament Vasiliy Vorobev  hinted  that Shushkevich would hardly agree to become the chairman of  the CIS Parliamentary Assembly, the post proposed to him by  Vladimir Shumeyko, the speaker of the Federation Council, the  upper chamber of the Russian Parliament.    The post was earlier occupied by former Russian speaker  Ruslan Khasbulatov who was arrested after the October opposition  rebellion in Moscow.    Vorobev said that the statement of Shushkevich's adviser who  said that the former leader might accept the post "reflects  mostly the personal opinion of the adviser, rather than of  Stanislav Shushkevich".    However, Vorobev said that he had not spoken with  Shushkevich  on the subject and added that it is too early to make any  predictions.</p>

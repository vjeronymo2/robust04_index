			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar] </F>   [Excerpt] "The U.S. involvement in the peace process is  weak and lacks assertiveness," Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  told French President Francois Mitterrand in a meeting last  week, according to a cable sent by Dr. Yehuda Lankry, Israel's  ambassador to France. The remarks were made in the context of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's mediation efforts  between Israel and Syria.    According to the ambassador's classified cable, Peres said  "Clinton is obviously more involved in economic issues than in  foreign policy, and Christopher cannot upstage his superior."  The foreign minister clarified through an aide that in his  meeting with Mitterrand, he had expounded on the criticism  leveled at the Americans by the Syrians. According to the aide,  Peres himself believes that the U.S. Administration "is doing  its utmost to promote the process." It should be noted that the  talk was conducted in French, Ambassador Lankry's mother tongue.  [passage omitted]</p>

Dr. Jeque took wrong, dry  [secas], and groundless stands in the course of that interview.  He went as far as to say that the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] government is placing blacks in the state apparatus  while showing hostility to coloreds.    Personally, I would prefer not to touch this issue of blacks  and coloreds, because I view all of them as Mozambicans;  however, Dr. Jeque's views force me to say something about it.    The fact is that the majority of Mozambican citizens are  black and that reality cannot be denied in any way. Hurt  whoever it may, blacks are in the majority. In view of that, it  is not and it will not be anything extraordinary to see many  blacks working in the state apparatus. The extraordinary thing  was that most officials in the state apparatus used to be  whites, Indians, and coloreds when the late President Samora  Machel headed the government and even some years after President  Joaquim Chissano had taken over that post.    Those officials were and are part of the minority in  relation  to the country's blacks, but none of them protested it. Blacks  did not have the right to say anything. Their sole spokesman  was the late President Samora Machel, who was surrounded,  dominated, and guided by the lot mentioned above. Under those  circumstances, the country promptly fell into misery because  none of them had any interest whatever in serving the Mozambican  people. Eighty percent of the Mozambican economy is in the  hands of the Indian section of society and those citizens are  only interested in helping their own people. They have no  interest in seeing the country develop. Their sole interest is  money, and part of that money is already abroad, which is of no  benefit at all to this country.    It will be a good thing for Dr. Carlos Jeque to grasp  immediately that when the Mozambican people, Africa, and the  whole world see that the majority of senior officials in the  state apparatus are blacks they are satisfied because, given  that blacks are in the majority, it is only legitimate that they  should govern the country. This is no racist view, and it is not  intended as an attack on other Mozambicans.    Dr. Carlos Jeque has a superiority complex in relation to  the  black person. If that is the case, then I am sorry for him.    It is completely unjust that a social minority should make  up  the majority of senior officials in the state apparatus. That  is unacceptable. I am only too aware that there are some (very  few) blacks who have been assimilated by the colonial government  and who regard themselves as whites. Those are the people who  continue to this day shamelessly to defend a return of  colonialism to this country.    In concrete terms, what exactly is it that Dr. Jeque wants?  Would he like whites, Indians, or coloreds to be put in the  state apparatus instead? Would he like to see a return to the  times when a Mozambican team sent abroad would be confused with  an European or Asian team because it would always be made up of  whites, Indians, and coloreds? If such a team included a black  person, that person was bound to be the bodyguard of the team's  leader. Dr. Carlos Jeque: Such situations did really happen  and should not be repeated.    By the same token, you cannot demand, for instance, that the  senior officials in the Portuguese state apparatus be black  Portuguese citizens. Neither can you demand that in the United  States, Great Britain, France, and so forth. To me, it is  absurd to deny a government of the majority.    Blacks are not racist here in Mozambique. Quite the  contrary, in fact: They are against racism. Racism was  instituted by the colonialists against our ancestors and it  lasted to the day of our independence. When blacks defend  themselves against racism today, the creators of racism turn  around and accuse blacks of being racist. They want blacks to  shut up so they can continue to stay on top and make blacks the  usual targets for racism. Blacks will never agree to that, or  they would never have fought for independence.    Mozambique's indigenous section of the population always  came  last during the entire colonial period. There were those who  dreamed that, after independence from the Portuguese, the  Indians and coloreds would take over and the blacks would  continue to occupy the same place they did before independence.  That type of dream is also in Dr. Jeque's mind. Dr. Jeque does  not wish to see a government of black people because, in his  opinion, black people have never known anything.    Our party, the Mozambique Democratic Party, Pademo, fights  and will always mercilessly fight that sort of mentality.  Today, racists are going underground and are beginning to show  their teeth. They act as though they are good people in a bid to  regain the trust they lost among the indigenous population so  they can attract votes during the elections.    Dr. Carlos Jeque has felt he has not been getting moral  support from his colleagues in the Fumo leadership and other  people because of his cynicism, vanity, and superiority complex.  That was what caused his isolation and his subsequent  resignation from his post as deputy Fumo chairman. Dr. Jeque is  a half-hidden colored armed with a colonial mentality and racism  against black persons. To me he is a dangerous Mozambican  because of his racism.    At one point in his interview, Dr. Carlos Jeque said that  "the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] had adopted an  inflexible stand because it sought to get involved in a tug of  war with another inflexible party, the government. That led to  certain less informed political parties misreading those  positions and leaning more toward Renamo."    That passage is false in its entirety. The group of eight  unarmed parties understood quite well what they were doing.  Renamo may be an armed party but it is in the opposition.  Personally, I do not see Dr. Carlos Jeque as an opposition  leader. To me Dr. Jeque is not well, health-wise. He always  looks bothered. In view of that, it would be a good thing for  him to give up on politics altogether and turn to simpler things.    My advice to those who are not satisfied with a majority  government is that they should choose some country where they  can live in happiness and leave in peace the majority government  here in Mozambique. The majority in this country does not  discriminate against, or show hostility to, the other sections  of society. Dr. Carlos Jeque's views on the excessive placement  of blacks in the state apparatus and an alleged hostile behavior  in relation to coloreds are purely and simply groundless.</p>

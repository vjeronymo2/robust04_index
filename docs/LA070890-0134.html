			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN AND WILSON SIDESTEP BUDGET CRISIS  </P> <P> Both are running campaigns touting their courageous leadership, and both have  boasted of their prowess in managing governments. But Pete Wilson and Dianne  Feinstein have sidestepped the looming state budget crisis like quarterbacks  with bad knees dodging onrushing linemen.  </P> <P> As the Legislature and governor suffer paroxysms over the politically difficult  topic of raising taxes and cutting government services, the gubernatorial  candidates have discussed their druthers only grudgingly, and in cautious  generalities.  </P> <P> Each is not quite sure that raising taxes is the way to go. Each is insistent  that cutbacks be made. And each has stubbornly refused to delineate what  cutbacks they would favor, if they were in charge -- which, of course, they  wish to be.  </P> <P> "If you're going to govern, you ought to tell people how you're going to  govern," said Assembly Ways and Means Chairman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa  Clara), who has tried to no avail to interest the candidates in the budget  crisis.  </P> <P> "I've heard nothing specific from either."  </P> <P> Republican Wilson, in an interview last week, repeatedly refused to say where  he would cut back state services -- or increase taxes -- to accommodate the  deficit.  </P> <P> "In the first place, I am not in charge," he said in response to persistent  questioning. "We have a governor who is in charge and what he needs is not  advice -- he needs votes."  </P> <P> The senator backed away from a call by Republican Sen. Ken Maddy, a Wilson  supporter, for a $729-million tax increase that would form the basis of a  budget-balancing agreement.  </P> <P> "I am very, very skeptical," Wilson said. "I'd like to see the spending cuts."  </P> <P> Wilson dodged a query about whether he was suggesting that it was possible to  resolve the $3.6-billion deficit by cuts alone -- without tax increases.  </P> <P> "I think that you will see, I hope next week, a resolution of that," he said,  adding, "I hope that they will be successful. They're running out of time."  </P> <P> Like Wilson, Feinstein has focused little public attention on the troublesome  issue of tax increases and cutbacks. Her involvement in the budget deficit  crisis has been limited to a quick visit to Sacramento on June 14, during which  she visited in private with Democratic lawmakers and emerged to say she was  prepared to act as an informal adviser.  </P> <P> She said then that she was "not entirely" supportive of a package then making  the rounds that would have increased taxes by $2.3 billion and staved off the  rest of the deficit in budget cuts.  </P> <P> "My general thrust is you've got to cut wherever you can, and I think you then  have to reassess the situation," she said.  </P> <P> Asked about specific targets, Feinstein said, "I'll say more on that later."  </P> <P> But her spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, now says it is "unlikely" that Feinstein  will endorse any specific moves.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a moot issue," she said, referring to the fact that the state  crisis must be solved before the November election. "That's what we elect these  people to do."  </P> <P> Myers said Feinstein could not be specific because as a candidate she was  operating in a "universe of limited information."  </P> <P> "She's not privy to all of the insider information," Myers said. "We don't have  the resources of the Assembly Office of Research and the budget office.  Preparing a state budget is a broad and complex task."  </P> <P> But Vasconcellos said each of the candidates has been offered all the budget  information available. "That's an excuse, not a response," he said.  </P> <P> The only candidate to offer a budget plan this political season was Atty. Gen.  John K. Van de Kamp, and his resounding loss to Feinstein in the Democratic  primary may offer a clue to why neither of the remaining two candidates has  stepped forward with specific solutions.  </P> <P> "Given the result in my race, perhaps that's the best politics," he said wryly.  </P> <P> But Van de Kamp drew a distinction between the kind of negative political  fallout that greeted Walter Mondale's 1984 statement that taxes might have to  be raised and the impact a specific statement on state budgetary matters would  have on Wilson and Feinstein.  </P> <P> "I don't think I got hurt on the issue," he said. "I don't think this would  hurt either one of them very much."  </P> <P> "It would be valuable to have both candidates say something about it and give  us an idea how they would behave," he added. "It's just too easy to say it's  none of our business and we don't have control."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, who proclaimed without much hyperbole that he had been more  specific about budgetary matters than any gubernatorial candidate in memory,  proposed boosting the state's top tax rates from 9.3% to 11% for those making  more than $100,000 a year. All together, he detailed almost $2.3 billion in new  revenues.  </P> <P> The attorney general also suggested more than $1.3 billion in budget cutbacks,  chiefly by making a 5% cut in state administrative costs and restoring the  $1.3-billion budget reserve over two years rather than one year.  </P> <P> To be sure, Van de Kamp's plan was criticized as unworkable by some legislators  skeptical of its chance of passage, and the attorney general himself  acknowledges that neither Wilson nor Feinstein can directly affect the state  budget choices this year.  </P> <P> While dancing around budget specifics, both remaining candidates are trying to  gauge the impact of the sharpening state and national debate over how to cut  budget deficits, a discussion which is increasingly bipartisan. In addition to  Republican Maddy's call for increased state taxes, President Bush recently was  forced to abandon his campaign promise that he would not raise taxes and concur  that some increases are necessary.  </P> <P> Wilson insists that the matter will not hurt him, despite the fact that he  could be in the position of voting on federal tax increases at the same time  that he is labeling Feinstein a "tax-and-spend Democrat."  </P> <P> Voters, he said, "don't have any trouble" equating Democrats with taxation.  </P> <P> But at the same time, Wilson drew a distinction between increased income taxes  -- which he said he does not support -- and increases in fees. The semantic  difference has traditionally been one emphasized by politicians faced with dire  fiscal realities.  </P> <P> Feinstein's spokeswoman Myers reflected general Democratic thought that the  break in Republican ranks over taxes will take the issue away from GOP  candidates.  </P> <P> "It muddies up the issue," she said. "There's a sense with the Bush thing in  particular that while the Republicans run around promising not to raise taxes,  when push comes to shove they're probably going to raise taxes anyway."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Puppet Traitor's Ballad of National Division"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  invited South Korean businessmen to a party Friday and drivelled  that "fantastic view of reunification should be discarded,"  talking about the fictitious "North's desire to communize the  South," "manufacturing of nuclear weapons" and the like,  according to a radio report from Seoul.    His jargon is an unpardonable criminal utterance of inciting  confrontation and disivion between the North and the South and  an open challenge to the 70 million fellow countrymen ardently  aspiring after the independent and peaceful reunification of the  country.    His remarks are a ruse to justify the schemes for division  and confrontation and a desperate attempt to calm down the  fighting spirit of the South Korean people against him and  bridge over the catastrophic crisis of the "civilian regime" by  diverting elsewhere their attention.    This time the traitor let out a string of rubbish about  "harmony between labor and capital," "industrial peace" and so  on. It is, after all, nothing but a crafty jugglery to hush up  South Korean workers who have turned out in the struggle for  their existence, unable to eke out their livelihood any longer  in the worst living position due to the colonial dependent  economy.    The fact tells that unless the South Korean people  resolutely  break with such traitors as Kim Yong-sam, their independent  demand and democratic rights cannot be guaranteed and the peace  and peaceful reunification of the country cannot be realized.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam must step down at an early date as  demanded by the people.</p>

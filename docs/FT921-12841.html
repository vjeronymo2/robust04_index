			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian palm oil growth levels off MALAYSIAN PALM oil production grew to 6.14m tonnes last year from 6.1m tonnes a year earlier, a rise of 0.7 per cent, according to the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority. With slow output growth being outpaced by demand the country's stockpile was reduced to 683,000 tonnes at the end of December, from 719,000 tonnes a year ago. The latest figure tends to confirm that Malaysian palm oil production is levelling off. Nearly a decade of dramatic expansion ended with a leap in 1989 of 1m tonnes, or 20 per cent, to 6.06m tonnes. The official forecast for this year's output is 6.3m tonnes. The spot month crude palm oil price on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange is currently about MDollars 910 (Pounds 190) a tonne, little changed from a year ago. Traders are predicting that prices will fall in the spring when the seasonal monsoon flood recedes and full harvest returns. To help sustain production and promote exports, the Malaysian government announced late last month its decision to push forward a Dollars 500m (MDollars 1.35bn) export credit programme. This is intended to support immediate deliveries of up to 1.5m tonnes, or nearly a quarter of current domestic production, which represent the minimum needs of six countries. China, India, Pakistan and Russia, the four largest importers, are entitled to draw on Dollars 100m each, and Egypt and Iraq Dollars 50m each. In bilateral payment agreements, domestic exporters will be paid by the local central bank, buyers abroad will pay their banks for remittance to Malaysia. Last July, the former Soviet Union requested from Malaysia Dollars 200m in official credit in order to revive imports, which were affected by local financial difficulties and had fallen sharply.</p>

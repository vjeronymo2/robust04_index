			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lumber prices back on increase AFTER a brief summer lull, North American lumber prices have again begun to soar, with strict timber cutting limitations in US and Canadian pacific forests promising to collide with rising demand in the US home building sector. Traders and timber interests expected the Clinton administration to find solutions to the forest impasse this year. However, there now appears to be only a slim chance there will be any easing in US timber cutting restrictions. Meanwhile, demand for lumber for homebuilding is rising. Historically low interest rates inspired a 21 per cent jump in new home sales in the US in September, with housing starts also climbing. US builders are completing new homes at a rate of 1.162m units a year, up from 1.128m a year ago. Rebuilding after the Midwest floods has added to that demand, and an unusually strong fall construction season has left lumber wholesalers short on inventory. The result has been a 30 per cent rise in western wood prices since August, with some analysts forecasting rallies as dramatic as the panic-driven surge that sent Chicago futures to a peak of Dollars 493.50 last March. The January futures contract easily surpassed the Dollars 400 per 1,000 board feet benchmark on Monday, and is nearly Dollars 100 above its high for all of 1992. Cash prices for western spruce 2 x 4s are also rising, although so far they have stayed below the spring high of Dollars 475. However, lumber analysts caution that prices for wood from alternative sources have already inflated, leaving little slack in the cash markets. Prices for construction dimension southern pine topped Dollars 495 last week, well above the March high of Dollars 435. Mr Laurie Cater, editor of Madison's Canadian Lumber Reporter, said Canadian wood stocks, always viewed as a limitless back-up to US forest output, are nowadays less available because of provincial restrictions on timber cutting in environmentally sensitive areas. Mr Cater and other analysts say the recent rise in lumber futures prices has been exaggerated by speculation. However, the supply and demand imbalance is real. Ms Evadna Lynn, senior forest products analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said total lumber supply in the US would be down 4 per cent this year, including a 2 per cent decline in lumber imports from Canada. Meanwhile, she said, US demand for lumber would rise from 5 per cent to 7 per cent. 'Obviously we have a very tight inventory situation,' she said. Last spring's lumber rally added about Dollars 5,000 to the cost of building an average home in the US, and builders are already building in the lumber mark-up in their new home prices.</p>

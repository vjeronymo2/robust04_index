			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER LOSES YANKEE ROLE IN GAMBLING INQUIRY  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner was forced to resign as general partner of the New York  Yankees on Monday by baseball Commissioner Fay T. Vincent, all but ending his  turbulent reign as the team's owner.  </P> <P> The agreement came following a daylong meeting in Vincent's office and was the  result of a four-month investigation by the commissioner into Steinbrenner's  dealing with self-described gambler Howard Spira.  </P> <P> "Mr. Steinbrenner will have no further involvement in the management of the New  York Yankees or in the day-to-day operations of that club," Vincent said in  announcing the decision.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner must resign as general partner by Aug. 20, when someone will be  appointed to take his place, subject to the approval of Vincent and the other  major league teams.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, however, will be allowed to consult on major business decisions  involving the Yankees. But he must ask Vincent's permission to attend games.  </P> <P> "For all purposes, Mr. Steinbrenner agrees that he is to be treated as if he  had been placed on the permanent ineligible list," Vincent said.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner also agreed not to contest the decision in court.  </P> <P> The news spread quickly through Yankee Stadium, where New York played Detroit.  Fans greeted the announcement with a 90-second standing ovation.  </P> <P> "I will not comment on the decision," Steinbrenner said. "I'm very happy it was  resolved. I'm very satisfied with the resolution, and that's all I'm going to  say."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, one of the most controversial figures in baseball history, is the  only owner to be severely penalized twice for major offenses. He was suspended  in 1974 by then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for making illegal campaign  contributions to Richard M. Nixon.  </P> <P> This time, Vincent disciplined Steinbrenner for violating Rule 21, otherwise  knows as the "best interests of baseball" clause.  </P> <P> The investigation centered on Steinbrenner's $40,000 payment to Spira, a  31-year-old New Yorker who describes himself as a former gambler and a former  employee of the David M. Winfield Foundation. The commissioner wanted to know  why Steinbrenner gave the money to Spira.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner testified before Vincent on July 5 and July 6 and gave various  reasons for the payment. Among them were that he was afraid Spira would attack  his family, that he gave Spira the money "out of the goodness of my heart" and  that he wanted to protect two former Yankees employees from embarrassing  revelations.  </P> <P> "I hope this sad episode is now over," Vincent said.  </P> <P> This was the second straight summer baseball penalized one of its more famous  characters. Last August, Pete Rose was banned for life for gambling.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner's 18-year tenure as principal owner of the Yankees has been  peppered with disciplinary action by the commissioner's office.  </P> <P> He has been fined several times, most recently on July 5 when Vincent docked  him $25,000 for tampering with Winfield in the days after his May 11 trade to  the California Angels. The Yankees also were ordered to pay the Angels  $200,000.  </P> <P> On Nov. 27, 1974, Kuhn suspended Steinbrenner for two years following his  guilty plea to felony violations of the federal election law. Steinbrenner was  reinstated on March 1, 1976, for good behavior, but former Yankees employees  have said recently that Steinbrenner violated terms of that suspension.  </P></p>

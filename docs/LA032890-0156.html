			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STOCK GAINERS, LOSERS NEAR EVEN; DOW UP  </P> <P> The stock market was mixed today in a meandering trading session as traders  studied a slightly stronger-than-expected reading on the state of the economy.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.75 to 2,743.69.  </P> <P> But declining issues slightly outpaced advances on the New York Stock Exchange,  with 700 up, 720 down and 552 unchanged..  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 142.30 million shares, against 131.61 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index gained .37 to 187.77.  </P> <P> Many investors stood on the sidelines, unconvinced that Tuesday's big 29.28  point gain in the Dow index marked the beginning of any solid upward market  move. A loss in Tokyo stocks also pressured blue chip stocks in New York.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at a 1.1% annual  rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year.  </P> <P> The figure was revised upward from a previous estimate of 0.9%, and came in  above most analysts' expectations.  </P> <P> Many observers viewed it as a modest new indication that the pace of business  activity seemed to be picking up slowly, reducing the chances of any  full-fledged recession.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, traders also appeared to conclude that the odds were  shifting in favor of higher interest rates in the months ahead.  </P> <P> Bond prices were lower in quiet trading early today.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 3/8 point, or $3.75 for  every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield, which rises when the  price falls, jumped to 8.50% from 8.46% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts noted that bond prices declined despite a government report today on  the gross national product indicating slow economic growth, which is usually  favorable to bonds.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the economy posted a 1.1% gain from October  through December, the slimmest quarterly advance in three years, helping slow  the increase of goods and services to just 3% in 1989.  </P> <P> "The GNP figure didn't do all that much," said Mitchell Held, chief financial  economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "We're sitting back and  waiting."  </P> <P> Bond traders are waiting for new economic indicators to be released next week,  especially a report by the nation's purchasing managers and government data on  unemployment, Held said.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term  government issues were down 3/32 point, intermediate maturities declined 1/8  point to 7/32 point, and long-term issues fell 1/4 point to 3/8 point,  according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information  service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a  $1,000 face value.  </P></p>

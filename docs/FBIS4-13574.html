			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Brij Bharadwaj] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, 8 April--Further pressure was mounted on  Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao today when several leaders of  Jammu and Kashmir, including former Chief Minister and National  Conference leader Dr. Farooq Abdullah and Pradesh [state]  Congress chief, Mr. Ghulam Rasool Kar, called on him and sought  immediate changes in the administrative set up in Jammu and  Kashmir if the political process in the State was to be  initiated.    The leaders included the Janata Dal chief of Jammu and  Kashmir, Mr. Abdul Qayaum. It may be mentioned that earlier  these leaders had refused to accompany Minister of State for  Internal Security Rajesh Pilot during his Kashmir tour because  they felt that no purpose will be served unless the  administrative set up in the State was changed to make it more  responsive.    These leaders had also submitted a memorandum to Prime  Minister seeking changes in the administrative set up including  change of Governor and top officials including Chief Secretary  and senior police officials. The appointment with Prime  Minister for Kashmiri leaders was fixed yesterday by Minister of  State for Internal Security Rajesh Pilot who also accompanies  these leaders.    It may be mentioned that while Mr. Pilot has been supporting  the demand for change, Home Minister S.B. Chavan is opposed to  any change and feels that the Governor is doing a good job and  should not be disturbed. The choice before the Prime Minister  is difficult as both groups are adamant that holding of  elections in the State which are necessary for restoring  normalcy will be possible only if the alternative suggested by  them was accepted.    Mr. Pilot is also reported to have felt enthusiastic about  the surrender of militants before him in Kupwara and large  response received at the public meeting addressed by him. He is  reported to have conveyed that in case administrative changes  are made the militancy can be given a crushing blow. He has  also suggested that for this purpose a surrender policy should  be formulated so that militants fed up with insurgency could lay  down arms.    The Minister for Internal Security is also proposing an  amendment in the Criminal Procedure Code to implement his  assurance that parents of every person taken into custody will  be informed within 48 hours after the arrest. This assurance  was earlier given by the Minister in Jammu and Kashmir, but now  he wants to enforce it throughout the country.    According to reports, the Jammu and Kashmir Governor, K.V.  Krishna Rao, is also expected here shortly to brief the Central  leaders. The Home Secretary has also had talks with the State  officials about the proposed changes in the State.    In the meantime, the leader of the Panthers Party and  convener of the conference of Kashmiri leaders in Vienna Mr.  Bhim Singh is continuing with preparations even though some  leaders including former Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah and  former Health Minister Karan Singh have expressed their  inability to attend the conference.    The details of the proposed meet were discussed today at a  lunch meeting which among others was attended by the leader of  the All Party Hurriyat Conference. They included Professor  Abdul Ghani Bhat, Justice Bahauddin Farooqi, and Mr. Abbas  Ansari. According to reports, some leaders from Jammu and  Ladakh including Mr. P. Namgyal former MP will also be going to  Vienna to take Part in the meeting.    Among the leaders who got in touch with Mr. Singh today  about  the meet was former hijacker of Indian Airlines plane Hashim  Quereshi. According to reports there are also doubts if Pakistan  Government will allow Sardar Abdul Qayum to go to Vienna to  attend the conference. There are also differences within the  Hurriyat Conference on the issue of participation as leaders  like Syed Ali Shah Gilani of Jamaat-i-Islami, Mr. Abdul Ghani  Lone of People's Party, and Mr. Shabir Shah of Jammu and Kashmir  Liberation Front will be unable to attend as they are in custody  and so far there is no move to release them to enable their  participation in the conference.    PTI adds: The Kashmir All-party Hurriyat Conference  leadership held discussions with former State Government Karan  Singh. [sentence as published]    The Hurriyat leaders said later "we exchanged ideas and  shared perceptions" with him. "Dr. Karan Singh does owe a duty  to people of Jammu and Kashmir not as a son of Maharaja, but as  a genuine and forthright seer in politics."    Confirming the meeting, the former Governor said there had  been a free and fair exchange of views. "I am not discouraged by  their views", Dr. Karan Singh added.    This also called for release of all detained Kashmiri  political leader to create a congenial atmosphere for a  dialogue. "The release of Jamaat leader Syed Ali Shah Gilani,  People's Conference Chairman, Mr. Abdul Ghani Lone and militant  chiefs Yasin Malik and Shabir Shah," Prof. Abdul Ghani said,  would "create the right atmosphere for holding of such a free  and frank dialogue."    The four leaders awaiting clearance of the Central  Government  for their proposed visit to the Austrian capital of Vienna for a  meeting of leaders from both sides of Kashmir asserted that such  a dialogue would help in solving the Kashmir issue.</p>

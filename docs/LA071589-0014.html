			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAST-FEEDING IN RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> I am appalled at Judge Richard Wells' decision in favor of Cafe Rodeo's policy  against allowing women to breast-feed their infants at their tables ("Judge  Rules for Cafe in Suit Over Breast-Feeding," Metro, June 30).  </P> <P> There is something fundamentally wrong with a society which allows smoking in  public, which medical experts agree can only be harmful to everyone involved  (the smoker and all those nearby), but does not allow breast-feeding in public,  which medical experts agree can only be beneficial to everyone involved (the  mother and child).  </P> <P> People who feel squeamish about the sight of a woman discreetly nourishing her  child in the most healthful, natural and loving manner possible should remember  that throughout history, women have nursed their children, and it is only in a  rare society that breast-feeding is not openly accepted. Most of the people who  object to the sight of nursing were probably themselves nursed as infants; up  until a few decades ago almost all children were breast-fed. Virtually all of  the great philosophers, prophets, religious leaders, military rulers,  scientists and regents through the ages were breast-fed as babies. Why should  we stop utilizing this wonderful and natural means of nourishment -- after all,  why do women have breasts?  </P> <P> JULIA GUROFF  </P> <P> Duarte  </P></p>

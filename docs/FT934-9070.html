			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Top brains 'still draining away' THE 'BRAIN DRAIN' of qualified scientists and engineers from the UK is slowing down, but migration is concentrated on the highest quality staff 'to the detriment of the UK', the Royal Society says today. Between 1984 and last year, 13.5 per cent of recently qualified British PhDs chose to leave the country - almost identical to the size of the migration between 1975 and 1985. There were small falls in the numbers of more senior staff leaving. European Union countries have gained in popularity compared with the US, suggesting closer integration of UK and Continental research. Immigration to UK research groups increased from 2.9 per cent to 4.0 per cent. The Royal Society, which produced the report jointly with the Royal Academy of Engineering, urged caution because academics leaving tended to be of the highest quality. Those leaving did so for professional reasons to take up long-term posts, while those arriving in the UK tended to be taking short-term posts. Returning British emigrants 'overwhelmingly' did so for personal rather than professional reasons. Chemistry has suffered the greatest increase in migration, with 16.2 per cent of recently qualified chemists leaving the UK between 1984 and last year, compared with 12 per cent between 1975 and 1985.

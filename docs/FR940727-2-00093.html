			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Employer proposes to make the Advances to the Master Trust in a series of payments, pursuant to a written loan agreement (the Agreement). The total amount of Advances will not exceed the aggregate account balances of the Plans' participants attributable to the GICs as of April 11, 1991, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  adjusted for interest, as follows: Commencing on the date the Employer and the Internal Revenue Service enter into a closing agreement pursuant to Internal Revenue Procedure 92&hyph;16, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  interest will be credited at the rate paid on the Interest Income Fund. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Employer represents that it wishes to enter into the proposed transaction in order to protect the Plan participants from the effects of a prolonged rehabilitation process and from any potential loss resulting from Executive Life's inability to meet its obligations under the GICs. In this regard, the Employer represents that the Plans' participants will benefit from the proposed transaction because the Advances will ensure that the participants receive 100% of the conservatorship date value of their accounts and such amounts will be available as soon as approval is received from the Internal Revenue Service and the Department. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Employer further represents that the Advances will facilitate benefit distributions, loans, hardship withdrawals and investment transfers which would not otherwise be possible because of Executive Life's suspension of payments under the GICs. The Employer also represents that the Advances will be non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur any expenses in connection with the proposed transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The balances as of April 11, 1991 consist of contributions plus interest at the contract rate, less prior withdrawals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Internal Revenue Procedure 92&hyph;16 provides for a temporary closing agreement program to settle certain tax liabilities that arise out of transactions between an employer-sponsor and the trust of a qualified defined contribution plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Employer represents that the annualized rate of return on the Interest Income Fund for the period from April 1, 1993 through March 31, 1994 was 7.35%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department notes that the exemption, if granted, will not affect the ability of a participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action against Plan fiduciaries for breaches of section 404 of ERISA in connection with any aspect of the GIC transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Repayment of the Advances under the Agreement is limited to payments made to the Master Trust by or on behalf of Executive Life, or its successor, or any other responsible third parties. No other assets of the Master Trust will be available for repayment of the Advances. If the payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Advances, the Agreement provides that the Employer will have no recourse against the Plans or the Master Trust, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plans, for the unpaid amount. To the extent the Master Trust receives GIC proceeds in excess of the total amount of the Advances, such additional amounts will be retained by the Master Trust and allocated among the accounts of the Plans' participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1) The transaction will preserve the Plans' ability to timely fund participants' benefits, including participant loans, hardship withdrawals and participant-directed investment re-allocations; (2) The Master Trust will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction; (3) Repayment of the Advances will be made only from amounts paid to the Master Trust by Executive Life, its successor, or any other third party; (4) If the payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Advances, the Employer will have no recourse against the Plans or the Master Trust, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plans, for the unpaid amount; and (5) Repayment of the Advances will be waived with respect to the amount by which the Advances exceed the amount the Master Trust receives from GIC proceeds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ms. Virginia J.

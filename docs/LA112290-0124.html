			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGESTERS: CHEERS FOR THE HOME TEAM  </P> <P> Perennial powerhouse Wilson High School of Hacienda Heights pulled out a narrow  victory in the Super Quiz of the ninth Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon  held Saturday at Gahr High School in Cerritos.  </P> <P> Wilson's last contestant was senior Michelle Ivey, whose father teaches math at  La Serna High School in Whittier.  </P> <P> Ivey answered all five of her questions correctly on the topic of astronauts  and space travel to ice her team's narrow win over West High School of  Torrance.  </P> <P> The Super Quiz, which resembles a raucous game show, is the only public segment  of the decathlon, which tests students in 10 subject areas, including science,  social studies, writing, public speaking and fine arts.  </P> <P> The team that places first in the overall competition will represent Los  Angeles County in the state competition. The victor will be announced next  Wednesday at a banquet in Montebello.  </P> <P> But all the teams are winners, said Compton teacher and team coach Nancy  Miller. "We're getting all this positive attention for academics, and it rubs  off on other students," she said.  </P> <P> Contestant Ramiro Medina of Compton said he could barely speak English six  years ago. Now he is getting straight As and competing for his school. "The  decathlon is important not just because we want to win, but for the experience.  It's helped me to become a well-rounded person," he said.  </P></p>

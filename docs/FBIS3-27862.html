Kumagai told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting that  the combination of an income tax cut and a consumption tax hike  has been the fundamental notion of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's cabinet.    "It is up to the government and the ruling parties to make  adjustments for combining the tax cut and the tax hike," he said.    Asked about the scale of income tax reduction, Kumagai said  the cut should help quicken Japan's economic recovery and  contribute to the global economy.</p>

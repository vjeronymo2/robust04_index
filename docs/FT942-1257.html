			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (13): Big decisions to be made - As the oil surplus dwindles, David Lascelles considers energy needs As Indonesia's oil surplus dwindles, the country faces increasingly large questions about its energy future. In some areas, Jakarta's policy is clear: the place vacated by oil is to be filled by other energy sources, which Indonesia fortunately has in abundance, notably liquid natural gas and coal. But in others, important decisions have still to be clarified: how are the ambitious targets for power generation to be achieved? And how is burgeoning demand for refined products to be met? Indonesia currently produces some 1.5m barrels of oil a day, of which it exports about half. But although it has managed to maintain production at this level for some years, there is little prospect of it being increased. No major new finds await development, and all the most promising and accessible areas have been well explored. Meanwhile, domestic fuel consumption is increasing at the rate of about 5 per cent a year, raising the possibility that some time early next century Indonesia will cease to have any oil to spare. Of the alternative energy sources, natural gas seems to have the brightest prospects. Already a world leader in the export of liquefied natural gas, Indonesia hopes to build on this position, but the pattern of production will change. Until now, the Aceh LNG project in northern Sumatra has been the spearhead. Although Mobil has a new offshore field with 1.5tr cubic feet of gas still to develop there, Aceh's output will begin to level off through the rest of this decade. Meanwhile, Total has made substantial gas discoveries in East Kalimantan which have opened the way for important expansion of the 20-year-old Bontang LNG plant there. A fresh round of contracts is being negotiated with utility customers in Japan, on the basis of which two more production lines will be added to Bontang bringing its capacity to 20m tonnes a year. (see separate article on this page). A question mark remains over the large gas field discovered by Exxon at Natuna in the northern offshore region of the country. The new energy minister, Ida Bagus Sudjana, halted negotiations last year, blaming the poor economics of the project. The feeling among the Jakarta oil and gas community is that its remoteness and the high carbon dioxide content of the gas deposit have weakened its chances. The outlook for coal is also good. Following the liberalisation of licensing in the 1980s, several foreign companies have launched projects, mainly in Kalimantan, including CRA, BP and BHP. This has led to a dramatic increase in production and exports which has propelled Indonesia into the position of the world's fourth largest exporter of steam coal. Production last year reached 28.6m tonnes, with exports amounting to 19mt. The expectation is that production this year will reach 33mt, with exports rising to 24mt. Most of this coal is produced from efficient open cast mines where reserves are large, warranting development plans extending several decades. In Kalimantan the coal quality is also good, with low sulphur, ash and moisture content. The question is the extent to which Indonesia will deploy these resources of gas and coal for its own domestic use. The government has an ambitious electricity programme for which it is trying to obtain private sector investment. The objective is not just capacity expansion, but a reduction of the current heavy reliance on oil for power generation. The 10 year plan aims to create some 15,000MW of new capacity, most of it coal-fired, but some also using gas. Dozens of foreign companies are chasing the business, and a number of projects have been agreed involving concerns such as British Gas and Enron, mainly drawing gas from small offshore fields in the Java Sea. But the big decisions have still to be made. 'Everyone's trying to sniff out what's happening,' says a western oil executive. 'The gas in Kalimantan and Aceh is for export,' says Mr Suyitno Patmosukismo, director general of the oil and gas directorate. 'Other concentrations will be developed for domestic use, for power generation.' An important milestone was passed in January when PLN, the state power company, struck its first electricity purchase contract with a private sector generator, showing that agreement could be reached on prices. The plant, the coal-fired Paiton plant in East Java, is a joint venture between Mission Energy, GE, Mitsui and PT Batu Hitam Perkasa, an Indonesian concern. A permanent debating point in the energy industry is the quality of investment incentives for foreign companies. This has become more critical now that Indonesia needs to stimulate a greater exploration and production programme. Last year, the government improved the profit share for companies operating in the less mature areas of eastern Indonesia and the offshore provinces: they will get 35 per cent rather than 20 per cent. But other changes reduced some of this benefit, leaving oil industry executives less than enthusiastic. A big sticking point is the government's refusal to consolidate taxation so that expenses incurred in one contract can be used to offset profits in another. Mr Suyitno says: 'There is a dialogue with the companies and we try to consider their concerns. But in the oil and gas area we do not need any more action to open our door wider.' Another potential difficulty is abandonment costs. Early contracts between Pertamina, the state oil company, and foreign contractors, omitted to specify who was responsible for removing equipment when production was finished. Foreign oil companies have taken the line that since Pertamina owns all oil industry assets, it should logically pay. Pertamina is now specifying in new contracts that foreign companies are responsible for these costs, but the question of who pays in old contracts - where millions of dollars are at stake - remains unresolved. 'According to our law and the law of the sea which Indonesia has agreed to, we have to remove it,' says Mr Suyitno. 'But the cost must be borne by the companies. We are discussing it with them.'</p>

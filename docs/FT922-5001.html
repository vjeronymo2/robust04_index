			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises on US indicators THE DOLLAR staged a recovery in late European trading on the foreign exchange markets yesterday following signs of strong US manufacturing growth last month, writes James Blitz. Potential dollar buyers grew confident after the National Association of Purchasing Management's index rose at its fastest pace in almost four years to stand at 56.3 in May from 51.3 the month before. The survey's employment index also jumped to 49.1 from 43.9 in April, its highest level since April 1989. The dollar closed at DM1.6100 in London, after a previous close of DM1.6070. However, there was still uncertainty in a number of traders' minds about the scope and pace of the US economic recovery. The April figures for personal income and consumption released yesterday were both weaker than expected. These showed a 0.1 per cent rise in personal income in April, and a 0.3 per cent rise in consumption. According to Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, yesterday's indicators may effectively add up to an ill omen. 'The real danger is the mismatch in output gains and personal consumption,' he says. 'If the increase in manufacturing output is not matched by personal consumption there will be a build-up of stocks that will lead to a cut in production in the third quarter.' Other economists believe that the market needs more time to decide whether to invest in dollars. 'The market will look at money supply figures on Thursday and the non-farm payroll on Friday,' said Mr Nick Stamenkovic, an economist at DKB International in London. 'Until we get signs of a stronger recovery the dollar will remain in narrow ranges.' Yesterday's good figures for business confidence in the US failed to restrain the dollar's losses against the Japanese yen after the Bank of Japan intervened to strengthen its currency for the fourth day running. Analysts reckon that the BoJ has spent Dollars 500m in intervention operations in the last four days, as it tries to reduce its huge trade surplus in the run up to the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in July. In late Asian trading, the BoJ pushed the dollar below Y127, its lowest level for four months. By the end of the European trading session, the dollar stood at Y127.40, after a previous close of Y127.70. The Danish krone was well underpinned as the latest polls showed that Danes will vote 'yes' in today's referendum on European economic and monetary union. The krone remained at the foot of the European Monetary System's grid, but at minus 34 per cent of allowed swing below its central Ecu rate, after Friday's close of minus 37 per cent.</p>

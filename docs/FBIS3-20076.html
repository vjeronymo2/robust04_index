			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our correspondent in Ioannina Pavlos Tsoundos  reported that the EU [European Union] foreign ministers and  their counterparts from the four countries that will join the  Union continued deliberations during a working luncheon after  the conclusion of the unofficial Council of Ministers meeting.  During a news conference by the EU presidency, it was noted  that talks on solutions to the The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia [FYROM] issue and EU enlargement entered their final  stages.    On the issue of FYROM, the initiative is now with the EU  Council of Foreign Ministers. Even though Greece's partners in  the European Union did not back down from their objections to  the countermeasures against FYROM, they did not accept a  proposal to send Greece before the European Court and now appear  to realize the reasons that forced Athens' move. Tomorrow, EU  Commissioner on Foreign Affairs Hans Van Den Broek will be in  Athens and hold talks with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Van Den Broek said that he  will not bring any message from the government of [FYROM  President] Kiro Gligorov, but he will raise the points discussed  during the unofficial Council of Ministers' meeting.    According to some information, a proposal by the foreign  minister of Luxembourg on the issue of FYROM was tabled  following Van Den Broek's report on the issue. This proposal  provided for EU guarantees that FYROM would proceed with  changing symbols and giving a binding interpretation of the  disputed articles of its Constitution to exclude offensive  designs against Greece; in return, Athens would lift the  countermeasures. EU Commission President Jacques Delors made it  clear that the issue is not under the authority of the EU  Commission but under the EU Council of Ministers, after Greece  recalled Article 224 of the Maastricht Treaty, which regards  issues of foreign security. Delors said that if the issue had  been placed on a legal basis, the EU Commission would have sent  the case to the European Court. However, this can not be done  under these circumstances, as the authority has now been placed  with the political branches of the European Union. Foreign  Minister Papoulias said that Greece's partners had indeed  criticized the countermeasures, but the climate was clearly  milder than before. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said  that the EU Commission will hold a meeting with the Greek  Government in the next few days to find a solution without the  need to take the issue to the European Court. It appears that  neither France nor Germany want to send Greece to the European  Court, as Foreign Ministers Alain Juppe and Klaus Kinkel  stressed the need for a mutual settlement of the dispute. The  only countries that seem to favor sending Greece to the European  Court are the Netherlands and Denmark. The foreign ministers of  these two countries made separate statements urging the EU  Commission to send Greece to the European Court.</p>

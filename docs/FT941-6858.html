			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Business Traveller (Travel Update): No bumping The US Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that an airline passenger bumped from an overbooked flight can sue for damages. The court denied an appeal by Northwest Airlines that a 1978 federal airline deregulation law prevents the 50,000 passengers bumped from flights each year from suing. The ruling clears the way for a trial over a Dollars 60,000 claim arising from an incident in 1986 in which a lawyer with a non-refundable, non-exchangeable ticket was bumped from a flight and then offered Dollars 198 in compensation or another flight scheduled to arrive six hours later than the original.</p>

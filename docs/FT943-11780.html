			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Standard Platforms turns in reduced loss Standard Platforms Holdings, the USM-quoted supplier of hardware and software to the document image processing and archival storage market, reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 35,640 for the six months to end-March, against Pounds 382,695. The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 865,617 to Pounds 749,995, although last year's figure included Pounds 76,475 from discontinued operations. Losses per share emerged at 0.9p (9.6p). Standard suffered from the effects of its ill-starred expansion in the US and was able to continue trading only with the support of its bankers. It had hoped to sell to US hospitals and clinics an off-the-shelf version of its optical document retrieval system. However, the expected sales never materialised, losses mounted, and the subsidiary was sold. Its shares were suspended last March at 36p pending publication of its accounts. They resumed trading at 18p in May when the company announced a Pounds 450,000 rights issue, loan stock conversion, a capital reduction, a share option scheme and board changes. The shares closed unchanged yesterday at 12p.</p>

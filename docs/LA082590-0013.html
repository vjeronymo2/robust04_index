			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATEST IN A SERIES OF TIME-SAVING DEVICES  </P> <P> Some sportscasters have started calling the Houston baseball team the 'Stros in  an effort to save time. I feel that they should extend this practice to other  teams.  </P> <P> Certainly, it takes more time to say Dodgers than 'Gers. Even more time could  be saved if the practice were extended to city names. We could hear the scores  of games involving the 'Ork 'Ets and the 'Burgh 'Ates.  </P> <P> In fact, why not use this method with the names of individuals. Think of the  time that would be saved if we turned on our radios and heard, "Hello  everybody, this is 'In 'Cully, along with 'Oss 'Orter and 'On 'Dale, bringing  you tonight's games between the 'Os 'Les 'Gers and the 'Nati 'Eds. On the mound  for the 'Gers will be 'Do 'Zuela."  </P> <P> Let's use this for the names of various statistics, too. Then 'Oss could  squeeze in even more 'istics between 'itches.  </P> <P> 'AM 'ALVA (SAM GRIJALVA)  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

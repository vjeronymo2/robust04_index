Sasaki, H. Higuchi, T. Takasaka, T. Harada, </F> T. Nakajima, and H. Okamura, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.]    [Text] The need for efficient ways to develop truck  components, which in the paper described below is an axle system  part, has resulted in a study of systematic CAE (computer-aided  engineering) approach. The aim of the study is to predict the  forces from the road acting on the axle system of a truck by  mechanical analysis, and similarly, do a structural analysis and  fatigue life analysis.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   In the early development of the automobile, new designs and  specification modifications were arrived at in the planning and  design stage by estimating the forces acting on a vehicle during  operation, and estimating the loads of component parts receiving  those forces.    That eventually made it necessary to perfect a comprehensive  method for estimating such forces by mechanical analysis CAE and  structural analysis CAE. In Figure 1, we show a flow chart of  that process. In specific terms, it means establishing a basic  structural analysis model during the initial vehicle development  stage and then creating applied models based on the intended use  of the vehicle. In this paper, we try to estimate the forces  acting on the axle system of a vehicle from the road surface  under different driving conditions, and apply those results in a  structural analysis of the axle system components in question,  and try to estimate and assess the strength and fatigue life of  those parts.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-14A></FIG>  <H5>         2. About CAE Model </H5> <H5>  2.1 CAE Application </H5>   Focusing on the front independent suspension of a compact  truck, we simulated driving over rough terrain, turning, and  braking, and also simulated driving over an irregular road  surface. Treating those results as input conditions, we assessed  the fatigue life of the system by performing a structural  analysis of the knuckles in the front independent suspension. In  Figure 2, we show a schematic drawing of the double-wishbone  front independent suspension used for the simulation. In  commercial vehicles, in particular, there is very little data  available on actual performance and knowhow because independent  suspension systems have only been around for a fairly short  time. The tough conditions under which the vehicle is used, the  many specifications, and the difficulty in testing critical  states make it hard to determine test conditions.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-15A>      Figure 2. Front Independent Suspension </FIG>    For those reasons, we did additional studies to determine  what effect the CAE method may have on improving development  efficiency.  <H5>  2.2 Structural Analysis Vehicle Model </H5>   In Figure 3, we show a structural analysis model of the  vehicle used in the simulations (double-axle rear wheel drive  cargo truck). The model used for the simulations was a full  vehicle model consisting of a frame, rear body, axles,  suspension system, tires, cab, engine, and transmission. To  analyze vehicle movement, a mechanical movement analysis  software (ADAMS and ADAMS/Tire) was used. The models used in the  simulation included a basic model prepared by a group of  specialists during the design and planning stage of the vehicle  based on a structural analysis of the solid body elements, as  well as applied models depending on the intended use of the  vehicle.[.sup](1,2)[/] Our main aim here was to do a  mechanical analysis of axle system parts, and being concerned  about computational efficiency and accuracy, we worked with a  model of the main solid body elements.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-15B>      Figure 3. Vehicle Model Produced by ADAMS </FIG>  <H5>  2.3 Mechanical Analysis Model of Axle Parts </H5>   In Figure 4, we show a mechanical analysis model of the  knuckle. For boundary conditions, we used the forces acting on  the tires obtained by mechanical analysis. For support  conditions, we used a model in which mechanical linkages are  supported simply. With this level of modeling, the initial  evaluations verified that an allowable accuracy had been  achieved based on a comparison between actual and calculated  measurements.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-15C>      Figure 4. BEM[.sup]*[/] Model and Boundary Conditions </FIG>    The analytic solving was done using SURFES (general-purpose  boundary element method),[.sup](3)[/] and the preprocessing  was done using a general-purpose CAE software (concept  station/I-DEAS). By being able to modify the shape of components  having a complex three-dimensional walled structure such as was  found in this study (e.g. making light-weight walls), we found  the boundary element method to be better at sticking  two-dimensional elements to the parts surface and easier to  study than the finite element method which has three-dimensional  solid elements. Computers are limited, however, in the number of  possible contacts, so this method is really unsuitable for large  models. In order to give direction to CAE design in the design  department,[.sup](4)[/] we found it effective to make the  analytical models as small as possible and do studies of models  having mobility.  <H5>  2.4 Assessing Fatigue Life </H5>   First, we created a mechanical analysis and structural  analysis model based on actual operating conditions of a truck  to produce a frequency drawing of the stress fluctuation stress  amplitude in order to evaluate the strength of the truck, and  following that, estimated the fatigue life of the truck based on  fatigue failure from cumulative linear wear and tear. The study  was done here based on actual operating conditions while driving  on the irregular road surface described above. A special-purpose  software known as MALIAN was used for the evaluation.  <H5>  3. CAE Simulation </H5> <H5>  3.1 Road Simulation </H5>   We compared the calculated forces acting on the tires from  the road surface derived from the mechanical analysis model with  the measurements taken from actual on-road operations. Measuring  the stress of the axle components at certain points, we used the  following conversion factor _a_[.sub]i[/] in order to find  the road surface forces acting on the tires.    conversion factor _a_[.sub]i[/] = (force acting on  tires)[.sub]i[/]/(stress values at evaluation  points)[.sub]i[/] (1)    [.sub]i[/] = up/down, right/left, and forward/backward  directions    The conversion factor was derived from actual data taken  from  bench tests performed on the axle parts.    In Figure 5, we show a comparison of the calculated and  actual forces acting on the tire from the road surface when  driving over a sinusoidal projection. Next, we discuss the  simulation of irregular road surfaces to assess the durability  of axle components. In Figure 6, we show a portion of the data  obtained by measuring the irregular road surface using a laser  displacement gauge.[.sup](6)[/] In Figure 7, we show a  comparison of the calculated and actual forces acting on the  tire from the road based on mechanical analysis using the road  surface data obtained in Figure 6, and a distribution curve  calculated from actual measurements. Figures 5 and 7 show that a  correlation exists between the two, and that the analysis model  is valid.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-16A>      Figure 5. Force Acting on Tire Driving Over Sinusoidal Projection (Actual and Calculated) </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-16B>      Figure 6. Profile of an Irregular Road Surface </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-16C>      Figure 7. Tire Force Response and Frequency Distribution </FIG>  <H5>  3.2 Stress Analysis Simulation </H5>   In Figure 8, we show a comparison of actual and calculated  stress generated at the R part of the axial root of the spindle  when driving over a sinusoidal projection. We found these to be  in virtual agreement.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-16D>      Figure 8. Stress Response at Root of Spindle </FIG>    In Figure 9 [figure not reproduced], we show a stress  analysis of the knuckle while a car is driving over an irregular  road surface. In Figure 10 [figure not reproduced], we show a  stress analysis of the knuckle while the car is being turned.  This is when maximum stress is being generated at the R part of  the axial root of the spindle. The different forces acting on  the tire from the road causes changes in the position of maximum  stress produced at the knuckle, so additional studies are needed  for each vehicle operating mode.    In Figure 11, the response data of forces acting on the tire  from the road is used to show a response time and  stress-frequency distribution curve for stress calculations at  the place where maximum stress is generated, which was found  assuming a linear alignment of forces acting on the tire.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-17A>      Figure 11. Stress Response and Frequency Distribution </FIG> <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-17B>      Figure 11. cont. </FIG>  <H5>  3.3 Simulation To Evaluate Fatigue Life </H5>   In Figure 12, we show an evaluation of fatigue life using a  stress-distribution curve for places where maximum stress is  generated while driving over an irregular road. Here, we used a  P-S-N diagram to make the evaluation based on cumulative linear  wear and tear, and degree of stress damage.[.sup](5)[/] We  used a Miner calculation to compensate for values less than the  stress limit. In the case of Figure 12, the degree of stress  damage in the knuckle is less than 1, and passes the target set.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-17C>      Figure 12. Fatigue Life Estimation Chart </FIG>  <H5>  3.4 Approaches Used for Special Conditions </H5>   In Figure 13, we show the actual and calculated results of  stress generated at the R part of the axial root of the knuckle  spindles when driving a vehicle over a sinusoidal projection,  turning, and braking quickly. A closer concurrence was obtained  with turning than with either of the other two, but this may be  because the precise tire characteristics, particularly the  rigidity along the horizontal axis and road surface , cannot  be ascertained with any degree of accuracy.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-17D>      Figure 13. Maximum/Minimum Stress at Root of Spindle </FIG>    Provided that there is linear alignment, we found that by  integrating various vehicle conditions that we could produce  accurate simulated models under dangerous and hard to verify  conditions, and even under particularly bad conditions.  <H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>   Our research into innovative ways to analyze the component  parts in development vehicles included the following:    (1) We estimated the road load acting on the components of a  moving truck by mechanical analysis, and did a structural  analysis of the parts. We tried a systematic approach to  evaluate fatigue life, and getting good results, came up with a  technology to do analysis based on CAE.    (2) We found that the application of this technology was  particularly essential in the planning stage while in  development and design, and that promoting CAE design  (structural analysis) based on expert CAE support contributed  enormously to development efficiency.    (3) In order to further improve this technology in the  future, we concluded that we need to improve how CAE is used and  build an engineering database with certain CAE models in mind.

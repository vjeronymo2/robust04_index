			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wing Kay Po] </F>   [Text] With just 12 days to go before the crucial vote on  the Governor's electoral reform proposals, Chris Patten and his  aides have plunged into a frenzy of last-minute lobbying to  persuade a handful of wavering legislators.    Enquiries by Eastern Express show there is an almost equal  split in the Legislative Council [Legco] between those who  support Patten and those who support the package of amendments  -- known as the 1994 package -- sponsored by the Liberal Party  and some independents co-ordinated by Eric Li.    Non-aligned members will be decisive in determining the  outcome of the vote.    A legislator, who did not wish to be identified, said  yesterday Patten has been personally seeing non-aligned members  to lobby them to support the electoral reform bill.    The lobbying has focused on four appointed members -- Roger  Luk, Vincent Cheng, Marvin Cheung and Martin Barrow -- who have  been heavily courted by Patten in the past two days. These four  legislators are understood to support the 1994 package. Last  night Roger Luk said he would stand firm on his support for the  watered down proposals despite lobbying by Patten. Patten is  believed to have requested breakfast with the group of  non-aligned legislators to lobby for their support.    The Liberal Party and some independent members yesterday  finalised and submitted their package of amendments to water  down the government bill which will be debated on June 29. The  main thrust of these proposals is to retain corporate voting in  functional constituencies and reduce the size of the electorates.    It is estimated that apart from the three government  officials in Legco, there are 23 legislators in the Democratic  camp who will vote for the government bill. These include the  17 United Democrats and Meeting Point members, and independents  in the Democratic camp, such as Fung Kin-kee, Christine Loh,  Anna Wu and Jimmy McGregor.    Emily Lau, a committed Democrat, is also counted as a  supporter but she said she was still considering her support as  she had put in a private member's bill for full direct elections.    Lau said there was still a "fighting chance" her bill would  be passed by Legco. She said she has secured 17 votes. Hui  Yin-fat is also believed to support Patten's bill. Simon Ip is  another possible supporter.    There are about 23 legislators who would support the 1994  package. They include the 15 Liberal Party members, and the  independents Eric Li, Elsie Tu, Samuel Wong, Roger Luk and  Vincent Cheng. Martin Barrow, Marvin Cheung and Alfred Tso are  also likely to support it.    A legislator who prefers to remain anonymous and who  supports  the 1994 package, said there would be at most 31 votes for the  watered down proposals if pro-China legislators did not abstain.  Because of the close vote, it is possible neither the  government bill nor any of the amendments will pass. If so the  status quo will be maintained.    Last night, a senior government official denied allegations  that the Government is panicking over securing enough votes for  the reform package. Among the 1994 amendments is a proposal to  set up a four-part election committee, each comprising 99  members returning 10 legislators.</p>

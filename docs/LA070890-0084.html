			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ANOTHER 4-0 ONE-HITTER IN DETROIT  </P> <P> If last weekend was the time for no-hitters, this is the weekend for  one-hitters.  </P> <P> Kevin Appier, a 22-year-old right-hander from Antelope Valley, Saturday night  made it two consecutive 4-0 one-hitters at Detroit.  </P> <P> The Kansas City rookie wasn't as close to perfect as the Tigers' Jack Morris  had been Friday night, but he turned in a magnificent performance in the  Royals' 4-0 victory.  </P> <P> Morris have given up a single to Kurt Stillwell, the second batter he faced,  then was perfect the rest of the 4-0 victory.  </P> <P> Appier, in his ninth start since joining the rotation in late May, gave up a  leadoff single to Lou Whitaker. Except for four walks, he matched Morris.  </P> <P> Stillwell didn't have the only Kansas City hit in this game, but he had the big  one. His bases-loaded single in the third inning drove in two runs and gave  Appier all he needed.  </P> <P> "It's kind of spooky to have the same kind of games two nights in a row,"  Kansas City Manager John Wathan said. "But Kevin pitched a great game. He had  all his pitches working.  </P> <P> "He didn't have the control Morris had, but otherwise he was just as great. He  has been one of our most consistent pitchers."  </P> <P> Appier has a 4-3 record, and the Royals expect big things of him. He was born  in Lancaster and went to Antelope Valley High School, Antelope Valley College  and Fresno State.  </P> <P> The Royals brought him up late last season, which he finished with a 1-4 record  and a 9.14 earned-run average, but the Royals, who had made him the ninth  player selected in the 1987 June draft, knew he was a prospect.  </P> <P> "I think I had good stuff," Appier said. "I walked some guys but, fortunately,  I worked out of those situations.  </P> <P> "I know what I did, but it hasn't hit me yet. I'm not awed. I expect so much of  myself that I'm never awed by myself. I'm a perfectionist. A lot of people in  my family are the same way."  </P> <P> Texas 7, Boston 4 -- With Mike Boddicker and Nolan Ryan on the mound at  Arlington, Tex., this game had figured to be a pitchers' duel.  </P> <P> But Boddicker (11-4), who had won 10 games in a row, couldn't make it through  the sixth inning, while Ryan made it through seven to get his 297th victory.  </P> <P> Ryan (8-4) settled after giving up three runs in the first inning. He struck  out 12.  </P> <P> Pete Incaviglia hit two home runs, and Ruben Sierra had another as the Rangers  battled back from the 3-0 deficit.  </P> <P> With Boddicker not at his best, the Red Sox lost their third game in a row, and  their lead in the East -- which was 4 1/2 games several days ago -- was cut to  a half-game over Toronto.  </P> <P> Cleveland 1, Oakland 0 -- Less than 24 hours after they had hammered seven home  runs in the second game of a doubleheader at Cleveland, the Athletics couldn't  touch Bud Black.  </P> <P> The left-hander held the predominantly right-handed-hitting A's to two singles.  He retired the first 13 and the last 11 batters he faced. During the interim,  Rickey Henderson and Carney Lansford got the hits.  </P> <P> Curt Young (4-3) also pitched well. But Chris James singled home a run in the  fourth inning, and with Black in top form, that was the game for the Indians.  </P> <P> The heart of the A's lineup -- Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and Dave Henderson --  went 0 for 10.  </P> <P> Baltimore 4, Chicago 1 -- Tim Hulett tripled in two runs, and John Mitchell  picked up his first victory in almost three years in this game at Chicago.  </P> <P> Mitchell, who had last won on Aug. 5, 1987 when he was with the New York Mets,  held the White Sox to seven hits in eight innings. Gregg Olson pitched a  perfect ninth to keep the White Sox from increasing their lead in the West.  </P> <P> Toronto 4, Seattle 2 -- With Jimmy Key returning to form and joining David  Wells and Dave Stieb to give the Blue Jays excellent pitching, Toronto seems  ready for a second-half drive.  </P> <P> Key, hit hard in his two previous starts, held the Mariners to three hits in  seven innings at Toronto, and the Blue Jays won their fifth game in a row.  </P> <P> Key gave up a two-run home run to Jeffrey Leonard in the first inning and was  almost perfect after that.  </P> <P> George Bell drove in three runs, including two on a first-inning single.  </P> <P> Duane Ward pitched two hitless innings to get his seventh save.  </P> <P> New York 5, Minnesota 4 -- Seldom-used utility infielder Wayne Tolleson singled  with two out in the 12th inning at New York, then scored the winning run on  Roberto Kelley's single to left field.

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Britten's War Requiem - Concerts in London Sunday's War Requiem, given in the Albert Hall (and broadcast live on BBC2), brought to an end Mstislav Rostropovich's mainly Barbican-based 'Festival of Britten'. In spite of passing vagaries of execution - some of them caused, it must be admitted, by the conductor's warm-hearted, imprecise beat - it has proved a resounding success: a series that seized the musical public's attention because its arrival was timely, its programming apt and its overall purpose possessed of missionary enthusiasm. It was, therefore, a particular shame that a good third of this War Requiem should have been counterpointed by the loud double-clicking sound emitted every ten seconds from the Albert Hall cupola - an electronic gremlin that was allowed to persist unchecked for an everlasting-seeming 25 minutes. The performance had set off with rapt, steady gravity, giving ample evidence of the immaculate preparation of all its forces (London Symphony Orchestra plus chamber orchestra conducted by Richard Hickox, hugely enlarged LS chorus, boy-choristers from St Paul's Cathedral). But it was lamed by the continual interruption: even when that was finally halted, the exalted atmosphere proved hard to restore. In such a case, a whole review is surely out of place; a few critical points only are permissible. This work was destined - in spirit, if not in fact - for the Albert Hall: its finest features are there emphasised and its patches of mechanical inspiration (in the Offertorium, especially) dramatically ballasted; voices solo and choral carry across the spaces with radiant, heart-lifting ease. The soloists were Makvala Kasrashvili (a shining, passionate soprano in the Vishnevskaya mould), Anthony Rolfe Johnson (who, curiously, ignored all p-markings in the 'Agnus dei') and Bryn Terfel (heroic-toned, vigorous in manner, a degree lacking in reflective eloquence).

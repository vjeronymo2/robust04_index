			<p>BFN     [Text] The Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People,  formerly the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress  of Haiti [FRAPH], has canceled their call for a strike on  Friday, 24 June. There are many reasons for this decision, the  spokesman for the Front stated. The academic year-end exams, the  deadline for the U.S. sanctions to go into effect, the fact that  the population might like to get fresh supplies, the fact that  some people, including both Haitians and foreigners, should  leave the country before the suspension of the commercial  flights scheduled for Saturday, 25 June, are among the reasons  that prompted the Front officials to withdraw their call for a  strike, according to its spokesman.</p>

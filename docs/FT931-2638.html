			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Westminster Health float gives Pounds 130m tag - Nursing home operator plans to raise Pounds 63m WESTMINSTER Health Care, the nursing home operator, is planning to raise Pounds 63m through a flotation likely to value the group at over Pounds 130m. WHC yesterday issued the pathfinder prospectus for the float, which will involve a placing with institutions and a clawback of up to 25 per cent for the public. The group is forecasting pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 1993 of Pounds 3.85m, up from Pounds 1.67m. On a pro-forma basis, taking the proceeds of the flotation into account, the pre-tax forecast is Pounds 7.94m. With a 15 per cent tax charge, and applying a multiple in line with Takare, the nearest comparable quoted company, analysts expect a market value of over Pounds 130m. Net assets after the float will be Pounds 79.5m. WHC has expanded rapidly since it was founded in 1985. It has been backed by National Medical Enterprises, a leading US health care group. NME's stake will fall below 50 per cent through the float, but neither it nor any other existing shareholders will sell shares in the float. NME promised not to sell any shares for a year afterwards. WHC and NME have a non-competition arrangement. The prospectus referred to legal proceedings against NME in the US, relating to allegations of improper and unlawful practices at its psychiatric hospitals, but says that 'these matters do not involve WHC or any of the non-executive directors nominated by NME'. WHC will have 3,236 beds in operation in 47 homes by the end of May, with another 600 beds in development and a further 300 beds planned. Mr Pat Carter, chief executive, said the market for private nursing homes is worth Pounds 2.2bn a year and there will be demand for 77,000 extra beds by the end of the century because of demographic changes. Capital expenditure is likely to be between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m a year, Mr Kent Phippen, finance director, said. The group has a Pounds 40.5m bank facility and a further Pounds 10m loan from NME. After the float it does not expect to raise further equity capital for two years. WHC's policy on interest is to capitalise it up to the day a new home opens. After that it is charged to the profit and loss account. Practices in the industry vary, with WHC more conservative than some. Pricing for the issue will be announced on March 31, with applications closing on April 8 and dealings expected to start on April 15. The public can register for a mini-prospectus from today by ringing 0500 304050. Sponsors are Barclays de Zoete Wedd and brokers are de Zoete &amp; Bevan.</p>

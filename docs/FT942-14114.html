			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Dior lifted by strong sales growth Christian Dior, the French fashion house that holds a large minority stake in the LVMH luxury goods group, yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase in net profits to FFr876m (Dollars 148m) last year from FFr803m in 1992. Mr Bernard Arnault, whose holding companies control both LVMH and Dior, said that the latter was on course for large profits growth in 1994 if it could sustain the strong sales growth shown in the first quarter. The board proposed raising the net dividend to FFr9.00 from FFr8.40. Dior, like other high fashion houses, was badly affected in the early 1990s by the downturn in the global luxury goods market. The company's net profits peaked at FFr5.3bn in 1989, two years before it went public on the Paris stock market, and then fell steadily until the increase last year. However, the pressures on the international luxury goods industry have eased recently. Dior saw sales rise by 10 per cent to FFr24.62bn in 1993 from FFr22.4bn in 1992. The rate of sales growth accelerated towards the end of last year with the upward trend continuing during the opening months of 1994. Dior's sales rose by 27 per cent in February against the same month in 1993. The old Dior fashion house last year produced a net profit of FFr116m. However, the bulk of the company's profits, about FFr760m, came from the 25 per cent stake in LVMH held through its 55 per cent tranche of its Jacques Rober subsidiary. Dior is expected soon to stage a capital increase following the complex deal negotiated earlier this year by Mr Arnault to unravel LVMH's cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks group.</p>

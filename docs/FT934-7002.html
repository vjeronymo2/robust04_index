			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Direct Line chief sells bonus for one-off Pounds 45m Mr Peter Wood, the chief executive of Direct Line, the rapidly growing insurance company owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, is about to swap a multi-million pound remuneration package for a one-off payment of about Pounds 45m. Full details will be disclosed later this week when Direct Line reports its latest figures. The payment is expected to consist of cash and shares in Royal Bank of Scotland. It is understood that Mr Wood will hold the shares for at least five years. The payment is understood to include remuneration of about Pounds 18m for this year, reflecting the rapid growth of the motor insurer in the past 12 months. Last year Mr Wood, who founded Direct Line in 1985, received a little more than Pounds 6m from his bonus contract which links his annual pay to the rate of asset growth of the insurance company. The bonus accounted for Pounds 6,014,000 of his total emoluments of Pounds 6,121,290. The deal was originally agreed in 1988 when Mr Wood sold his 25 per cent stake. The company was the UK's first telephone-based 'direct' insurer, selling motor insurance policies by telephone and has grown rapidly, specialising in the lower risk end of the market. Earlier this year it announced that it was on course to becoming the country's biggest motor insurer. Direct Line recently announced its intention to expand into the home insurance market, where it is highly critical of the commission rates charged by building societies, banks and other intermediaries. The group is also test marketing plans to sell personal loans by telephone. The company has nearly doubled the number of its motor-insurance customers to 1.25m during the past year. It employs 1,900 people in Croydon, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEWBURY PARK LETS GOOD TIMES ROLL IN 9-2 VICTORY  </P> <P> Sure, the Newbury Park High baseball team is having a good ol' time. And why  not?  </P> <P> The Panthers are unbeaten in their last 14 games. They have won all five of  their Marmonte League games. And everybody seems to be getting in on the  action.  </P> <P> It is a wonder that they are not aggravating their opponents. Nothing worse  than a bunch of guys having a good time as they dismantle you.  </P> <P> "We're out here to have fun," pitcher Tim Beal said after Newbury Park defeated  Thousand Oaks, 9-2, in a league game Wednesday at Thousand Oaks. "At least  that's the way I see it. We just can't lose that. We can't get too confident."  </P> <P> Newbury Park's success has driven Coach Gary Fabricius to quote Oklahoma  basketball Coach Billy Tubbs, of all people.  </P> <P> "Remember what Billy Tubbs said when Oklahoma was ranked first in the nation  this year?" said Fabricius, who supplied his own answer. " 'It's great.' That's  what he said. Not many teams have a chance to be here. And Newbury Park hasn't  been on top in a while."  </P> <P> It seems to be the Panthers' turn now, however. They are accomplishing it with  durable pitching, clutch hitting and with flair on the basepaths.  </P> <P> Take this game, for example.  </P> <P> Beal improved to 4-0 and completed his seventh game in eight starts. He  scattered eight hits, allowing only two after the third inning. He struck out  10, including the side in the fourth.  </P> <P> On offense, the Panthers needed only six hits to score nine times. In the first  inning, Eric Greene scored easily from third base on a wild pitch. The pitch  from Thousand Oaks starter John Bushart bounced in front of the plate, hit  catcher Jud Schlimgen in the chest and ricocheted in front of the plate.  </P> <P> In the third, Greene scored on another Bushart wild pitch. Greene and Brad  Cleveringa each scored three runs.  </P> <P> Leading, 5-2, Newbury Park (14-1-3 overall, 5-0 in league play) buried the  Lancers (8-6, 3-2) with four runs in the seventh.  </P> <P> Cleveringa drew a lead-off walk and Greene, who was three for three, singled.  Geoff Black then doubled to score two runs and Danny Madsen followed with his  fourth home run, a two-run blast to right field.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks, which stranded nine baserunners, managed a run-scoring single by  Bill Hall in the first and an RBI fielder's choice by Brian Higgins in the  second. Hall was four for four.  </P> <P> "We talked at the beginning of the year about doing whatever it takes to win,"  Fabricius said. "And they're doing what it takes right now.  </P> <P> "I don't know how to explain it, but I like it."  </P> <P> Just having a little fun.  </P></p>

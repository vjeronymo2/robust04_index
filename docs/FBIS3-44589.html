At a news  briefing, the Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said the  Government had not yet been contacted by the PWC, but he ruled  out accepting such an invitation under any circumstances.    [Begin Macleod recording] Our general stance is this: If  people in Hong Kong have questions of clarification on the bill  then, of course, they are welcome to put them and we will answer  them. That is our normal stance: If people have questions,  we'll answer the questions. But, there is no question of us  sending people up to Beijing to appear before the PWC. [end  recording]    Sir Hamish also said he expected the inflation rate to  remain  at the present level of around 8 percent during the next few  years. He said the booming economy meant that there would be a  surplus this year, despite his deficit budget, but he refused to  speculate on how big the surplus might be.    Speaking in Beijing, the head of China's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office Lu Ping said it would be a sign of noncooperation  if Hong Kong Government officials did not go to Beijing to  explain details of the airport corporation bill. He said  certain items in the bill were not clear and needed explanation  from Hong Kong officials. Mr. Lu also said Chinese nationals  born in Hong Kong will not lose their permanent residency if  they emigrate to other countries. He was speaking one day after  a senior government official warned that up to 400,000 Hong Kong  Chinese residents could lose their right of abode in the  territory. Cliff Bale has this report.    [Begin Bale recording] Principal Assistant Secretary for  Security Simon Vickels told legislators yesterday that the  setting up of strict criteria for permanent residents could mean  many Hong Kong Chinese emigrants would lose their right of abode  after 1997. Mr. Lu disputed this, saying that Chinese nationals  who return to Hong Kong after emigrating would not lose their  permanent residence, nor will they have to make an application  to return here. Mr. Lu also expressed the hope that the  criteria for non-Chinese nationals seeking permanent residence  will be kept simple. He said he welcomed people from other  countries to ensure that Hong Kong remained an international  financial center. However, Mr. Lu also said this issue would  have to be discussed further. This will be done by the Security  Sub-Group of the Preliminary Working Committee, which starts a  two-day session on Sunday. Several members have suggested that  criteria such as property ownership, the ability to speak  Cantonese, and having work or relatives in the territory should  be used to determine whether a foreigner takes Hong Kong as his  place of permanent residence. [end recording]    Mr. Lu also spoke about yesterday's invitation to government  officials to visit Beijing to explain details of the airport  corporation bill. He said that if they rejected the invitation,  it would be a sign of noncooperation. Mr. Lu also said any  final decision on the bill would rest with the airport committee  under the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group.</p>

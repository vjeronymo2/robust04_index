			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mondi waka Makhanya] </F>   [Text] A leadership tussle within the ANC's Western Cape  region has precipitated the first real confrontation in the  regional cabinet.    The skirmish between ANC ministers and premier Hernus Kriel  was the first real test for the provincial administration, with  hard words being traded publicly for the first time since the  elections.    It appears the timing for the challenge on Kriel was a ploy  to underscore the anti-National Party credentials of regional  minister of the environment Lerumo Kalako, public works minister  Leonard Ramatlakane and ANC chief whip Chris Nissen in advance  of elections at next month's crucial ANC regional congress. At  this, the trio are expected to mount a challenge to ANC regional  chairman and regional economic affairs minister Allan Boesak.  It is seen as significant that the attack on Kriel coincided  with an overseas trip by Boesak.    Boesak has his back to the wall as pressure mounts for his  replacement from elements blaming him for the ANC's poor showing  in the April election. There are indications he may step down  ahead of the regional congress to avoid the humiliation of  almost certain defeat. Should this happen he will most probably  take up an ambassadorship to Washington, a post for which he is  being considered.    Although there are several contenders for his position, the  most likely successor is health and welfare minister Ebrahim  Rassool, who has no political baggage and no major enemies.    At issue are accusations that Kriel breached protocol by not  consulting the ANC before last week's premiers' summit with  Public Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya on the issue of  provincial powers. Kalako, Ramatlakane and Nissen  unsuccessfully tried to get central government to delay  conferring powers on the Western Cape on grounds that Kriel had  violated protocol. Notably missing from the altercation was  Rassool.    The issue was resolved when -- after Boesak's return -- the  ANC accepted Kriel's explanation that the disputed ordinances  had been drawn up by central government and not himself.  Nonetheless Nissen was adamant that the skirmish had sent a  message to Kriel that he should consult.    The dispute forced Kriel to make his first public attack on  the ANC, calling on Boesak to "discipline" his troops.    Minor as it was, the dispute highlighted a debate in the ANC  about how to deal with the Kriel government. The ANC is caught  between not wanting Kriel to take too much credit for successes  of the Reconstruction and Development Programme in the region  and their insistence on its implementation. This is another  issue likely to dominate the congress as the ANC defines its  role as junior partner for the next five years.    Observers inside and outside the ANC see the challenge as a  muscle-flexing exercise, which could have only happened in  Boesak's absence.    "Various people are trying to establish themselves for  Boesak's position, and the best way do that is to show you are  not going to listen to what the Nats have to say," said an  observer.    He added: "I pray the congress does not fracture us too  much. The last thing we need is to be divided in the NP's  backyard. But the way things are going now, we might need to  call those internal stability `manne' [men] to be on standby."</p>

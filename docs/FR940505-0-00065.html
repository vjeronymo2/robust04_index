For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, if more than one class of section 2701 interest exists, the amount of the reduction is determined separately with respect to each such class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Multiple initial transfers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If an initial transferor has made more than one initial transfer, the amount of the reduction with respect to any section 2701 interest is the sum of the reductions computed under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to each such initial transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> In general <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . (i) P, an individual, holds 1,500 shares of $1,000 par value preferred stock of X corporation (bearing an annual noncumulative dividend of $100 per share that may be put to X at any time for par value) and 1,000 shares of voting common stock of X. There is no other outstanding common stock of X.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) On January 15, 1991, when the aggregate fair market value of the preferred stock is $1,500,000 and the aggregate fair market value of the common stock is $500,000, P transfers common stock to P's child. The fair market value of P's interest in X (common and preferred) immediately prior to the transfer is $2,000,000, and the section 2701 value of the preferred stock (the section 2701 interest) is zero. Neither P nor P's spouse, S, made gifts prior to 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Additional facts applicable to Examples 1 through 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . P's transfer consists of all 1,000 shares of P's common stock. With respect to the initial transfer, the amount remaining after Step 2 of the subtraction method of &sect;25.2701&hyph;3 is $2,000,000 ($2,000,000 minus zero), all of which is allocated to the transferred stock. P's aggregate taxable gifts for 1991 (including the section 2701 transfer) equal $2,500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Additional facts applicable to Examples 4 and 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . P's initial transfer consists of one-half of P's common stock. With respect to the initial transfer in this case, only $1,000,000 (one-half of the amount remaining after Step 2 of the subtraction method of &sect;25.2701&hyph;3) is allocated to the transferred stock. P's aggregate taxable gifts for 1991 (the section 2701 transfer and P's other transfers) equal $2,500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Inter vivos transfer of entire section 2701 interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . (i) On October 1, 1994, at a time when the value of P's preferred stock is $1,400,000, P transfers all of the preferred stock to P's child. In computing P's 1994 gift tax, P, as the initial transferor, is entitled to reduce the amount on which P's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a) by $1,400,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The amount of the reduction computed under paragraph (b) of this section is the lesser of $1,500,000 (the amount by which the initial transferor's taxable gifts were increased as a result of the application of section 2701 to the initial transfer) or $1,400,000 (the duplicated amount). The duplicated amount is 100 percent (the portion of the section 2701 interest subsequently transferred) times $1,400,000 (the amount by which the gift tax value of the preferred stock ($1,400,000 at the time of the subsequent transfer) exceeds zero (the section 2701 value of the preferred stock at the time of the initial transfer)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The result would be the same if the preferred stock had been held by P's parent, GM, and GM had, on October 1, 1994, transferred the preferred stock to or for the benefit of an individual other than P or an applicable family member of P. In that case, in computing the tax on P's 1994 and subsequent transfers, P would be entitled to reduce the amount on which P's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a) by $1,400,000. If the value of P's 1994 gifts is less than $1,400,000, P is entitled to claim the excess adjustment in computing the tax with respect to P's subsequent transfers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Transfer of section 2701 interest at death of initial transferor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) P continues to hold the preferred stock until P's death. The chapter 11 value of the preferred stock at the date of P's death is the same as the fair market value of the preferred stock at the time of the initial transfer. In computing the Federal estate tax with respect to P's estate, P's executor is entitled to a reduction of $1,500,000 under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The result would be the same if P had sold the preferred stock to any individual other than an applicable family member at a time when the value of the preferred stock was $1,500,000. In that case, the amount of the reduction is computed as if the preferred stock were included in P's gross estate at a fair market value equal to the sales price. If the value of P's taxable estate is less than $1,500,000, the amount of the adjustment available to P's executor is limited to the actual value of P's taxable estate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The result would also be the same if the preferred stock had been held by P's parent, GM, and at the time of P's death, GM had not transferred the preferred stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Transfer of after-acquired preferred stock <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . On September 1, 1992, P purchases 100 shares of X preferred stock from an unrelated party. On October 1, 1994, P transfers 100 shares of X preferred stock to P's child. In computing P's 1994 gift tax, P is not entitled to reduce the amount on which P's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a) because the 1994 transfer does not reduce P's preferred stock holding below that held at the time of the initial transfer. See paragraph (a)(4) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Inter vivos transfer of entire section 2701 interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . (i) On October 1, 1994, at a time when the value of P's preferred stock is $1,400,000, P transfers all of the preferred stock to P's child. In computing P's 1994 gift tax, P, as the initial transferor, is entitled to reduce the amount on which P's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a) by $700,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The amount of the reduction computed under paragraph (b) of this section is the lesser of $750,000 (($1,500,000 &times; .5 ($1,000,000 over $2,000,000)) the amount by which the initial transferor's taxable gifts were increased as a result of the application of section 2701 to the initial transfer) or $700,000 (($1,400,000 &times; .5) the duplicated amount). The duplicated amount is 100 percent (the portion of the section 2701 interest subsequently transferred) times $700,000; e.g., one-half (the fraction representing the portion of the common stock transferred in the initial transfer ($1,000,000/$2,000,000)) of the amount by which the gift tax value of the preferred stock at the time of the subsequent transfer ($1,400,000) exceeds zero (the section 2701 value of the preferred stock at the time of the initial transfer).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Subsequent transfer of less than the entire section 2701 interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . On October 1, 1994, at a time when the value of P's preferred stock is $1,400,000, P transfers only 250 of P's 1,000 shares of preferred stock to P's child. In this case, the amount of the reduction computed under paragraph (b) is $175,000 (one-fourth (250/1,000) of the amount of the reduction available if P had transferred all 1,000 shares of preferred stock).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

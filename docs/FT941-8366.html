			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: The Falstaff of suburbia - The revival of the English National Opera production There are two portraits of Falstaff the man. In Shakespeare he is an old knave, who has fallen upon hard times and revels in comic rough-and-tumble. In Verdi he inhabits the same milieu, but the heart has grown warmer, the comedy has softened; Falstaff has acquired a nobility of spirit. The production of Falstaff that David Pountney mounted for English National Opera always had the rumbustious rogue in mind. It even looks vulgar - intentionally, one assumes. Falstaff has landed in present-day suburbia, where the middle-class flaunt what wealth they have. A row of terraced houses frames the set, every front door, every chimney-pot the same. The fair ladies of Windsor dress in off-the-peg, black-and-white Cecil Beaton imitations. At the end everybody goes to a party at Herne's disco. Although the brashness of this picture will not have been to all tastes, it was at least all of a piece when the production was new in 1989 and it still is now. Several of the key players have returned for this revival and there is also a conductor who has similar ideas about the opera. Andrew Litton wants Verdi's score to be red-blooded, with rhythmic strings, forward wind, blazing brass. If that sounds as though it could mean loud, it does, to the detriment of the words, but his vigour and decisiveness are welcome. The tone of the evening is mellowed somewhat by Benjamin Luxon's Falstaff, who looks beyond the obvious comic opportunities. As he sits rueful and bedraggled after his ducking in the Thames, he cuts a sadder figure than usual. His big monologue at that point is not very incisive. It is surprising how much real singing and voice this role demands - rather more than Luxon can summon. The strongest couple are the Fords. Janice Cairns looks a picture of bourgeois chic and is vocally well in command, with plenty of voice to spare. Alan Opie cannot claim that, but his jealous husband in striped suit and shades is well sung and knows better than anybody else on stage how to deliver English words. The others include Yvonne Howard's playful Meg and Anne Collins as a businesslike Quickly. Timothy Robinson sings Fenton nicely with well-mannered English tone; Sarah Pring's shining soprano is too substantial for Nannetta's light-as-thistledown music. Alexandre Naoumenko makes a strong Dr Caius. As the final fugue drew to a close amid much bustle on stage and uproar from the brass in the orchestra, I dreamed of a Falstaff that aspired to Verdi's nobility of spirit, warming the heart like Sir John's glass of mulled wine, a subtle, wise, detailed, nimble, sparkling Falstaff. That will have to wait for another day. And, I fear, another production. Revival sponsored by Woolwich Building Society. Performances continue until March 29 (with some changes of cast)</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD REPORT  </P> <P> Congratulations on your first edition of the World Report (April 24)! Well over  half of my business is conducted overseas and I have always found The Times to  be a little short on international coverage.  </P> <P> A suggestion: Would you include a table of currency exchange rates like you did  for the economic indicators? An even better idea would be to have the exchange  rates listed daily in the Business section.  </P> <P> GARY G. DAVIS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

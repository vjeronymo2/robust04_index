			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (1): Worst may be over - Powerful and predominantly positive forces at work in the global economy suggest the present time is a period of dynamic change rather than a weary recovery from recession IT LOOKS as if the worst may be over. The big industrialised nations are either out, or beginning to see their way out, of recession. Elsewhere, activity is expanding rapidly in regions as far-flung as south-east Asia, China, the Indian subcontinent and Latin America. Although prone to jitters, financial markets think they have already scented a better future. While businesses have been agonising about Japan's unprecedentedly severe post-war economic slowdown and the painful recession in continental Europe, bond and equity markets in the world's leading economies enjoyed a bull run this summer. The animal spirits of the global investing community have been stirred by hopes of sustained expansion with low inflation: the holy grail of economic policy that has so often eluded politicians and central bankers over the past 40 years. Investment conditions have certainly improved compared with a year ago. Short-term borrowing costs, already low in the US and Japan, have since fallen sharply in Britain and elsewhere. Although short rates are still comparatively high in Germany and most continental European nations, long-term rates in many countries have fallen to levels last seen at the end of the 1960s while in the US they recently touched a record low. But while clouds may be lifting, it is equally certain that disappointments will lie ahead. It is difficult to enthuse about short-term prospects in most big industrial countries. Germany's recession may have bottomed out, but recovery will be difficult. Japan's downturn could have further to go in spite of government stimulation measures. Britain appears an exception with steady growth and a surprise drop in unemployment so far this year. But the sluggish and patchy nature of the US economic recovery will probably set a pattern of slow recovery for much of the developed world. Unemployment in the industrial world will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. More than 22m people are out of work in Europe, according to the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, while the jobless total in the 24 industrialised nations of the OECD is forecast to rise to 36m next year. In spite of growing global interdependence, the industrial countries as a group will continue to make heavy weather of international co-operation. The Group of Seven, which some years ago looked as if it might develop into a directorate to steer the global economy, has degenerated into a high level talking shop of marginal utility. A more serious issue for future global prosperity is the uncertainty over whether the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks will reach a successful conclusion this year. The former Communist countries that made up the Soviet Union and its empire in eastern Europe have still to master a difficult transition to market-based from command economies. While some nations such as Poland and the Czech republic are making progress, others, notably the former Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are racked by war. At the same time, poverty will continue to dominate news reports out of Africa as civil war and bad governance stifle economic activity. But the world has always been a mixture of good and bad, and such contrasts between hope and despair are especially typical for a period of transition. There are powerful and predominantly positive forces at work in the global economy that suggest the present time is a period of dynamic change rather than a weary recovery from recession and the inflationary excesses of the 1980s. The collapse of communism has been accompanied by the spread of free market ideas that are opening up huge areas of the world, from India in the south to Siberia in the north, to more rapid development. The end of the cold war has spawned a rash of geopolitical changes that will bring economic opportunity in their wake. Racial harmony in South Africa and peace in the Middle East will be difficult to achieve but are no longer unthinkable. A technological revolution - or, more accurately, several revolutions are under way. Information and communications technologies, advanced automation and robotics, and new materials such as polymers, composites and ceramics are revolutionising production processes and products. Although economists have so far found it difficult to measure the impact of new technologies on productivity, global investment in manufacturing has been remarkably strong in the face of recent economic slowdowns and recession. It is likely that new technologies are also beginning to have a positive impact on productivity in the service sector after several years of often misguided investment. The short-term effect of such developments may be large-scale job losses in formerly safe white-collar jobs, but the changes should ultimately benefit mankind. This revolution in technology and production is fuelling and being fuelled by globalisation. It is an ugly word. But it means national boundaries and habits are becoming less relevant to business decisions as investment flows and production facilities move in quest of the highest possible returns or market share. Globalisation is breaking down the old distinction between industrialised and developing nations. Such changes can leave policy makers wrongfooted. Governments, working to older agendas, have found themselves opposing or challenged by market forces. The past chaotic year in the European exchange rate mechanism was one symptom of such stress. Another is the industrial world's inability to reduce farm subsidies and fully support freer trade, unlike many of the newly industrialising nations of Asia and Latin America. Wise governments realise that the only intelligent response to the challenge of globalisation is to make their economies more adaptable. In this spirit, many countries are trying to address structural problems left over from the past decade: soaring health expenditures threaten the US economy; Britain worries about its rising social security budget; and Germany must reduce the huge transfer of funds flowing to its new eastern Lander. Likewise, officials and the public in Britain and the US are concerned about standards of educational achievement and some fast-growing developing nations are becoming increasingly aware of the hazards of pollution and rapid urban expansion. The 1980s have left a legacy of sharply increased public and private debt. According to the OECD, gross public debt has nearly doubled to just under 70 per cent of the annual output of its member countries, from around 35 per cent in the mid-1970s. Lax monetary policies in Japan, the US, Britain and Scandinavia engendered sharp asset price inflation and bubble economies in the late 1980s. The correction has been difficult: the consequent process of debt deflation has entailed a long period of balance sheet restructuring, curtailing growth and hurting banks, companies and families in all these nations. Some problems are especially intractable. The generous protection given to agriculture in Japan and the European Community imposes a huge indirect burden on family budgets and, particularly in the case of France and its trading partners, exacerbates international tensions. But the political clout of farm lobbies has so far outweighed economic arguments against protection. Communism's collapse and the disintegration of the Soviet Union have also had far-reaching economic effects that must still be digested. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a triumph for western values, but the badly thought-through unification of Germany has turned into a nightmare for policy- makers. The inflationary pressures unleashed by German monetary union prompted the Bundesbank to tighten credit conditions with little regard for the economic welfare of its ERM partners. The resulting strains saw the forced exit of Britain and Italy from the system last September, followed by a series of devaluations affecting the Iberian currencies and Ireland. They culminated with the speculative attack on the French franc in July that finally forced EC finance ministers and central bank governors to widen ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent from 2.25 per cent and 6 per cent previously. The scale of speculation against the ERM was a graphic example of the impact of deregulation and globalisation on long-standing policy arrangements. The removal of exchange controls in preparation for the European Community's single market at the end of last year made the ERM's system of fixed but adjustable parities more vulnerable to speculative attack than at any time in its 14-year history. The past 10 years have seen a huge increase in the volume of funds that investors can shift across frontiers. The Basle-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) estimated the aggregate daily turnover in the foreign exchange markets at nearly Dollars 900bn in April 1992, equal to 13 times the GDP of the OECD group of countries on an annualised basis. Cheap telecommunications and computer equipment and a wide range of derivative products have encouraged new and more aggressive companies to embark on speculative transactions. New York hedge funds, such as the Quantum Fund managed by Mr George Soros, delivered the coup de grace to sterling last September. Normally conservative insurance companies and pension fund managers were reported to have led the flight from the French franc into the D-Mark in July. Markets can change their views with astonishing speed. France's failure to keep its currency in a 2.25 per cent band against the D-mark came only weeks after it appeared that the franc might supplant the D-mark as the anchor currency of the European Monetary System. As Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the BIS general manager, observed recently: 'No country is isolated from the policy behaviour, or misbehaviour, of others'. Financial markets have shown that they can mount a direct challenge to the monetary sovereignty of nations. So far, governments have no clear strategy for dealing with this phenomenon. If the EC is any guide, it is likely that they will reject turning back the clock and re-introducing capital controls. Governments are more likely to take care that policies and economic conditions in their countries show greater compatibility. For capital movements are not just a short-term phenomenon. Foreign direct investment flows have overtaken foreign trade as an engine of world growth. Through foreign direct investment, multinational companies are having an ever greater influence over the future of countries and their citizens. Statistics published by the OECD earlier this month estimated the stock of foreign direct investment by its 24 member states at Dollars 1,720bn in 1990, up from Dollars 440bn 10 years before. Much of this spending has flowed among the industrialised nations. The drive for a single European market encouraged Japanese car and electronics manufacturers to set up plants in the UK. But rising costs and soaring exchange rates in the developed world have also spurred much investment in newly industrialising countries. A recent Thai government paper traced the large increase in Japanese investment in Thailand to the Plaza agreement of 1985 which helped push the dollar lower and produced a surge in the value of the yen. But, as with most developments in the world economy, there are pluses and minuses. In a recent report, Ms Gail Fosler, chief economist of the Conference Board in the US, noted that business spending was growing in countries with relatively low capacity utilisation rates, such as the US, Canada and Mexico. This, she said, suggested that 'business spending is no longer driven by business cycle considerations but by global competition'. Mrs Sylvia Ostry, head of the Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto and a former chief economist at the OECD, goes further. New technologies and foreign direct investment are creating 'global overcapacity in industry after industry after industry', she says. Mrs Ostry has predicted new types of friction between nations or trading blocks as they adjust to these changed conditions. An early example was the so-called social dumping case in which the Hoover company shifted vacuum cleaner production from Dijon in France to its plant near Glasgow in Scotland to take advantage of less regulated labour markets and lower social costs. The pressure of competition among the industrialised countries and from the dynamic economies of east Asia and Latin America has become so remorseless as to make some people think the unthinkable. During the summer, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the secretary-general of that free trade bastion the OECD, said he would 'not rule out protectionism as a last resort' if it preserved the industrialised world from social unrest caused by mass unemployment. It is a moot point whether politicians and electorates in the industrial world have adjusted their expectations sufficiently to the prospect of cut-throat international competition and slower growth over the rest of the 1990s. Low opinion poll ratings suggest that politicians have coped poorly in the face of changing world economic conditions. It is a paradox that in an increasingly interdependent global economy, politicians are having to deal first and foremost with domestic issues to ensure their re-election. The heady days of the 1980s, when Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French President Francois Mitterrand and EC Commission President Jacques Delors pushed ahead with plans for European economic and monetary union appear long gone. Slow growth - with the OECD forecasting growth of about 1 per cent for its 24 member countries this year after 1.5 per cent in 1992 - is no friend of grand designs. And yet, if the equity and bond markets are to be believed, a global recovery is emerging. The investment community is encouraged by the idea that the industrial world might have seen the back of the inflationary binges of the past 40 years and is returning to an era of price stability - such as existed in the 19th century. At the same time, the spread of market economics in the developing world holds out the hope of continuing strong growth that will sustain global demand. The emerging recovery in the industrial world is getting off to a good start. 'Unlike the economic recoveries starting in 1976 and 1983, this one starts with low price-wage inflation to encourage long-term investment,' says Mr Paul Horne, international economist of US brokerage house, Smith Barney Shearson, in Paris. But the path ahead is strewn with uncertainty. The impasse over the global trade negotiations is an obvious risk. The achievement of steady growth with stable prices also depends crucially on whether the inflation of expectations, which has also been such a feature of the post second world war period, can be scaled back in line with monetary inflation. If so, the world may be able to look back at the 1990s as an important period of transition in which the difficult structural and employment effects of a technological revolution were gradually overcome in the industrial world, and rising productivity spread improved living standards to all mankind. If, on the other hand, governments, employees and businesses scramble for ever bigger shares of a slow growing cake, what little growth there is will give way again to inflation, stagnation or worse.</p>

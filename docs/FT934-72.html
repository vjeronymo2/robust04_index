			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Others in business broadcasting Sir, There are omissions in Simon Ellis's article on business broadcasting (Management, December 22). First, he omits to mention our programme Dawn Traders, broadcast between 5.30am-6.00 am, with a loyal City following thanks to its provision of tightly focused city and market news and information. Second, he omits our finance and business summary in our Drivetime programme which is both earlier and longer than the Financial World Tonight on Radio 4. Containing a market report from Wall Street, as well as news coverage of the day's business events and at least one, and often up to three interviews, it is also more comprehensive than the Financial World Tonight. Both these programme segments broadcast interviews with a wide range of interviewees from City economists to chairmen, financial directors and union leaders. Robin Amlot, financial editor, London Broadcasting Company, 72 Hammersmith Road, London W14 8YE</p>

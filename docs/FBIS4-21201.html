			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner  stated on 12 April that our country does not have the resources  to combat drug trafficking or other illegal activities. He  indicated that this is why cooperation and help from the  consumer countries is needed, and he proposed as a solution that  ``drug trafficking has to be fought where drugs are consumed.''    Former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora said these same  words when he received the U.S. demand that his country must  fight the cultivation of coca leaf, which is the raw material  from which cocaine is produced.    During the past few days our country has been involved in  the  trafficking of drugs or other illegal activities such as the  Brazilian ``numbers game.'' When the foreign minister was asked  what the government is doing to clear up the bad image that has  been created, he said: ``I believe the government is doing  everything it can to control drug trafficking and other illegal  activities. We do not have sufficient resources to combat drug  trafficking, and the help Paraguay receives from the consumer  countries is not very much.''    He indicated that the government cannot perform miracles  without the necessary resources. He stated that our country has  requested cooperation and help from the consumer countries,  ``because drug trafficking must be fought where the drugs are  consumed. Because if there is consumption and an important  price, then without a doubt there will be production and the  possibility of [drug] routes.''    He then proposed another solution to this scourge: that the  consumer countries emphasize aiding the countries where the drug  is produced or countries where drug routes are discovered.

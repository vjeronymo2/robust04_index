			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery bill attacked by Labour THE GOVERNMENT'S national lottery bill was 'the unacceptable face of nationalisation', Labour said yesterday during Commons exchanges concerning the bill's possible effects on employment in competing industries. In the debate before the bill paving the way for the new lottery received its second Commons reading, Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary, charged the government with wrecking 'a perfectly reasonable proposition' through its insensitivity. Citing concern among MPs about the effects of a lottery on the football pools industry, Ms Clwyd said the government had offered no safeguards as to the future of a large number of private-sector jobs. Labour preferred to put its faith in the established positions that the pools industry provided rather than speculation about the number of jobs the national lottery might create, she said. 'A job in the hand is worth more than a job in the bush.' Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, said the bill would establish 'a new multi-billion pound business' - an enterprise that would create around 1,000 'core' jobs in its central operation and many others in associated service industries. He confirmed reports that a confidential study commissioned by the government had indicated the pools industry might lose 1,100 jobs attributable to the lottery under certain circumstances, but said this conclusion assumed pools companies did nothing to change the management of their operations in response. In fact, the pools sector had already responded to the potential threat which the lottery poses. 'The pools are well able to adapt to change in order to preserve their own interests.' In an attempt to dispel Labour fears that the funds distributed by the lottery might in effect act as a substitute for public spending, Mr Brooke promised that proceeds would not be brought within the government control total. This point was underlined by Mr David Mellor, former heritage secretary, who spoke of the need for it to be clear the government was not trying to 'slough off' responsibility for arts, sport and heritage. Mr Mellor said that the only basis on which he could commend to the many bodies that wanted the lottery that it would be a good thing was if the undertaking not to use it as a substitute for public funds was 'honoured to the letter'. He said: 'The national lottery is only worth something if it is a quantum leap forward for these interests. Otherwise I do not think we want it'. Unlawful participation in foreign lotteries meant that the choice at issue was not between one lottery or none 'but between benefit from the lottery in the UK and benefit abroad,' Mr Brooke said. A Labour amendment describing the bill as unacceptable in the form proposed was defeated by 310 votes to 269, a government majority of 41. The bill then received a second reading by 339-203, a government majority of 136, with Labour MPs being given a free vote.</p>

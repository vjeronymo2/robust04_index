			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ART ENSEMBLE TRIES FOR SYNESTHESIA  </P> <P> Remember Nick Nolte as painter Lionel Dobie in "Life Lessons" -- the first part  of the film trilogy "New York Stories" -- furiously laying down glistening  tracks of paint while his stereo booms rock music from the '60s? Now that was a  happening.  </P> <P> On Thursday night the Improvisational Art Ensemble -- one painter and an Orange  County music trio -- tried to stir up some good vibes in the Irvine Fine Arts  Center courtyard.  </P> <P> They hoped, as painter Jeff Severtson told the audience, to create a kind of  synesthesia -- the mixing of aesthetic sensations that has been the elusive  goal of certain artists since the 19th Century.  </P> <P> But the improvised music was a soporific New Age wash of sustained synthesizer  and electronic saxophone sounds underlaid with a steady drum beat and the  occasional jangle of bells. And the two bouts of improvised painting -- "Homage  to a Poorly Drawn Circle" and "Waters Ource" -- were overly polite activities  that yielded results of no particular aesthetic interest.  </P> <P> Incredibly, Severtson chose to paint on a square framed canvas on an easel  (which wobbled perilously whenever he applied more elbow grease). Had he  chosen, say, lengths of paper or a huge piece of raw canvas, he would have been  obliged to move around more and his project would have had a more contemporary  flair.  </P> <P> The canvas-on-the-easel idea was hokey and old-fashioned, more the kind of  thing you'd expect on some earnest educational-TV program about how easy and  pleasant it is to paint abstract works of art at home.  </P> <P> Switching brushes from time to time (and occasionally standing back to toss his  hair and analyze his creation), Severtson eked out colorful compositions that  clung to the edges of the canvas, including the narrow wood frame, leaving a  void in the center.  </P> <P> In "Waters Ource," which took about 40 minutes to complete, he offered a  greater range of activities -- splats and palette-knife gouges and spills of  paint as well as careful brush strokes and muddy washes.  </P> <P> Still, the entire presentation was far too restricted and self-conscious to  work as a total art experience. Severtson never seemed really involved in his  work and the musicians (Dya Singh, Greg Page and Soheil Massoumi) lacked the  requisite levels of intensity and inventiveness.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS IRA 'HARDSHIP'  WITHDRAWAL  </P> <P> Question: About three years ago, I withdrew $2,500 from my individual  retirement account to help purchase a condo. I dutifully paid income taxes and  a 10% penalty on the withdrawal. But now I hear there could be a "hardship"  case exemption that would allow early withdrawals for the purchase of a primary  residence. Is that so? And what do I do about claiming the exemption now? -- R.  P.  </P> <P> Answer: Unfortunately, you don't do anything, because there is no hardship  withdrawal provision for IRAs yet. Congress has been talking about it for  years, but so far there's nothing on the books. The exemption to which you are  referring applies only to 401(k) savings programs at work, which are not as  generous as you have been led to believe.  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service allows taxpayers to withdraw funds from their  401(k) tax deferred savings plans for certain "hardships" -- a catch-all  category that includes illness and the purchase of a primary residence.  However, the withdrawals are still subject to taxation as ordinary income.  Further, if the withdrawal is made before you turn age 59 1/2, you will be  slapped with a 10% penalty for early withdrawal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Common Law Spouse May Get Some Benefits  </P> <P> Q: I have been living with my boyfriend for about 10 years. We are both about  50 years old. Am I eligible to collect his Social Security as a common-law  spouse when he dies? -- M. B.  </P> <P> A: Your eligibility to collect Social Security as a common-law spouse depends  primarily on where you live. Some states recognize common-law marriages;  others, including California, do not.  </P> <P> However, even if you don't live in a state that recognizes the legal standing  of your union, you may still be eligible for spousal Social Security benefits.  According to a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, if you have  temporarily lived, or perhaps even just spent a few weeks in a state  recognizing common law marriages, the agency may recognize your claim. Our  experts say you should contact your local Social Security office for advice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home's Value in Past Can Be Determined  </P> <P> Q: Over the years, you have referred to the fact that the IRS allows taxpayers  to upgrade the cost basis of community-owned assets, such as a house, to their  fair market value on the date one spouse dies. But how does one reach back six  or more years to determine the value of a house in a way the IRS will accept?  Property inflation varies so greatly from one area to another that I doubt a  general inflation factor would be accepted. -- E. T. L.  </P> <P> A: You're right. A general inflation factor, or even a cost-of-living index  adjustment for a particular geographic area, isn't precise enough. You will  need comparable sales figures for homes in your neighborhood for the period in  question.  </P> <P> Although this might sound difficult to find, a qualified real estate broker,  real estate appraiser or probate referee should be able to locate the  information you need. In fact, you may discover that if you list your home for  sale with a real estate broker, the realty may provide the information at  little or no fee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> If Benefits Seem Small, It May Pay to Check  </P> <P> Q: The company for which I have worked for the past 17 years will be closing in  the immediate future. I have received written notice of the amount of my share  of the company's "defined benefit plan" that I can expect to receive. However,  this amount seems to be about half of what it should be. Where do I go from  here? -- D. K.  </P> <P> A: Your first stop should be your employee relations department where you  should ask why your perceptions of what you are owed are so different from what  the company is now saying. Perhaps there is a simple explanation. One possible  reason is that what you thought you were entitled is an amount you were told  you would get if you continued working at the company until age 65 at a certain  wage scale. Now, however, the company is closing and you won't be working there  until retirement, so your benefits are lower.  </P> <P> If this is not the case, you can pursue the matter further by filing a claim  under the benefits claims procedure of your pension plan. The procedure should  be detailed in the fine print of your plan. Follow it carefully.  </P> <P> Finally, you may be covered by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. Again, check  the fine print of your plan. If you are covered, and you feel that your plan  has not been terminated correctly, you can write to the corporation at 2020 K  St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20006. Mark your envelope to the attention of the  Coverage and Inquiries Division.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Early Retirement Can Affect Payout  </P> <P> Q: I understand a wife gets half of her husband's Social Security benefits  whether or not she has worked. Further, if the wife has worked and her own  Social Security benefits are less than half of her husband's, she gets the  larger of the two amounts. Well, my husband and I both retired at age 62 and  all these years I have been getting my own Social Security, which is less than  half of his. How can I have this corrected? -- J. S. C.  </P> <P> A: You probably don't have a problem to be corrected. A spouse who retires at  age 62 is entitled to just 37.5% of the Social Security benefits of the other  spouse. The answer here is that your benefits are probably higher than 37.5% of  your husband's benefits. If they weren't, you would be getting 37.5% of his  benefits.  </P></p>

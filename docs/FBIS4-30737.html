			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]  has won 22 parliamentary seats and come in fifth in the  Hungarian parliamentary elections. KDNP Party Chairman Laszlo  Surjan assesses the result and the future.    [Begin recording] [Surjan] [passage omitted] As we know, the  transformation from a planned to a market economy and many other  circumstances have brought very great disappointment because  only very few people have attained a higher standard of living.  In practice, the living standard of all citizens has declined.    Until now we have had a role in a coalition, a role we  played  as a partner of that coalition with moderate strength. Now we  would like to participate in Hungarian public life in a much  more marked manner and with a much better defined character but  independently of others, relying on our own strength and our own  ideas.    [Unidentified correspondent] Does it mean that the KDNP  cannot accept fully its participation in the bloc of  pro-national forces which the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]  is trying to form?    [Surjan] The significance of a bloc of pro-national forces  is  yet to be thought through. I myself am afraid of this term.  Naturally, we must think together, just as we have undertaken  this -- we have even created serious tensions within the party  -- by trying to help each other in the second round through  withdrawing in favor of each other. Unfortunately, without  result. [passage omitted]</p>

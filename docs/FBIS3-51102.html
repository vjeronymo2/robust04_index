This delay not only demands a satisfactory explanation but  also leads to the issue -- which seems to be taking forever to  settle -- of the necessary reform of the Armed Forces. The  promotion of a considerable number of generals without there  being a single retirement only worsens the old problem of an  excess number of officers in our Armed Forces.    Granted, sending officers into retirement does not ease the  burden on the state, but at least the number of officers on  active duty does not continue to grow and, ultimately, the  budget will tend to be divided among fewer officers.    To the contrary, the overpopulation of officers has an  immediate effect on the efficiency of institutes and on costs  and wages. The fact that officers do not earn a decent salary  is due, to a certain extent, to their being too many of them.  Low wages, in turn, are a hotbed for all sorts of corrupt  practices that undermine the Armed Forces' morale. In the end,  only those who manage to accommodate those practices or who have  a family fortune tend to survive, and not necessarily the  upright and talented ones.    Therefore, it is a matter of national security to implement  an important reform within the Armed Forces. It should not only  include the number of officers but also the equipment it has and  the purchases made. The lack of openness in military purchases  -- reportedly justified by the very nature of the issues linked  to national defense -- prevalent for such a long time has given  rise to a stifling atmosphere that has bred corruption. The  embezzlement committed against the Navy, for example, is a case  in which the country will not back off from its determination to  find the culprits.    The subject of the Armed Forces and the necessary openness  on  its main issues has not been properly approached yet. And it  should be approached properly just as much as the rest of the  main national subjects. The armed institutions must not remain  aside in the reform that is being carried out in all sectors of  society, the economy, and the state, and that is making our  national recovery possible.</p>

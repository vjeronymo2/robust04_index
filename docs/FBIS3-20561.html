			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zheng Zuguo (6774 4371 0948): "Driving on the </F> Fast Lane, Undergoing Major Changes: Shanghai's Economy To Leap  Even Higher This Year: Growth Rate To Reach 14 Percent; Pudong's  Development To Reach New Height; Financial Transactions To  Become Even More Orderly; Export Trade To Increase Steadily;  Importing of Foreign Capital To Make New Breakthrough;  Infrastructure Input To Increase; Scope of Market Exchange To  Further Expand; Districts and Counties To Give Impetus To the  Tertiary Industry"]    [Text] There will be new breakthroughs in Shanghai's reform  and opening up this year, and the national economy will continue  its trend of sustained, rapid, and healthy development.  Specifically, the municipality's economic development will  display the following trends:    Economic growth will continue to be fairly strong,  showing a trend of sustained, rapid, and healthy  development. In recent years, Shanghai has continued to put  large amounts of domestic and foreign capital into its economy.  The marketization process is playing an increasingly prominent  role in optimizing the allocation of resources; the scopes of  the mainstay industries are rapidly expanding. This year, given  Shanghai's market condition, quality, and efficiency, its GNP is  expected to grow by approximately 14 percent. Because of the  sudden surge in many large markets this year, the tertiary  industry will undergo unprecedented development. Its growth rate  may exceed that of the GNP, and the economic efficiency of its  industries will continue to set national standards. In the wake  of the implementation of the classified tax system and the  continued increase in overall income, local government revenues  will continue to increase at a steady pace.    Development of the financial industry will accelerate;  fund utilization will become even more orderly. Today, the  specialized banks are operating more like commercial banks and  the existing commercial banks have laid a good foundation for  future development; 28 foreign-funded financial institutions  have opened in Shanghai. These have created the conditions for a  financial system which is unified but open, which facilitates  orderly competition, and which is strictly managed. We can  anticipate that even though it will be harder to raise capital  this year, Shanghai's financial market will become even more  orderly, and construction and production funds are assured.    The opening and development of Pudong will be marked by  progress in basic development which will gather momentum; the  development of new functions will continue to accelerate, and  city and district development will keep pace with growth.  In the three years since the opening of Pudong, the first group  of 10 major infrastructure construction projects has been  completed two years ahead of schedule. The construction of the  first group of 50 commercial buildings in the Lujiazui financial  district has begun ahead of schedule. The Jinqiao export  processing zone has taken in more than 200 projects; 30 have  already gone into production and are among the first to harvest  the fruits of development. Waigaoqiao's tax-shelter zone has as  many as 800 projects; the tax-shelter market and the piers in  the port area are in operation. The New Pudong District, which  concetrates on international trade, export processing, and  financial business, will soon reach a high tide in accelerating  the development of those functions.    The construction of a big market system will continue  to be marked by expanded scope, orderly transactions, and the  bringing in of more and more functions into play. Shanghai  already has formed the basic framework of a big market system;  it already has a fledgling state-class market. Last year, the  municipality's volume of securities exchange surpassed 400  billion yuan; there were more than 1,600 seats in the securities  exchange, with more than 100 different types of stocks being  traded. Volume of transaction in the metals exchange topped 300  billion yuan. As the market plays an increasingly prominent role  in optimizing resource allocation, and with the economy  sustaining a fairly high rate of growth, the number of big  markets and the volume of transaction in Shanghai will continue  to grow, and many economic laws and provisions and market  regulations will be introduced. A prominent feature of  Shanghai's big market development this year will be its growing  impact on the rest of the nation through its fund gathering and  distribution and resource allocation functions, and it will  forge even closer ties with the international markets.    There will be new breakthroughs in terms of territory  and scale with respect to the bringing in of foreign capital.  Foreign trade will be marked by steady recovery. This year,  there will be continued breakthroughs in terms of projects and  dollar amount of foreign capital brought in. The secondary  industry's focus in bringing in foreign capital will be on the  development of heavy industry and township enterprises. Foreign  investments in the tertiary industry will be attracted more to  finance, commerce, and retail. Domestic sales of commercial  buildings and the adoption of the BOT method will make new  breakthroughs too. In the wake of Shanghai's readjustment of its  foreign trade thinkings and the rapidly increasing functions of  the New Pudong Zone, some enterprises that manage their own  exports will become more mature; non-commodity trade will  continue to increase. The rate of increase in foreign exports  will equal that of the increase in the GNP. Other forms of  foreign economic cooperation will also make great strides.    Urban infrastructure construction will be marked by its  sharp focus, accelerated progress, and clear results. This  year should mark a season of bumper harvest in infrastructure  construction. One by one, a group of important municipal  construction projects will be completed and put to use. After  the completion of the Yangpu Bridge, the second phase of the  waterfront project, and the project to widen Jiangsu Road, the  inner loop is completely open to traffic; the first phase of the  combined sewage treatment project is in operation. At the same  time, another group of municipal construction work is reaching  high tide. The Number 1 subway track will be tested upon  completion; construction of the elevated roadway of the Chengdu  Highway will be accelerated to create a 8.3 km framework of  roadways. A new round of major construction work has been  unveiled. Construction of the outer loop roads and the multiple  track Huangpujiang tunnel will soon begin. Acceleration of  infrastructure construction will continue to promote the  development of other related trades and industries and will  become one of the driving forces behind the rapid economic  growth.    District and county economies will be marked by the  development of the tertiary industry, especially by the speeding  up of the development of specialty businesses, to promote  economic growth. The construction of a large group of  commercial and tourist facilities will be accelerated in the  suburban counties. Upon strengthening unified planning, many new  specialty markets will be developed in the urban areas. A  central business district will soon take shape.    The living standard will rise even higher, and the  consumer goods market will continue to be brisk. Retail  sales will increase at a rate of more than 30 percent and volume  will exceed 80 billion yuan this year. Construction of  high-quality commercial and residential buildings and vacation  homes may slow somewhat, but domestic demand for commercial  buildings and residential homes is still brisk, and construction  will be stepped up. Markets for decorations and other  accessories will also grow accordingly.    While Shanghai's economy will continue to develop fairly  rapidly, its economic development still has many unresolved  contradictions--contradictions that have been around since the  beginning, but in addition, there will be new effects and new  problems produced by the central government's strengthening of  its macro regulation and control and thorough reform. For  example, there will be further increases in the demand for  production funds; problems in the original channels for fund  gathering and distribution will continue to grow; new chains of  debt may resurface. New thinkings and new countermeasures are  needed to solve the new fund predicaments. It is urgent that  Shanghai increases its foreign trade development momentum, and  it is imperative that enterprises actively open up new markets.  They must promote development in the investment goods and the  consumer goods markets and in retail and wholesale businesses  under the conditions of slowing total demand and intense  competition. There is a growing number of factors contributing  to lower enterprise profits and higher enterprise losses.    We can predict that this year will be a year full of hope.  So  long as it upholds the strategic principle of taking the lead in  reform and solves its many problems diligently, Shanghai's  economic development will continue to reach new heights.</p>

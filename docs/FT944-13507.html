			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: New issues The publicity surrounding recent flotation disasters has tended to leave the impression that investing in UK new issues has become a quick way to lose money. Yet analysis of all this year's flotations produces a rather different picture. On average, they have outperformed the market, albeit by a whisker. But while the proportion of duds may not be abnormal, the scale of the losses on the flops has undoubtedly done some damage. By putting bad apples into the market, sponsors have soured the institutions which are now looking much more carefully at the new goods they offer. And it is not just those involved in the disasters that suffer. Because some sponsors have been less fastidious than they ought, the prices of good quality flotations have been forced down, raising the cost of capital across the market. There seems to have been a specific problem with management buy-outs. This may reflect the fact that by the end of last year stock market valuations were so much higher than trade sale prices that venture capital backers floated businesses which were not cut out to be independent quoted companies. In addition to the pressure on prices, the disasters have resulted in some marginal floats being pulled. The fact that new issues since May have comfortably outperformed the index may suggest that the market has already corrected itself. Sceptical institutions reply that problems take time to show through. But then they have every interest in talking prices down further.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Credit Suisse flotation deferred CS HOLDING has deferred the flotation of part of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank, because better-than-expected profits in 1991 will enable it to meet the country's stringent bank capital requirements. The group's net profit rose to SFr980m (Dollars 649m) in 1991 from SFr149m the previous year, giving consolidated earnings per bearer share of SFr225.10 against SFr34.70. The result would allow the group enough retained profit to meet Swiss capital requirements, Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, said in London. This was in spite of a ruling 18 months ago by Switzerland's Supreme Court that the requirements should apply to CS First Boston, its investment bank, on the same basis as if it were a commercial bank. CS Holding had planned to respond by selling part of Credit Suisse on the stock exchange, but Mr Gut said the holding company was in no hurry to do so when Swiss bank stocks were selling at below net asset value. 'We have to make sure we are not diluting our earnings,' he said. In the longer run, it might be interested in a sale to generate capital for expansion into other markets, but the matter would not be considered again before the start of next year. Meanwhile, group capital will be strengthened by about SFr300m by paying part of this year's dividend in share warrants. Each SFr120 dividend will include a warrant worth the equivalent of SFr45, compared with SFr110 and SFr35 respectively last year. CS Holding will also seek shareholder approval to issue SFr250m in contingent capital which could be used to back equity-linked debt issues. Mr Gut said this would create scope to raise about SFr1bn in new equity, though it would not need to do so to meet the capital requirements. The sharp rise in profits reflected both an already announced 57 per cent increase in net earnings at Credit Suisse and a swing from loss of Dollars 475m to net income of Dollars 216m at CS First Boston.

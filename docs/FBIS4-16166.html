			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Rudolf Gladkikh] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- The Russia's Choice bloc  issued a statement on Wednesday, following NATO air raids on  Bosnian Serb positions near the town of Gorazde.    "The process of peaceful settlement on the long-suffering  land of Bosnia-Herzegovina is going through another period of  hardships. Bloody events in the U.N.-proclaimed `safe area of  Gorazde' cause deep sorrow and concern. It is necessary to act  decisively in order to put an end to deaths and sufferings of  innocent people, to violence, terror and any provocations, no  matter who inspires them," the statement said.    It stressed that the "safety of Gorazde is provided for by  respective resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and they  must be unswervingly fulfilled." The statement described as  alarming the fact that the decision on bombing "was adopted  without proper consultations corresponding to the seriousness of  the moment with the leadership of the Russian Federation."    "Russia as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council  cannot stay away from such responsible decisions and should not  associate itself with coercive actions for which it did not give  its consent," the document said.    In a separate statement the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia (LDPR) denounced the air strikes in much stronger terms.  "NATO bombs kill orthodox brethren and sisters," it said. The  party also lashed out at U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, saying he has "forgotten the goals of his  organisation and its charter." "Especially outrageous is that  air raids are called a `U.N. Peace-keeping operation," the  statement said.</p>

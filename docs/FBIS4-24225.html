			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Reg Rumney] </F>   [Text] The money in the Budget for job creation  demonstrates once again the difficulty of spending money  allocated for certain socially desirable purposes -- and the  spending constraints faced by Finance Minister Derek Keys and  his team.    R292-million [rand] is allocated for job creation, outside  of  any further money for this purpose that might come from the  Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP] R2.5-billion  fund for this fiscal year. But around R247-million of that is  rolled over from the last fiscal year, with only R45-million  being added to the allocation.    In general, while the RDP fund gathers steam, non-RDP  spending in fields where apartheid left big backlogs is  restrained.    Spending on health dropped two percent in real terms at  R14-billion, although the shift in spending is seen in the rise  in the primary health care portion to 25 percent of the total  health care budget at the expense of secondary and tertiary  health care.    Spending on social security and welfare rose 20.5 percent to  R13,015-billion, yet this translates, according to the South  African Council for the Aged, to a disappointing R13 a month  increase in social pensions.    Spending on housing is up 15.6 percent above the amount  voted  for 1993/94, but at R2.2-billion falls far short of some  estimates of the kind of money needed to attack the housing  backlog. Again, the money will have to come from the RDP.    To be fair, spending on social services has to be looked at  over a longer period to get perspective. Spending on  protection, which includes defence, has declined as a percentage  of total spending from 21.8 percent in the 1990/91 budget to  18.1 percent in the 1994/95 budget.    Over the same period social spending has risen from 41.3  percent to 45.0 percent, or 19.1 percent a year to make up 14.3  percent of gross domestic product.    Within social spending education has risen to 22.0 percent  of  the Budget, from an already high 20.9 percent -- education  spending represents seven percent of gross domestic product for  this fiscal year. Spending by most departments was cut back to  find the R2.5-billion for the RDP.    But transition costs associated with security during the  election negated any "post-apartheid dividend". The disastrous  National Peace-Keeping Force exercise alone swallowed up  R384.5-million.    While the defence budget was cut by R650-million, transition  costs push it up again this fiscal year. So spending on  protection services actually rises by R2,309-billion, or 10  percent, slightly above inflation. Within that defence  spending, widely seen as a source of money for diversion to  social spending, rose by 13.5 percent.    And the South African National Defence Force has released a  document arguing that the defence budget will have to increase  in future, and cutbacks have harmed defence capabilities.</p>

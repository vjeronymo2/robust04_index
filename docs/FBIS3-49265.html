			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The recent Ministry of Foreign Economic  Cooperation appointment of Ireneusz Sekula to the presidency of  the Main Customs Office (GUC) has resulted in a number of  biographical reports, one of which appeared in the 26 December  issue of WPROST. The Poznan weekly writes that GUC's former  president, Mariusz Jakubowski, was replaced by "the politician  and entrepreneur" Ireneusz Sekula, who is an advocate of  lowering customs duties in order to make smuggling less  attractive and thus increase customs revenues.    WPROST also reports that the 50-year-old Sekula completed  his  studies for a master's degree in psychology in 1965 at the  University of Warsaw, where he later earned a doctorate in  political science. Following a stint with the Polish Scout Union  (ZHP), he began his professional career in state administration,  working for the Ministry of Industrial Machinery and the  Ministry of Labor, Wages, and Social Service Affairs. From 1983  to 1988, he was president of the Social Security Agency (ZUS).  Sekula was minister of labor and social policies in Zbigniew  Messner's government (mid-198O's) and served as deputy premier  in Mieczyslaw Rakowski's government (the last communist  government, which preceded the Mazowiecki government of 1989).  From 1966 to 1990, Sekula was a member of the ruling communist  party, the Polish United Workers Party, and currently belongs to  Social Democracy of the Polish Republic (SdRP), where he serves  on the Executive Council. Sekula has been a deputy in the last  three Sejms: the last Sejm that included communists, elected in  1989, and the Sejms elected in 1991 and 1993--in the latter two  representing the Democratic Left Alliance, of which the SdRP is  a leading partner.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Sweet sound of harmony - Unifying business law is no simple matter National legislators seldom keep pace with the development of international business. When they do attempt to address the subject, they often make things worse by drafting the legislation from a purely domestic view. Fortunately, a large number of international organisations have made it their task to harmonise different systems of national business law and to provide national legislators with guidelines and models for new legislation. It can take decades before government experts agree a legal text and when they do, businesses can wait many more years for ratification. Some organisations try to bypass this bottleneck by drafting standard terms and guidelines which businessmen can incorporate in their contracts. However, the number of international organisations generating harmonisation, unification or new law projects has mushroomed. Excluding the European Community, which legislates for the benefit of its member countries, this new legal industry now consists of no less than 28 organisations, some of them highly specialised. The United Nations alone has 12 different agencies in the legislative business. The most prolific of these are Unctad (trade and development), Uncitral (trade law) and Wipo (intellectual property), while Gatt (tariffs and trade) is the best known. There are eight other inter-governmental organisations. The oldest and most productive is the Rome-based Unidroit, founded in Rome in the 1930s for the international unification of laws, while the most productive is the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A recent addition is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Although it has not provided the post-communist countries with much money, it is about to let them have a model law on secured transactions. Finally, there are eight non-governmental international organisations. Half of these specialise in transport law: CIT (railways), CMI (marine), IRU (road) and Fiata, which is a federation of freight forwarders. Of the remaining four, the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has done useful work on abbreviated contract terms, standard terms for several types of banking operations, and arbitration. A survey of the current activities of these organisations, produced by Uncitral on July 1, lists no fewer than 112 projects related to the harmonisation and unification of international trade law. A sampling of this mountain of paper shows that there are great variations in its quality, usefulness and impact. Work in the field of international transport law has had a great impact on business, notably in limiting the liability of carriers for damage or loss of goods. Unfortunately, the law is also rather difficult to understand, and national courts (of the maritime nations in particular) are often faced with difficult problems of interpretation. The most successful, perhaps, is the ICC work on Incoterms, the widely-used abbreviated contract terms system, while its standard terms for letters of credit have been adopted by most banks engaged in international business. Uncitral's work on arbitration rules and model law has profoundly influenced arbitration worldwide, particularly the English and Scottish jurisdictions and the Commonwealth. Mr Gerald Herrmann, who steered these projects with unique enthusiasm, has been since promoted to Secretary General of Uncitral. By contrast, the other great product of Uncitral, the 1980 UN Convention on International Contracts for the Sale of Goods (the Vienna Convention), is only the smallest common denominator of the often conflicting interests of the countries which for 15 years participated in its drafting. Its ratification by the UK has been opposed by the English legal profession for a variety of reasons, one of which is the unjustified fear that it could open the door to continental lawyers. More valid objections to the convention are the absence of provisions on when the title to the sold goods should pass from the seller to the buyer, and its preference for enforcing specific performance rather than compensating a breach of contract by damages. In spite of the fact that the UK has not yet ratified the Vienna Convention, UK traders may fall into these pitfalls whenever the contract is governed by the law of a country which has ratified it, as most of its trading partners have done. Two ICC projects may help a little. One is concerned with updating the ICC Guide on the Retention of Title, the other with the drafting of a model contract which would fit the Vienna Convention. The ICC published in 1991 a Model Commercial Agency Contract and is about to publish a Model Distribution Agreement. The amount of duplication and triplication that exists in this field is illustrated by the existence - in addition to an EEC directive - of an 1983 (Geneva) Convention and many valuable studies on commercial agency undertaken, and now suspended, by Unidroit. Another Uncitral product, the soon to be published Legal Guide on International Countertrade Transactions, is a valuable study of problems arising in different types of barter and buy-back deals, but could be much improved by bringing these problems in relation to specific national laws. By providing a readily available model, the EEC harmonisation measures exercise a powerful influence on the international unification of law, sometimes infecting it with integrationist tendencies which are far ahead of the political readiness to accept them. Such seems to be the case of the Uncitral Draft Model Law on Procurement. Its Article 3 provides for equal opportunity and equal treatment of foreign participants in public tenders. This desirable objective is not yet acceptable to many countries where preference for domestic suppliers is well established by practice and legislation. A model law, though it must not be too much ahead of what is politically possible, will be widely used only if it represents an advance on the legislation already in place. The Uncitral Draft Model Law on Procurement seems to follow the outmoded method of prescribing procedure instead of clearly stating economic aims. It has been criticised, by Australia for example, for its resulting lack of flexibility and for a narrow emphasis on price, instead of value for money, as the main criterion for evaluation of offers. Although it deals with social security obligations, the draft is silent on environmental conditions, health and safety, wages and working conditions. A further weakness is that its provisions for administrative and judicial review of awards have been rejected by Japan, probably because judicial review there might easily take 10 years. One should not draw too many general conclusions from a small sample of work which, even if not perfect, results from devoted efforts of many well-informed lawyers and is indispensable for the development of international trade law; except, perhaps, that there is a need for unification of the unification process and for a greater support of private efforts, which can bring quicker and better results than negotiations between governments.

			<p>The      following summaries highlight information from articles that  appeared in Algerian and West European press.  The hardcopy version  of this Foreign Media Note contains 4 cartoons with captions.      Guards Authorized To Carry Weapons      The Ministry of Interior has authorized uniformed security guards  to carry weapons for self-protection when employed to guard company  buildings or deliver money, precious metals, or chemical products.  Security delivery vehicles will be equipped with radios and must  carry certificates verifying the nature of the cargo being  transported.  The measure was reportedly introduced in December 1993  after a series of attacks against companies and public offices.  (Algiers EL WATAN in French 2 May 94)      Flow of Refugees to France Continuing      According to a front-page article in the French-language daily EL  WATAN, some 10,000 Algerians have fled to France, including doctors,  journalists, and other professionals, despite a bleak outlook for  employment in that country.  Technical workers such as architects  and electronics experts, for example, have found it necessary to  work as industrial designers or to repair household appliances in  dormitory towns largely inhabited by North Africans.  The article  quoted Algerian writer Rachid Mimouni, who criticized the fact that  Algerian Islamist extremists "have been welcomed in European  countries," while those whose lives have been threatened "f ind no  assistance."  (Algiers EL WATAN 18 May 94)      GIA Publication Comments on Assassinations      Algiers daily EL WATAN reported that the Armed Islamic Group  (GIA) has claimed responsibility for the assassination of a French  priest and nun in its weekly newsletter, AL ANSAR.  The newsletter  called the killings part of "the policy of liquidation of Jews,  Christians, and infidels on Algeria's Muslim soil," describing the  clerics as "crusaders who spent long years spreading evil."  EL  WATAN cited "informed observers" who attributed the double  assassination to Mohamed Gousmi, who controls the GIA's "battalions  of death" (kata'ib al-mawt) and his deputy, Djamel Zitouni.  Gousmi  is said to have personally sent news of the killings to Peshawar as  a way of demonstrating his rejection of those FIS leaders who have  condemned acts of terrorism.  Another GIA head, Emir Dehilis, has  condemned to death FIS representative Rabah Kebir; according to EL  WATAN, documents proving the existence of this death threat were  found in a GIA arms cache in Ain Ghrab.      According to EL WATAN, information for the GIA bulletin is faxed  from Algiers to the Peshawar, Pakistan home of "Abou Amine," who is  said to be close to Afghan Prime Minister Golbodin Hekmatyar.  (Abou  Amine reportedly replaced "Abou Anas", or Bounoua, who was a  representative for the Islamic Salvation Front (FTS) and the son-in-  law of Shaykh Abdallah Azam.)  Abou Amine compiles the newsletter,  writes its editorials, and faxes it to Warsaw for onward  transmission to Europe and Algeria.  According to EL WATAN, this  "fragile" relay system enables the Algerian "Afghans" to maintain  their leadership over the GIA, whose "emirs" are increasingly  "uncontrollable."  (Algiers EL WATAN 15 May 94)      GIA, FIS Relations Decline      According to the Paris-based expatriate weekly AL-WATAN AL-  'ARABI, "informed sources" have reported that a conflict between the  GIA and the FIS is anticipated following the assassination of a  French priest and nun.  According to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI, the roots  of the dispute between the two groups began when the GIA accused the  FIS of colluding with the Algerian Government in an ambush that  targeted a house in Algiers owned by a FIS member in which a large  number of GIA leaders were killed.  The operation reportedly took  place with the collusion of the FIS as a sign of its "good faith" in  executing the agreement between the two sides stipulating that the  FIS would aid President Zeroual in eliminating the extremists within  the scope of a political settlement.  (Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI 27  May 94)      GIA-MIA-AIS Unification Denied      The reported unification of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and  Armed Islamic Movement (MIA) under the umbrella of the Islamic  Salvation Army (AIS)--announced earlier this year by Qamr Eddine  Kherbane and Anouar Haddam, both members of the FIS executive  council--has not materialized, according to Algiers daily LIBERTE.  AL ANSAR, the GIA mouthpiece, has reportedly announced that all GIA  "sections" and "companies" have rejoined the ranks of the GIA, with  the exception of Said Mekhloufi's group.  The LIBERTE article stated  that an AIS communique reportedly signed by Abou Mohamed Abdelhadi  subsequently alleged that the Al Ansar statement was "nothing but  lies" since "the AIS invited and continues to invite GIA elements to  rejoin in order to close ranks, but they refused."  According to  LIBERTE, the GIA-MIA merger originated in 1992 after several GIA  leaders were killed or jailed, and MIA head Said Mekhloufi dissolved  his group in the hope of forming a unified movement with the GIA.  (Algiers LIBERTE 12 May 94)      (For reaction by Islamic Society Movement (HAMAS) leader Mahfoud  Nahnah to the reported split, see the 13 June 94 Near East-South  Asia Daily Report, "HAMAS leader Calls for Dialogue, End to  Violence.")      Civilian Defense Force Shelved      According to a "reliable source," Algerian officials have decided  not to pursue the mobilization of civilians proposed by former  Interior Minister Selim Saadi on 23 March.  Saadi had raised the  possibility of using civilian reservists as an anti-terrorist civil  defense force during a visit to Blida.  Officials have reportedly  decided that Algerian security forces are "sufficiently capable" of  continuing their anti-terrorist measures.  (Algiers EL WATAN 12 May  94)      Egyptian Anti-Terrorism Productions To Be Broadcast     The 11 April edition of Algiers daily LIBERTE reported that  Algiers ENTV television plans to broadcast two Egyptian productions,  "al-'Ailah" ("The Family") and "al-Irhabi" ("The Terrorist"), both  of which both dealt with religious extremism and violence.  "Al-  'Ailah," an Egyptian television series, is scheduled to be broadcast  first, followed by a showing of the film, "al-Irhabi." (Algiers  LIBERTE 11 Apr 94; Algiers ALGERIE ACTUALITE 12-18 Apr 94)      Television Documentary on Origins of Armed Islamist Groups      The London-based expatriate magazine AL-MAJALLAH reported on an  Algerian television program by journalist Lotfi Cheriet called "al-  Kabus" ("The Nightmare"), a documentary about "terrorism and the  roots of political and fundamentalist violence in Algeria."  The 25-  minute program described the origins of armed Islamist groups from  the early 1980's.  Various viewpoints were presented, including  those of opponents of Islamist groups and "neutral" scholars.  In  addition, the documentary 4ncluded "provocative" statements by  Abdelkader Chakendi, a "repentant" former Islamist leader.  According to the article, Chakendi at one time worked with Said  Makhlouf i, leader of the Algerian "Afghans" and with Abdelkader  Chebouti, appointed by Ali Belhadj to be commander in chief of the  Armed Islamic Group (GIA).  The program also showed footage of  training centers established by the Islamists in late 1990.

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel Focus - The Caribbean: Ritual bonding for the family  -Martin Dickson, his wife and three children, go on a Club Med holiday in the Bahamas IT FIRST dawned on me that I might have come to the wrong place when this overly jolly and insistent man accosted me on the Club Med restaurant steps. 'Will you cheer for me in the lip-synching contest?' he demanded. At least, that's what I think he said. I was more intent on avoiding him than catching his precise words. I swerved out of his way. 'You've frightened him,' he was told by his giggling lady companion, like him a member of staff at the Club Med resort on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. He had, too. At the mere mention of the phrase 'audience participation,' I tend to break out in a sweat and look anxiously for the nearest exit. So on Day 1 of a week-long holiday I did not exactly welcome the idea of relentless, collective jollification. More fool you, you might say. After all, Club Med, arguably the greatest French cultural export of the past half century, with outposts scattered like the Foreign Legion across (mainly) hot and sandy regions of the globe, is known for little else but relentless, collective jollification. For sure, the popular image of Club Med's villages has them filled with clean-limbed, sun-kissed youths who spend the long, laughing tropical days in vigorous sporting activity, the evenings in hearty social bonding, and the nights in vigorous sexual bonding. The club's artful slogan hints at all these delights: 'Club Med, the antidote for civilisation.' But the dull old world of demographics, together with the profit motive, has encouraged Club Med to establish a group of villages very different from the archetype. These are family resorts, catering to the (very civilised) demands of an ageing baby-boom generation that goes on holiday with its children and needs them entertained. Eleuthera is just such a resort, offering a wide range of sporting and other activities for adults and children, together with an elaborate system of child-care that can take nasty little brats off their parents' hands from early in the morning until the middle of the evening, with only a small, late-afternoon break. Blissful images of lazy, child-free days filled my head as I booked an Eleuthera package for myself, wife and three children. I might spend a day soaking up the silence on the fine, pink-tinged sand of the palm-fringed beach, then drift through a few days of sailing, snorkelling, water-skiing and scuba diving. In the evenings, with the children sleeping off the day's activities, we would linger over meals of fine French cooking. Inevitably, reality did not entirely live up to this fantasy. Certainly, the food was very good and there was an extraordinary range of constantly-changing dishes. Club Med offers almost a dozen kinds of freshly-baked bread alone. The accommodation was a little spartan, but clean and quite sufficient for a holiday spent almost entirely out of doors. The kids' programme was certainly full, and among many other things gave our children the chance to water ski, go for sailing trips, scuba dive, snorkel, play soccer, golf and tennis, swim, find treasure and even become trapeze artists, thanks to the resort's own mini-circus. There were, however, two significant drawbacks. First, so many activities were crammed into the programme, and so many children were doing each one, that there was no time for a child to concentrate on getting one thing right  -and no opportunity to take private lessons outside the strict timetable. Take scuba diving. A couple of dozen children would spend half-an-hour or more hanging around the village swimming pool waiting for a mere one-minute swim with a scuba kit, followed by a pose in full gear for a photographer - a case of 'never mind real expertise, here's a pic to impress the folks back home.' Second, programmes like this are only as good as the camp instructors leading them and the size of the classes. Our eldest child, aged nine, and youngest, five, had good, enthusiastic minders and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. But our normally uncomplaining seven-year-old suffered from being in a large group led by young people whom we felt lacked sensitivity towards their charges. She was so unhappy that she spent much of the week moping around us. Goodbye peace and quiet. Goodbye sailing. Goodbye our reason for being in Club Med. Nor were the evenings entirely child-free. The club did entertain children while their parents ate an earlyish meal, and that was a boon. But far from collapsing into bed thereafter, virtually all the children in the village then converged on the club's open-air auditorium for a show which lasted until 10.30. By the end of the week, ours were distinctly ratty. It is one of Club Med's great traditions that there is a show in each village every night. They can be of a surprisingly reasonable standard and while they are put on by the phenomenally hard-working staff, some involve the guests, both children and adults. Each evening also ends with a ritual bonding activity - the collective singing of a silly pop song, accompanied by a choreography of absurd hand, arm, head and leg movements. Children love it, but it is not the kind of thing that comes easily to your average up-tight Englishman. For large parts of the day you can get away from such jollity, though it still tends to pop up unexpectedly. 'Before you can get on the boat, you must all say 'Hello, Captain Tom',' insisted the group leader on one snorkelling trip. We all said it - through gritted teeth. Still, there is something infectious about the Club Med atmosphere. Despite our reservations about the children's programme, we met many American families who swear by it and go back year after year to Eleuthera or the company's other Caribbean family resorts. And while these days it may not be an antidote to civilisation, it does break down inhibitions. Just ask the prominent American lawyer in our village who cavorted across the stage in one show clad in little more than his underpants. By the end of the week even I was twitching discreetly to the silly song. Club Med is still expanding. On November 6 it opens its first village in Australia, on Lindeman Island, in the Whitsunday and Cumberland island group just off the Queensland coast and two boat-hours west of the Great Barrier Reef. Accommodation for 550 guests is in three-storey, air-conditioned lodges. Club Med took control of the island in May 1991 and has spent Pounds 21m on refurbishing the resort. An inclusive week's stay (without flights) starts at Pounds 694 per adult and Pounds 347 per child (4-11 years of age). Flights to Australia from the UK can be arranged by Club Med from Pounds 750, as can stop-overs in Cairns and Sydney. Details of the Eleuthera resort and many others can be found in Club Med's Winter Sun '92-'93 brochure. It also has a skiing brochure. In London, Club Med is at 106-110 Brompton Rd, SW3 1JJ.

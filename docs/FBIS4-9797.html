			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Isabel Becerril] </F>   [Text] The industrial sector has stated it is determined to  fully support any actions President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  may take to solve the country's problems. The decision was made  after the more than 464 members of the National Association of  Processing Industry (Canacintra) executive commission and board  of directors decided to vote in favor of a motion proposed by  its president, Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez. During the meeting,  Terrones urged all Canacintra members not to allow any  nonfulfillments regarding the Stability, Competitiveness and  Employment Pact (Pece) "because at this time, the country's  situation is quite delicate."    As a result of the manufacturers' concern prompted by recent  developments in Mexico, Terrones Lopez said now more than ever  it is necessary for the country's industrial sector, regardless  of beliefs or affiliation, to join forces with the president in  order to strengthen the nation. He added it is not the president  who is in jeopardy now but, rather, the entire nation. "We must  unite so we can reclaim the levels of social peace, justice, and  liberty we once enjoyed only a few months ago," he said.    Replying to a question by a member who participated in the  monthly Canacintra meeting on 22 March on whether the president  had requested support from the manufacturers, Terrones Lopez  responded the president had not so requested. He added,  nevertheless, it was Canacintra's obligation to support the  country and that if they had to, they would back the president.    Likewise, the Canacintra leader requested its members remain  calm, saying the country's authorities were already taking the  necessary measures to prevent the country from falling apart.  The Canacintra president urged his associates not to become too  apprehensive, saying, "at this time it is important for us to  work." He said apprehension is the first step in demoralizing a  country or making it deteriorate further. He promised the more  than 464 Canacintra manufacturers there will be peace and that  they will seek to ensure certainty "but that no way will they  abandon President Salinas."    During the meeting, it was agreed that all delegates  throughout the Mexican republic would immediately contact their  respective state governments to offer support. Likewise, they  would conduct a campaign to urge all sectors of the country to  remain united to support the institutions. They reiterated their  commitment, respect, encouragement, and unrestricted support to  the president concerning the measures he may adopt to clarify  the events troubling the nation. Terrones said the country's  manufacturers are aware the economic program has been adequate  and that from that viewpoint we can conclude there is a need for  the manufacturing sector to integrate, and "in this we will not  fail."</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> China is banning cigarette and liquor imports this year to save foreign  currency and end abuses in its foreign trade system, official reports said.  China Daily quoted Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Minister Zheng Tuobin  as also announcing a ban on reselling export licenses and tightening controls  on imports of all products that can be made in China. The newspaper did not say  when the restrictions will take effect. A ban last year on sales of foreign  cigarettes did little to slow their widespread smuggling into China.  </P></p>

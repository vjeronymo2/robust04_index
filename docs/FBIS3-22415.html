			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed item under "Courier of the S&amp;T Revolution" </F> rubric: "Chemical Weapons Are a Threat to the Ecology"]    [Text] Chemical weapons lost their significance after the  appearance of the atomic bomb. However, their production is  continuing in Russia, a fact which threatens the ecology. Lev  Fedorov, a scientist and chemist, made this declaration  intending to cause a sensation, on the occasion of presenting  his book "Chemical Weapons in Russia: History, Ecology,  Politics."    In the scientific work which he presented, Doctor of  Chemical  Sciences Fedorov makes public a survey of the events connected  with the activities of the military-chemical complex, whose  secrets have traditionally been held "behind seven seals."    The book is full of sensations. In particular, the scientist  asserts that there are about 100 geographic regions in Russia,  where it is a threat to one's life and health to live, as a  result of the production, testing or storage of toxic substances  for military use.</p>

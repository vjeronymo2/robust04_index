			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: USG reaches agreement with creditors USG, the parent company of US Gypsum, North America's largest gypsum producer, filed a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganisation plan yesterday which it said would cut its debt obligations by about Dollars 1.4bn and reduce annual interest requirements by about Dollars 200m, Reuter reports from Wilmington. It said the ownership interests of current stockholders would be diluted significantly. The plan also calls for a restructuring of bank debt. Under a pre-packaged scheme, a company reaches agreement on a restructuring with its creditors before filing for bankruptcy, minimising the time it spends under the authority of the court. 'USG has solicited and received sufficient acceptances to confirm the pre-packaged plan, one of the largest pre-packaged reorganisations to date,' said Mr Richard Fleming, USG vice-president and treasurer. He added that 'USG's primary goal is to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as possible and to minimise the impact on our employees, our unimpaired creditors and our operating subsidiaries.' USG listed assets of Dollars 1.8bn and liabilities of Dollars 3.1bn, including Dollars 1.7bn in unsecured debt.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rutland Trust suffers 20% fall to Pounds 8m RUTLAND Trust, the financial services group and property surveyor, yesterday revealed a 20 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.2m for the year to December 31. The result, struck on turnover 26 per cent lower at Pounds 94.6m, was further depressed below the line by a Pounds 3.3m charge (Pounds 4.9m profit) for losses on the sale of the computer equipment leasing arm, Technology Group. The group's three divisions - corporate and asset financing, and professional services - had all returned profits. However, losses in the building surveying arm held back growth in professional services where profits rose from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3.3m. Mr Michael Langdon, chairman, said costs in building surveying had been cut and the division was now breaking even. Loss adjusting, meanwhile, enjoyed increased turnover and the division had been expanded with three new offices. Asset financing, most of which is the company's vehicle leasing business, saw the sharpest drop in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.56m. The corporate finance/head office division saw a 21 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3m. Rutland ended the year with net cash of Pounds 19.5m. Mr Langdon said the group had seen 'a number of opportunities in the business services sector . . . We are not going to sit looking at a cash pile forever.' Earnings per share fell from 2.38p to 1.8p. A maintained final dividend of 0.53p makes a same-again 0.8p total.</p>

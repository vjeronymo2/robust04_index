			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Wellcome opts for single global auditor The board of Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, has approved a plan to remove accountants Touche Ross and appoint Coopers &amp; Lybrand as sole global auditor and lead tax consultant from the start of next year. Details of the plan emerged after the company announced on Friday the surprise departure of Mr John Precious, the finance director, who it said was leaving 'to pursue other opportunities'. This was the latest in a series of boardroom and management changes, presided over by Mr John Robb, chairman and chief executive. However, Mr Justin Court, group financial controller, stressed yesterday: 'I really want to be utterly categorical that there is no connection with the departure of Mr Precious.' He said the controller's department had begun considering a change to a single firm a year ago in an effort to save costs. 'It has been in the pipeline for a long time. This will provide fee synergies. Our level of indulgence has gone down somewhat. We are quite keen to get a bit more briskness.' He said Coopers won the audit following a 'beauty parade' in March which included the three other firms that audit Wellcome subsidiaries around the world: Touche Ross, Price Waterhouse and KPMG Peat Marwick. Mr Court expected the company's total audit fee - which was Pounds 800,000 last year - to fall by between 30 and 40 per cent. But he said that Coopers, the UK's largest firm, had won the contract primarily because of its strength in the pharmaceuticals sector. He said price was 'an issue but not the issue'. Some Wellcome executives are believed to have expressed anxieties about Touche following last year's reprimand of Trafalgar House, one of its audit clients, by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog. But Mr Court said this was not a factor in the selection. Wellcome's decision is the latest in a trend among international companies to appoint a single global firm of accountants as auditors, which often saves considerable costs. For example, Touche Ross itself has recently gained the worldwide audits of Reed-Elsevier and Credit Lyonnais. Coopers is global auditor to companies including Glaxo. Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil and a non-executive director of Wellcome, said: 'The company has used a number of auditors around the world. It has changed shape and it was time to appraise the benefit of having a single auditor. All company audit committees should do this.'</p>

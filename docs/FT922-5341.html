			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / People: John Lewis promotes The John Lewis Partnership is to have a new chairman from February 1 1993, only the fifth since the retailing company was established in 1864. Deputy chairman Stuart Hampson, 45, will take over from Peter Lewis, who is retiring then, at 63 years old. Because of the particular nature of John Lewis's constitution, the chairman potentially wields considerable power. There are three effective authorities of the company: the chairman of the trust company (hence the title 'partnership'), created in 1929, which manages the share capital on behalf of permanently employed staff, or partners; the central council, representing all levels of the company; and the 12 central board directors. By taking over as chairman, Hampson heads both the trust company and the central board. He will inherit an absolute veto over policy decisions and will appoint all senior management figures. Hampson was educated at the Royal Masonic school in Bushey, Hertfordshire, going on to, first, Wilbraham Academy in Massachusetts and thence to St John's, Oxford to study modern languages. He joined the UK Board of Trade in 1969, and in 1978 was appointed principal private secretary to Roy Hattersley, then secretary of state for prices and consumer protection. Hampson continued in the civil service until 1982, when he joined John Lewis as a senior trainee. He was made deputy chairman in May 1989. He clearly feels the weight of history on his shoulders. 'Appointment as the fifth head of a 128-year-old business is bound to instil a sense of history and tradition, but the Partnership's system of democratic ownership, and its distinctive trading policies, are as relevant to the competitive conditions of the 1990's and the next century as they were in the 1930's' he says, refusing to elaborate until he takes over. Hampson is the second chairman drawn from outside the Lewis family. Sir Bernard Miller was chairman between 1955-1972.</p>

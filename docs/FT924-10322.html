			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Banks unveil plan to prop up ailing loans: The Banks JAPANESE banks yesterday unveiled plans for a loan and land purchase company intended to clean up a banking system troubled by non-performing loans and stimulate the property market, the collapse of which has created the problem. The size of the bad loan burden was highlighted by a ministry of finance announcement that the non-performing loans of the leading 21 Japanese banks rose by 54 per cent to Y12,300bn (Pounds 62bn) in the six months to the end of September. The ministry also said valuation losses on bank's stock portfolios had more than doubled over the past year. Eleven leading Japanese banks last night revised down their first-half earnings forecasts by between 27 and 60 per cent, blaming the decline on appraisal losses on their securities holdings and on increases in their reserves for bad loans. Fuji Bank said that its pre-tax profits would be Y29bn, about 55 per cent lower than forecast, while the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan revised down its estimate by 56.6 per cent to Y23bn, and the Industrial Bank of Japan cut its forecast by 49 per cent to Y35.5bn. Finance ministry officials said the fall in stock and property prices had eroded the asset base of leading banks, putting them under increasing pressure to write off non-performing loans, a process which will be quickened by the industry-funded body. The Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan, conscious of public criticism of proposed government assistance to banks, said the new company, expected to be established before the end of the year, will be entirely self-funded. The company will have an initial capital of Y6bn, shared among participating banks, which will also provide low-interest funds for the purchase of their own non-performing loans at a discount to face value - that discount, in principle, will be based on an independent valuation of the loan's property collateral. With the non-performing loans transferred to the new company, banks will be able to write off some of their losses in the current financial year, while the company will then become responsible for finding purchasers for the prop erty. Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said the establishment of the company is 'very timely', and he was confident that the valuation of the property, to be done by a panel of accountants and valuers, would stimulate the ailing property market. However, the banks are offloading the loans because they cannot find purchasers for the property and it is not clear that the new company will be able to find buyers. If that is the case, the bank which originally transferred the loan would be required to buy the rights to the property back at a much later date. The establishment of the new body enables the banks to spread the losses associated with the non-performing loans. It is expected that the valuation panel will assess the collateral at higher than market prices, creating a small write-off this year, and that the afflicted bank will take a second hit in a few years' time, when its asset base has strengthened.</p>

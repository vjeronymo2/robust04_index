			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Clyde Blowers falls 73% to Pounds 34,000 Clyde Blowers, the mechanical engineer based in Scotland, returned profits of Pounds 33,723 for the half year to end-February, a 73 per cent downturn on the Pounds 126,207 reported last time. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.12m). Earnings fell to 2.5p (9.2p) but the interim dividend is a same-again 0.83p.

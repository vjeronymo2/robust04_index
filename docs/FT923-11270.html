			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): CGT bill on property I OWN a freehold upper floor maisonette in Tooting, London, which was bequeathed to me by my mother 20 years ago. If I sold this property - which I have rented out, off and on, but which is now empty - would I be exempt from capital gains tax and inheritance tax? Alternatively, if I made a gift of it to my daughters, would they be liable for capital gains tax should they decide to sell it? If you move into the maisonette before contracting to sell it, and give the appropriate main-residence notices under section 101(5)(a) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 (or the corresponding provision section 222(5)(a) of the taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992), you should significantly reduce the prospective CGT bill - subject to any anti-avoidance legislation in the Finance (No 2) Act 1992, of course. If you give the maisonette to your daughter, you will have the same CGT bill as if you had sold it to her at its current market value (although you could pay the CGT by instalments, with interest). The term 'heritage property' refers to property which forms part of the national heritage - not simply to property which has been inherited. Your best plan is to consult a solicitor who is competent in the tax law and practice relating to domestic property transactions. As a first step, you could ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses) and CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / People: ICI appoints finance director Alan Spall, 49, has been appointed finance director of Imperial Chemical Industries as part of a move to bring some younger faces into the increasingly elderly boardroom of Britain's biggest chemicals company. Spall, who joined ICI in 1970 after qualifying as a chartered accountant with Thomson McLintock, takes over from Colin Short, 59, who is being moved sideways. Short, a former treasurer of Chevron who joined ICI in 1990, has been given responsibility for the eastern hemisphere, which will enable him to devote more time to his new job as deputy chairman of ICI Australia, ICI's biggest affiliate. Short retains responsibility for planning. ICI plays down any suggestion that Short, who played a key role in defending the company against Hanson, has been demoted. Short is less than three years away from retirement and knows the eastern hemisphere well from his days in the oil industry. Sir Denys Henderson, 61, the chairman of ICI, and chief executive Ronnie Hampel, 61, are both expected to retire in 1995 and ICI is keen to bring a younger generation of managers into the boardroom. The effect of the current changes is to reduce the average age of the ICI executive directors from 57 to 54. The company announced yesterday that Chris Hampson will leave next April when he reaches the normal retirement age of 62 and will be replaced on the board by Mike Brogden, 55, who joined ICI in 1960 as a technical officer in the dyestuffs division. Brogden has been chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers since May 1992 and will retain his responsibility when he joins the board next May. The latest reshuffle does not appear to give any more clues as to the likely successors to Henderson and Hampel, who have both agreed to stay on after the normal ICI retirement age. Although Spall, ICI's general manager in charge of finance, is under 50, Rob Margetts, 47, who has been on the ICI board for over a year, is still regarded as the front runner.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subsidiary Versus Consolidated Capital Structure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where a regulated company is a wholly owned subsidiary which obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent company, regulators often use the capital structure of the consolidated system (i.e., the parent company and all of its subsidiaries) in computing the WACC. The consolidated capital structure is an appropriate capitalization to use in calculating a regulated subsidiary's WACC when: (1) No substantial minority interest in the subsidiary exists (i.e., the regulated subsidiary is wholly-owned by a parent company or nearly so), and (2) the risks are similar between the parent and subsidiary. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  In such a situation, investors' appraisals of the parent company's common stock are thought to represent the best measure of the current cost of common-stock equity to the subsidiary. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  When the consolidated capital structure is used, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity capital (issued by the parent company), the consolidated system's cost of preferred stock, and the consolidated system's cost of long-term debt, rather than the respective capital component costs of the regulated subsidiary, are also used because the consolidated capital structure directly affects the capital component costs of the consolidated system and not those of the subsidiary. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  The use of the regulated subsidiary's capital component costs is inconsistent with the use of the consolidated system's capital structure and could, therefore, distort the WACC estimate obtained for the regulated subsidiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The use of the consolidated capital structure differs from the ``double leverage'' concept used by some expert witnesses. The latter approach uses the parent company's WACC as a measure of the subsidiary's cost of common-stock equity capital along with the subsidiary's capital structure, the subsidiary's cost of preferred stock, and the subsidiary's cost of debt. Those that favor the use of such a method cite the advantage of using the actual data of the subsidiary for which an allowable rate of return is being computed. The merits of the approach are highly debatable, however, since it could produce an estimate of the cost of common-stock equity capital for the regulated subsidiary that is lower than the opportunity cost of such capital when the subsidiary is more risky than the parent, and an estimate that is higher when the subsidiary is less risky. The Commission's proposed rule does not, therefore, rely on the double leverage method of calculating the WACC for a regulated subsidiary company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> J. Rhoads Foster, ``Fair Return Criteria and Estimation,'' 28 Baylor L. Rev. 889 (1976), in Charles E. Phillips,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4, at 392.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To see how a company's capital structure could affect its component capital costs, consider, for example, the case of a heavily-leveraged company (i.e., one that has a relatively large proportion of debt in its capital structure). Such a company could be perceived by current and potential debtholders and equityholders as having a relatively high probability of bankruptcy (in which case coupon and dividend payments would be discontinued and the possibility that principal could also be lost would be heightened) and, therefore, as being a relatively high risk investment. Debtholders and equityholders would require a return on their investment funds that is commensurate with the relatively high risk of such a company in order for them to be willing to purchase and hold the company's debt and common stock. A heavily leveraged firm could, therefore, have relatively high costs of debt and common-stock equity capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of the consolidated capital structure is not correct, however, when a substantial minority interest in the regulated subsidiary exists, or when the regulated subsidiary's risk differs substantially from that of the parent company. The appropriate approach in this situation is to ignore the parent-subsidiary relationship and to estimate the subsidiary's WACC using the subsidiary's own capital structure and capital component costs. This method, referred to as the ``stand alone'' or ``subsidiary approach,'' recognizes the subsidiary as an independent operating company, and its cost of common-stock equity capital is inferred as the cost of common-stock equity of firms having risk comparable to that of the subsidiary. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  The basis for this method is that the required return on an investment depends on its risk (i.e., the subsidiary's risk) rather than on the parent's financing costs. In short, this method emphasizes the use, rather than the source, of the subsidiary's capital funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The issue of selecting an appropriate sample of firms having risk similar to that of the regulated company under consideration is explored in detail below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's proposed rule specifies that a subsidiary carrier's capital structure is to be used in computing the WACC unless, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission determines that: (1) The subsidiary carrier's parent company issues publicly traded common-stock equity; (2) no substantial minority interest in the subsidiary carrier exists; and (3) risks are similar between the subsidiary carrier and the parent company. Under the proposed rule, no substantial minority interest in a subsidiary carrier exists when a parent company owns 90 percent or more of the subsidiary's voting shares of stock. It also must be demonstrated that both the business and the financial risks facing the parent and subsidiary are similar. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Business risk is the variability that a company's internal (e.g., the skill levels and salaries of employees) and external (e.g., the number of competitors) operating variables impart to the earnings available to investors because of the fundamental nature of the company's business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Financial risk is the additional variability that debt and preferred stock financing impart to the earnings available to common-stock equityholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Such an evaluation may involve a comparison of such financial risk measures as total capitalization and debt-to-equity ratios, investment quality ratings on short-and long-term debt instruments, and coverage ratios such as the times interest earned and fixed charges coverage ratios. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  There must also be an assessment of the degree to which the regulated subsidiary comprises the parent's holdings. To the extent that a subsidiary accounts for a substantial majority of the consolidated system's revenues, expenses, and profits, the business risks of the parent and subsidiary would, in general, be the same. However, where a parent's holdings are diversified into areas of business unrelated to the regulated subsidiary, the business risks of the parent and of the subsidiary are more likely to differ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Times interest earned ratios (``TIER'') measure the extent to which operating income can decline before a firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. TIER is computed by dividing a firm's earnings before interest and taxes by the firms' annual interest expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fixed charges coverage ratio (``FCCR'') measures the ability of a firm to satisfy all of its fixed obligations. FCCR is computed by dividing the total of net income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and the provision for income taxes, by fixed charges. Fixed charges are the total of interest expense, principal payments, and capital lease obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule states that the Commission shall consider some or all of the aforementioned business and financial risk criteria in determining whether to approve the use of a consolidated system's capital structure and component costs in computing the subsidiary's WACC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other measures of business and financial risks may also be used in comparing the risk of a parent with the risk of a subsidiary. These could include those discussed later for selecting an appropriate proxy group of firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Stepan Topal, president of the Gagauz </F> Republic, by G. Golya; place and date not given: "Stepan Topal:  'I Believe in the Wisdom of New Politicians....'"]    [Text] To the surprise of many people, the residents  of rayons densely settled by the Gagauz population displayed the  greatest activity during a parliamentary elections held in the  republic and the sociological poll "Council With the People." As  late as two weeks before the election, the local administration  spoke about the intention of a majority of the population not to  participate in these actions.    However, the politicians of Chisinau and Komrat  summoned up the courage to rise above past wrongs and to take  steps toward each other. As a result, about 100,000 citizens of  Moldova of Gagauz nationality who desire peace and stability on  this rich land were given an opportunity to take advantage of  the right to vote. Their hearts are alive with the new hope that  the confrontation will come to an end, and that the Gagauz knot  which has been tightly tied over the last three years will be  untied reasonably. This is how our dialogue with Stepan Topal,  then president of the unrecognized Gagauz Republic, began.    [Topal] The elections proceeded successfully, and political  life has calmed down somewhat. A session of our parliament held  on 11 March ratified the results of the sociological poll during  which an absolute majority of the Gagauz came out in favor of  Moldova's independence. Simultaneously, we held a referendum  during which local residents came out in favor of the existence  of the Gagauz Republic within a united Moldova.    We now live in anticipation--anticipating that the  leadership  of Moldova in the person of President Snegur and the political  forces that have come to power will keep their election promises  and solve the Gagauz problem.    We are satisfied with the results of the elections; after  all, precisely those parties that the Gagauz population  supported have come to power. Both the Agrarian-Democratic Party  and the Socialist Party have given positive assurances to the  effect that they will resolve the Gagauz issue at the very first  session.    [Golya] Did this promise prompt the Gagauz administration to  reconsider its original decision?    [Topal] Not just this. Perhaps the Congress "Our Home--the  Republic of Moldova" which was held in early February was the  turning point. For the first time in the last three years  President Snegur and other leaders from Chisinau officially  stated at the congress that the Republic of Moldova is building  its own statehood, not striving to unite with Romania, will  ensure equal rights for all its citizens, and will not allow  them to be infringed upon.    This coincides fully with our position; for three years we  have been fighting for Moldova's sovereignty and independence.  It appears that our intentions coincide at present.    Being aware of the situation, we accommodated them, opened  polling stations, and facilitated active participation of the  people in the elections, although we were apprehensive about  being cheated yet again by Moldovan politicians. The ball is in  Chisinau's court. We would like to hope that our worst  apprehensions will not come true.    [Golya] What is the explanation for the fact that most  voters  in areas densely settled by the Gagauz population voted in favor  of the Electoral Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Unity  Movement?    [Topal] Perhaps it is due to their having worked with the  voters more. To be sure, quite a few Gagauz voted in favor of  the Agrarian-Democratic Party. Judging by their programs, these  very political forces are capable of justifying our  expectations. A bigger vote for the Socialists might also have  been due to the fact that most of the candidates from the  Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova were also members of the  old parliament. They were not able to resolve the Gagauz issue,  and for this reason the voters had less confidence in them.    [Golya] Stepan Mikhaylovich, at the outset, when fundamental  differences existed between Komrat and Chisinau, you cooperated  with the Dniester area and provided feasible support to each  other. How are your mutual relations developing at present?    [Topal] Normally. We have signed a treaty of friendship and  cooperation and we fully comply with it. The Dniester area has  helped us with the necessary energy resources and other  materials. We believe that the problems of the Dniester area and  Gagauzia should be solved in parallel. Failure to solve the  Gagauz problem will affect the Dniester area, and the other way  around. It is necessary to resolve the status of the Dniester  area and Gagauzia as soon as possible and to determine the state  structure of Moldova.    [Golya] How do you see it?    [Topal] We should proceed from reality. We believe that, by  all signs, a federated or confederated structure is the most  realistic under current conditions. I do not understand why some  politicians and statesmen of Moldova are in mortal fear of this.  After all, there have been dozens of examples throughout the  world of countries with federated structures retaining their  integrity.    Such is our opinion. It virtually does not contradict the  draft law on Gagauz Eri autonomous oblast within the framework  of which President Snegur proposes to solve the problem.    However, this should be a draft developed with the  participation of our representatives rather than the one that  was written in one night in the office of Mr. Arseni. Many  questions were raised concerning this document in Strasbourg  during an expert evaluation. We are now forwarding our  clarifications to the Council of Europe and hope that the new  parliament will discuss a draft law which is drawn up with our  remarks taken into account.    [Golya] Perhaps some problems of the Gagauz may and should  be  solved within the framework of the Law on Ethnic Minorities,  too....    [Topal] Possibly. We are prepared to participate in its  development in order to ensure guaranteed rights for all  residents of Moldova. However, it should be kept in mind that  the Gagauz do not consider themselves an ethnic minority. I  would like to ask those who maintain this: Where do the Gagauz  form an "ethnic majority?" We will not reach an accord if we  once again begin by discriminating against an entire people, the  Gagauz people. In the old parliament we heard enough statements  to the effect that the Gagauz are strangers, that they are not a  people.    [Golya] Some Gagauz were elected to parliament only on the  ticket of the Agrarian-Democratic Party because from the  beginning of the election campaign you actually ignored the  latter. Are those too few, perhaps?    [Topal] The Gagauz should receive a quota of their own in  the  new parliament, just as in the structures of executive power. We  hope that the new parliament will show understanding for this  problem and will give our representatives an opportunity to work  within the state structures. Otherwise it would be difficult to  say that our problem has been completely solved. The point is  that the Gagauz who came to the parliament on the tickets of  various parties represent themselves rather than the Gagauz  people. They live in Chisinau, and their hearts do not exactly  bleed for their fellow Gagauz. This is not a rebuke to them;  such is reality.    [Golya] How do you structure your foreign policy?    [Topal] We consider ourselves to be an autonomous entity  within the Republic of Moldova, and proceed from this.  Naturally, if the Gagauz problem is solved we will have no claim  to pursuing our own foreign policy.    We believe that these issues, as well as defense, state  security, and some other crucial problems should be the  prerogative of Chisinau rather than the local organs of power.  At the same time, a close relationship has developed between us  and Turkey because it is a kindred country. We have specific  plans concerning economic cooperation. For example, it is  planned to build a tile plant in Komrat in which the Turkish  side is prepared to invest 30-35 percent.    There are also plans to provide telephone communications in  Komrat and the entire Budzhak region with the help of the  Turkish company TRT. In addition, the late President of Turkey  Turgut Ozal promised to allocate $35 million for the development  of the Gagauz region. It was planned to use the funds, for  example, to complete the construction of the "South" canal so as  to finally provide water for the entire region which has been  officially acknowledged to be a zone of marginal farming.    In a word, there are many plans. The Consulate of Turkey in  Chisinau is giving us all kinds of assistance. For example,  owing to the consulate, about 200 of our students are already  studying in Turkey.    Otherwise, implementation of the plan depends entirely on  how  the parliament solves our problem. If there is peace and  tranquility, there will be investment and support from developed  countries.    [Golya] As far as is known, for now you advocate the  ratification of all agreements within the framework of the CIS  and the Economic Union.    [Topal] Naturally, we believe that there is no other way  out.  The abandonment of traditional economic relations in the absence  of real integration with the West has brought about the economic  catastrophe all of us are facing.    [Golya] What solution to the language problem do you see?  Are  you personally fluent in the Moldovan language?    [Topal] Personally, like most elderly Gagauz, I know the  Moldovan language, although I am not perfectly fluent in it.    I see a solution to this problem in creating normal  conditions for language instruction rather than in forcible  Moldovization or, worse yet, Romanization. Attempts at forcibly  making us learn the language caused a negative response. The  Gagauz began to pull their children out of Moldovan day care  centers and stopped learning the language. This would not have  happened had an opportunity been given to study the language  voluntarily and normal conditions provided. The Gagauz are not  against the Moldovan language; they are against discrimination  along language lines. The new parliament has a duty to postpone  certification, if not cancel it; this would substantially reduce  confrontation in our society.    [Golya] We are now in the third year since the day you were  elected president. During this time you have seen few pleasant  moments and have heard many threats. Do you regret putting this  heavy burden on your shoulders?    [Topal] I am not a politician; all my life I have worked on  road construction. However, since the people elected me, I must  pull my weight until the end. You cannot cheat your destiny.</p>

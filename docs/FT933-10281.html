			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Aylwin speeds rights trials President Patricio Aylwin has attempted to close a chapter of Chilean history by speeding up the trials of officials accused of human rights abuses under the previous military government of General Augusto Pinochet, writes David Pilling in Santiago. In an eagerly awaited national address on Tuesday night, Mr Aylwin proposed the appointment of special judges who would be given the responsibility of rapidly processing the trials, which have become bogged down in the legal system. Judges would hear evidence in secret in an attempt to learn the truth quickly and, where possible, to discover the whereabouts of missing bodies, the prime concern of most victims' families. There are more than 2,000 cases of extra-judicial killings and disappearances, most of them brought to light in a 1991 report commissioned by the government. A 1978 amnesty law precludes punishment of abuses committed between 1973 and 1978 - the bloodiest period of the Pinochet regime.</p>

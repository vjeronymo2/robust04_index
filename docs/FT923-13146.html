			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg shivers in political chill  -The JSE is keeping a nervous eye on the ANC's popular campaign SOUTH Africa's recent political tribulations have blown a chill wind over the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), which is keeping a nervous eye on the African National Congress's (ANC) mass action campaign in an effort to discern what sort of future faces the country. The timing of last week's market fall followed comments from Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, making clear that there would be no quick return to the negotiating table following the collapse of constitutional talks last month. Until that point, the market had tended to assume that it was witnessing a lovers' quarrel rather than parties seeking a separation. Like most people, it had been duped into believing that the government and the ANC were close to a settlement, whereas it is now clear that they remain deeply divided on fundamental issues. The overall index slipped by 5.4 per cent to 3,483 between July 3 and last Friday. Over the same week the industrial index lost 4.8 per cent, having earlier been down by 6 per cent; gold shares declined marginally. This week, the overall index began by shedding a further 1 per cent, or 35 points, on Monday, and declined 15 points to 3,432 yesterday. The industrial index fell 24 points yesterday to 4,226. One beneficiary of the JSE's misfortunes has been the capital markets, where rates on the Eskom 168 and government R150 bonds fell last Friday to 2 1/2  year lows. The wave of buying here reflects the view that bonds are the only asset that will perform in the current political climate. Mr Charles Booth, research director at stockbroker JD Anderson, says the direction of the equity market from here will be determined by politics. If the mass action campaign really bites, he believes that the market could well go lower. If it turns out to be a damp squib then it will probably stay at current levels. 'I cannot see it going up until all parties are back at the table and talking,' he adds. Mr Graham Boyd, an economist at stockbroker Simpson McKie, cautions, however, that reading the politics right in South Africa has often meant getting the market wrong. While the JSE is focused on politics now, it could shift back to more traditional fundamentals. Here there is little cause for optimism. The date for an economic recovery to commence is being pushed back all the time and there is consensus that 1992 will be a year of decline in GDP. Last week's correction eliminates the unexpected rally which took place during May and June, leaving prices where they were three months ago. While the market is still perceived to be in high territory, Mr Booth says research done at his firm, putting their own fair value on leading industrial companies, suggests that the market is only overvalued by about 4 per cent - assuming a reasonable economic recovery next year. Mining shares have, in general, caught a cold along with the rest of the market. Although metal prices have been a bit firmer recently, the stronger commercial rand has had a dampening effect on gold, platinum and coal share prices. Although, at this stage, the market looks more likely to go down than up, there are two bull factors to be considered. One is the downward trend in interest rates, with at least one more rate cut expected this year. The other is the healthy state of the gold and foreign exchange reserves, which traditionally lend support to the JSE. Neither should that ephemeral creature, confidence, be left out of the equation, especially in a country where exaggerated swings in sentiment are part of the landscape. Should the South African rugby team manage to achieve back to back defeats over the All Blacks and the Wallabies in a month's time, old hands would not be found betting against a rise in the market.</p>

The chairman of the right-wing extremist Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), which surprisingly came out  on top in last December's elections, said that a "Berlin-Moscow  axis," to be extended to the Indian capital Delhi, should secure  stability in Europe and Asia.    At a joint press conference with Munich publisher and  chairman of the extreme right-wing German People's Union (DVU),  Gerhard Frey, Zhirinovskiy said he is in favor of large-scale  joint German-Russian projects. This should include a highway  from Berlin via Kaliningrad and Moscow to Vladivostok. He also  demanded more German language teaching in Russian schools. The  LDPR leader spoke out against ethnic German Russians leaving the  country. They should be kept in Russia, where there is plenty  of space for more settlers from Germany. Together with Frey,  Zhirinovskiy laid a wreath at the memorial of the soldiers  killed in the war against Napoleon's troops, to commemorate the  Russians "who liberated Europe together with the Germans."    Again, Zhirinovskiy demanded the resignation of Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Economics Minister Alexandr Shokhin,  and the head of the privatization authority, Anatoliy Chubays,  the last reformer in the cabinet. According to Zhirinovskiy,  all three are politicians who want to keep Russia down. Kozyrev  could only save his skin if he took a "clear pro-Serbian  position" immediately. Also, the government must demand an end  to the international blockade of Serbia, Libya, and Iraq. It  should, furthermore, reintegrate the Crimea into the Russian  Federation because the people there no longer want to be part of  Ukraine.    According to the Russian news agencies, the Public  Prosecutor  in Moscow has instituted proceedings against Zhirinovskiy,  accusing him of warmongering. Zhirinovskiy called these reports  a "hoax." According to INTERFAX, the proceedings were instituted  following inquiries by various public authorities, mass media,  and private individuals.</p>

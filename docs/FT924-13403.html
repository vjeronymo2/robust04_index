			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Earnings halved at Reynolds Metals THE SLUGGISH world economy and weak aluminium prices cut Reynolds Metals' earnings in half in the third quarter. Income fell to Dollars 20.8m, or 35 cents per share, compared with Dollars 41.5m, or 70 cents, in the same period last year. For the first nine months of the year, Reynolds reported earnings of Dollars 67.2m, or Dollars 1.13 per share, down sharply from Dollars 130.4m, or Dollars 2.20, in 1991. Third-quarter sales rose slightly to Dollars 1.48bn, from Dollars 1.44bn a year ago. For the nine-month period sales were Dollars 4.31bn, down from Dollars 4.34bn. 'Reynolds' results reflect the continuation of severely depressed aluminium prices due to the weaker than expected economic recovery and the worldwide oversupply situation,' said Mr Richard Holder, chairman and chief executive. 'Considering the economic climate, shipments were strong during the quarter,' he said. Reynolds' aluminium shipments totalled 388,300 tonnes in the quarter, and 1.115m tonnes for the first nine months, up from 386,400 and 1.088m tonnes respectively in 1991. Despite the dramatic earnings decline, the results were in line, or even slightly better, than Wall Street expectations. Reynolds closed down Dollars 2 per share at Dollars 49 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

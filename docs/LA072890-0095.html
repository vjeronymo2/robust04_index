			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS HAVE 4-3 LEAD OVER BRAVES IN SEVENTH  </P> <P> The Dodgers' long, frustrating struggle to replace the injured Orel Hershiser  continued Friday night with no end in sight.  </P> <P> As a matter of fact, Friday night's game against the Atlanta Braves at Dodger  Stadium seemed, at times, to have no end sight either.  </P> <P> The Dodgers led, 4-3, in the seventh inning and seemingly threatened to go on  so long that Hershiser himself, not due back until season's end at the  earliest, might have a chance to get in a few innings.  </P> <P> After more than three hours of walks errors and wild pitches, the crowd of  40,907, was just getting up for the seventh-inning stretch.  </P> <P> The game began at an agonizingly slow pace, but the Braves wasted little time  in scoring.  </P> <P> After Dodger starter Terry Wells had walked Jim Presley to open the second,  Dale Murphy slammed his 16th home run of the season deep into the left-field  pavilion between the 370- and 385-foot sign.  </P> <P> It was a memorable homer for Murphy, his 370th lifetime, moving him past Ralph  Kiner into a tie with Gil Hodges and Dave Winfield for 33rd on the all-time  list.  </P> <P> But the night was anything but memorable for Wells.  </P> <P> After losing Murphy, he seemed to lose his control and, perhaps, his hopes of  filling that troublesome fifth spot in the Dodger rotation. Although the next  two Braves got aboard, Wells got ahead of pitcher Tom Glavine with two quick  strikes only to walk him, loading the bases.  </P> <P> Goodby Wells.  </P> <P> Hartley came on to turn the Braves back without any further damage, but there  seems no relief in sight as the Dodgers as they continue their frustrating  search for a replacement for Hershiser.  </P> <P> John Wetteland, Mike Maddux, Tim Crews and Wells have all taken a shot. The  result is a 1-7 mark over 13 starts.  </P> <P> Things weren't much brighter Friday night on the Braves' side where Glavine,  the starter, did plenty of struggling of his own.  </P> <P> Glavine surrendered the tying runs in the third. Hubie Brooks got one home on a  fielder's choice following a double by Kirk Gibson and a walk to Kal Daniels.  Glavine gave up the other on a bases-loaded walk to Jose Vizcaino.  </P> <P> In all, Glavine, who had walked a total of six over his last four starts,  walked that many through 4 1/3 innings Friday.  </P> <P> At that point, he departed after giving up back-to-back singles to Juan Samuel  and Vizcaino.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn then got Samuel home on a sacrifice fly to left off  Doug Sisk.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Better luck last time: Tom Glavine was also the starter for the Braves last  July 27th. That day, Dale Murphy hit two home runs behind him as Glavine  breezed over the San Francisco Giants, 10-1. . . . No change in the status of  shortstop Alfredo Griffin following an examination by Dr. Matthew Bernstein  Friday. Griffin remains day to day due to continued sensitivity to light in his  left eye, the lingering result of a fight in a Pittsburgh bar last weekend.  Griffin will be reexamined Monday, but could possibly see action in this  series. . . . Pitchers Don Aase and Pat Perry, both recovering from shoulder  problems, threw before the game. Aase pitched a simulated game for about 15  minutes. Perry threw in the bullpen. . . . Fernando Valenzuela (8-8) will face  John Smoltz (7-7) in tonight's game, scheduled for a 7:05 start.  </P></p>

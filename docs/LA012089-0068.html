			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DISCARNATES' TAPS COMMON DESIRE  </P> <P> "The Discarnates" (Little Tokyo Cinema 1) connects with our deepest longings in  a remarkably potent fashion. Who, after all, has not yearned for a reunion with  long-gone loved ones? The challenge, of course, is to make such an encounter  convincing and to give it some larger purpose. Director Nobuhiko Obayashi  accomplishes this and more in his graceful, mysterious heart-tugging fantasy of  the supernatural, which Shinichi Ichikawa adapted from Taichi Yamada's novel.  </P> <P> Harada (Morio Kazama) is a dapper, successful, 40-year-old writer of TV soap  operas. He lives alone in a handsome, sleekly modern flat in a building in  which all but one of the other apartments have been converted to offices.  </P> <P> One night Kei (Yuko Natori), a beautiful but distraught young woman -- and his  sole neighbor -- knocks on his door and introduces herself, seeking company and  clutching a bottle of champagne. Harada, tired from a long day, dismisses her  but subsequently succumbs to her charms. On another night Harada boards a  subway, on a seemingly abandoned line, and ends up in Asakusa, Tokyo's ancient  and colorful amusement and shopping district, where he was born.  </P> <P> In an old vaudeville theater he encounters his father (Tsurutaro Kataoka), who  takes him home, where his mother (Kumiko Akiyoshi) insists he stay for dinner.  The only catch is that Harada's parents were killed in an accident when he was  only 12.  </P> <P> Obayashi makes shrewd use of settings and of a particularly haunting theme from  "Madame Butterfly." Harada's childhood home is as idealized as his parents are,  as it is as warm as his apartment is cold in its shades of gray. His young  parents are a humble, carefree couple devoted to each other and to their only  son. They see him as he was as a child and are proud of his success as an  adult, and do not see him as the middle-age man he has become, a self-absorbed,  competitive striver who has discarded his wife and neglected his own son. At  heart, "The Discarnates," which takes its title from an archaic word meaning  "stripped of flesh," is a cautionary tale with which many can easily identify.  </P> <P> So firm is Obayashi's control that he can get away with both the sentimental  and the bizarre. Harada is splendid as a man transformed by experiences as  mind-boggling as those James Stewart underwent in "It's a Wonderful Life." The  rest of the cast is equally satisfying. You may well come away from "The  Discarnates" (Times-rated Mature for some sex and for some sequences too  intense for youngsters) surprised by the intensity of its emotional impact.  </P> <P> The Tora-san Festival continues at the Little Tokyo Cinema 2 with "Tora-san and  a Lord" and "Tora-san Carry On!"

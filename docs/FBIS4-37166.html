			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The President's Press Conference"] </F>   [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's free and frank talk  with the world press is always a source of pride and comfort.  Firstly, it pours cold water on those who still insist there is  no freedom of expression in the Islamic Republic. Secondly, it  boosts the morale of Iranians and their foreign friends when  gloom and disillusionment get the better of them. Finally, it  reminds world public opinion about the confidence and elegance  of the elected president of Iran.    In our part of the world you cannot find even a few heads of  states or government who hold, what is now generally come to be  termed as, `open' press conferences.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani deserves congratulations for doing so,  though the gaps between one press meeting and another have been  widening. This may be rightly attributed to the chief  executive's tight schedules, but his aides should ensure that  the country's president receives journalists and commentators at  regular intervals. It helps in boosting the nation's image.    On Tuesday more than 100 journalists were at the  presidential  bureau shooting queries on everything from the dress code for  women to alleged nuclear cooperation with North Korea. Local  and foreign scribes shot a volley of questions, sometimes  irresponsibly and outside acceptable norms of protocol. The  president fielded them in his usual sophisticated manner.    Our president's candor and self-confidence is envied in  camps  unwilling to accept Iranian realities. Irrespective of the fact  that on several counts (mostly on the conduct of the economy)  the president's point of view was not very convincing, of  cardinal importance is the fact that Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a man  who believes in what he is doing and sees no reason to conceal  his thoughts.    There was also a barrage of questions on Islamic Iran's  foreign policy. In short, clear and simple language the  president made it known that his administration is keen on  building normal relations with the international community. The  universal truth that knowledge often fosters tolerance and  understanding was amply clear between the lines.    Censuring the British Government for its misdeeds plus  bugging Iran's diplomatic mission in London, the president said.  "This wrong deed by the British has created an atmosphere of  insecurity and mistrust in relations, which will have negative  consequences." However, he added immediately that "we do not  wish to see the existence of such an atmosphere among countries."    Hashemi-Rafsanjani is now in his second, and probably last  term of office. Opinion about his administration is mixed at  home and abroad, depending on one's knowledge about pre- and  post-revolutionary Iran.    For the second time this week President Hashemi-Rafsanjani  chronicled the achievements made under his rule and insisted  that Iran's economic condition is not as bad as some would like  to publicize. Millions of Iranians saw and heard their  president say this on TV. Many must have exchanged glances in  disbelief. Mind you they, like millions across our Islamic  nation, are people who want the president to succeed. On this  count however, they could not help but disagree with him.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station reporters Yao Dongming and Song </F> Yongkuan: "The Overall Task -- A Matter of Importance" -- from  the "News and Press Review" program]    [Text] With the advent of the spring breeze, the yearly  twin sessions of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] are upon us again. The first  topic among many NPC deputies and CPPCC members is the overall  task. They believe that it is urgent to promote -- among people  across the country and cadres at all levels in particular -- the  idea of caring for and having the overall interest in mind.  What is this overall task? It is the prosperity of our great  country and the unceasing progress of the Chinese Nation.  Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability -- this is the  overall task today for the whole country and whole party.    While examining and discussing the report on government  work, the NPC deputies and CPPCC members commented: Memorizing  these phrases does not mean one understands what the overall  task is. The key is that cadres at various levels must  conscientiously subordinate themselves to this overall task in  thinking and in action. The measures they devise should be  conducive to this overall task and the steps they take must  serve this overall task. When partial interest stands in the way  of the overall interest, they must voluntarily give up partial  interest in favor of overall interests.    NPC deputies and CPPCC members cited a wide array of  irregularities in the localities that harm overall interest.  For example, some localities always try to get around the  strictures of the central government. When the central  government was trying to consolidate order in the banking  sector, the localities continued their illegal raising of  investment; while the central government was calling for  reducing the scale of capital construction, they continued  building office buildings, auditoriums, and guesthouses; when  the central government was calling for preventing the real  estate sector from overheating, they claimed that there was no  heating in their localities. Other manifestations include  haphazard importation, duplication in construction, misguided  competition in disregard of one's capabilities, rushing to  launch new projects without careful study, and so forth. Some  of these actions may yield short-term benefits but will, in the  long run, be harmful to the state and people.    The existence of these phenomena indicates that in our  effort to accelerate the transition from a planned economy to a  market one, lack of understanding and experience and a mistaken  standpoint can often lead to misguided actions. A sense of the  overall task is especially important at a time like this. A  man's understanding can be improved step by step and experience  can be accumulated bit by bit, but he must first have a sense of  the overall interest.    This year, we will be combining package reform with  breakthroughs in key areas, a crucial year for all-round  deepening of reform. Reform will unearth many deep-rooted  contradictions. NPC deputies and CPPCC members held that the  overall tasks requires us to properly handle the relations  between reform, development, and stability.    He Zhukang, a deputy from Jilin, said: Only by persistently  implementing reform and promoting development will we be able to  lay a foundation for the long-term social stability and state  order. To promote reform and development, we must have a stable  social environment. Reform is aimed at unleashing the motive  force, development is our goal, and stability is the  precondition. This year we will be placing greater efforts on  carrying out reform and new contradictions and problems are  bound to emerge. To ensure smooth implementation of reform, we  must subordinate ourselves to overall interests and ensure that  regional growth rates will be appropriate and steady.    Referring to the policy of macroeconomic regulation and  control adopted by the central authorities last year, Jiangsu  Deputy Shen Daren said with feeling: This policy was adopted for  the interest of the overall situation. It has created a  favorable overall environment for regional development and  helped bring along healthy development of the regional  economies. It is easy to see from the comments of the NPC  deputies and CPPCC members that China is indeed faced with a  rare historical opportunity in terms of the conditions at home  and abroad. We must, however, be aware of the fact that we are  advancing economic reform when the national economy is growing  rapidly; we are required to maintain a sustained, rapid, and  healthy growth of the national economy while accelerating  structural transformation. Under these circumstances, it is  essential to stress ideals, discipline, unity, and overall  interest. We must be full of confidence yet keep a clear head.  Let us continue our conscientious, meticulous efforts in this  regard and work in a down- to-earth manner to achieve new  victories.</p>

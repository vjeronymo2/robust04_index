Fridman  (Rovno AES); received May 31,1993; UDC 621.184.25:621.181.192]    [Abstract] Fourteen AES power units with VVER-1000  reactors are currently operated in CIS countries. Each reactor  has four steam generators, and 35 of those have already failed,  after being in operation for less than one-quarter of their  service life. While steam generators abroad fail due to  corrosion damage of heat-exchange tubes, failures at AESs with  VVER-1000 are caused by cracks in output (``cold'') collectors.  The work described in the article was aimed at finding causes of  the cracks. Cartograms of damage at 23 steam generators that had  been replaced at the Novovoronezh, Balakovo, Yuzhno Ukrayinskaya  and Zaporozhye AESs were studied (there was no damage at the  remaining AES. It was found that there was a certain regularity  of crack location and pattern. It is concluded that the location  of damages is determined by design features of the tube plate,  on the one hand, and peculiarities of thermal and hydraulic  processes in the steam generator, on the other. The damage is of  fatigue type. Substantial thermal cyclicity, which affects the  collector metal temperature, is caused by frequent PVD  [expansion not given] shutoff.

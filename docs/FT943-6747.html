			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Danish pledge to stay on economic path Denmark's finance minister vowed yesterday he would not let left-wing pressure push his economic policy off course. The Danes face a parliamentary election in autumn and opinion polls suggest the present four-party centre-left coalition may be returned as a minority administration dependent on the support of the left-wing Socialist People's Party (SPP). 'The SPP will not be allowed to lift the level of government expenditure,' the finance minister, Mr Mogens Lykketoft, told the Financial Times. He expected, however, that his party would be able to agree policy with the SPP on other fronts, such as the environment, education and social welfare. The four-party coalition, dominated by the Social Democratic Party, will face the autumn election to the Folketing on a date yet to be announced. The minister's pledge is intended to help persuade the financial markets that Denmark's economic policy, which aims to keep inflation low and to eliminate the budget deficit by 1997, will not be changed. This week he brought forward publication of the 1995 draft budget by a week for the same reason. 'One could fear that the markets were uncertain whether we would stick to the fiscal policy which we laid down last year,' he said. The markets showed no noticeable reaction to the draft budget, leaving the gap between yields on Danish and German benchmark government bonds unchanged at about 1.7 per cent. 'We could not really expect to affect the markets,' said Mr Lykketoft. 'Our policy was known, and we have not changed it, but we have proved that we are holding our course.' The draft budget, according to the government, involves a real decline in expenditure of DKr6bn (Pounds 635m) on a budget balancing at DKr392bn (Pounds 41.5bn). The budget deficit will fall by only DKr2bn to DKr45.3bn, or 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product, from 1994 to 1995, despite a strong economic recovery. But Mr Lykketoft said the real improvement in the deficit was about DKr12bn. The revenue benefited from extraordinary income to the tune of DKr10bn in 1994, which disguised the true improvement in the budget between 1994 and 1995, he said. On present trends, Mr Lykketoft said he expected the budget deficit to be eliminated in 1997.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: DESIGN FOR A LIVABLE PLANET HOW YOU CAN CLEAN UP THE  ENVIRONMENT BY JON NAAR (HARPER &amp; ROW: $25.95; 320 PP.)  </P> <P> "Design for a Livable Planet" takes much more a reader's approach than  MacEachern's family-friendly book. Jon Naar puts environmentalist efforts in a  political and social context, sprinkling his chapters liberally with historical  observations ("Drinking-water pollution is at least as old as the Roman Empire,  when aqueducts were poisoned by lead leaching from the pipes") and quotes (from  Tom Lehrer's song, "Pollution": "You can use the latest toothpaste, then rinse  your mouth with industrial waste").  </P> <P> The book is filled with ideas for practical change on the individual level, but  Naar really wants to drive home the point that the protection of the planet is  too important to be left to bureaucracies, corporations and government  agencies. To this end, he divides his book into issues and explains how the  reader can use their Green consumer power and join existing grass-roots groups  intent on influencing public policy.

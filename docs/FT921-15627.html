			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chrysler unveils top-range LH vehicles CHRYSLER, the smallest of the big three US vehicle makers, yesterday unveiled a new generation of large executive saloon cars, the result of a Dollars 1.5bn development programme. The so-called LH project is one of the most ambitious new product programmes ever undertaken by Chrysler, and marks its first all-new car programme for more than a decade. The cars, to be launched in the autumn in North America, as the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision, are aimed at re-establishing Chrysler in the heartland of the US market for mid-size and full-size executive cars, where it has lost considerable market share with its present out-dated products. The LH cars will play a crucial role in the company's fight for survival as an independent carmaker in the first half of the 1990s, and are the keystone of an ambitious new product offensive unveiled this week. Chrysler is planning to spend around Dollars 16.6bn from 1991 to 1995 on new product development and the modernisation of its facilities, and is aiming to replace all of its car range by 1995. The top-of-the-range LH cars will be vital to the company's attempt to restore its credibility as a carmaker to match its success in the light truck market, where it has established a leading position as a maker of multi-purpose vehicles (minivans such as the Chrysler Voyager) and four-wheel drive vehicles, such as the Jeep Cherokee. It has lost ground alarmingly in the US car market, however, where it was relegated to fifth place for the first time in 1991 behind both Honda and Toyota of Japan. Its share of US new car sales dropped to 8.5 per cent from 9.2 per cent a year ago, while Honda increased its share to 9.8 per cent in 1991 from 9.1 per cent in 1990, and Toyota boosted its share to 9.0 per cent from 8.3 per cent. Chrysler's car sales fell by 18.4 per cent to 702,518. Production of the LH range is due to begin at Chrysler's Bramalea, Ontario, assembly plant in June, and Mr Robert Lutz, Chrysler president, said the company was eventually aiming at a production of more than 300,000 cars a year.</p>

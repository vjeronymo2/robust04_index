			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / People: At the democratic heart of the new Germany - Sir Norman Foster, the British architect picked to redesign Berlin's Reichstag, tells Judy Dempsey he has a sense of wonder about the city Berliners have an opinion on everything. They also like to complain. Ask them what they think about the Reichstag becoming the new seat of the German government when parliamentarians eventually move to Berlin in the late 1990s and they will opine about the cost, estimated at around DM15bn. Then they will question how democratically elected deputies dare reconvene at a place indelibly associated with some of the darkest periods of Germany's past. In spite of the controversy, Sir Norman Foster, the British architect who won the competition to redesign the building, still retains a sense of humour as well as a sense of wonder about the city. 'If you look at what has happened in Berlin since unification (in 1990), it is miraculous. It is faster and more precipitous than anyone's wildest dreams. It's a bit like watching Nigel Mansell with his foot on the floor going around the Grand Prix circuit and asking why can't he go faster.' It is not difficult to see what Sir Norman means. Berlin resembles a giant building site; new buildings emerge from the rubble, and new rail, underground and bus networks link the former divided city. Public attention is focused on the Reichstag and, in designing the building, Sir Norman is designing the democratic heart of the new Germany. The Mancunian architect has an impressive track record for taking on the task; he was the designer of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building in Hong Kong, the acclaimed Stansted airport in Britain, and the Commerzbank headquarters in Frankfurt. Yet he never thought a British architect would be awarded the job of redesigning the German parliament. Sir Norman, sitting in a bright, vast office with high ceilings a hundred yards from the Reichstag, said he believed it was 'inconceivable that someone could seriously consider giving the responsibility for a new German parliament to British architects. It seemed such a long shot.' But with a bit of persuading from his wife, he visited Berlin to reconsider. He listened to parliamentarians and planners. He found out what was important to them. 'My doubts were shaken. I was soon fired with enthusiasm. It must be one of the most important projects in the world today. And I think we were inspired by that.' Sir Norman set to work with his team of 81 architects and a budget of DM600m. The central philosophical thread running through the project over the past two years - and two completely different designs - was the need to make the Reichstag accessible and democratic. Yet the primary influence upon his design was the symbolism and historical significance of the Reichstag. 'The history of the Reichstag has so many interpretations. It was about the birth of Nazism but in many ways it was also about the death of it. It contains so many layers of history. It has also been the scene of extraordinary celebration and optimism.' The democratic defenders of the Reichstag, which was designed in Italian Renaissance style by Paul Wallot and completed after a decade's building in 1894, rarely had a chance to use it as a forum for free debate. Bismarck, who never crossed the threshold, loathed it, preferring the deputies to continue meeting in the old state porcelain factory. Hermann Goring and Josef Goebbels arranged to have it burned in 1933. The Allies bombed it in late 1943. The interior of the burnt-out shell was finally restored in east German communist style between 1969 and 1971. Bequeathed to Sir Norman was an abestos-infested edifice whose internal structure bears no resemblance to the original designs. Despite this troubled history, Sir Norman says his proposals for the Reichstag owe a great deal to the original generosity of the space. He will rebuild the facades around the courtyard, introduce natural light through an elegant light house capped by a dome, and modernise Wallot's natural ventilation system. 'What we are doing involves a very delicate intervention with the past. It is about bringing back the qualities of the old earlier spaces and in the process creating some dynamic new ones. It is very much about dealing with the historic fabric, rediscovering the building, the quality of the materials, and the craftsmanship. In that sense, we are traditionalists.' Yet the emphasis on accountability and openness that united Germany's new parliament must have is never far from his mind. 'The whole scheme begins by placing everyone on the single democratic level - the historic first floor (the original location of the debating chamber) where government is seen to be open and accessible,' he explains. Sir Norman wants the building to be accessible to the public in another way as well. The public should have the benefit 'of one of the best viewing platforms in Berlin. When you get on the roof of the Reichstag you have a breathtaking view of the city. It is an incredible vista. And aside from just the sensual satisfaction of surveying the scenery, symbolically to be able to wander freely and have a meal up there, to ascend a viewing platform which is metaphorically and physically above the debating chamber, above the politicians, is indeed powerful stuff. And to mix freely with politicans and to enter the front door, through the grand staircase is to rediscover the historical roots of the building.' Yet Sir Norman admits that an 'equal amount of energy has gone into security. You cannot get into the same lift as the politicians when moving to different levels of the building. No chance] But the security is not advertised by iron bars and spikes. It is very discreet.' The debate about when, and at what cost, the government will finally move to the German capital has been far from discreet. Sir Norman and his staff seem non-plussed by the debate. Doubtless, Berliners would complain if the timetable were to be postponed. But they might also even grow to like and respect the Reichstag.</p>

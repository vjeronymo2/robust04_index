			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 3 May TASS -- Russian borderguards have  prevented one more armed provocation on the Pamir stretch of the  Tajik-Afghan border.    ITAR-TASS today learned at the headquarters of the Russian  borderguard troops in Tajikistan that a group of armed men from  the Tajik opposition made a attempt on Monday evening to fight  their way into Tajikistan on one of the sectors guarded by the  Horog borderguard detachment.    The intruders enjoyed fire coverage from Afghan territory.  The Russian borderguards were compelled to retaliate, thereby  preventing the gang from crossing the border river. The Russian  troops suffered no casualties. The enemy losses were not  reported.    Men of the irreconcilable opposition are now being massed on  separate sections of the border between Tajikistan and the  Afghan province of Tahor. Military sources do not rule out new  armed provocations on this stretch of the border.</p>

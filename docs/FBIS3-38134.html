			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report]  <H5>  NATO's Political Mission Growing </H5>   While doubting that it would be advantageous for France to  rejoin the NATO command structure, Pascal Boniface, director of  the Institute of International and Strategic Research, credits  NATO with being one of the few pillars of stability in an  increasingly "nationalistic" Europe. Writing in the 10 January  Paris daily LIBERATION, Boniface asserts that NATO is a "unique  forum" for consultation among the Western democracies, remains  the "best guarantee" for a continued U.S. presence in Europe,  and exerts a "limitless attraction" on the former Warsaw Pact  countries. According to Boniface, NATO remains the only  multinational defense organization in Europe with the required  infrastructure, logistics, command and control, and imposing  force. Nevertheless, he expressed doubts about the benefits of  rejoining NATO's integrated command, suggesting that allies  would be more receptive to French policies if France assisted  the development of a genuinely European defense identity. He  observes that the "complementarity" between a European defense  identity and NATO was endorsed at the 1991 NATO summit in  Copenhagen and reaffirmed at the NATO summit in Rome later that  same year.    Boniface calls for a redistribution of roles within NATO  because of NATO's shift from purely military to political and  security missions, coupled with what he perceives as a gradual  disengagement from NATO by the United States. The United States  should share control with Europe, Boniface believes. In the  future, the Alliance's main military mission will be crisis  management and peacekeeping. However, U.S. "reservations" about  military intervention in Bosnia are "not encouraging" in this  respect, Boniface contends, since NATO is powerless to act when  the United States declines to take military risks. The December  1992 decision by France to participate in NATO peacekeeping  operations, he contends, should be seen in that specific context  and should not necessarily be interpreted as a first step to a  return to integrated military structures, Boniface concludes.  <H5>  French Reintegration Possible </H5>   Commentator Alain Duhamel writes that, while France's 1966  decision to "remove the tricolor troops" from a NATO "totally  dominated by the United States" had a "solid foundation" at the  time, this "old" doctrine could soon be replaced by a "search  for influence through solidarity" (LE POINT, 8 January).  Changing circumstances call for such a shift, Duhamel believes,  citing the situation in Russia, Bosnia, elsewhere in East  Europe, and the perceived U.S. "retreat from the Old World."  France is in an "ideal" position to influence a redefinition of  NATO, Duhamel contends. France's nuclear capability and  influence in Africa gives Paris the clout to argue for a  "bipolar" equal division of NATO's political, military, and  financial responsibilities between the United States and Europe.  In Duhamel's view, this would place NATO on a more realistic  footing, lead to greater autonomy within NATO for the European  contingent, and assist the development of large-scale European  military units composed exclusively of professional troops. It  could also foster the growth of a competitive European defense  industry, Duhamel believes. Under this arrangement France would  probably rejoin an integrated NATO military command under a  European general staff and thus bring about, through different  means, the Gaullist dream of a "new equilibrium" for NATO,  Duhamel concludes.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Big US players take a global view - International issues Last week's announcement by the US Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, of its intention to borrow Dollars 20bn in international capital markets has introduced a significant new player on to the foreign borrowing scene. Fannie Mae, one of the world's biggest issuers of long-term debt, has traditionally relied on US domestic capital markets for its extensive funding needs - it has an annual requirement of around Dollars 46bn. However, as it seeks to fund expansion of its Dollars 214bn portfolio of mortgages, it is now turning to the global market for more diverse and cheaper sources of funding. If other major US players follow, which is likely - the US Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loans Bank, are also taking a serious look at the international markets  - they will dwarf even the large European sovereign borrowers, who have dominated foreign borrowing over the last few years. Fannie Mae made its debut in the international bond markets in June with a Dollars 1.5bn offering of 10-year global debentures, at a price significantly less than would have been the case in the US market, according to Ms Linda Knight, Fannie Mae senior vice-president and treasurer. Freddie Mac launched its own Dollars 1.5bn global issue in July and the Federal Home Loan Bank was active in the market last week with two dollar deals, a Dollars 400m fixed-rate offer and a Dollars 200m floating-rate issue. However, Fannie Mae's announcement comes at a time of substantial change in the international capital markets. Many of the large sovereign borrowers are reducing their foreign borrowing activity, as they attempt to claw back their budget deficits and as greater economic growth boosts their tax revenues. At the same time, the upturn in the economic cycle is fuelling the appetite of many corporate and financial borrowers for more foreign borrowing. As one eurobond syndicate manager in London said: 'Apart from the obvious exceptions like Sweden, sovereign borrowing is likely to become a thing of the past as the pressures to fund decline. The obvious question then is: are the corporate borrowers going to take over?' In the US, that is already happening to a certain extent. Ford Motor Credit, the financing arm of Ford, came to the market last week with Dollars 250m offering of five-year floating-rate notes. GECC, the financing arm of General Electric, regularly taps the many different currency sectors of the international capital markets - it has borrowed Dollars 4.6bn already this year, after borrowing Dollars 4.7bn last year, according to figures from Euromoney Bondware. In the UK, where companies tend to rely more on equity than debt for capital, the rise in bond issues has been less marked. However, there are exceptions - the Abbey National, one of the UK's largest mortgage lenders, has borrowed around Dollars 9bn in the international public markets this year. Last week it launched a Dollars 500m offering of Yankee bonds targeted directly at the US market and it intends to follow that up with a global offering of bonds of around Dollars 1.5bn, which should be launched early next year. The bank also has about Dollars 9bn of medium-term notes outstanding in Europe and has the potential to issue Dollars 3bn of MTNs in the US. Italy, which borrowed around Dollars 12.8bn in 1993, according to Euromoney Bondware, has reduced that to about Dollars 8bn so far this year. This involved a yen issue in January and a multi-tranche offering later in the year made-up of D-Mark, US dollar and yen tranches. Italy needs to borrow about Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn this year on the international markets, according to the Italian Treasury. The supranational institutions such as the European Investment Bank and the World Bank look set to remain major borrowers. The European Investment Bank, which raised about Ecu14.2bn over the whole of last year, has raised around Ecu11.5bn so far this year. Of this, around 75 per cent has been in EU currencies, mostly Italian lire and the remainder split evenly between D-Marks, French francs and sterling. About 80 per cent of the issues have been in fixed-rate bonds. Treasury officials expect that further issuance this year could be in Italian lire and Spanish pesetas. The World Bank, which last week was active in the Italian lira and Luxembourg franc sectors, and which launched both a global D-Mark and a global offering earlier this autumn, has an approximate funding target of Dollars 10bn for its current fiscal year. The Republic of Sweden, which borrowed Dollars 11.8bn in 1993, has already borrowed Dollars 12.6bn this year and given the size of its budget deficit, looks set to maintain a sizeable presence in the capital markets. The Republic of Finland has also been a major borrower this year, tapping various markets, including the US dollar, Japanese yen and floating-rate D-Mark sectors, raising a total of around Dollars 6.6bn so far in 1994.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Barclays slow to dispense its cheque clearing policy Sir, I was delighted to read that Barclays has shown the other big banks the way in clearing cheques in three days rather than four ('Lloyd's gives way on cheque clearing', March 4), but perhaps this news has not yet reached Barclays' Hammersmith, west London, branch. On February 21 this year I paid two UK clearing bank cheques into my account with Barclays. Five days later, on February 26, a Barclays cash dispenser declined to dispense cash, informing me that, although the 'balance' on my account was substantially in credit, the 'cleared funds' available to me were insufficient to meet my request. On February 28 my branch told me that it could 'confirm clearance' the following day - not three days after I paid the cheques in, not even four, but eight days. The cheques then cleared. Documentary evidence is to hand should Barclays wish to dispute any of the above. Isabel Ashman, 6 Lexington Street, London, W1R 3HS</p>

Airy Refining Company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date of Filing: February 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Case Number: LEF&hyph;0121.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On February 3, 1994, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy filed a Petition requesting that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement Subpart V special refund proceedings for crude oil overcharge funds. Under DOE procedural regulations, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund monies to persons injured by violations of DOE petroleum price and allocation regulations, provided DOE is unable to readily identify such persons or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive. 10 CFR 205.280. We have considered ERA's request to formulate refund procedures for the disbursement of $2,226,782.70 remitted by Mt. Airy Refining Company (Mt. Airy) and its former shareholders, William P. Boswell, W. Luke Boswell, Lindsay B. McLean, David P. Boswell, P. Wilson Boswell II and Ellen W. Boswell, in connection with a Consent Order Mt. Airy and its former shareholders entered into with DOE and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The alleged violations referred to in this Decision involve the sales of both crude oil and refined petroleum products. Because most of Mt. Airy's overcharges relate to crude oil, OHA has determined that the interests of administrative efficiency would best be served by considering all monies received to be the result of crude oil violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Mt. Airy Consent Order funds were remitted to DOE to remedy the firm's alleged violation of the Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Regulations published at 10 CFR Part 211 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedures and Sanctions Regulations set forth at 10 CFR Part 205. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the United States Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. This Decision sets forth OHA's plan to distribute those funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> I. Jurisdiction and Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify persons injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of its regulations or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and OHA's authority to fashion procedures to distribute refunds see,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 9 DOE &para;82,508 (1981) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Mt. Airy operated a refinery in Mt. Airy, Louisiana from the date of its incorporation under the laws of the state of Ohio in 1977 until its dissolution on August 11, 1983. It was therefore a ``refiner'' as that term has been defined in the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations at 10 CFR &sect;211.62. As such, Mt. Airy was subject to the jurisdiction of DOE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the reporting requirements found at 10 CFR &sect;211.66(b)(h), Mt. Airy was required to submit a ``Refiners Monthly Report'' detailing its crude oil receipts, runs to stills and volume of crude oil processed. DOE reviewed Mt. Airy's compliance with these regulatory provisions during the course of an audit of Mt. Airy's principal business operations. The audit was conducted during the period beginning on January 1, 1977 and ending on January 27, 1981. On July 25, 1986, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order which found that Mt. Airy had improperly reported its crude oil receipts for the period beginning July 1977 and ending November 1977. ERA amended that Order on May 27, 1987 (the May 1987 Order) to include additional entitlement reporting violations by Mt. Airy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The May 1987 Order states that Mt. Airy's violations resulted in its receipt of $2,059,649.94 in entitlements which it was not authorized to receive and directs Mt. Airy to refund the amount of its violation, plus interest. The Order further states that Mt. Airy shareholders were individually liable, to the extent that Mt. Airy's assets were distributed to them upon its dissolution in 1983, for refunding the violation amount. ERA found that shareholder liability in this case was predicated upon the ``trust fund doctrine'', which provides that stockholders who receive assets upon corporate dissolution hold those assets in trust for the payment of bona fide corporate debts incurred before dissolution.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See Bayport <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 18 DOE &para;83,007 at 86,058 (1989). Mt. Airy and its former shareholders vigorously contested the May 1987 Order in proceedings before OHA. Nonetheless, without admitting any violations whatsoever, they agreed to enter into a Consent Order with DOE on November 14, 1990, (the November 1990 Order) to settle the violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Loktev: "The ZIL: A Head-On Collision"] </F>   [Text] [Begin boxed material]    --Are ZIL trucks necessary?    --The tax policy undermines production.    --How will the government answer the demands of auto plant  workers?    [End boxed material]    For two weeks, the main conveyer for assembly of ZIL  automobiles has stood idle. The automatic flow lines have  stopped, the smelting furnaces have been turned off, and the  mighty forges and presses have fallen silent.    The ZIL has always been a reliable, economic and productive  mainstay of the government. And now this support has begun to  sway, and together with it the fate of the almost 100,000-man  collective. Moreover, the paralysis of the main Moscow  automobile plant is about to spread at any moment to the 2,000  supplier enterprises of the AMO [Automobile Moscow Society] ZIL,  bringing with it the threat that many more tens of thousands of  workers will be left without a job or means of existence.    In the situation of forced idleness, the ZIL trade union  committee has stepped up its work, as have the plant's Sotsprof  [Association of Socialist Trade Unions] and "Zashchita" trade  union associations. The former held a meeting of representatives  of the ZIL labor collectives. The latter two held a meeting near  the second entryway which drew, by our accounts, no more than  500 people.    During the meeting, the base of the monument to I.  Likhachev--the first "red" director of the ZIL--was covered with  slogans calling for the workers to enter the ranks of the  Sotsprof, to re-elect the trade union committee, to increase  wages by 2.5 times, to guarantee employment, and to dismiss the  director from his duties.    We may evaluate the fairness of the demands in various ways.  Whether to agree with them or not--that is another question,  albeit an important one. The main thing, and I have once again  become convinced of this while listening to the speakers, were  the emotions of the meeting--that the method used in the past  was ineffective in solving the dead-end problems. I believe many  of those who gathered that day at the plant's entryway  understood this. Yet I do not have the heart to condemn the  meeting participants. The working man, driven to desperation and  losing his perspective in life, grabs onto any possibility of  expressing his protest.    The automotive giant stands idle. Maybe its products are not  needed, not in demand? That is not so. An impressive figure was  cited at the meeting of the labor collectives--159,000  automobiles. That is the order for the current year. However,  the buyers have no money, and therein lies the secret.    Yet how much does the ZIL pay in municipal and federal  taxes?  You would not believe it--92 percent from each ruble of profit.  Under such conditions, how can the ZIL, which is no longer  state-owned but has now been changed over to joint stockholding,  increase wages? (We might add that 20 percent of the stock  belongs to the state, and for this reason the government should  not cast the plant to the whims of the market elements). How to  develop, how to acquire new equipment, and finally how to  support the huge plant housing fund? Questions, questions,  questions... And they are aimed not only at the government.    The plant management also caught it at the meeting.    "Today the working man has no time for politics. He has  grown  tired of them," said director Vladimir Petrov. "Where are the  new automobiles? Why is it that handicraftsmen work and survive,  while a huge plant with competent engineers and skilled workers  is falling apart?"    "People have worked for 20-30 years, and now what--they have  to collect bottles for a piece of bread. The average wage at the  plant is 90,000. But this is due to the exorbitant salaries of  the managers of various ranks. The workers are being laid off,  while the managers are hatching more new structures which are  being tacked on. And they are not answerable to anyone. If the  workers knew that these structures operate for the good of the  plant--by all means, they would support them. But that is not  the case. So why should we hatch more parasites?"    The meeting adopted an appeal to the government in which the  ZIL workers demanded an immediate review of the program of  financial-economic revitalization of the plant which they had  developed, as well as a positive resolution of the main  questions:    --to review the tax policy in the interests of the  producers;    --to write off the indebtedness of the enterprise to the  budget and extra-budgetary funds, as being unconnected with the  production activity of the ZIL;    --to restore the granting of free housing to those on the  plant's waiting list;    --to grant the enterprise special-purpose state credit.    Well, and what will happen if the authorities answer with  refusal? The ZIL workers intend to picket the government  buildings and are also ready to declare a political stirike.  Such are the sentiments at the capital's largest enterprise.</p>

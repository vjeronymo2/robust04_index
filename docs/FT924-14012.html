			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Sterling lending flat, Bank says STERLING lending to the private sector was virtually flat over the three months to August, according to the Bank of England. An analysis of bank lending to UK residents in the three months to the end of August, published by the Bank, reflects a depressed economy with a private sector reluctant to accumulate debt. Foreign currency lending to the private sector fell by 2 per cent, probably reflecting fears that sterling would have to be devalued as it slipped against the D-Mark over the summer. The seasonally adjusted 2 per cent rise in lending to individuals was dominated by loans for house purchases, prompted by the partial holiday from stamp duty that ended on August 20. Industry and commerce reduced borrowings in sterling by 1 per cent. That was mainly accounted for by sharp drops in borrowing by business and services, which recorded the fourth successive and biggest fall in sterling lending for 5 1/2 years. Lending to property companies has fallen by 5 per cent since early last year and lending to the construction industry has fallen by 18 per cent since the start of last year. Lending to manufacturing industry was flat in the three months to August. Hotels and catering reduced borrowing by 5 per cent in the three months to August, the sharpest fall since the series began in February 1987. Lending to the motor trade dropped by 5 per cent. The drop in lending for most areas of the private sector was partly offset by an increase of 22 per cent in sterling lending to the energy and water supply industries. Most of that went on oil and natural gas extraction.</p>

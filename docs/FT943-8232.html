			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Breaking the chains of freedom: Racial reconciliation is the most important legacy of Nelson Mandela's first 100 days in power It is a rare honeymoon that lasts 100 days, in politics or in life. The new South Africa has had its period of wonder and bliss; now South Africans are getting down to the really rather difficult business of life after apartheid. Later today, President Nelson Mandela will mark his 100th day in office with a speech to parliament outlining the achievements of his new government, and charting a path to future prosperity. The review of past achievements will, inevitably, be short; for the past 100 days have been far more notable for disasters averted, than for positive change. Scarcely three months after all-race elections hailed as a miracle worldwide, the euphoria which followed the poll has faded; but the new-found spirit of national unity, fostered almost single-handedly by President Mandela, remains strong. It is almost impossible to find anyone, white or black, with a bad word to say about Nelson Mandela. Rightwing leaders - even the hard-line Conservative party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, whose party boycotted the poll  -vie to have their photos taken shaking the hand of the new president. Inkatha Freedom party head Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi is fulsome in his praise. And in spite of rumblings from a disaffected back-bench, South Africa's former rulers, the National party, remain eager junior members of the Mandela government. None of this seemed inevitable, or even likely, before the poll; and even the most conservative commentator has been quick to give credit to Mandela himself. Racial reconciliation is the most important legacy of his first 100 days; without it, there could be no progress in the hundreds more yet to come. But the first 100 days have also demonstrated that political stability is not enough. Democracy must also be made to pay: to provide housing, education, healthcare and jobs for the poor; foster the advancement of blacks in business as managers and as owners, and in the civil service; remove apartheid inequalities. Informal opinion polls - in the townships, on television and radio, and in offices of leading cities - show that most blacks believe their material lot has not improved since the elections. They also show that few blacks are surprised by this - and that most are willing to give Mandela time to deliver. Ordinary people are eager to excuse his lack of action: many explain, with pride, that their president is busy sorting out the problems of Rwanda; that he is shouldering the burden of the whole of Africa; that they trust him to deliver in the end. But political activists are not so patient, and will find it easier and easier to exploit township impatience. Simon Zondi, an African National Congress activist in KwaZulu Natal, says: 'People expected that as soon as the ANC takes over, they will see a change. But up to now that's not what's happened. To people's minds, the old (FW) de Klerk government is still in power.' Township activists such as Zondi, experienced at mobilising resistance around popular concerns such as lack of housing, are likely to give President Mandela a rough ride in the months and years to come. They will not act alone: Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, has made clear that he sees himself as the conscience of the ANC. His future political career depends on mobilising disaffected ANC members behind him in his role as unofficial government watchdog; he has already launched his campaign with an attack on high parliamentary and government salaries. Mandela will have to deliver significant advancements in socio-economic development - and market them well - if he is to withstand this grassroots challenge. So far, change has been slow. In his state of the nation address soon after becoming president in May, Mandela promised that his first 100 days would bring free healthcare to every pregnant woman and child under six, and supplementary feeding schemes at every primary school. The launch of the latter has been delayed until September 1, and the former, though implemented, has caused considerable chaos in hospitals. And what is worse, it is understood that even these limited programmes are over budget, and that the president's office has been seeking donor funding to ensure they are maintained. This is an ominous sign for the future of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, the ambitious development plan which President Mandela is expected to detail in his speech to parliament today. For the president spent much of his first 100 days trying to persuade overseas and local investors that the RDP's goals could be achieved without increasing overall government spending; some R2.5bn is to be spent on the RDP in the current financial year, but all of it is to come from savings in other government departments. Unfortunately for Mandela, the markets showed little sign of believing his assurances on the subject of fiscal discipline (the news that Derek Keys, finance minister, is to resign from October, though for personal reasons, did not help). If there are now signs that RDP expenditure is straining the budget - coupled with fears of a revenue shortfall provoked by recently released gross domestic product growth figures showing that the 3 per cent economic expansion projected for this year may be difficult to achieve - then the new government's fiscal credibility could suffer further. But for the moment, President Mandela appears to feel he has spent enough time defending his credibility with potential investors, local businessmen, and whites in general. His speech is expected to reach out to his mass black constituency, to reassure them that the anti-apartheid struggle is about to begin paying off. But he will have to do more than simply announce a string of development targets, however laudable. He must take steps to overcome signs of paralysis in government: for the ongoing tussle between central government and provinces over the devolution of constitutional powers is severely hampering delivery under the RDP; a damaging row between national housing minister Joe Slovo and Tokyo Sexwale, provincial premier of the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging metropolis, over housing construction has not helped the government's public image; and the relative powerlessness of provincial government is also impeding progress towards the racial integration of local government, which will also bring many development benefits. Even more importantly, Mandela must demonstrate that he is ready to do more than simply exhort the economy to grow (as he did last week when he insisted he was not happy with a projected 2.5 per cent growth rate and preferred 5 per cent). He must reduce the cost of government itself, which as Mr Keys pointed out in a recent speech, consumes 21 per cent of national income, far above the 9 per cent spent on government in Japan and 10 per cent in South Korea. Yet all the pressures point towards increasingly costly government: under the constitution, Mandela cannot sack white civil servants, but he must promote blacks - leading to an inevitable expansion. And the new provincial governments will also increase the civil service burden. Mandela must also use his influence to foster an increase in labour productivity. According to figures compiled by Pretoria's National Productivity Institute, a quasi-government body, hourly manufacturing wages in South Africa, at Dollars 4.78 in 1993 dollars, rank just below wage rates in Singapore and South Korea, where productivity is far higher, and well above countries such as Malaysia (Dollars 1.80). So in the hundreds of days to come, Mandela must show that his government is capable of delivering an economic miracle to match the feats of political magic which stunned the world. For as ANC leaders constantly stress, the political kingdom is worthless without the economic development to make it habitable. The anti-apartheid struggle is finally over; but the economic battle has just begun.</p>

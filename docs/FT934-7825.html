			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hanson sale gets under way HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, will today signal the start of the sale of many of its smaller businesses by announcing the disposal of Axelson oil and gas in North America. Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive recently given the additional title of deputy chairman, is understood to have given the go-ahead to raise more than Pounds 500m from the sale of non-core businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The group has decided to take advantage of the appetite for new issues in the US and UK markets by drawing up plans for a number of flotations, although it is still planning to dispose of many of its smaller companies through trade sales. Both Mr Bonham and Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the group's US arm, have long been in favour of rationalising the group by concentrating its resources on big businesses such as coal, building materials, tobacco and chemicals. The rise in the group's net debt to Pounds 3.5bn, however, has underlined the importance of bringing borrowings down through disposals. Net debt rose significantly after last summer's acquisition of Quantum Chemical Company in the US, which had Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.67bn) of borrowings. The new management is understood to have received the unanimous backing of the board to proceed with the rationalisation programme. Mr Bonham, according to one of the group's advisers, believes Hanson must now degear the balance sheet in order to position the group to take advantage of any potential acquisitions in the future. Axelson is seen as a typical example of the kind of business Hanson has now lined up for sale. Since the group has no plans to be a big force in oil and gas it did not believe it could justify management time spent on Axelson which has sales of Dollars 60m and an annual profit of Dollars 9m. It is being sold to a US company for about Dollars 80m. Other US companies earmarked for disposal include housebuilding, consumer products and recreation and leisure companies. In the UK Hanson is talking to Electra, the development capital group headed by Mr Michael Stoddart, which is backing a management buy-out team interested in buying a number of British businesses which could raise as much as Pounds 90m.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: SILENTS, PLEASE -- A MOVIEGOER LOOKS BACK  </P> <P> The Orpheum Theater, between 8th and 9th streets on Broadway, is a time  machine.  </P> <P> We walked into it one night last week and were back in the '20s. We had come to  see the 1927 silent movie "The Student Prince," starring Norma Shearer and  Ramon Novarro.  </P> <P> The showing was one in the third annual "Last Remaining Seats" program  sponsored by the Los Angeles Conservancy. Essentially, the theater had hardly  changed since I patronized it on Saturday afternoons as a schoolboy. But it was  grimy. Graffiti covered the men's rest room. It was warm and humid. But the  Renaissance and Gothic grandeur remained intact. We sat in the balcony between  the two heavy chandeliers. It occurred to me that it would not be a good place  to be in an earthquake.  </P> <P> My anxieties dissolved when the organ rose, front and center, and Gaylord  Carter turned to face the almost sellout audience. Incredible. He had turned 84  that day. He had played throughout the first run of "The Student Prince" at the  Million Dollar Theater in 1927. Here he was to play it again.  </P> <P> The first short subject was "Precious Images," a powerfully nostalgic montage  of clips from 60 years of movies. They flashed by at less than a second each;  we hadn't time to say the names of the stars or the movies; yet every clip  inspired a surge of recognition. So profound a part of our lives the movies  have been.  </P> <P> A Harold Lloyd short began with a simple introduction: "The plot -- A boy is in  love -- the rest just happens." How many movies have been based on little more  than that. Lloyd really loves his Model-T Ford roadster, which of course turns  against him. Carter played with sympathy.  </P> <P> For "The Student Prince," Carter improvised from Sigmund Romberg's score for  the musical, the lyrical waltzes, the stirring marches, the fraternal drinking  song. I had wondered how they could make a silent "Student Prince." They  didn't. Obviously, it had been anticipated, in 1927, that the film would be  accompanied by an orchestra, an organ, or at least a piano. Despite the playful  touches of director Ernst Lubitsch, without the accompaniment of Gaylord Carter  the film would have been an intolerable bore.  </P> <P> Imagine a beer hall full of rowdy students singing Romberg's drinking song in  silence. Synchronizing with their lips, Carter created the illusion of raucous  male voices. He never rested. When the camera rose to show the castle on a  hilltop, he played castle music -- if there is such a thing. When Shearer and  Novarro chased each other through fields of wildflowers, he sent up a swirl of  romantic airs.  </P> <P> I was reminded of my cousin Donald. In the 1920s he played the piano for  Saturday night movies in the Women's Club of Shafter, a farm center northwest  of Bakersfield. Shafter was the sticks. It didn't even have a moving picture  theater. Donald couldn't play the piano; he played a player piano. But with his  fewer skills, he tried as hard as Carter to match the music to the scene.  Invariably, when someone was dying, he played "Nearer My God to Thee." It was a  much-worn roll.  </P> <P> Shearer was not a great actress. She wasn't even beautiful. Her face was too  long. So was her nose. But in "The Student Prince" she is required only to be  coy, passionate and heartbroken. Novarro had only to express youthful charm,  buoyancy and naivete. Both were equal to those tasks.  </P> <P> Since you will probably never see the movie, it can't hurt to disclose the  plot. Novarro is a crown prince. He is raised behind palace walls. As a young  man he is sent to Heidelberg, where he falls in with the students and learns to  drink beer chug-a-lug. He falls in love with Shearer, an innkeeper's niece.  When the old king dies, his last request of Novarro is that he marry a princess  and carry on the family line. Novarro, urged on by the king's advisers, gives  his word. Finally he goes back to Heidelberg to tell Shearer that, though he  may never see her again, he will never forget her. Believe me, that takes  music.  </P> <P> Tonight at 8 the conservancy is showing "Bringing Up Baby," with Katharine  Hepburn and Cary Grant, at the Westlake, across from MacArthur Park.  </P> <P> Don't miss it if you can.  </P></p>

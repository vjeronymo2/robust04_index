			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Allied Irish gets Dollars 55m compensation from E&amp;Y ALLIED IRISH Banks, the Republic's largest clearing bank, has accepted a Dollars 55m (Pounds 36m) out of court settlement of a claim for damages against Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm. The firm were auditors to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland which AIB had bought for IPounds 45m (Pounds 43m) in 1983. However, two years later it was put into receivership with outstanding liabilities of more than IPounds 300m. A total of Dollars 110m is to be paid to AIB and Icarom, formerly Insurance Corporation, divided equally between the two. AIB's disastrous foray into the insurance business became apparent when it was discovered that there had been significant underprovisioning in Insurance Corporation, involving a wide range of insurance cover throughout the world, including horse-breeding and space rockets. The level of provisions for reinsurance business written through London was apparently especially poor. In many cases business was placed with reinsurers without a strong track record. AIB attempted to shore up the company with a further injection of IPounds 40m, but in 1985 disposed of the company to the government for a nominal sum of IPounds 5. The government called in a receiver, and AIB agreed to contribute IPounds 5.5m for 15 years to meet Insurance Corporation's outstanding liabilities. By the end of 1991, the liabilities still remained in excess of IPounds 270m. In a final settlement last year with the government, AIB agreed to contribute a further IPounds 8.8m per year for the next 20 years. The final cost to AIB of its involvement with Insurance Corporation will be close to IPounds 250m. Mr Gerry Scanlan, AIB's group chief executive said yesterday: 'I am pleased the issue has been brought to a conclusion and all of us in AIB can focus fully on the task of growing and developing the group at home and abroad.' The damages claim was made against E&amp;Y's Irish partners and is to be paid by the firm's insurers. It is thought to be the largest settlement to be made in a damages case against an accountancy firm outside the US. The payment has been made without any admission of liability.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Tapie agrees repayments to Credit Lyonnais Credit Lyonnais has reached agreement with Mr Bernard Tapie for the businessman-turned-politician to start selling his corporate and personal assets to repay the FFr1bn (Dollars 160m) he owes the bank. The agreement, confirmed yesterday by both sides, is another move in the financial restructuring of the troubled state bank, which is expected to be finalised next week when Credit Lyonnais announces its 1993 results. The chief plank of an expected restructuring is likely to be the funnelling of some FFr20bn worth of non-performing property loans into a separate company which will be bolstered by an injection of some FFr3-FFr4bn from the French government. 'It means we have turned off the tap (of credit) for Mr Tapie, and turned over a new page for the bank,' said a Credit Lyonnais spokesman yesterday. The Bernard Tapie Group, wholly owned by Mr Tapie, said it would be recapitalising certain of its corporate assets - believed to include two makers of industrial weighing machines, Terraillon and Testut, and also La Vie Claire, a chain of health food shops - in order to sell them. In borrowing from Credit Lyonnais over the past 20 years, chiefly through its small subsidiary, Societe de Banque Occidentale (SDBO), Mr Tapie had mortgaged personal assets, including the Paris mansion that he bought from the founder of the Givenchy luxury goods business. Credit Lyonnais is calling in this mortgage. Credit Lyonnais would not comment on whether there was any deadline by which Mr Tapie had to repay his debts but said he would at least get 'several months' for the economy and property market to improve so he could realise the best price for his assets. If Mr Tapie were pushed into forced sales, the bank might not get all its money back and would be obliged to make loss provisions in its accounts.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Euro Disney reshuffles top jobs EURO Disney, which has been beset by rumours of poor attendance since the spring opening of its ambitious theme park outside Paris, is reshuffling its senior management in an attempt to improve the performance of the park and its merchandising interests. The news of the management changes came shortly after stock market reports of an improvement in last month's hotel occupancy rates and in the level of attendance by French visitors at the Euro Disneyland complex. The reports fuelled a rise in Euro Disney's shares, which have fallen heavily over the summer, by FFr5 to FFr77 during the day. The shares were first traded on November 7, 1989. Euro Disney is appointing Mr Philippe Bourguignon, 44, as president reporting to Mr Robert Fitzpatrick, who is promoted from president to chairman. Mr Bourguignon, a Frenchman, joined the group in 1988 from Accor, one of France's largest hotel and leisure companies. One of the chief criticisms of Euro Disney has been that the company has been slow in adapting the management and marketing techniques developed by Disney, its US parent, to the different demands of the European market. Euro Disney said Mr Bourguignon's appointment reflected its long-term plan to replace US executives with Europeans. However, Euro Disney is bringing in Mr Steve Burke, 34, from the US to take responsibility for its theme parks and merchandising as executive vice-president. Mr Burke worked on Disney merchandising in the US where he pioneered the development of the Disney stores chain. The group is also appointing Mr Sanjay Varma, 37, as president of its resorts activities, which include the Euro Disneyland hotels.</p>

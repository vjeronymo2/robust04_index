			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg to cut debt by SKr3bn TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and metals trading group, is aiming to cut debt by SKr3bn (Dollars 416.7m) in the next 12 months as part of a recovery strategy and renewed focus on core operations. The group, which has net debt of about SKr10bn, has sold assets worth SKr1.4bn this year. Mr Kjell Nilsson, president, said the group aimed to concentrate on mining, metals trading and rubber. It would not be a long-term participant in forestry and construction related activities, he added. 'A 10 per cent increase in metals prices is worth more for the group than the profits of four of our construction related businesses in a top year,' Mr Neilsson stated. Operations which could be sold include Munksjo, the paper and packaging operation, and Svedala, the mineral processing and materials transport unit. Munksjo alone could fetch several billion kronor. Cutting debts by SKr3bn would lift the group's equity to assets ratio above 30 per cent from 24 per cent today. This would make it easier to raise new equity to support the long-term development of core activities.</p>

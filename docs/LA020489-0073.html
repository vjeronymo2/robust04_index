			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> PARRIS BRINGS SONGS FROM BOSTON  </P> <P> Rebecca Parris, the Boston-based singer, is in town for a while. Heard during a  one-night stand Thursday at Nucleus Nuance, she was set for two evenings at  Alfonse's, closing tonight and will open Tuesday for a five-day run at the  Director's Lounge of the Registry Hotel in Universal City.  </P> <P> A tall, imposing woman, Parris can claim several of the virtues to which many  singers aspire: a personal, confident sound, flawless intonation and an often  dominant jazz feeling.  </P> <P> Like many vocal artists she tends now and then to lag behind the beat. This can  work well if it doesn't get out of hand, but if during "The Man I Love" the  trio is already into the "we'll build a little home" passage while the singer  hasn't quite finished the "Tuesday will be our good news day" line, it can make  for a disconcerting moment.  </P> <P> The less Parris leaned on her jazz proclivity, the more convincing was her  impact. Such songs as "Never Let Me Go," "My Romance," "The Island" and Carroll  Coates' charming waltz "London by Night" were delivered in a full, warm and  rich manner. On the other hand, "Autumn Leaves" at a ridiculously fast clip was  strictly a throwaway.  </P> <P> Parris has a slightly too flip personality that detracts from the mood some of  her songs try to establish. And her backup group lets her down. John Harrison,  a pianist who came with her from Boston, lacked the light touch and swinging  jazz beat that could have complemented her. Between this and an occasionally  over-loud drummer she had problems; in fact, it was a pleasing contrast to hear  her start one song with just Allen Jackson's bass for accompaniment.  </P> <P> Despite these handicaps, Rebecca Parris deserves the attention of anyone  looking for fresh and inventive vocal concepts.  </P></p>

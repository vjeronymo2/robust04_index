			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The official opening of the Constituent Assembly  [CA] has been held at the Uganda International Conference Center  with a keynote address by President Yoweri Museveni to the  delegates. [passage omitted].    In his address to the CA, President Museveni called upon the  delegates to facilitate the making of the constitution that will  mainly create a modern industrialized society so that the people  of Uganda are able to emancipate themselves from manual labor  and protect their sovereignty. He also urged them to evolve a  constitution that can quickly galvanize a Uganda people into a  cohesive force. He said the constitution they are going to do  shall be able to ensure unity in diversity with a clear vision  and emphasis on integration and modernization. [passage omitted].    He told the delegates that they should create conditions for  the modernization and industrialization of Africa with a wide  spectrum of raw materials, a large skilled labor force, and a  large internal market, all essential for feasible integration.    He impressed upon the delegates the need to ensure a healthy  and not [word indistinct] Uganda. He urged them to design a  constitution that puts in place maximum freedom for the direct  producers of wealth whom he categorized as farmers, industrial  workers and industrialists, artisans, and the people working in  the services sector. He said these direct producers of wealth  should have minimum inconvenience from governments and  bureaucrats, and the entrepreneurial class must be left to  evolve freely, so that the middle class will be a stabilizing  force and integrative elements for our society are formed.    Mr. Museveni further urged the delegates to avoid the  temptation to transplant management models from elsewhere,  declaring that political institutions cannot exist in the air  without a social basis. He therefore noted that Uganda must  ensure that our political institutions spring from our social  structure on a healthy basis. The president reminded the  delegates that what has happened today is the fulfillment of  what the NRM [National Resistance Movement] envisaged, promised,  and set out to do way back in 1981.</p>

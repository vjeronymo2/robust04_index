			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Austrian banks see strong rise in earnings Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, and Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse, one of Austria's leading savings banks, forecast strong rises in earnings for this year. Both banks plan to strengthen their provisions against bad debts, and while higher earnings are expected next year, they cautioned against excessive optimism. Bank Austria expects operating profits to rise by about 50 per cent for the whole of 1993 to around Sch5bn (Dollars 416.6m), in spite of difficult conditions caused by the international recession this year, the bank said. But Mr Alfons Haiden, chairman, warned the bank was still facing difficult times ahead and needed to improve earnings further. Bank Austria was created in November 1991 from a merger of the city of Vienna's Zentralsparkasse savings bank and Landerbank. It has faced considerable difficulties in rationalising the activities of its two constituent institutions, and is having to make large provisions to cover the costs of the old Zentralsparkasse's pensions obligations. Pensions provisions are expected to be Sch1.3bn this year, and provisions against bad debts are expected to be Sch4.3bn. The number of branches will be reduced by 12 and its workforce cut by 350 by the end of the year. The bank plans to shed another 400 employees next year. The Erste forecast a rise in partial operating profits from Sch652m in 1992 to close to Sch1.2bn this year. The bank intends to raise its dividend from 13 per cent last year to 15 per cent. Bad debt provisions would be about Sch1bn. 'There is no ground for jubilation but (we are) satisfied,' said Mr Konrad Fuchs, general director. The bank's performance should improve further next year, though profits would grow more slowly, he said. The bank plans a capital increase of Sch100m-Sch150m next year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jia Zhishun (6328 1807 7311) and Wei Zengchen (7614 2582 </F> 5256): "The Living Standard of 660,000 Retired Personnel Will Be  Guaranteed and 4.1 Million Incumbent Staff and Workers Have No  Trouble Back at Home"]    [Text] Social insurance work has been vigorously developed  in our province, playing an important role in promoting economic  development and safeguarding social stability. At present, 4.1  million incumbent workers and 660,000 retired workers across the  province have participated in the social insurance program.  Thus, a multilayered and integrated social insurance system has  taken its initial shape.    Social insurance is a social security measure and a social  stability mechanism cosponsored and enforced by the state and  government departments, with the purpose of providing a  guarantee for the living standard of laborers during maternity,  old age, illness, burial arrangements, injury, disability, and  unemployment. Beginning in 1986, on the basis of universally  establishing at the higher and the lower levels the social  insurance management organs that are subordinate to the labor  departments of various levels, our province has conducted a  series of reforms of the social insurance system with old-age  insurance and unemployment insurance as the priorities.    In line with the principle of "fixing the amount of funds to  be collected according to the amount of funds to be spent,  allowing a small surplus, and keeping a portion as accumulation  funds," we have implemented the method of collecting and  adjusting old-age insurance funds with social efforts in  state-owned enterprises and changed the long-practiced method of  making enterprises assume sole responsibility for all the  retirement payments. At the end of 1987, 149 counties and  cities across the province took the lead in China in  implementing the method of collecting old-age insurance funds of  state-owned enterprises from social sectors. Beginning 1  January 1992, this method was carried out in the whole province.  Starting this year, the method of fixing the percentages of  old-age insurance funds to be collected from permanent workers,  contract workers, and temporary workers, collecting these funds  in an unified manner, and combining them for use has been  implemented in state-owned enterprises across the province, thus  effecting an integrated management of old-age insurance for  state-owned enterprises.    We have conducted the program of collecting old-age  insurance  funds for collective enterprise workers from the social sectors.  So far, all counties and cities across the province have  basically realized the goal of collecting old-age insurance  funds from the social sectors in cities and counties, with more  than 80 percent of incumbent workers and retired workers  participating in this program.    We have also established the old-age insurance system for  temporary workers, Chinese workers in foreign-funded  enterprises, private enterprise workers, and self-employed  workers. To meet the needs of the coexistence of various forms  of ownership and market economic development, and while  unceasingly improving the old-age insurance system for workers  of state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises, our  province has successively issued old-age insurance regulations  and methods for various kinds of enterprise workers such as  temporary workers, Chinese workers in foreign-funded  enterprises, private enterprises, and self-employed workers.    In line with the principle of pooling old-age insurance  funds  from the state, enterprises and workers themselves, we have  universally implemented the system of making workers themselves  pay a basic amount of old-age insurance funds.    Starting in 1992, we have reformed the method of calculating  and distributing the basic old-age pensions for workers and  selected Baoding, Handan, and Xingtai cities as pilot units.  The reform plan of Baoding city had been put into trial  implementation in July 1993. The whole province will promulgate  the new method for calculating and distributing the basic  old-age pension and put it into practice within this year.    We have universally established the unemployment insurance  system for enterprise workers. Over the past few years, the  scope of implementing the unemployment insurance system has  unceasingly expanded, 23,491 units with 3.86 million workers  have joined the unemployment insurance program, and the  unemployment insurance program's dual functions of providing  relief for unemployed workers and helping them find jobs again  have been given full play. At present, the whole province has  provided jobs for 136,700 unemployed people in cities and towns  and provided relief for the living of 26,000 unemployed people.    We have taken active and prudent steps to conduct reform of  the injury, medical, and female workers' birth insurance systems  in selected units. Thirty counties and cities across the  province have implemented the injury insurance reform. In  reform of the medical insurance system, we have mainly  implemented the method of pooling medical expenses for incumbent  workers who suffer serious illness and health-care expenses for  retired workers from social sectors in some selected units. In  female workers' birth insurance reform, we have experimented  with the method of pooling birth funds for female workers from  social sectors.    We have conducted social insurance program and socialized  management and service work. Labor departments and social  insurance organs at all levels have enhanced the sense of  service and strengthened socialized management and service work  for enterprise retired workers in the principle of "combining  the efforts of departments and regions and the efforts of  specialized organs and the masses." Almost 50 percent of the  counties and cities across the province have established  management organizations with the self-management of retired  personnel playing a dominant role. Many counties and cities  have also conducted "coordinated" service work, such as handling  all sorts of social insurance procedures and providing  consulting services.</p>

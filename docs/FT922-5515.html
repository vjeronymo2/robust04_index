			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo back in favour HIGH-PROFILE health stocks were strong in reaction to overnight gains in the US, where the Dow closed at a record high, and on reassesment by a number of UK analysts. In New York, on Thursday night, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham American Depositary Receipts were both significantly higher. Yesterday, in London, Glaxo rose 19 to 778p while SmithKline gained 18 to 918p in the shares and 110 to 4138p in the Units. US house Salomon Brothers was an aggressive buyer of both telling clients that they had underperformed heavily against the market and arguing that Glaxo, particularly, had been left by the wayside. Also, Hoare Govett turned positive on the sector and put SmithKline back on its selective buy list. Mr James Culverwell, one of Hoare's pharmaceutical experts said; 'SmithKline is cheaper and we know the new products are doing well while, with Glaxo the jury is still out.' SmithKline was further helped by news that it had agreed a swap which will give it full control of its Italian consumer brands business, Beecham Italia. Builders fall The construction and building materials sectors were hit by a warning note from County NatWest, suggesting that 1992 profits could prove disappointing. The profits in construction are deteriorating rapidly, according to County, because of the 'awful prices' at which work has been won in the downturn. Costain lost 3 to 68p, despite the fact that it is generating profits in the materials area, thanks to a good Australian coal operation and cost cutting in US coal production. This is being offset by the depressed property sector, and housing where there has been no upsurge in sales. County also warned of a possible dividend cut from Pilkington, which slipped 7 to 147p. Public sector building is unlikely to provide stimulation, because of the already large public sector borrowing requirement, while private demand may show a slow recovery in the second half of the year. Blue Circle lost 9 to 244p and RMC was down 6 at 629p. ADT volatile Business services group ADT tumbled in early trading as nerves became frayed ahead of the release of the company's first-quarter profits. At the day's worst, the shares were down by about 17 per cent. Dealers interpreted the planned late afternoon announcement (timed to coincide with the simultaneous release of results in the US) as indicating problems with the figures. However, the stock is very tightly held and there was also a suggestion that an early morning seller of just 2,000 shares had triggered the fall. The slide led the company to bring the announcement of the figures forward by about an hour. The fears then proved unfounded and profits came in ahead of expectations. The shares responded and eventually closed 3 ahead at 438p. Mr Jeffrey Kessler at Lehman Brothers said: 'This is a relatively satisfactory report though not as good from the two core operations of security and car auctions.' Turnover in Racal Electronics rose to 22m, making it the most heavily traded stock of the day, as dealers squared their books ahead of the demerger of the Chubb subsidiary expected to be announced next month. There was also a suggestion that part of the day's turnover was caused by the placing of the recent stock overhang. The shares firmed 1 1/2 to 61 1/2 p, with one UK broker said to have given the shares a strong push. Barclays Bank shares were firmer as the bears closed out their positions on the last day of the account. There was also some support from speculation that Hong Kong magnate Li Ka-Shing would bail out Olympia &amp; Yorks's Canary Wharf, to which Barclays is heavily exposed. However, one analyst described the rumour as 'very low grade.' Barclays shares closed 5 up at 374p. Midland was 8 firmer at 417p as interested party HongKong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation reminded shareholders that its offer could be worth as much as 449p in the light of the current HSBC share price. Consideration of an encouraging property deal in Hong Kong helped Standard Chartered which has fallen sharply over the past week and which is seen as sensitive to the Hong Kong property market. Standard has been affected by problems on the Indian Stock Exchange to which it is heavily exposed. The shares recovered 13 to 495p. Internationally-traded Reuters Holdings lifted 14 to 1189 on the back of a strong Wall Street. The world's biggest mining company, RTZ, dipped 14 to 626p after negative noises from one securities house. Bid speculation boosted Ranks Hovis McDougall, rising 8 to 234p, on strong turnover of 1.9m shares. Dalgety, up 2 to 424p and Hillsdown, gaining 5 to 179p, were mentioned as possible predators. Supermarket group Tesco improved 3 to 276p, as chairman Mr Ian Maclaurin told the annual meeting there were signs the recession is coming to an end and the group was well placed to gain from an upturn. J. Sainsbury also responded to hopes of economic recovery, climbing 9 to 474p. APV firmed 2 1/2 to 133 1/2 p on talk that company would soon announce a new chief executive. Compass Group was suspended at 489p, as it announced that, with US group ARA, it was in discussions with Forte, unchanged at 239p, about acquiring Forte's contract catering business. Smiths Industries retreated 12 to 315p, after several brokers cut profit expectations for the current and following year. The company, which recently completed a series of presentations to investors, is said to have indicated it is experiencing a slowing of defence orders due to the US presidential elections. UBS Philips &amp; Drew, the company's broker was reported to have reduced its profits forecast for the 1992/93 period by Pounds 13m to Pounds 100m. Stores group Kingfisher lost 11 to 559p, on hefty turnover of 2.9m shares, as its B&amp;Q subsidiary offered price cuts in the highly competitive DIY area. DIY discounting was behind a profits downgrade for Kingfisher from BZW, which also hit the shares. Storehouse gained 5 to 142p, as 2.7m shares changed hands. Credit Lyonnais Laing was reported to be a big buyer, on expectations that the appointment of Mr David Dworkin, head of its BHS unit, as Storehouse chairman and chief executive could lead to disposals within the group. Mr Tony Shiret, analyst at Laing, also said that profit estimates are probably too low. The agency stockbroker expects Pounds 40m to March 1993 and Pounds 60m for the next year, compared with Pounds 15.8m previously. Blue-chip media stocks Pearson and Reed International saw some recovery after a weak period. Reed continued to see support from an improved recommendation by County NatWest. Pearson lifted 5 to 865p and Reed was 9 better at 569p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (160).

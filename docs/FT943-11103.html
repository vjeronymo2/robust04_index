			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Poles mourn dead of 1944 Warsaw Uprising Poles paid tribute yesterday to the 200,000 victims of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against Nazi occupation when they commemorated the 50th anniversary of one the bloodiest battles of the second world war. Red and white Polish flags lined streets as masses were held and prayers were said in the Warsaw synagogue before today's main ceremonies which will be attended by German President Roman Herzog, US Vice-President Al Gore, British Prime Minister John Major and a Russian presidential aide. The German and Russian presence has angered some veterans because of the Nazi brutality during the uprising and Moscow's failure to come to their aid. But President Herzog and Polish President Lech Walesa have said it is now time for reconciliation. 'We Germans and Poles must find some way of putting our relations in order. Otherwise a wound will still divide Europe across its centre,' Mr Herzog said in an interview with Polish television broadcast on Saturday night. The uprising began on August 1 1944, and ended in capitulation the following October 2 after weeks of bombardment and hunger. By the time the Soviet army entered Warsaw on January 17 1945, few buildings were left standing.</p>

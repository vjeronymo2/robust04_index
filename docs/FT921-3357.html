			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Germans in glasshouses . . .: As they say in Europe BRITISH elections grab the attention of continental Europeans more than theirs interest the British. This is probably a result of the oddities, and of what are seen as failings, of the British electoral system: the bogus drama of setting the date, the difficulty of predicting the number of seats that each party can win because of the random nature of the first-past-the-post system; and the constitutional theatre that an election involves. It all seems a bit like cricket - and a bit of a gamble. Thus, in Die Welt, Reiner Gatermann started by quoting the 'vote-guru,' David Butler: 'The Conservatives are three-to-two, Labour three-to-one.' The headline was 'April 9 means the end of Kinnock or Major.' Gatermann pondered the closeness of the race: 'Kinnock's supporters must wonder why their party cannot make more political capital out of the failure of the long-promised recovery to arrive and the widespread dissatisfaction with Tory policy in health and education - and finally the poll tax disaster. But they really know the reason: it is called Neil Kinnock.' He concludes that people just cannot see Kinnock as prime minister - 'He has that image ascribed to the Welsh - saying too little with too many words.' European correspondents based in London do not like Kinnock because, they say, he turns down one-to-one interviews with them and they are banned from the main floor at Labour Party conferences. However, they do not seem to admire the government much, either. In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jochen Rudolph discussed last week's Budget: 'The history of British policy teaches that incorrect fiscal policy causes a lot of trouble . . . To steer with fiscal means makes it essential to know where the economy stands, where it can be measured. But the experience of the last two years, at least in England, is that the experts always diagnose falsely, and as a result make incorrect forecasts - the Treasury included.' Traditionally it has been only the Germans who adopt a high-handed, didactic tone when dealing with British failings. But since France became a pillar of financial rectitude, the attitude has spread. La Tribune de l'Expansion had an editorial on the Budget which accused John Major of being a Keynesian. It was horrified by the Pounds 28bn deficit: 'In an open economy it is not by digging deficits that one emerges from the swamp.' Over at Les Echos, Patrick de Jacquelot takes a more tolerant, often fatalistic, view. He developed an old theme of his regarding the problems facing the Tories. The Budget was badly received by the public; that alarmed the City; which in turn could affect the pound, 'aggravating thereby the difficulties of the government. There is therefore the risk of a vicious circle which must make the Conservatives shiver . . . ' To de Jacquelot, the electoral question could be put quite simply: 'Would the improvement of public services and social welfare justify higher government spending and taxes?' In the Milan daily, Il Sole-24 Ore, Alessandro Merli saw the problem as being mainly one for the Tories: 'After the years of the Micawberesque fiscal virtue of Margaret Thatcher, who set about repaying the whole of the public debt thanks to the boom and the proceeds of privatisation . . . the last two years have seen a sudden change in the trend. Not only has Major wanted to show a 'compassionate' side of Conservatism, thus increasing public spending, but the recession has meant a hard blow to tax receipts.' Merli's views prefigured much British comment. But for real disdain one has to return, as always, to the Frankfurter Allgemeine. It noted that Major had not been able to make much use of his freedom to choose the date - 'it could have been foreseen that the economic situation would not change.' But it was also the one paper I read that made much of that woman whom we all seem to have forgotten: 'Things would be easier if Major had to deal only with his Labour rival, Kinnock. But the person he has to measure himself against is Mrs Thatcher. Her legacy is double-edged: there is the image of the 'Iron Lady' who improved Britain's reputation in the world and broke through the blockades in the economy and society. But there is also the picture, formed during the last phase in Thatcher's period in office, which shows a self-admiring autocrat who had lost any notion of the needs of simple people.' In this welter of not very admiring comment it was nice to read Fabrice Rousselot in Liberation. At least someone thought something good was happening in Britain: 'This unpredictable election is in the image of a changing British political landscape. The vote of April 9 could for the first time smash the traditional 'Labour-Tory' polarisation and open the way to a broader political scene, more consensual and less marked ideologically.' Somebody could also have said that Britain's is the only political landscape in Europe where we are not watching the rise of something nasty on the far right. But nobody over there seems to have noticed that. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

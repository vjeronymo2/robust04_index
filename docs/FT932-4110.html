			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Record first quarter for NYSE members THE 310 securities firms that are members of the New York Stock Exchange earned record after-tax profits of Dollars 1.51bn in the first quarter of this year. The total is up sharply from the previous record of Dollars 1.36bn, set in the first quarter of last year, and provide more evidence that the boom in Wall Street earnings shows no signs of slowing down. The firms' total revenues reached a record Dollars 17.75bn, up from Dollars 16.48bn in the same quarter of 1992. Revenues were strong due to several factors that have sustained the securities industry for the past two years. They include heavy demand for stocks from individual and institutional investors; an extremely busy debt and equity underwriting calendar; strong growth in client assets under management; and a highly favourable domestic interest rate climate. The NYSE said members' assets jumped to Dollars 841.9bn, up from Dollars 631.57bn a year earlier. NYSE firms' expenses were a record Dollars 15.45bn in the quarter, a reflection of the fact that employee compensation is tied to earnings performance.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Midland bad debt level confounds City THE CORRIDORS of Midland Group's majestic City of London headquarters echoed to the sound of its bankers touching wood yesterday, as one after another mused about the likelihood of their bank being on the road to recovery. The group's 1991 pre-tax profit of Pounds 36m, up from Pounds 11m in the previous year, was far better than City analysts had been anticipating. The widespread expectation was that Midland would make a thumping loss and withhold a dividend payment for the second half of the year. But Midland paid out a second interim of 1.7p, making 3.4p for the full year  -though this is sharply down on 1990's 9p. Indeed the extent of any recovery should not be exaggerated. The dividend was drawn from reserves in both years, since there were losses per share of 6.2p in 1991, sharply reduced from 24.7p previously. The principal reason for the turnround was the fall in the second half of the year in the charge for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 373m, compared with Pounds 530m in the first half. The fall was a particular surprise to analysts, since Midland was thought to have made a loss of about Pounds 60m on its loans to the Maxwell empire. This decline also bucked the trend at the other clearing banks. Bad debt charges consist in part of loans that have been written off, because the bank has severed a relationship with a customer and there is no prospect of recovery. However, another element of the charge is a provision against possible losses on loans where there may be a prospect of some repayment. In the latter case, banks and their auditors have to use their judgment about the magnitude of likely losses. Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, insisted that the bank was not being too optimistic in reducing the bad debt charge. His explanation for the fall was that Midland had made heavy charges in the second half of 1990 and the first half of 1991 - in other words, he believes that Midland predicted the likely trend to bad debts earlier and better than the other banks. It is difficult to make a meaningful comparison between the bad debt charges made by different banks, because the statistics they disclose are not compiled on the same basis. However IBCA, the rating agency, believes that Midland's charge for bad UK loans in the whole of 1991 may indeed have been higher, as a percentage of its UK loans, than the other banks, as the accompanying table shows. Midland's declining bad debt charge meant that it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 107m in the second half of the year, compared with a Pounds 71m loss in the first half. However, Midland's trading profits before bad debts were Pounds 468m in the latter half of 1991, down from Pounds 480m in the first half. Sir Peter Walters, the bank's chairman, pointed out encouraging trends in the full-year performance. Operating expenses, at Pounds 2.38bn, were held at almost exactly the same level as in 1990, largely because staff numbers were reduced by 4,900, or 9 per cent, over the past 18 months. Midland also enjoyed 7 per cent growth in net interest income, which was almost twice as fast as any of its main rivals. Part of the reason was that over the past two years the bank has adjusted the structure of its borrowing and lending rates for UK personal customers and small businesses, having for several years tolerated an interest rate structure less profitable than those of its rivals. Growth in service charges, fees and other banking income was up 9.8 per cent  -significantly slower than at Barclays and NatWest, though twice the rate of Lloyds' growth. Bad debts meant that the core UK bank made a loss of Pounds 147m before tax, up from last year's Pounds 46m. But there was a strong contribution of Pounds 109m, up from Pounds 79m, from the corporate and investment banking businesses grouped together in Midland Montagu. Midland's newest business, First Direct - a branchless bank providing its services by telephone - now has 200,000 customers. Sir Peter said if the costs of winning new accounts were excluded, First Direct was now profitable  -thereby confounding the analysts again.</p>

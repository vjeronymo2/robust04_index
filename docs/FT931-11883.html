			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Benefit curb soon for big home loans A CEILING is to be put on the level of mortgage interest payments that will be met through the social security system after a householder has lost his or her job. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has begun detailed discussions with the Treasury about the new limit. He is expected to make an announcement about its introduction before the end of this month. His initiative follows severe ministerial embarrassment over two cases which caused a political furore in December as social security mortgage payments of about Pounds 1,800 a week to a householder with a mortgage of more than Pounds 800,000 were highlighted. At present there is no limit on the level of mortgage payments that can be met from income support provided certain criteria are satisfied. Claimants must have only very limited savings, must be looking for cheaper accommodation and must convince a social security adjudication officer that they could afford the mortgage when buying the property. Claimants can receive full interest payments for up to a year if they are trying to sell their properties. There were signs when the row erupted that ministers would be keen to end large weekly mortgage payments, but initial suggestions were that any reforms might concentrate on making people repay some or all of the money they had received once the property had been sold. The new approach will be to impose a ceiling so that benefit will not be paid if the mortgage is above a certain level, which will probably be fixed between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 200,000. The limit will not apply retrospectively. The Treasury is believed to be pressing for a figure at the lower end of the range in order to maximise savings.</p>

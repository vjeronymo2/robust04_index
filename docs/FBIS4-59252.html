			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas Official Tells AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT: We Are Committed to a Strategy of Jihad Action; the  Command in the Occupied Territory Determines Its Circumstances"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Hamas has reaffirmed  its full and irrevocable commitment to its strategy of jihad  action. A senior Hamas official has stated that the movement's  military command in the occupied territories decides and  determines the method, time, and place of such action.    In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, the  official said that "Hamas is determined more than ever before to  continue the jihad and not to recognize the state of the Zionist  entity, awaiting the success of Arab and Islamic awakening."    The official, who wished to remain anonymous, disclosed the  results of the recent meetings in Damascus of the Alliance of  Palestinian Forces [APF] opposed to the peace process. He said  that "the main issue discussed by the conferees in Damascus was  the question of drawing a suitable mechanism for aborting the  Cairo agreement by nonviolent means, particularly as the circle  of Palestinian opposition forces is now larger because many have  abandoned the Madrid conference dreams which were translated  into bitter facts in the Cairo agreement."    He said that "the Palestinian people's conviction that what  was on offer was insignificant will be reinforced when they see  the bitter facts on the ground when the Cairo agreement is  implemented and when they discover that it is no more than a  federation with the Zionist entity as confirmed in the 400 pages  of the agreement in their political, security, economic, and  civilian aspects."    He also said: Hamas representative 'Imad al-'Alami briefed  the APF representatives on the latest developments, especially  the Zionist and U.S. pressures to which the movement was  subjected in some areas and also the dimensions and essence of  the agreement reached between the Fatah Hawks and al-Qassam  Battalions in Gaza. He explained that it was no more than a  field agreement which did not rise to the level of political  agreement because Hamas' declared position on the agreement is  still the same.    The official also said that Hamas made a point of  "explaining  to the Palestinian opposition groups the circumstances of the  political initiative announced by Hamas Political Bureau  Chairman Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, which attracted media attention in  recent weeks. It said that Hamas is committed to its strategy  of insisting on every inch of Palestinian territory, and that it  is committed in principle, politically, and nationally not to  negotiate with, have peace with, or recognize Israel...and that  Hamas' initiative was a mechanism presented to public opinion  because Hamas does not operate in a vacuum and has a phased  concept linked to its strategic concept. He stressed that Hamas  is for the liberation of all Palestine but "we did not say that  that would be achieved in one go because that would be a  prevarication, realistically and historically."</p>

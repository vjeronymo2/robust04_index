			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8.4 billion of news three-month bills at  an average discount rate of 7.79%, down from 7.91% last week.  </P> <P> Another $8.4 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount  rate of 7.84%, down from 8.03% last week. The new discount rates understate the  actual return to investors -- 8.06% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill  selling for $9,803.10, and 8.29% for a six-month bill selling for $9,603.60.  The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government  securities are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

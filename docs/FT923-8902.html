			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Record precious metals output lifts Placer Dome RECORD output enabled Placer Dome, the Vancouver-based precious metals producer, to shake off lower gold prices and post a one-third rise in second-quarter earnings. Placer's share of production from 15 mines in North America, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Chile reached 505,000 ounces in the second quarter, up from 399,000 ounces a year ago. Thanks largely to rising production at the 30 per cent-owned Porgera property in Papua New Guinea, the company now expects its share of output from all mines to reach 1.9m ounces this year. Earnings rose to USDollars 24m, or 10 cents a share, from Dollars 18m, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest figure includes Dollars 7m in gains from the sale of investments, and severance costs of Dollars 5m. Sales climbed to Dollars 259m from Dollars 236m. Cash flow from continuing operations rose to Dollars 74m from Dollars 69m. The average realised gold price slipped by 8 per cent to Dollars 371 per ounce, but this was offset by a steep drop in cash production costs from Dollars 231 to Dollars 184 per ounce, which marks the lowest level since late 1987. The company said that production volumes and unit costs were likely to improve further at the Kidston and Granny Smith mines in Australia, and the Bald Mountain, Campbell and Dona Lake properties in North America.</p>

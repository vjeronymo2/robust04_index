			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting to discuss political, security, and relief  issues was held in Mogadishu today between Somali National  Alliance [SNA] members and Ambassador Lansana Kouyate, the UN  special representative to Somalia. The SNA members included  Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali, the United Somali Congress secretary  general; Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid, the SNA chairman for  internal affairs; and Lieutenant General Abdirahman Warsame Elmi  Aare. They made it clear that the SNA is not responsible for  existing problems such as kidnapping, robbery, and murder, and  rejected such accusations. They added that these acts are  perpetrated by groups and individuals opposed to the good of the  Somali people. They also asked the United Nations not to  overlook the problems but to assist in solving them,  particularly the problems of disease and drought which are  prevalent in the country.    Ambassador Lansana Kouyate briefed the meeting on the  Nairobi  meetings of Somali organizations and the technical reasons for  the delay of the expected 15 April Mogadishu meeting. He said  that God willing, the meeting will be held on 25 April. He also  reported on meetings he had held in New York and Washington with  the UN Security Council and donor countries. He welcomed  improvements in the Somali police force and the start of the  work of the joint police committee to combat thieves and bandits.    The UN force in Somalia was also discussed during the  meeting  and Ambassador Lansana Kouyate said that the duty of the UN  force is to safeguard humanitarian aid adding that it has  nothing to do with compulsory disarmament.    The meeting ended well with understandings reached on the  agenda. Both sides stressed that joint work between the SNA and  UN Operation in Somalia should be strengthened and that  relations should be maintained consistently.</p>

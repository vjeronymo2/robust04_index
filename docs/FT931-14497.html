			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Parmalat moves into Hungary PARMALAT, the fast-expanding Italian dairy foods group, is buying 60 per cent of Fejertej, a Hungarian dairy foods group, from the country's privatisation agency. The acquisition, which is Parmalat's biggest venture so far in eastern Europe, is believed to have cost around L11.5bn (Dollars 7m). The group has already set up a small milk and yoghurt venture in Russia, and has also invested in the former east Germany. Fejertej, which is one of Hungary's leading dairy products producers, has sales of around L85bn and operating profits of around L6bn. The company has 1,000 employees, and a market share of around 90 per cent in the Fejer and Komaron regions. Sales this year are forecast to rise to about L97bn. Parmalat has the right to buy a further stake in Fejertej should its employees not take up options to buy shares at discounted prices within the next six months. Parmalat, which will report its 1992 results early next month, has been expanding substantially outside Italy in recent years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Threat for Macedonia Is Myth, Bulgarian Socialists Say" -- </F> BTA headline]    [Text] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- It was a wrong decision  that turned positive, former Communists' Bulgarian Socialist  Party (BSP) leader Zhan Videnov said at a news conference,  commenting on parliament's decision as to the transit of  Macedonia-bound UN equipment via Bulgaria. According to Mr.  Videnov, the positive thing about the decision was that it  clearly stated it set no precedent and should not be repeated.    BSP deputy floor leader Nikolay Kamov voiced his concern  over  statements made by representatives of the Union of the  Democratic Forces (SDS) which, according to Mr. Kamov, did not  rule out the possibility for once again taking this decision.  "The SDS refuse to firmly state that they are against the  passage of foreign military troops via Bulgaria's territory,"  Mr. Videnov also said. According to him, it is dangerous for  this country to think that a series of single acts leave its  stand unchanged. If approached again with this request, we are  most likely to again say "yes," the BSP leader said.    According to Mr. Videnov, the great powers now see the  conflict in former Yugoslavia as a global, religious-based one.  The processes in the Balkans cannot be a concern for the great  powers only. Serbia-Montenegro is not hostile to Macedonia  [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and this (that  Macedonia's security is jeopardized) is a myth certain political  forces in Bulgaria have created to justify their actions,  according to the BSP leader.    The Socialists have not yet taken an official stand on the  decision of the Russian Duma to demand lifting of the  Yugo-embargo, Klara Marinova of the BSP told the news conference.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  have agreed that the nature of U.S.-proposed objective criteria  for measuring the openness of Japan's market should be based  both on quantitative and qualitative standards, according to  papers of a bilateral agreement revealed Thursday [26 May].    The two countries agreed Tuesday to resume stalled trade  "framework" talks on the three priority areas -- automobile and  auto parts, insurance and government procurement of  telecommunications and medical equipment.    Although the two governments agreed not to make public the  contents of the papers they exchanged Tuesday, sources close to  the negotiations said that "by making clear the goals in each  trade area, the separate negotiations will be able to focus more  on the proposals."    The papers showed the two sides also confirmed that  objective  criteria be based on both quantitative and qualitative  standards, and that no numerical targets be set.    Japan and the U.S. also clarified the goals in considering  the criteria for measuring liberalization and the specific  deregulation measures in the three markets.    According to the papers, the goal for the automobile and  auto  parts sector is a greater opportunity for entry, while that for  the government procurement sector is a major increase in foreign  products and services. For the insurance area, the goal is to  end obstacles to entry.    In future negotiations, the U.S. is expected to ask Japan to  increase the number of outlets dealing with imported cars and  car parts, and to take action that will make it easier for  Japan's automobile dealer networks to sell foreign products, the  sources said.    As for government procurement, the U.S. will probably ask  for  improvements in bidding procedures and demand a larger share by  foreigners by basing objective criteria on the scale of foreign  product procurement, the sources said.    In the insurance sector, they said the U.S. will likely ask  for an introduction of the broker system and for changes in  Japan's practice of "keiretsu," or system of interlocking  shareholding among companies.</p>

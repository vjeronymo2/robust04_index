			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "E.D.": "French Population Remains Critical of </F> Europe"]    [Text] One month before the European elections, the French  population has not turned Europhobic, but it remains very  critical with respect to European unification. Its opinion,  gauged through a SOFRES poll in cooperation with regional daily  newspapers (footnote) (1,000 persons interviewed between 1 and 6  April 1994), has remained virtually the same since the  referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. Slightly over one-third of  the respondents (36 percent as compared to 37 percent in  September 1992) often think of themselves "as a European  citizens." Although Europe remains an abstract concept, most  respondents still consider that a hypothetical collapse of the  European Union would be "serious" (59 percent as compared to 57  percent in December 1991).    The single market is judged harshly: 48 percent think that  it has "increased" France's economic difficulties over the past  two years, while only 15 percent consider that it has "reduced"  them. For the future, although pessimism is less pronounced, it  remains the dominant feeling: 34 percent think France's  economic problems will increase in the coming two years, while  32 percent believe that they will abate. However, there is less  worry on this count than in 1992.    With regard to institutional matters, public opinion prefers  a confederation. A vast majority (52 percent) favors "close  cooperation between the national governments within the European  Council." One-third of the French (36 percent) are in favor of  "a federal European state whose decisions, when adopted by a  majority of member states, should be implemented in each  country."</p>

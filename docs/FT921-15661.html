			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Labour may punish electricity polluters A LABOUR government might penalise electricity companies which fail to meet conservation and efficiency targets in order to encourage energy saving and help protect the environment. Under one option companies that failed to meet such targets might be forced to charge lower prices for their electricity or suffer restrictions on the returns they are allowed to make. In the shorter term, companies that did not achieve adequate results in the specific area of home insulation might be threatened with sanctions including the loss of their licences. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said: 'We will need to look in great detail at how we best benefit the customers and save energy by changing the operational and financial regime.' Labour is studying attempts by US regulators in Wisconsin and elsewhere to encourage energy conservation. In 1987, state regulators offered the Wisconsin Electric Power Company an additional return if it could cut demand by a stipulated amount over two years. In a continuation of the programme a further return was offered in ex-change for fresh reductions. Wisconsin also offered consumers both rebates for purchasing energy efficient appliances and incentives for turning in old, inefficient ones. Labour is committed to prioritising a 'hugely in-creased' programme of energy conservation and efficiency. It has pledged to establish new commissions for the main utilities which will have greater powers than the current regulatory bodies. Scare stories about the threat of global warming could wreck moves to curb more serious pollution risks, an academic warned yesterday. Professor David Bowen, director of the Institute of Earth Studies at University College of Wales, said it was unrealistic for politicians, the public and the media to think global warming was happening now. 'Great harm had been done . . . it is regrettable that global warming was ever identified as the key issue,' he said. 'Far more important is the pollution of the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and countryside, about which scientists and policy makers must agree policies urgently.'</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BAe scales back talks on sale of Dutch arm Talks on the sale of Ballast Nedam, British Aerospace's Dutch construction subsidiary, are to be scaled back after BAe and Boskalis, the Dutch dredging company, failed to reach agreement on a full takeover. Boskalis, which had said in October that it was prepared to pay about Fl 500m (Pounds 177m) for Ballast Nedam, will continue to discuss other forms of co-operation with Ballast Nedam short of outright acquisition. BAe said it still intended to sell Ballast Nedam. 'Discussions will continue with Boskalis on a non-exclusive basis with the possibility of other parties becoming involved in these or other negotiations,' it said. Boskalis's exclusive rights to negotiate a Ballast Nedam deal expired on December 1. The three companies would not say why a takeover had not proved to be possible. BAe said there had been no material change in Ballast Nedam's financial position since the negotiations began. Boskalis, which had earlier announced plans for a Fl 300m share issue to help pay for the acquisition, said it was now calling off the share issue. The failure of the merger talks renews uncertainty about Ballast Nedam's future. Earlier this year Ballast Nedam's chairman resigned after BAe turned down his plan for a flotation on the Amsterdam stock exchange.</p>

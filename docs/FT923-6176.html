			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Ford plant to build engines for Jaguar JAGUAR, the troubled UK luxury-car subsidiary of Ford of the US, is to have its new range of V8 engines built at the Ford engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales, with an investment of more than Pounds 100m. Building the engines at Ford's main UK engine plant, rather than at a new Jaguar facility in the west Midlands, will be the biggest step yet by the US carmaker to integrate Jaguar into its operations. Jaguar makes its current 3.2-litre and 4.0-litre 6-cylinder engines and 5.3-litre V12 engines at its outdated engine plant at Radford, Coventry, which has a workforce of about 850. The company said yesterday it would continue to make engines at Radford at least until the end of the decade. It added that building the engines at Bridgend rather than near its research and development operations at Whitley, Coventry, would save about Pounds 15m. Production of the new generation Jaguar engines is expected to begin in 1995-96, with up to 50,000 engines a year. Ford has invested heavily at Bridgend, where it has built a Pounds 300m plant for its new Zeta multi-valve engines. These are fitted in the Escort/Orion and will be used in the replacement car for the present Sierra to be launched early next year. Jaguar was taken over by Ford for Pounds 1.56bn in late 1989, and the new V8 engine range will form an important part of its ambitious product plan for the second half of the 1990s. The development programme is aimed at boosting output by the end of the decade to more than 100,000 cars a year, which would quadruple last year's depressed level. The plan, which is expected to involve a capital investment of more than Pounds 1bn, centres on the development of three new model ranges, code-named X100, X200 and X300, as well as the development of the new engine family. Jaguar's strategy for the 1990s includes: A revised version of its XJ6 saloon, codenamed the X300, to be launched in 1994. A replacement for the XJS coupe and convertible ranges, code-named X100, to be launched in 1996 and featuring the Bridgend-built engine. Development of the new engine family, first as a V8 - code-named AJ26 - for launch in 1996, and later in V6 form and possibly as a V12. The crucial launch, probably in 1998, of a smaller sporty saloon, codenamed the X200, to compete with rivals such as the BMW 5-Series. Jaguar hopes that this car will enable it to more than double its annual production from 50,000 to 70,000 for the other car ranges to 100,000 to 150,000.</p>

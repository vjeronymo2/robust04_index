			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Pakistani shares lose the lustre of 1991 - Farhan Bokhari profiles the bottom performer among emerging markets last month UP WITH the Latin American leaders last year, Pakistan hit trouble in July and slipped 15.8 per cent in dollar terms, the worst decline in the emerging markets list from the IFC, part of the World Bank. There has been a recovery this week and last but the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) index is still 181.75 below the 1,520.90 registered on July 1, when the new financial year began, and 375.42, or 22 per cent below its 1992 high of 1,714.57 on January 7. Political uncertainty loomed recently after a split within Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's ruling alliance, the IDA (Islamic Democratic Alliance). A Karachi-based regional ethnic party, the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement) broke ranks with Mr Sharif, after an army-backed crackdown against its members, allegedly for running torture cells to victimise opponents. That immediately raised fears of economic and commercial repercussions. Karachi, the country's most important port and centre of banking and corporate activity, is largely controlled by the MQM. A rift with the ruling alliance has raised the possibility of MQM-backed street agitation or other forms of disturbances which would disrupt life in the city. 'For now, the presence of army troops in the city has helped to restore some confidence, but that may last only until the army is called back to its barracks,' says one leading businessman. However, there are other reasons for the fall in equities this year. Last December, an Islamic court handed down a ruling which required all banks to eliminate pre-determined interest or usury, known as 'Riba', by the end of June this year, because the practice is considered unlawful under Islamic codes. The government has now appealed the ruling to Pakistan's supreme court. During the first six months of this year, sentiment was dulled by concerns that the judgment, if enforced, would have implications for the country's financial sector. Now, many investors are watching to see the outcome of the supreme court's decision. In addition, many investors are nervous over the worldwide decline in the cotton price. This means a lower profitability in the textile sector, and approximately one-third of KSE's 606 listed companies are textiles related. Despite recent trends, the KSE's President, Mr Arif Habib, continues to be optimistic, pointing to a rise in market turnover from last year's average of some 2.4m shares a day to 2.8m this year, and continued corporate interest in floating new shares on to the market. Since January last year, he says, 150 new companies have been registered on the KSE.</p>

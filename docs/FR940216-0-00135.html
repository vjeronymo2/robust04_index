			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also considered whether it would be feasible to apply the same baseline-setting approach used for domestic refiners to foreign refiners directly, i.e., that any foreign refiner would be required to establish an individual baseline using Methods 1, 2, or 3. Under this approach, any foreign refiner, like any domestic refiner, who is unable to establish the quality of its 1990 US-market gasoline would be barred from supplying gasoline for use within the United States beginning in 1995. This approach would be consistent with the guiding themes for baseline-setting: That parties not have options in setting baseline levels, and that within this constraint that the baselines are set using the best available data. Application of this baseline-setting approach to foreign refiners is problematic, however. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foreign refiner use of the general scheme using Methods 1, 2 and 3 would require that the foreign refiner must have actual test data for the portion of its production destined for U.S. markets, or in the alternative, foreign refiners would have to model the 1990 quality of their U.S. product based on post-1990 gasoline quality data and refinery configuration information. EPA believes that most foreign refiners lack the information necessary to establish their 1990 U.S. market gasoline under either Method 1, 2 or 3. Most (if not all) foreign refiners, like domestic refiners, did not collect adequate data in 1990 to use Method 1. In addition, Methods 2 and 3 generally are inappropriate for use by foreign refiners for technical reasons, in that Methods 2 and 3 model the quality of overall refinery gasoline production, not the quality of a portion of refinery production. The overall quality of gasoline from a refinery may bear scant resemblance to the quality of the portion going to the U.S. market. Accordingly, Methods 2 and 3 normally will not work for refineries that ship only a portion of their production to the U.S. market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that it is inappropriate to require the use of Methods 2 and 3 baselines when these Methods will not work properly for some or most foreign refiners, and when the consequence of such a failure would be to bar the foreign refiner from importing gasoline into the U.S. Therefore, in order to create a non-optional baseline setting approach for foreign refiners, EPA determined to regulate their gasolines through domestic importers as described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the technical difficulties inherent in applying baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to importers and foreign refiners, and the potential for gaming that would result from optional use of these Methods, EPA is concerned that it would be unable to carry out a consistently effective compliance monitoring and enforcement program of foreign refinery baselines set using these Methods, with the result that the accuracy of foreign refinery baselines would not be ensured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a fundamental distinction between EPA's ability to monitor and enforce regulatory requirements that would apply against domestic as opposed to foreign refiners. Simply put, domestic refiners are subject to the full panoply of EPA's regulatory jurisdiction and compliance monitoring, while not all foreign refiners desiring to produce reformulated and/or conventional gasoline may be subject to EPA's regulatory jurisdiction with equivalent certainty. Compliance monitoring and enforcement are integral to the establishment of accurate and verifiable baselines, as well as subsequent compliance with standards based on these baselines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reformulated gasoline program compliance monitoring and enforcement scheme consists of several elements designed in the aggregate to ensure that the environmental goals of the Clean Air Act are met, including,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : baseline-setting audits; mandatory reporting and record keeping; independent laboratory sampling and testing; tracking of product from point of production to point of distribution; unannounced EPA compliance inspections; annual attest engagements by certified professionals; and an enforcement scheme comprised of civil penalties, injunctive relief, and criminal sanctions. Domestic refiners and importers are subject to EPA jurisdiction in each of these activities; all foreign refiners may not be equally amenable to EPA jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Domestic refiners, required to establish individual baselines using actual or inferred 1990 production values (Methods 1, 2 and/or 3), are required to have baseline parameter determination methodology and resulting values verified by an EPA-certified auditor. However, foreign refiners, like all foreign corporations and citizens, enjoy protected status under the laws of their national jurisdiction and are not equally amenable to EPA audits of refiner baselines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA has experienced difficulty in other mobile source regulatory programs, including the foreign automotive certificate of conformity program, in gaining entry to foreign countries to conduct compliance inspections and therefore believes similar problems could arise under the reformulated gasoline program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggested that diplomatic instruments may be available to mitigate EPA's concerns with access to foreign refineries for baseline certification and compliance monitoring and oversight. However, EPA has not been presented with a model instrument that guarantees such access over time. In contrast, EPA does have guaranteed access to domestic refineries and importers through authority provided in the Act and its implementing regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, EPA is unaware of any current diplomatic instruments which would provide EPA with assurances of oversight of the integrity of compliance audits conducted by non-U.S. auditors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has considered whether one or more foreign refiners may be able to devise a diplomatic instrument sufficient to guarantee EPA's certified auditors and inspectors access to conduct baseline verification audits and compliance oversight and enforcement inspections. However, the foreign supply of gasoline (conventional and ultimately reformulated gasolines) to the U.S. currently depends on imports from numerous foreign sources. EPA believes it unlikely that all current (or foreseeable future) foreign suppliers of gasoline will be able to provide adequate diplomatic guarantees for EPA access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 CRITICALLY INJURED BY BLAST AT HOME  </P> <P> An explosion apparently caused by a gas leak destroyed a Pacific Beach  apartment Saturday morning and critically injured two residents, a Fire  Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> Firefighters responded to the two-story complex in the 900 block of Tourmaline  Street shortly after 5 a.m. and found two residents lying in the front yard,  Capt. Bob Landis said.  </P> <P> The victims, Larry Harlin, age not given, and Deborah Arnaudo, 24, were taken  to UC San Diego Medical Center, Landis said. Harlin suffered burns over 85% of  his body, and Arnaudo suffered burns over almost 45% of her body. Both were in  critical condition Saturday afternoon, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Fire investigators suspect that the explosion, which blew out a first floor  wall, occurred when natural gas leaking in a bedroom closet was ignited by an  open flame.  </P> <P> The explosion caused $12,500 in damages, Landis said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The United States Must Promptly Renounce Its Hostile </F> Policy Against the DPRK" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Foreign political  parties urged the United States to promptly renounce its hostile  policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at  isolating and stifling it.    Vassalo Anthony Joseph, general secretary of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Malta, in a letter to the  president of the UN General Assembly April 3 urged him to show  deep interest in the resumption of DPRK-USA talks and pay due  attention to the challenging act of the United States in  unilaterally foiling the third round of DPRK-USA talks.    The letter strongly urged that the United States should  withdraw all its military hardware including nuclear weapons and  troops from South Korea and stop any manner of interference in  the internal affairs of Korea including military action.    Amaral Matos, first secretary of the Maputo City Committee  of  the Mozambique Liberation Front Party, in a statement April 11  said the United States could never frighten Korea although it  was putting unreasonable pressure on it in conspiracy with the  International Atomic Energy Agency.    The statement warned that if the United States continue to  resort to pressure on Korea with an anachronistic daydream, it  would sustain a more ignominious defeat and meet with  condemnations from the world people.    The Polish League of Communists "Proletariat" in a statement  April 9 denounced the United States' hostile Korea policy aimed  at isolating and stifling the DPRK and expressed full support to  the recent steps taken by the DPRK with regard to the "nuclear  issue" and to its stand manifested in them.</p>

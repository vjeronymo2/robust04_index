			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (22): Electronic Socrates takes a class - Monica Horten reviews developments in video-conferencing A new technique in distance learning is being pioneered by Boston University in the US. Working with United Technologies Corporation, it has set up the 'virtual university' at which some 150 distance learning students attend live video tutorials. Tutor and students watch each other on a computer screen, asking direct questions as they would in the classroom. Classes are conducted by the tutors from an electronic speaker's podium, named Socrates. The podium has an overhead slide projector in the normal way, but also has a built-in computer screen. The screen displays the video image of the students as well as computer data: charts, lecture notes, maps or a whiteboard. To bring an individual student into view and conduct a personal conversation, the tutor presses a set of controls underneath the screen. Socrates is a far cry from the office 'cinema-size' video conferencing units of the mid-1980s. It reflects the dramatic advances in video conferencing technology in the past year or so. The average system is small enough to be moved around on a trolley - 'roll-about' system is the new industry term. But the latest systems which will appear on the market this year will run on a personal computer. People will be able to run the video conference as part of their normal computer software. The personal computer systems will be sold as a card which slots inside the PC unit - although some manufacturers are working with video conferencing suppliers to build the technology into their machines as a standard feature: for example, Compaq, the pc-maker is working with Picturetel, which invented Socrates. PC systems have been anticipated for some time, but technical difficulties have meant that they have overshot the manufacturer's original timetable for shipment. There is still confusion as to which systems are or will be available and when. Heidi Aghnami of Dataquest, the industry analyst, believes that only Picturetel and VTel now have products shipping in volume. But several are scheduled for the next few months, including ICL, GPT, Northern Telecom, BT, IBM and Olivetti. PC systems will operate via the ISDN telephone services. ISDN is practical because it is a dial-up service; and because it provides the necessary bandwidth for video transmission for the same cost as an ordinary phone call. A video call needs a minimum of 128Kbits/s for the system and an acceptable picture quality. Ideally it should have 384Kbits/s. One ISDN call provides 128Kbits/s; two or more calls can be joined together technically to provide higher bandwidth. In the past, users had to employ expensive leased lines, or order a special circuit from their telephone company for the duration of the call: these circuits typically cost about Pounds 1,000 per hour for a trans-Atlantic call; over ISDN, the cost is closer to Pounds 100. The low cost of ISDN - which has only become widely available in global business centres in the past 18 months - has already been important for the growth in sales of roll-about video conferencing systems. Vendors such as Picturetel are looking at an increase of 60-70 per cent in sales this year over last year. And Heidi Aghnami predicts a compound annual growth rate in revenue of 103 per cent from video conferencing equipment for the years 1992-1997. Another factor has been the decreasing cost of the hardware. The average roll-about unit costs between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 20,000 - reflecting a fall of more than 50 per cent on the Pounds 40,000 price tag two years ago. The PC systems will cost between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 5,000. These are expected to show an even faster increase in sales, with a predicted annual growth rates of 156 per cent in the next three years. Such predictions are attracting new participants - which will sharpen market competition. Azlan, a UK-based network distributor making its first moves to distribute video conferencing, sees increasing demand from its customer base, especially for systems which can link in to local area networks. Azlan will sell roll-about systems from Sony Broadcasting - itself new to video conferencing - and is assessing offerings from pc system suppliers. Nick Coutts, group strategic marketing director, expects a surge in demand next year when prices have settled down even further - 'for all sorts of technology products there is a price point of Pounds 2,000 per seat above which it becomes hard to justify. In about 12 months, video conferencing will reach that figure,' he says. Intel, the semi-conductor manufacturer, is introducing a product called ProShare, expecting to launch it later this year. ProShare is a PC system which will combine its Indeo video coding software with an ISDN card and a video camera. But Intel departs from the other suppliers in that ProShare does not use an H320 codec - the hardware which contains compression/decompression algorithms to enable the video transfer down a telephone line. H320 is the industry standard - and ensures that systems from different manufacturers can talk to each other. 'H320 has been a market enabler,' says Steve Gandy, manager of teleconferencing systems at British Telecom. 'It means that customers can buy a system without having to worry who they are talking to.' According to Heidi Aghnami, the non-standard approach is unlikely to succeed in the long term. PC systems will not only be connected to other PCs but to 'roll-about' systems and will need standard communications protocols in order to do so. 'Intel will have to make a firm decision to go along with industry standards. Experience has shown that proprietary standards don't work in the long term,' says Aghnami. However, Intel has bought a 10 per cent stake in VTel, based in the US, which supplies H320 systems of all sizes. Industry observers believe this could be a move to get to grips with the standard, without overtly backing it. The H320 standard is also being further advanced by a consortium backed by computer and telecoms industry heavyweights such as AT&amp;T, Hewlett-Packard, BT, GPT, Northern Telecom. The group focuses on PC systems. It sees a need for the video transmission standard to address personal computer software applications in a common way, so that customers will be able to transfer data between different software applications across a video conferencing link. For example, a speaker in a video meeting might want people at the other end to have copies of spreadsheet figures. At the moment it is difficult to achieve, but the new standard - known as the T series - aims to resolve the problems.</p>

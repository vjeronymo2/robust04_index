			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Row erupts over Italian bond trade settlement A ROW over the settlement of Italian government bonds traded during turbulent market conditions last week has broken out between several London-based firms and a number of Italian banks. A US investment bank, a Swiss bank and a broking firm are among the London-based firms to have experienced disputed trades with Italian banks. The trades, entered last week when the market fell sharply after the Danish referendum rejecting the Maastricht Treaty, should have been settled this week. But some Italian banks have claimed trades are void because settlement had not occurred within three days, the standard settlement period in the domestic market. In the international market, when bonds are cleared through Cedel or Euroclear, seven days is the standard settlement period. Failure to settle within the standard time is usually penalised by the charging of interest, according to one of the London-based banks. Consequently, they are challenging the Italian banks' position that, under Italian legislation introduced at the start of this year, the trades can be considered void, or a surcharge levied. The issue raises a number of legal questions on the jurisdiction of domestic and international domains which have yet to be clarified. The international bond markets are regulated by the International Securities Market Association, which is a regulatory body in the UK. 'If there is a transaction between two ISMA members in an ISMA product, then ISMA regulations, including seven-day settlement, should apply,' said an ISMA official. Many banks face substantial losses in the Italian government bond market, which is down three points since the Danish referendum result. The bid/offer spreads quoted by traders have widened, and some liquidity has disappeared, as banks try to minimise losses. Widespread selling by international investors, who had been enthusiastic buyers of the paper, left some Italian banks with the impression that they were expected to mop up pools of paper despite a lack of enthusiasm from domestic investors.</p>

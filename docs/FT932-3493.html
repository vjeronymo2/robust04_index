			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Too high, too low, or just about right / Examining the debate over profit levels earned by the UK's privatised utilities Are Britain's privatised utilities making excess profits? The question, debated since BT was privatised in 1984, has been brought to a head by the current Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation of British Gas. The probe was triggered mainly by the inability of the company to agree with Ofgas, its regulator, what level of profits was reasonable. A dispute over profits is also simmering between Ofwat and the water industry. The water regulator has embarked on an elaborate examination of profitability for a review next year of the industry's charges. The government originally rejected profit controls when privatisations began in 1984 and opted for price caps. The idea was that caps would encourage efficiency as companies would be able to keep the extra profits from cost-cutting. But it became apparent that price caps, reviewed every four or five years, could not be set without reference to profits. Defining a benchmark for a reasonable level of profits is far from easy. Crude profit figures in themselves prove nothing, as large companies need larger profits than small companies to reimburse greater shareholder investment. Profit increases by utilities also prove little. Last week the airports group BAA, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, and three electricity companies - PowerGen, National Grid and Scottish Hydro-Electric - reported higher profits, but the figures still begged the question of whether levels were too high, too low or about right. The way regulators, utilities and the MMC answer this question is by calculating the 'cost of capital' - defined as the minimum a company must pay to raise funds from investors. If a company's return on assets is consistently below its cost of capital, it will be unable to raise new funds. If it is higher, customers are being charged more than necessary. Applying this theory in practice runs into numerous complexities. Moreover, the utilities and their regulators have produced widely divergent figures of the cost of capital. Part of the explanation for the differing figures lies in the utilities' interest in proving their cost of capital is high: that way, they believe, the regulators will allow them to make higher profits. Similarly, regulators, as consumer champions, have an incentive to keep prices as low as possible, although this is tempered by their duty to ensure the utilities can finance themselves. The dispute is fiercest in the gas industry, where Ofgas argues that the cost of capital is 2 1/2 to 5 per cent after inflation, while British Gas believes it should be 6.7 per cent for existing assets and 10.8 per cent for new investment. 'We are not earning enough. One of the reasons we went to the MMC was because our profits were being squeezed,' says Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's finance director. In the water industry, the discrepancy is also wide, with Ofwat arguing for a figure of 5 to 6 per cent and companies pushing for 9 1/2 per cent. 'The water companies need to be profitable to invest to meet new environmental standards,' says Mr Paul Garrett of the Water Services Association, the industry trade body. Observers not directly involved with either the utilities or their regulators tend to argue that the right figure for the cost of capital lies somewhere between the extremes. Mr Nigel Burton, an analyst at Warburg Securities, says, on average, it is something below 8 per cent. Mr Simon Taylor, an economist at J P Morgan, the investment bank, thinks the appropriate figure is 6 to 7 per cent for National Grid and higher for others. Most regulators and utilities use the same academic model to calculate the cost of capital, called the capital asset pricing model. This takes the interest rate on a low-risk asset, such as index-linked gilts, and adds a premium to compensate for the greater riskiness of buying equities. An adjustment is then made to account for the fact that companies raise funds not just through issuing equity but also debt, which is cheaper. The problem is that there is disagreement on all elements of the calculation: if different figures are put into the model, different figures emerge. There is particular controversy over whether investments in utilities are risky. The regulators argue that they are less risky than investments in other businesses. The products they supply are basic necessities, not short-term fads, and their dominant market positions give them protection from competition. But the utilities say their businesses are high risk because of continual interference by regulators. Even once a figure is decided for the cost of capital, there is still a question of how to value utilities' assets. This is because regulators wish to compare the cost of capital with profits as a percentage of company assets. But valuing assets leads to another conundrum. Inflation rules out valuing assets according to how much was actually paid for them - the 'historic cost' approach. But valuing them according to how much they would cost to replace - the 'current cost' approach - can produce absurdly high figures. The most extreme case is the water industry, which was sold to investors for Pounds 5.2bn but whose assets in current costs are valued at more than Pounds 100bn. If a 5 per cent cost of capital was applied, profits would need to be increased five-fold (see chart). Ofwat and Ofgas have chosen to cut through this Gordian knot by differentiating between pre- and post-privatisation assets. Pre-privatisation assets are valued according to how much the shareholders paid at flotation, while post-privatisation assets are valued on a current cost basis. But this is of little use to shareholders and customers, since published accounts do not disentangle pre- and post-privatisation assets. Matters are more difficult with BT, which stopped publishing accounts on a current cost basis when privatised. Moreover, figures for single years can be misleading. British Gas's 3.1 per cent return in 1992 was depressed by exceptional factors. Mr Rogerson of British Gas explains that in most years since privatisation the company has earned between 6 and 7 per cent. Such complexities lead some to question the the formal approach of calculating the cost of capital. Mr Peter Hyde, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, says it involves 'taking one subjective figure, called capital values, and multiplying it with another subjective figure, called rate of return, to calculate an even more subjective figure'. A less formal method is to look at how well shareholders have fared in practice. This approach, which involves comparing how far share prices have risen since privatisation with the rise in the FTSE 100 index, is set out in the chart. In all cases, the privatised utilities have outperformed the index, but their records vary considerably. The recently privatised water and electricity companies have done very well - with share prices often rising by 100 per cent during periods when the index rose little. BT and British Gas have also seen their share prices rise. But the rises look less impressive given that they were privatised in 1984 and 1986 respectively and the index has also risen substantially since. The main explanation for the varied performance is that regulators have already tightened the price caps of the companies which were privatised first. BT's cap has been squeezed from the rate of inflation minus 3 percentage points (RPI-3) to RPI-7 1/2 , and British Gas's from RPI-2 to RPI-5. The tighter caps are already having an impact on profits. By contrast, the more recently privatised electricity and water industries have so far escaped stricter regulation. But reviews of their price caps are under way and it is unlikely they can avoid the regulatory squeeze forever. When the British regulatory structure was invented, the government hoped to avoid the American debate about the proper rate of return for utilities. It was over-optimistic. The debate is now well under way. It is complex and fraught. It will probably never end.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                UTILITIES - FINDING A FAIR PROFITS FORMULA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           *Pre-tax                   **Share price rise                            profit       Per cent       since flotation                           Pounds m     (decrease)          per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BT                         1,972          (36)               216 British Gas                1,054          (38)               116 BAA                          285           49                202  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- National Power               580           16                105 PowerGen                     425           18                115 Scottish Power               297           14                 32 Scottish Hydro-Electric      146           19                 43 National Grid                533            7                n/a  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Anglian Water                185            8                 91 North West Water             247            7                 85 South West Water              93            3                100 Thames Water                 251            6                 93 Yorkshire Water              139           12                100 Northumbrian Water            69           14                135  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                **FTSE 100 rise         **Current cost                                since flotation         rate of return                                    per cent                per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BT                                   142                     n/a British Gas                           77                     3.1 BAA                                   23                     n/a  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- National Power                        16                     5.6 PowerGen                              16                     5.7 Scottish Power                        13                     6.0 Scottish Hydro-Electric               13                     6.9 National Grid                        n/a                     7.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Anglian Water                         22                     1.5 North West Water                      22                     1.1 South West Water                      22                     1.6 Thames Water                          22                     0.6 Yorkshire Water                       22                     0.8 Northumbrian Water                    22                     0.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *   Latest financial year **  As at June 10, 1993 *** Latest available figures  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT and Warburg Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

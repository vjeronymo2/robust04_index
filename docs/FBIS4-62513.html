			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] </F> Minister of Foreign Affairs Arkadiy Gukasyan by an unidentified  correspondent in Stepanakert on 14 May]    [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG" daily), 05/14/94--[Correspondent]  What's the external policy of the RMK Ministry of Foreign  Affairs?    [Gukasyan] A public opinion survey, carried in Mountainous  Karabakh, has shown that our people voted for independence.  Today the RMK Ministry of Foreign Affairs is implementing the  will of Karabakh people. Our work is directed to stipulate  recognition of the RMK independence.    [Correspondent] In what way is this work coordinated with  negotiations within CIS, CSCE and UN frameworks?    [Gukasyan] The work, carried out within CIS, CSCE and UN  frameworks, is of tactical nature. But the strategy remains the  same. We have to deal with the international community, with  the opinions of foreign countries and international  organizations, with international law norms. In our opinion, if  we succeed in shifting the struggle from the battlefield into  the political arena, if we sit at a negotiations table, we'll  have an opportunity to present our arguments, which, we believe,  are sufficient for recognition of the RMK.    Our main problem is to stop the military operations. Only  then will it be possible to resolve political problems.  Azerbaijan is not ready to a cease fire today. In my opinion,  the Azeri Government didn't give up the idea of resolving the  Karabakh problem by force yet. They still hope that military  success may create a favorable political situation for future  negotiations. This is a mere illusion, and the Azeri Government  will have to meet the reality, and sit at the negotiations table  together with the RMK authorities. I do not exclude the  possibility that this may be already a new government of  Azerbaijan.    [Correspondent] In your opinion, how many ways for resolving  the Karabakh conflict are offered by different political forces  in Azerbaijan?    [Gukasyan] There is only one opinion in Azerbaijan regarding  the resolution of the Karabakh conflict. I can't see other  forces in Azerbaijan, which would act today differently than the  current Azeri government. The problem is -- which politicians  will be smart enough to give up force methods. And as long as  Aliyev is unable to give these up, the situation may end up with  a shift of power in Azerbaijan.    [Correspondent] Do you agree with the concept of  "Territories  for peace", as suggested by the Chairman of the RA [Republic of  Armenia] Supreme Council?    [Gukasyan] We agree with the concept but we always try to  explain what "peace" means in essence. In our opinion, peace is  only possible after a final status of Mountainous Karabakh is  defined. Without resolving the problem of status, the danger  will persist. In other words, as long as the problem is not  resolved finally, peace is impossible.    [Correspondent] You agreed with stationing disengagement  forces along the whole length of the front line. Do you think,  these forces may become an obstacle to the goals of the RMK?    [Gukasyan] The risk factor has always existed. It was  present when we pulled the problem of Mountainous Karabakh and  took the responsibility for defending (our country) from an  Azeri aggression, and now, when we try to shift from the sphere  of war and to switch into the sphere of peace. We have been  always taking risk. Risk is inevitable. But if resolution of  the problem is related with a choice between war or peace, we  always prefer peace. Though risking, the RMK government will  try to gain not only international guarantees in the stage of  transition to peace, but will take measures to insure security  with our own forces.    [Correspondent] Azerbaijan does not accept the idea of  stationing peace-making forces. Which forces would you prefer  -- CSCE or Russian?    [Gukasyan] The most important thing for us is to have  international guarantees. The more guarantees, the better. CIS  guarantees are good, UN guarantees are even better, and to have  both together would be an ideal case. In our opinion, the  status of Mountainous Karabakh should not depend on will of  Azerbaijan or other countries.    [Correspondent] Azeri journalists have been clearly  indicating that third forces hinder, and have been pointing at  Russia. In your opinion, could the current situation be  possibly reached by means of bilateral negotiations?  [Gukasyan] If there is such a notion in Azerbaijan, then I  can't understand why the Azeri leaders are not willing to sit at  the negotiations table with the RMK. Unfortunately, this is not  true, and this proves once again that the Azeri government is  not sincere in its evaluations.    [Correspondent] Azerbaijan continues stating, that Karabakh  continues implementing the policy of Armenia. How would you  evaluate the Armenia-Karabakh relations in the sphere of  external relations? What's the rate of their influence upon  each other?    [Gukasyan] Armenia and the RMK are completely independent in  their external policies. Of course, this does not exclude some  agreement in our positions. Our opinions differ in several  questions. We do not face any pressure by Armenia in this  regard. Karabakh carries an independent external policy.  Regarding the policy of Azeri leaders -- they have  psychological difficulties in understand the fact that  Mountainous Karabakh is now a separate military and political  entity. We are in friendly relations with the Armenian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs. Our different positions regarding several  questions do not hinder to carry a coordinated policy.    The RMK external policy is developed in Stepanakert, and if  it doesn't coincide with the opinion of the Armenian  authorities, they understand that Karabakh should defend its  opinion.    [Correspondent] How do you see the future of Armenia-RMK  relations? Would it be a single entity or separate units?    [Gukasyan] I see Mountainous Karabakh as an independent  country, though I do not exclude the possibility that Karabakh  may become a part of Armenia.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: CrossRail bill fails in the Commons A private bill authorising the Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme for an east-west railway under London was killed by the Speaker of the Commons yesterday, triggering a battle between transport ministers and the Treasury for funds to revive the project. The attempt to resurrect the bill, rejected in May by a quasi-judicial committee of four MPs, failed when Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker, objected and blocked the motion signed by 288 MPs of all parties. Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, supported Mr Morris. She said: 'Future legislation on that bill is now for the government to determine.' Downing Street said Mr John Major remained 'firmly' behind the project. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is keen to take over the project and promote it through the hybrid bill procedure - a mechanism sometimes used for major private projects backed by the government. Supporters believe, however, that CrossRail will have little prospect of success unless its revenue forecasts are raised. Letters, Page 22</p>

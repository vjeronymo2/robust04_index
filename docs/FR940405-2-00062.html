Survey data collection will continue to be encouraged and supported, but the emphasis of this announcement is the analysis and routine use of collected data and information to actively direct successful program development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This announcement addresses two distinct levels of support. The first is a Core Capacity Program, which consists of using BRFSS data for planning, developing, integrating, coordinating and evaluating chronic disease(s) prevention and control programs, and monitoring the prevalence of major behavioral risks associated with leading causes of premature death. The second is an Enhanced Program, which is intended to increase State capacity to analyze BRFSS data and institutionalize routine use of BRFSS data to develop meaningful interventions and direct program development. Applicants may apply for a Core Capacity Program or for both a Core Capacity Program and an Enhanced Program. Enhanced Program awards will only be considered for those applicants which successfully compete and are funded for Core Capacity Program awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Bonds: Sterling and French franc deals dominate lively session DEALS in French francs and sterling dominated a lively session in the Eurobond market yesterday. SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, launched a Pounds 100m five-year issue via Samuel Montagu, while Woolwich Building Society issued a Pounds 150m three-year deal via Union Bank of Switzerland. Both deals were considered rather aggressively priced, but demand for sterling bonds from overseas and UK investors remains quite firm, and the deals are expected to be placed over the next week or so. In particular, the SmithKline Beecham deal was offered at the same yield as an outstanding Pounds 100m issue, with which it is fungible. Further, the yield spread of 62 basis points over the comparable gilt takes advantage of the shape of the yield curve: as with many recent issues, the bond matures at the end of 1998, while the gilt matures in March 1998, which makes the deal appear more generous. Dealers said the fact that the issue was offered at a premium of several points above par also detered some investors. However, the previous issue, launched at the end of January at a spread of 75 basis points, performed well, meeting demand even above par. The deal was swapped into floating-rate sterling. Woolwich's three-year deal was also considered rather tightly priced at 45 basis points over the curve. However, there has been very little paper at the short end of the yield curve, and existing paper is trading at tight levels. But dealers said that mainstream investors were not very interested in the short end of the market. However, there was demand from asset swappers, who were able to swap the bonds into floating-rate assets paying about 30 basis points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor). In the French franc market, two large deals by Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer francais (SNCF), the French national railway, dominated the day's trading. SNCF launched a FFr4bn issue due 2008, consisting of a FFr2bn international tranche, and a FFr1.5bn domestic offering due 2005. Dealers said that the FFr4bn 15-year deal via Credit Commercial de France met strong demand, particularly from international investors, who are expected to account for more than half the paper placed. SNCF did not swap the proceeds, taking the opportunity to lock in historically low 15-year rates. Also in the French market, Alcatel launched a FFr2bn five-year deal via Societe Generale, priced to yield 55 basis points over the curve. Elsewhere, the Republic of Finland, which has been rumoured in French francs in recent weeks, launched a SFr200m five-year issue via UBS.</p>

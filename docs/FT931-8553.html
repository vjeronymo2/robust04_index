			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exxon expects Indonesian gas deal to be signed soon AN AGREEMENT to develop the giant Natuna gas field in the South China Sea between Exxon Corporation of the US and the Indonesian government could be signed by the end of March, according to an Exxon official in Jakarta. In a recent report the World Bank estimated that the field contained 40 trillion (million million) cubic feet of proven and probable natural gas reserves mixed with about 70 trillion cu f of carbon dioxide. Industry officials say the field will cost Dollars 16bn-Dollars 19bn to develop due to the technical difficulties of separating the natural gas from the carbon dioxide. Gas from the field would be processed into liquefied natural gas. Indonesia is at present the world's largest producer of LNG, exporting over 22m tonnes last year to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. The Indonesian government and Exxon have agreed financial terms for Natuna's development, the Exxon official said. But he declined to give further details. Industry officials say fiscal terms would include cost recovery and taxation terms. Further discussions are likely to cover technical and environmental matters, including methods for disposing of the carbon dioxide. One proposal is to reinject the carbon dioxide into limestone reefs, but this may necessitate an expansion of the project's acreage. Exxon has a 50 per cent stake in the field with Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas company, holding the remainder. Industry officials say Pertamina may be unable to fund its share of development costs and be forced to reduce its stake or offer incentives for Exxon to increase its own financing burden. The World Bank report attaches 'critical importance' to the development of the Natuna field for the future of Indonesia's LNG industry. About 12m tonnes of LNG a year is being produced from Pertamina's Arun plant in North Sumatra but half its contracts expire in 1999 and reserves are running low. The Natuna field could supply about 14m tonnes of LNG a year, more than compensating for the reduction from the Arun plant. Any agreement signed next month, however, would not guarantee the project's go-ahead, officials stress. Before the field could be developed, between 20 and 30 agreements need to be reached with suppliers, banks, shippers and LNG purchasers. Industry officials say the field would take about eight years to develop before first production and would entail more than 700,000 tonnes of offshore platforms and facilities and nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) of pipelines.</p>

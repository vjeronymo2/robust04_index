			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, the Spaniard Domingo Jimenez Beltran  was elected executive director of the new European Environment  Agency, which has its headquarters in Copenhagen.    Jimenez Beltran was chosen from among several hundred  candidates during a special meeting of the administrative board  of the Environment Agency. At the moment he is director general  for environmental policy at the Spanish Ministry for  Transportation and Communications [as heard].    The Agency's new director said that sustainable development  is necessary, in other words, development should be compatible  with environmental protection.    [Begin Jimenez Beltran recording] The Agency has to act like  an information agent supporting political decisions compatible  with the kind of development we want. Public information has to  help citizens take part in this process. In the long run we all  have to make decisions: Politicians and an increasingly strong  public lobby. The agency will be a point of reference providing  the information needed for political decisions as well as for  active public participation. [end recording]</p>

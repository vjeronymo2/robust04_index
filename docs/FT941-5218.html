			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Coal chief warns bidders of risk: Claim that sell-off will cause casualties angers private-sector mining groups Potential bidders for British Coal were given a stark warning by the corporation chairman yesterday that some producers seem certain to be 'squeezed from the market' after the industry's privatisation. Mr Neil Clarke said there would be fierce competition on supply between the buyers of the five regions of British Coal, the leasors of pits already closed by British Coal and importers. The scope for expanding existing sales outside the electricity supply market was only about 3m tonnes. 'This is not likely to be a war without casualties,' he told a monthly meeting of the Coal Industry Society. 'It would seem inevitable that ultimately some producers will be squeezed from the market.' Mr Clarke also said that reductions in British Coal's capacity brought supply and demand far closer to a sustainable balance. This suggests such a balance has yet to be achieved and will reinforce fears that there will be more closures among the 17 remaining pits before privatisation. Mr Clarke's comments were greeted with surprise and anger by private-sector miners. Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, which has already re-opened one pit closed by British Coal and may bid for one of the five regions, said private-sector mines were well used to competition. Another private-sector miner described Mr Clarke's speech as churlish. 'If British Coal had got its costs down as it should have done the market now would be much bigger.' Separately, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the government would have to adopt a more commercial approach to the privatisation of British Coal if taxpayers were to get value for money from the sale. It criticised proposals that bidders for coal rights should pay a lump sum rather than a royalty on each tonne of coal extracted. The institution said that the freehold of coal and colliery land should remain with the coal authority. In his speech, Mr Clarke defended British Coal's marketing, saying it was recovering business by, for example, supplying coking coal for British Steel in south Wales. British Coal expected to maintain its market share this year in spite of colliery closures. Outside the electricity industry and coking coal, sales of coal in the UK next year would be about 13m tonnes of which British Coal would supply at least 9m tonnes. Some imports could not be displaced because of quality factors, so the maximum scope for expanding sales would be about 3m tonnes. Production from up to 10 pits being leased out could be more than 3m tonnes a year, he said. Most of this is being aimed at the non-electricity and coking coal markets. Mr Clarke said the expansion in British Coal's range and volume of products would continue.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Injectable 'birth pill' drug given go-ahead UPJOHN, the US pharmaceuticals group, yesterday received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its Depo Provera drug as an injectable contraception, nearly 15 years after the company first applied for approval. Although Depo Provera has been on the US market for many years as a treatment for endometrial and kidney cancers, the FDA initially rejected its application as a contraceptive after animal studies suggested it might be linked to cancers of the breast, cervix and liver. Further studies suggested that Depo Provera's link with cancer was minimal, and the drug is already on sale as a contraceptive in about 60 other countries. Analysts estimate the drug's US sales at Dollars 108m, while revenues from non-US markets stand at about Dollars 74m. Each injection of the synthetic hormone, similar to the natural hormone progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months. On Wall Street, shares in Upjohn had risen Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 1/8 at mid-day yesterday.</p>

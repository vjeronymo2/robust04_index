			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shlomit Tana: "Kibbutz B.M."] </F>   [Text] Kibbutz members who work in the first kibbutz plant  that is going to the stock exchange--the Abarot plant of the  religious kibbutz B'erot Yitzhaq, which manufactures steel  pipes--receive a graduated salary, like their wage-earning  counterparts. Their monthly salaries range between 16,000  shekels (for a manager) to 3,000 shekels (for a "common"  laborer).    But the kibbutzniks' wages do not go into their pockets.  Most  of them do not even bother to look at their amounts. In any  event, it cannot affect their standard of living.    Abarot's turning to the stock exchange about a year and a  half ago, together with an external partner, necessitated  implementing several "capitalistic" upheavals in the plant:  establishing a graduated wage also for the kibbutznik workers;  organizating a "Corporation B.M."; the appointment of a board of  directors, on which representatives of the public also sit; and  the implementation of a complete separation between the plant  and the administrative and financial system of the owners--that  is, the kibbutz.    The plant has ceased being just one of the kibbutz's  branches. Today, the economic situation of the kibbutz is not  reflected in the situation of the plant, and the kibbutz  treasurer cannot withdraw monies from the plant in order to fill  the kibbutz coffers. If one of the two entities--the plant or  the kibbutz, goes bankrupt--those who seize its assets will not  be able to touch the assets of the other.    Today, in Be'erot Yitzhaq, no one wants to go backwards. The  manager of the industrial branch in the kibbutz, Eli'ezer  Shafir, is responsible for three local industrial plants.  According to him, it is already clear that, thanks to the  turning to the stock exchange, Abarot's production has gone up  (in 1992 it exceeded 40 million shekels) and that the management  and the control methods have become more professional. "Now we  are forced to insist on quarterly financial reports, and we have  brought to the plant a director-general brought in from the  city, 'Amos Benada."    But Shafir admits that there are also squeaks: kibbutz  members feel that the plant was expropriated from them entirely;  they argue that the management and the board of directors do not  share information with them.    Today it is already forbidden to report in the bulletin or  in  the kibbutz assembly doubts concerning planned transactions.  Thus, for example, the report on the purchase of 50 percent of  the shares of the "Fibertek" plant was given to the members only  after the deal had already been completed.    The Abarot plant, the pioneer of the kibbutzs on the stock  exchange, differs from the seven kibbutz plants that followed it  in the last half year. All seven are "net" kibbutz plants,  without any external partners. About a year after Abarot went to  the stock exchange, Kineret's "Hopit" plant for the manufacture  of plastic containers went to the exchange. After it came  "Spencrete" of Palmahim, "Ortal" and "Tal" of Neveh-Or and  Mishmarot.    Shares of "Kafrit" of Kfar-'Aza, "Gan-Shmu'el Preserves  Manufacturing," and "Ma'abarot Products" were issued in the wave  of flotations of recent weeks.    The chairman of the kibbutz Industry Association, Micha  Hertz  of Nir-Yitzhaq, estimates that 20 to 25 kibbutz plants will go  to the stock exchange during 1994. In five of them, this has  already been approved by the kibbutz assembly. According to him,  on the kibbutzs' road to the stock exchange it will be necessary  to overcome ideological inhibitions and evil images. Many  kibbutzniks still link the stock exchange with phoney,  fictitious businesses and and speculation. Not to speak of the  veterans, who view the whole affair as ideological bankruptcy.    Hertz: "We explain in the kibbutzim that this time we are  not  going to "play" on the exchange and to buy shares. They became  entangled in the 1980's because of such "games." This time we  are talking about the sale of shares. It must be remembered that  today the kibbutzs are having difficulty obtaining capital from  the banks due to their tremendous debt, which comes to  approximately 12 billion shekels."    The Kibbutz Industry Association today comprises more than  360 plants. Only a small portion of them are ready to go to the  exchange from the viewpoint of their stockholders' equity and  their economic strength.    The breakthrough into the capital market involves, as was  stated, complicated considerations. The legal adviser of the  Kibbutz Industry Association advises the kibbutzs that are  weighing this step to take into account that they will have to  relinquish the traditional kibbutz style of management. That is,  it will no longer be possible "to settle things within the home."    The Securities Law requires a public corporation to publish  all the information that is relevant to the investor. On account  of this law, internal kibbutz questions are exposed to the audit  of the Securities Authority. For example: Why is a handicapped  kibbutz member placed next to a central machine? And why "are  they wasting money" on the installation of air conditioning in a  production area that is manned by only four workers? And how is  it that the main operator of a machine is absent because the  kibbutz has decided to make him responsible for preparing a  Purim party?    [Box, p 14 by Hadar Horesh]  <H5>  They Do Not Have A Good Reputation </H5>   The kibbutzs do not have a good reputation at the stock  exchange. David Bal'as's affair presented them as naive  businessmen at best. The kibbutz crisis of the 1990's proved  that most of them do not know how to adapt themselves to the  modern business world.    This year the "Tekhen" affair exploded: a company that was  established by the Takam [United Kibbutz Movement] in 1988,  which raised 40 million shekels by issuing bonds to the  investing public. The company passed on the money that it raised  to the kibbutzs of the Takam, as loans. As was expected from the  start, the kibbutzs could not pay their debts, and they are now  seeking money from the government.    After the successful flotation of Abarot last year, many  believed that a wave of flotations was coming from the kibbutz  movements, but most of the planned flotations got bogged down en  route: the management of the stock exchange presented severe  requirements to the kibbutzs, including a series of arrangements  that were intended to prevent the possibility of the kibbutz  members benefiting from the revenues of the plant at the expense  of the investors from the public at large. Some of the kibbutz  plants were found "not ripe" for a flotation.    More than a year afterwards, kibbutz Kineret--one of the  richest in the kibbutz movement--floated the "Hopit" plastics  factory. In the last two months, the wave of flotations  strengthened. In all, the kibbutzs raised approximately 120  million shekels on the stock exchange. Three more kibbutzs are  in advanced stages of an issue, and it appears that they will  raise capital at the beginning of the next year. [end box]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan says India's assertion not to give up  nuclear option under any circumstances would intensify the  nuclear threat in South Asia and neighboring regions. This was  stated by a Foreign Office spokesman in Islamabad today while  commenting on a statement made by the Indian prime minister, Mr.  Narasimha Rao, during his address to the Indian military  commanders on the 13th of this month. He said Mr. Narasimha  Rao's statement is clear manifestation of India's intention to  persist with its nuclear-weapon program. The spokesman said  when viewed in conjunction with India's reported intention to  deploy ballistic missiles, the statement arouses the legitimate  fear that India is about to take steps which will unleash a  nuclear arms race in South Asia. He said it is no secret that  India wants to be recognized as nuclear-weapon state to realize  its image of itself as a great power. The Indian ambition, the  spokesman said, will inevitably erode the nonproliferation  regime of the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] which  recognizes only five nuclear-weapon states. He said all that  India needs to do to reassure itself about Pakistan's nuclear  program is to accept one of the several proposals made by  Pakistan for reciprocal or regional nonproliferation. The  spokesman said India's stance can only be interpreted as a  preemptory rejection of the proposal advanced recently by the  United States about initiating multilateral talks on security in  South Asia.    Commenting on the press reports about resumption of  bilateral  talks between India and Pakistan, the spokesman clarified that  Pakistan has not received any proposal for ministerial or  summit-level talks between the two countries.</p>

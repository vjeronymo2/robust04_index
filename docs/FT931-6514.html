			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambros to float insurance subsidiaries HAMBROS, the merchant banking group, is completing plans to float some of its insurance subsidiaries on the stock market and expects to go ahead with an issue designed to raise more than Pounds 30m by the end of the month. Hambros, which sold part of its stake in CE Heath, the insurance broker, last year, will retain a stake of about 50 per cent in the new company, Hambros Insurance Services Group. The group's existing management is expected to acquire 15 per cent of the capital, with some 35 per cent being sold to outside investors. The flotation will be by means of a placing coupled with an intermediaries' offer through Panmure Gordon. The new group will be chaired by Mr Christopher Sporborg, the deputy chairman of Hambros Bank. Mr Nicholas Page will become chief executive.

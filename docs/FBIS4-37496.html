			<p>BFN     [Text] Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador in the  United States, said that a date and level has so far not been  set for meetings between Israeli and Jordanian representatives.  Responding to King Husayn's remarks that there would soon be  overt meetings between the two countries, Ambassador Rabinovich  said that although important progress has been made in the  negotiations with Jordan, issues have to be defined precisely  prior to overt meetings. The ambassador added that U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher is planning to visit the region  in July.    Ambassador Rabinovich said the focus in the Israeli-Syrian  negotiations must be a direct dialogue between the sides. The  ambassador remarks to our correspondent Ya'el Eylon at a meeting  of Jewish leaders at the president's residence in Jerusalem.</p>

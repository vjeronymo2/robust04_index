			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Labour condemns policy for needy NEEDY families and others dependent on social security should not be made to pay for the 'economic mess' created by government policies, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said last night, Ivor Owen writes. At Guisborough, Cleveland, he said: 'What is needed is a package of measures to get Britain out of recession, not an attack on the incomes of the unemployed, pensioners and the disabled.' Mr Dewar urged the government to recognise that the best way to reduce the social security budget was to reduce the numbers on the dole by ensuring there were chances for them to secure creative employment. He strongly criticised the speech by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, at last week's Conservative party conference in which he condemned people he said cheated to claim social security. In a letter to the minister, Mr Dewar expressed particular concern about the implications of his attack on 'young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing list'. Mr Dewar deplored the 'offensive suggestion' that women, in significant numbers, became pregnant simply to advance up the queue for housing. He accused Mr Lilley of showing a lack of understanding of the difficulties facing lone parents and young couples in Britain today.</p>

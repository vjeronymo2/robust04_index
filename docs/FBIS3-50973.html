			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vilma Estrada for the "National News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada was  categorical when he stated that transactions carried out by the  government for the sale of gold are totally honest.    [Begin Taboada recording] That is a resource which belongs  to the country and should be managed trusting... [pauses] guided  by the best conditions in the market, where it should be sold  when the market price indicates the gold should be sold -- and  it should be withheld when the market price is so low that the  advisable thing is to withhold the gold. The rest is lack of  information on the part of those who have been critical. [end  recording]    He emphasized how important it is for the country to sign  the  [word indistinct] agreement with the World Bank and the IMF.    [Begin Taboada recording] With regard to the IMF, we are  talking about $84 million distributed over three years; in the  World Bank's case, we are talking about approximately $140  million over a shorter term -- but the amount must also be  disbursed within a period that does not end in 1994. The  signing of those agreements is very important because it means  Nicaragua presents a certificate to the international community  to prove that we are doing what is necessary to end our  dependence on funds from abroad; that we are adopting the  measures needed by the economy to eventually end dependence on  international cooperation; that we are adopting the necessary  measures to effectively activate the country's economic  development; and, in sum, that the handling of public finances  and various policies is adequate and will allow the country to  achieve its full reactivation in the medium term. [end recording]    A delegation is scheduled to arrive in the country in late  January, possibly to sign the agreement.    [Begin Taboada recording] It is important to clearly  understand that Nicaragua needs this agreement. I believe that  anyone who thinks it possible to continue a stable economic  policy without those agreements is being unrealistic.  Therefore, all Nicaraguan groups should join forces to achieve  the best settlement possible within the normal parameters of  these negotiations, in which the two parties concede certain  things for the sake of achieving the best settlement possible.  [end recording]    He announced that $30 million will arrive in the country  from  Taiwan not later than early February. There will also be aid  from the United States -- approximately $40 million.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Nigeria's other head of state: Abiola is cultivating his image as a leader as he plays a wary game with the military ruler THE suppression of Nigeria's election result in June has transformed the image of Mr Moshood Abiola from business tycoon with a chequered career to champion of democracy. President Ibrahim Babangida is an old friend of Mr Abiola, but when he barred him from becoming the next head of state, it was not intended as a favour. However, the country's best known Yoruba has nevertheless achieved a rare feat in Nigerian politics: he has cut across tribal lines and become a focus of opposition to military rule even among people who did not vote for him and who did not expect him to make a good president. The government's refusal to uphold the June election results has left the self-proclaimed president-elect as the rallying point for a civilian population tired of a military regime that, after eight years, seems to have run out of all ideas except how to stay in power. Though less fortified than the president's palace in Abuja, Mr Abiola's house in Lagos is beginning to resemble the home of a head of state. Never a solitary man, Mr Abiola has been besieged by well-wishers since his unofficial victory was annulled. Last Tuesday morning, he and his police escort returned from challenging the government at the Supreme Court to find the house besieged by groups of supporters, mainly from his home state of Ogun, near Lagos. The excited Abiola fans were admitted through massive gates at intervals by security guards, turned out in smart replicas of the New York police uniform, right down to badge and truncheon. The impression of a state within a state continues at the entrance to his large-fronted modern house, where two gilded thrones are placed, one marked president, the other vice-president, in honour of Mr Abiola's running mate, Mr Babagana Kingibe. The first group, women from Ogun state in traditional dress, danced and sang Yoruba songs outside the house for two hours until Mr Abiola emerged to acknowledge the adulation. The women then made way for a larger and even more energetic crowd who also demanded the presence of their leader, holder of some 200 traditional chieftancies and former Africa director of the US multinational ITT. The scene was a mix of traditional and modern, as drummers and dancers, carrying live fish and other gifts from their villages, shuffled past shiny new cars and guards with surveillance equipment. Placards declared: 'Babangida is a pharaoh, end military rule', 'Conspiracy against Nigerian people', 'International communities save us from dictatorship' and 'We have elected our president.' 'These days the chief's time is not his own,' said an apologetic assistant, as Mr Abiola stood on a chair to address an equally large throng inside his house. By mid-afternoon the crowd, fed and refreshed, began to leave and their hero looked about to wilt. 'I just want to sleep,' said the Social Democratic party leader as food was brought for him and 20 or so close friends. During lunch, when the mobile phone was not ringing, he discussed his tactics. Mr Abiola has abandoned passionate rhetoric for measured warnings against the dangers of violence. He has dissociated himself from protests earlier this month in support of his presidency. These were organised in Lagos and other parts of the south-west by the Campaign for Democracy, but degenerated into a looting spree until the troops were sent on to the streets, leading to a number of civilian casualties. Old charges against Mr Abiola, emanating from official circles, that he made his fortune dishonestly out of telecommunications contracts, have been followed since the elections by allegations that as a southerner he does not represent the nation, and even claims that he is a CIA agent and that he has already granted the US permission to base a submarine in Nigerian waters. Mr Abiola has met the president twice since the elections but their positions remain irreconcilable. He denies that Mr Babangida believes his own propaganda. 'The problem is that he just doesn't want to give up power.' But what is his strategy if on August 27 - the target date for handover to civilian rule - Mr Babangida is still president? 'My role is to give leadership, and that will come in due course,' he said. He has repeated his stand against violence yet remains equivocal. 'Those who make peaceful protest through the courts impossible will render violence inevitable,' he said. He has also denied that he wants to split Nigeria by declaring himself president of the south. Mr Abiola's latest ploy, seeking justice through the courts, always looked a long shot. In the end the trip to the Supreme Court proved futile because the government has decreed that the judiciary has no power over the government's transition programme. From his seat in Lagos, Mr Abiola's position within his own party is unclear and the government still retains the support of the armed forces. President Babangida is said to be a shrewd poker player. Mr Abiola may be wise not to show his hand until he picks up an ace.</p>

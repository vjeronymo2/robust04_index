			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VARIATIONS ON A DESERT CLASSIC  </P> <P> Stuffed dates, date-nut bread, date shakes, Waldorf salad with dates -- you  would expect to find these old-timers in a collection of recipes dealing with  the sweet fruit of the date palm. But times have changed considerably, and  contemporary chefs are using the date in innovative ways.  </P> <P> Chef Antonio Jimenez of Cafe Cafe in Westwood adds dates to peanut sauce for  linguine and spices the unusual mixture with Thai red curry paste. Hugo Molina  of the Parkway Grill in Pasadena simmers dates with raspberry vinegar, Port,  cream and shallots to make a rosy sauce for sliced duck breast.  </P> <P> Roger Pigozzi, executive chef of the Biltmore Hotel, has a couple of ideas that  will come in handy for future holiday seasons as well as for special occasions  now. Individual molded souffles that blend wild rice, dates and celery root  make a dressy addition to a dinner plate. The date and apricot stuffing that  Pigozzi suggests for pork chops and game should also work well with poultry.  </P> <P> The only note of tradition is Georgian chicken with dates, a family recipe from  Fred Powers, the proprietor of Gorky's Cafe and Russian Brewery. The chicken  simmers with vegetables, wine and other ingredients in a sauce that is lightly  sweetened with sugar and dates.  </P> <P> LINGUINE WITH PEANUT SAUCE AND DATES  </P> <P> Antonio Jimenez, Cafe Cafe  </P> <P> 2 to 3 tablespoons half and half  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon Thai red curry paste  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dates, slivered  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon creamy peanut butter  </P> <P> Oil  </P> <P> 4 ounces cooked linguine  </P> <P> Chopped parsley  </P> <P> Heat 2 tablespoons half and half and sesame oil in small skillet.

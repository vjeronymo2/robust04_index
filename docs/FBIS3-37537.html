The mission is suggesting  the division of authority between Chisinau and Tiraspol along  with the preservation of the territorial integrity of Moldova.  The Dniester region will be given the right to  self-determination, if Moldova wishes to form a single state  with Romania.    According to a statement of the Dniester leader, circulated  today, Smirnov had a meeting with the CSCE mission in Tiraspol  and asked its representatives to be mediators and guarantors at  talks with the Moldovan leaders on a peaceful settlement of the  conflict. The Tiraspol leader told representatives of the  European conference that elections to the Moldovan parliament  would not be held in the Dniester region, since the problem of  granting a special legal status to the region has not yet been  settled.    However, the authorities will not create obstacles for those  who want to take part in the voting on the right-bank part of  the Moldovan territory. Smirnov said he was ready to meet  Moldovan leaders and hold talks with them on a peaceful  settlement of the conflict.</p>

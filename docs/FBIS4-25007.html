			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Overseas investors are  keen on the construction of expressways in Guangdong, a  flourishing province in south China.    Construction contracts involving 50.4 billion yuan (5.8  billion U.S. dollars) have been drawn up between Guangdong and  overseas investors since 1993, local officials said.    The overseas investment, which accounts for 61.9 percent of  construction funding, comes from the United States, Brazil,  Malaysia, France and Hong Kong.    Local officials said that the existing highways are far  short  of the economic boom. The daily flow of cars on most highways  in the province surpasses 5,000, with some even reaching 10,000.    Under construction are expressways from Guangzhou, the  capital city, to Zhuhai, a special economic zone, between the  special economic zones of Shenzhen and Shantou, and along the  coast from Yangjiang to Zhuhai.    Besides, Guangdong Province has already signed agreements of  intent with overseas partners for the construction of the  Guangdong section of the Beijing-Guangzhou Expressway and three  other expressways. The projects are expected to be started next  year and completed by 1998-99.</p>

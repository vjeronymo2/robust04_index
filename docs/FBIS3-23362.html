			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nadav Ha'etzni: "The Palestinian Street -- </F> Drifting Away From 'Arafat]    [Text] Leaflets calling for the resumption of the armed  and violent struggle against Israel and for quitting the talks  with it have been distributed throughout the territories in the  last two weeks, since the massacre in Hebron. Some of the  leaflets demanded the Palestinian leadership not return to the  negotiating table unless settlements are eradicated and an  international force is deployed in the territories.    There was nothing dramatically new in the content of the  leaflets. They stated the position of the Palestinian  opposition, which has been operating openly since the Oslo  agreement was disclosed. However, there was a big change in the  identity of the signatories. The name of 'Arafat's  organization, Fatah, appeared in all of them, alongside that of  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the Democratic and the  Popular Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine, and other  opponents of the process. One such leaflet, signed by seven  organizations, was distributed in Jericho; others appeared in  places such as Hebron and Janin.    What is interesting is that the leaflets did not appear out  of the blue. They are the external manifestation of a profound  process which has been gathering momentum since the Hebron  massacre. A broad coalition has been emerging in the street and  in internal circles, which has been pushing for a total halt of  the talks. 'Arafat's closest advisers have been bending over  backwards in a bid to find a way back to the negotiations, but  as the situation appears now, no acrobatic formula will satisfy  the local leadership in the territories. In fact, most Fatah  activists in the cities have fallen into step with their  erstwhile opponents. Many Fatah members in Hebron went as far  as announcing their desertion to the ranks of Hamas.    According to various reports, this "closing of ranks" around  the opposition has had another effect: the resumption of  terrorist activities against Israel. Israeli security elements  are aware of the fact that instructions in that spirit have been  sent from Tunis and Amman to Fatah gangs in Judaea, Samaria, and  Gaza. However, even if such instructions had not been received  from the outside, the disengagement from Oslo would have been  inevitable. Many of these militant leaflets were written  without the approval of the chairman in Tunis or his envoy in  Jerusalem, Faysal al-Husayni. The latter tried to thwart  attempts to bring about cooperation between the opposition and  Fatah on the national level, but these efforts spurred  al-Husayni's subordinates to take independent action.

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Parsimony paints a poor picture - Companies find collections raise more than spirits / Off the Wall SLOWLY, oh so very slowly, companies are improving the quality of the art on their office walls. If they want any encouragement it is perhaps significant that some of the most successful British companies - Unilever, ICI, NatWest  -have the best art collections, while connoisseurs among the banks, such as Flemings, with its Scottish art, have collections they regard as among their better investments. But you can still visit boardrooms where the walls are covered with abject hunting prints, or even the portraits of former directors. It is inexcusable. Art can stimulate the work force; project a positive image for a company; provide patronage for British artists; and perhaps show a good investment. Some might even be tax deductible. There is no excuse, when companies invest many millions in a new HQ, for skimping on interior design. The word is getting through. Pearl Assurance last month moved into a Pounds 100m HQ near Peterborough which is brimming with modern art. It asked the Contemporary Art Society to select most of it, and its Pounds 700,000 purchased over 120 pieces. The commission is the largest handled by the CAS, a charitable organisation which helps galleries and museums acquire contemporary art. The CAS has worked for ICI, Unilever, Nat West, De Beers, and for Stuart Lipton, one of the few developers convinced that art improves the marketability of projects. At Pearl, there is a Michael Sandle sculpture in the courtyard and a tapestry by Joanna Buxton at the entrance. The paintings were the responsibility of the CAS. From its contacts it supplied works by new graduates - like Peter Doig, Zoe Benbow and Jenny Franklin - as well as established names like Maggi Hambling and John Keane. Many of the paintings are large and bold and are used to unify and individualise open plan offices. Artists and dealers are usually happy to sell to CAS at the keenest prices. Pearl spent a derisory sum on art compared with the cost of the building. It raised almost Pounds 600,000 of its investment by selling the traditional furnishings of its old HQ in Holborn. In the recessionary future, the CAS, and other corporate art advisers - like Coode-Adams Martin, Art for Offices and Unicorn - will be employed more on refurbishing than on new projects. But the best new buildings are still those improved by artist and craftsman. Lipton's office block on London's Ludgate Hill is embellished with 40,000 hand made tiles by Rupert Spira; the new ITV HQ in Gray's Inn Road is enhanced with work by John Loker; and the National Power offices in Swindon have attractive floating sails in the atrium, created by Sue Ridge. And the most expensive new building in the UK this century, the Pounds 450m British Library, will not look quite as austere as feared. The government, in an act of amazing parsimony, refused to provide its promised Pounds 500,000 for works of art to set off the piazza. Now the Foundation for Sport and the Arts has come up with Pounds 175,000 to enable Eduardo Paolozzi to complete his mammoth statue based on Blake's drawing of Newton. * * * At one level, the links between property developers and the arts have never been stronger. To attract potential tenants to view unlet office blocks, developers have held concerts, encouraged galleries or art schools to display paintings and sculptures and even, in the case of Imry Merchant, owners of Rose Court on the site of the Elizabethan theatre, held a performance of The Merchant of Venice. Now, LMS, owners of Angel Square in Islington, have come up with the ultimate arts event. In September, Artangel, the avant-garde performance group, will take over the unlet block to perform 'soundscapes' by Hans Peter Kush, who specialises in creating unique audio environments. Visitors, limited to groups of 80, will ascend in the lift through a multi-layered arts happening. On each of the five floors they will be confronted by a different environment, ranging from a threatening dark space with flashing lights on floor one to a peaceful nautical atmosphere on floor five. On two nights, dancers will perform a fresh routine on each floor. Can the time be far off when an unlettable office block is permanently converted into a performing arts centre? * * * The Edinburgh Festival opens next weekend, and the auguries are good. Advance ticket sales have brought in Pounds 800,000, down Pounds 100,000 on forecast. But, at a time when late bookings are the norm, the new Festival director, Brian MacMaster, is not too desperate. The big surprise is that one of the events with vacant seats is the Pina Bausch dance troupe, making its first UK visit for 10 years. Most amazed by the unsold tickets is Pina Bausch herself who has not played to an empty seat in 15 years. She has volunteered to bring over a jet load of fans if bookings do not pick up. The Fringe this year is the biggest ever, with over 1,100 different shows. One seems essential. Miles Kingston is offering a 'Rough Guide to the Fringe' at which he will advise on how to react when heckled by comedians; what to do if you are the only person in the audience; and how to avoid audience participation. * * * Remember all that hoo-hah a month or so back about the death of the West End: shows closing; theatres dark; Angels in extremis? Well, as predicted, it was just a summer newspaper space filler. Attendances in June were actually racing ahead, up 7 per cent on last June, helping 1992 attendances rise 5 per cent, to date, over last year. Indeed, audiences are only 2 per cent down on the record levels of 1990. Not that everything is bliss. The profusion of West End theatres, with three more - the Criterion, the Donmar, and the Savoy - set to re-open soon, means there is greater competition than ever for the custom of the 11m theatregoers each year. Impressarios are offering more and more cut price incentives to draw in punters, so postponing that wonderful day when they cover their production costs and start to make a profit. But the real threat to the West End this summer comes not from the recession but from Camden and Westminster Councils, who have the theatres within their boundaries. Camden has extended daytime parking restrictions to 8.30pm and Westminster is planning the same. This makes theatre going much more troublesome for the 2m-odd who take their cars to shows. * * * Anyone disillusioned with the slide in equity prices, might be interested in a memorabilia sale at Knebworth House tomorrow. Among the lots on offer is 'The Little Stockbroker' slot machine, which provided some diversion in the 1930s. Investing a penny (old coinage) can provide a remarkable return. If the spin turns up 'textiles', you get five pennies back. 'Sterling' delivers a copper bottomed sixpence. Even 'coal' offers a fair gamble - a two penny dividend. But don't invest in trusts, bonds, or loans: they just swallow up your money.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EXTRATERRESTRIALS 'COMING BACK TO LOOK FOR ANCIENT MAYANS';  </P> <P> UFO MANIA SWEEPS GUATEMALA, KEEPING EYES FIXED ON THE NIGHT SKY  </P> <P> UFO mania is sweeping this Central American nation, sending thousands of people  each night out into the cold, dark mountains hoping for a glimpse of  extraterrestrials.  </P> <P> Hundreds of night sightings by upstanding citizens, not thought to be psychotic  or prone to heavy drinking, have captured the imagination of the country of 8.7  million people.  </P> <P> Each day, local papers report sightings by doctors, lawyers, students and even  government officials. Conversation on the streets of Guatemala City invariably  turns to the phenomenon, with a wide range of opinions about what the strange  objects might actually be.  </P> <P> "I think the ETs (extraterrestrials) are coming back to look for the ancient  Mayans, with whom they had contact centuries ago," said Joaquin Lopez Bonilla,  a 20-year-old student at the capital's San Carlos University.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Looking for Tikal'  </P> <P> "They are looking for Tikal, I am sure," he said, referring to the resplendent  ancient Mayan capital, now a major archeological site about 200 miles north of  Guatemala City.  </P> <P> But there is a lot of skepticism.  </P> <P> "These so-called sightings are nothing more than drug-traffickers who operate  small craft at night," said Nario Pineda, a businessman from the town of  Antigua, just outside the capital. "They make all kinds of strange maneuvers in  order to avoid radar and the police,"  </P> <P> But for those who claim to have seen the UFOs, nothing can dissuade them from  their belief.  </P> <P> "I saw them and so did 12 of my friends, so I know I am not crazy," said Juan  Carlos del Monte, 28. "We saw two red lights far off in the distance. They  seemed to be playing around out in space. Then, suddenly, one began to move.  Within 30 seconds it was flying practically over our heads.  </P> <P> "It was bigger than a jumbo jet, and it did not make a sound. It was circular  in shape, with one red light and three amber lights," Del Monte said.  </P> <P> Del Monte was interviewed 40 miles northeast of Guatemala City along the  highway that leads to the Caribbean coast. The area, near the town of El  Progresso, has produced by far the richest number of sightings, although UFOs  have been reported in other parts of the country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Common Time  </P> <P> In El Progresso, the UFOs reportedly appear between 7:45 and 8:15 p.m. The most  common time for their appearance is exactly at 7:56 p.m.  </P> <P> On a recent night, the highway was lined with hundreds of cars, each jam-packed  with children, dogs, grandparents and whoever else wanted to see the UFOs.  </P> <P> Many people wrapped up tightly against the cold winter chill of the desolate  mountains and milled about, comparing tales of past sightings. Dozens of  telescopes and binoculars pointed toward the clear black sky.  </P> <P> One man, using a portable electric organ, played the famous five-note tune made  popular from the movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."  </P> <P> "They are out there; they can hear me," he insisted.  </P> <P> On that night, however, the UFOs did not appear.  </P> <P> "There are too many people here now," said one disgruntled observer, who said  he had come to El Progresso every night for a week. "All the car lights and  cumbia music (a lilting form of 'salsa')) are scaring the Martians away."  </P> <P> "It has been like this every night for the past few days," said one police  officer, who was sent to El Progresso to make sure that the highway was not  blocked by the crowd. "Thousands of them come up from the capital to see the  UFOs. It's a big party."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three Times  </P> <P> "I have seen the UFOs three times," he said, adding that he did not want to  give his name because "otherwise, they will think I am crazy down at  headquarters."  </P> <P> But the government is apparently not taking the UFO craze lightly.  </P> <P> "We don't fully discount the sightings, in fact, we're a little concerned," a  Defense Ministry spokesman said. "But there is no proof of anything,"  </P> <P> He said that a number of military and police agencies were investigating the  reports and that the agencies were "keeping an eye out for the UFOs ourselves."  </P> <P> "We have four observation posts set up around El Progresso," he said.  </P> <P> Even Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan was not immune to UFO mania. One  night recently, he and an entourage of aides spent several hours near El  Progresso, heads turned skyward.  </P> <P> "We did not see a thing," the minister told reporters the next day. "I am very  disappointed, but I will be back again,"  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the craze continues.  </P> <P> Local merchants are running radio ads claiming that ETs came to Guatemala to  buy their products, while T-shirts, banners and graffiti cry out: "Welcome to  Central America UFOs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrive Late  </P> <P> "It's getting to be a bit much. We are going to suffer if this continues," said  one bank manager in Guatemala City, adding that several of his employees "have  been coming in late in the morning."  </P> <P> "They stay out in El Progresso until very late and cannot get up in time the  next day," he said.  </P> <P> But as long as the sightings continue, Guatemalans will keep looking skyward at  night.  </P> <P> "This is the most exciting thing that has happened here in years," Del Monte  said. "It is better than the Pope's visit in 1985."  </P></p>

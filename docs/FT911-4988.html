			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Iranian border reopened to refugees Iran said yesterday a border crossing with Iraq had been reopened a day after Iraqi tanks and troops had sealed it and killed a number of Kurdish refugees. IRNA, the official news agency, said the Tileh Kouh border, near the Iranian town of Sar-e-Pol-e-Zahab, was reopened on Monday night and about 100,000 Iraqi refugees were waiting to enter. Iraqi troops backed by 15 tanks had opened fire on the refugees at Tileh Kouh on Sunday night, killing a number of them and closing their escape route, according to a Tehran Radio report on Monday. Iran formally protested to Baghdad, saying an Iraqi brigade moved two miles into Iran in violation of a UN-brokered ceasefire halting the two countries' eight-year war in 1988.</p>

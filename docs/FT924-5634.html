			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wassall document attacks Evode debt WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate which has launched a hostile Pounds 94.3m bid for Evode, is expected to publish its offer document later today, highlighting the chemicals and plastic group's net indebtedness. According to Wassall, Evode's net debt has risen from Pounds 6.6m in 1987 to Pounds 113m in 1991, which includes Pounds 40.7m of convertible preference shares and the Dollars 43m (Pounds 28.4m) unlisted US redeemable preference shares. Evode argues that since the UK preference shares do not have to convert until 2001 they should be treated as equity. However, Mr Christopher Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said holders of the preference shares would only be willing to lose their 7 per cent coupon and convert into equity if Evode's dividend grew by an annual rate of 18 per cent from 1993. 'Having cut last year's dividend by 44 per cent, I cannot see how Evode could increase their pay-out by 18 per cent a year,' said Mr Miller. Wassall also argues that some of the Pounds 70.2m of goodwill relating to Evode's 1989 purchase of Chamberlain Phipps should be written back into its profit and loss account following the recent sale of Chamberlain's shoe business. Mr Miller said: 'If just 10 per cent of the goodwill relating to Chamberlain is written back into Evode's accounts, it will wipe out the Pounds 6.5m which its own broker forecast for Evode's after-tax profits to September 28'. Evode's financial adviser yesterday said some goodwill relating to Chamberlain might be written back into its profit and loss account, but did not want to comment further until publication of the group's results next month. Mr Miller said: 'We will be asking how Evode will be able to fund capital expenditure, meet its redemption obligations, pay back the bank debt and payout preference and ordinary dividends all at the same time.' Evode is likely to take the two weeks allowed under Takeover Panel rules to reply to Wassall's offer document.</p>

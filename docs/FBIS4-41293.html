			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 21, BNS -- The income of 1,300  interviewed families increased 41.5 percent in the first quarter  of 1994 compared to the same period last year, the Latvian State  Statistics Committee said. The index of consumer prices rose  34.6 percent in the period what means that the purchasing  ability of residents grew 5.1 percent. However, compared to the  fourth quarter of 1993 the real purchasing ability did not rise.    Regardless of the slight increase of family income, the  families generally failed to earn the subsistence basket which  was recently worth 48.74 lats and even the crisis subsistence  basket which was worth 38.44 lats because the average monthly  income per family was 34.54 lats in the first quarter of 1994.    The income of urban families grew 47 percent to reach 39.66  lats per each family member in month while the income of rural  families increased 28.6 percent.    The income of families with average monthly earnings 25 lats  per one member increased from 16.74 lats in the first quarter of  last year to 18.49 lats in the first quarter of this year.    The income of families with average earnings 45 lats and  more  increased from 60.42 lats to 65.29 lats per month.    The incomes increased thanks to the growth of official  salaries from 15.53 lats to 22.55 lats, as well as resources  donated by public and pension funds.</p>

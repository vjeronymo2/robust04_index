			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Trying to sell Kiev reform: Opposition to the market WHILE Ukrainian officials have spent the past week embroiled in international negotiations over oil, foreign debt and nuclear weapons, opposition to market-oriented reform proposals has begun to emerge. Deputy prime minister Viktor Pynzenyk is now rewriting his reform programme after conservatives in the cabinet gave his draft proposals a frosty reception while he was away in Brussels this month seeking European Community aid. At the same time, hardline ex-Communists in parliament are rumoured to be organising an attempt to oust the reformist chairman of parliament, Mr Ivan Pliushch. Mr Pynzenyk's latest draft is scheduled to come before the full cabinet for approval this week before being presented to parliament. The programme plans to cut inflation from over 50 per cent a month now to 3 or 4 per cent a month by the end of the year. To do that, Mr Pynzenyk wants to bring the budget deficit down to 6 per cent of gross domestic product this year, from 1992's run-away deficit of 36 per cent of GDP. Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma insists he remained committed to this reformist course. 'I cannot imagine doing anything other than continuing with the reform programme,' he said. 'There is no other path.' But Mr Kuchma said the reforms had to be sold carefully. Cuts in social welfare spending, which are envisaged as part of the effort to balance the budget, would go ahead. But reformers must speak of 'restructuring' the state health care, not cutting it. 'We cannot write that we will spend less on health, so we should call it restructuring, ' Mr Kuchma said. 'It is the same thing but expressed in a different way. This does not mean that we are backing down from the programme.' Mr Kuchma has asked Mr Pynzenyk to present the reforms in a politically palatable form. Yet his fears about the political acceptability of the proposals have cast doubt among western observers and Ukrainian economists on his willingness to take the tough decisions that will be needed to control inflation. Since coming to office in October, Mr Kuchma has failed to rein in credit emission. Central bank officials say that in the last two months of 1992 there was a net emission of Rbs100bn, bringing the monthly inflation rate to 50 per cent in December. Prices rose by 2,500 per cent over the whole year. Ukraine's coupon is one of the few currencies in the world to have depreciated against the Russian rouble since Ukraine left the rouble zone in November. When the government has taken tough decisions, it has tended to bow to pressure and watered down its actions. Its decision to cut food subsidies and raise state prices, which came into effect on December 25, caused many food prices to rise by 300 per cent overnight. But when several thousand of workers from the elite Arsenal arms factory marched to the parliament to protest, the government softened the blow by doubling the minimum wage. The government has made some progress in its bid to weaken the power of the state bureaucracy by privatising the agriculture sector. By giving plots of land to its private citizens it has created 13m private smallholders and production rose by 50 per cent last year. 'These garden plots are the main source of food for the cities,' says Mr Pynzenyk. Mr Pynzenyk says progress in microeconomic reforms, including small-scale privatisation in agriculture and the retail sector, are the key to the programme's success: 'We are opposed to the view that we should have stabilisation first and then structural reform,' he says. Mr Daniel Kaufmann, chief of the World Bank mission to Ukraine, has urged Kiev's reformers to speed ahead with structural reforms. 'Financial macro-economic stability cannot be attained without reform at the micro-level, particularly enterprise reform and privatisation in industry and agriculture,' he says. Western financial support for Ukrainian reforms does not appear imminent, especially because of US worries over Ukraine's hesitation to surrender its nuclear weapons. While Mr Kuchma does not expect American aid to make things better, he does not think the US can make things worse. 'America is threatening us over the nuclear weapons,' he says. 'They say that if we do not give them up they will take away their aid. But when they say this, I look around and I say to them, where is this aid?'

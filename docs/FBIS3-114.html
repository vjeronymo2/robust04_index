			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome, 28 Feb (AFP) -- The president of the Supreme  Court of Togo, Mr. Emmanuel Apedoh, told AFP today that the full  results of the legislative elections organized on 6 and 20  February in Togo have not yet been sent by the National  Electoral Commission (CEN). He specified that he is still  without "the reports on the counting of votes" in the five  constituencies where incidents disrupted the polls and which the  CEN declined to publish the results during the second round of  the elections.    This statement calls into question the earlier one made by  the CEN and the Togolese Government that the full results have  been sent to the Supreme Court on 23 February. Questioned this  morning, an official of the CEN admitted that certain documents  on the results in the five constituencies have not as yet been  sent to the Supreme Court but it will be done "in the course of  the day."    The two parties opposed to President Gnassingbe Eyadema  claimed to have won 43 out of the 81 seats at stake, and  therefore the absolute majority in parliament which, according  to the constitution, gives them the prerogative to form the new  government. Supporters of the head of state have announced their  intention to call for the annulment of the polls in the five  constituencies (all claimed by the opposition) whose results the  CEN did not publish.    This confusion has already caused a discrepancy in the  scheduled political timetable. Thus it is out of the question  that the new National Assembly can be officially inaugurated on  1 March as expected since it can only sit "without further  considerations" on the second Tuesday following the official  proclamation of the election results. And yet the Supreme Court  has a maximum of 15 days "after receiving the full results" to  declare them official and final.</p>

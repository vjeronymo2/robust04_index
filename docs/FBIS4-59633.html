			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ibrahim Humaydi report: "Nazzal: Continuation of Israeli </F> Occupation Means That Our Military Operations Against It Will  Not Cease"]    [Text] Damascus -- Muhammad Nazzal, representative of the  Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Jordan, has stressed the  movement's opposition to participation in the self-rule  elections. He pointed out that Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat has no "real desire" to "establish democracy through the  election principle and guaranteeing the opposition's right to  perform their activities freely." He stressed that the  continuation of the military operations of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  Battalions, Hamas' military wing, "is linked to the presence of  the occupation."    Nazzal told AL-HAYAH that the movement's position on the  question of contesting the self-rule elections in October "is  clear and declared. We are for legislative elections in which  the people choose their leadership. As for the elections linked  to the self-rule plan, our position is clear with regard to the  refusal to participate in them." He accused those "calling for  participation in the elections of marketing their political  plans to justify their weak positions." He drew a distinction  between administrative rule elections and "unionist, student,  and municipal" elections. He said that "we are for  participation in all these elections. The only exception is the  administrative elections linked to the self-rule."    Nazzal said that "so far we have not sensed within the  influential minority any real desire to establish democracy in  Palestinian society through the election principle and  guaranteeing the opposition's right to perform their activities  freely." He added that "what we are witnessing in reality is  exactly the opposite. The PLO leadership is against the  election principle."    He added that "this leadership's commitment in its recent  agreement with Israel to prevent verbal incitement by  organizations or groups against the occupation authorities casts  dark shadows on this leadership's method of dealing with its  opponents in the stage ahead."    He was asked: Will you continue military action if you join  the [Palestinian] authority? He replied: "That assumption is  wrong. Who said we are going to participate in the authority?  And what sort of authority is the one being talked about, whose  composition is subject to the occupation authorities' approval?"  Nazzal pointed out that "Hamas' continuation of the resistance  is linked to the presence of the occupation. As long as the  Israeli occupation continues to exist, the resistance against it  will continue and never cease." He added that he accepts "the  flexibility that does not deviate from the constants and that  gives room for moving toward achieving the Palestinian aims....  If the intention is to say that Hamas is showing one thing and  concealing another, and that its positions are aimed at  achieving some interests, even if these interests conflict with  its principles and constants, this concept does not apply to us  and is unacceptable to us."    Hamas' representative in Amman went on to say that the  "al-Qassam Battalions will not be abolished, nor will they cease  to operate. Nor is there any reason to do that as long as the  occupation is still weighing heavily on our land. In fact all  international conventions and treaties guarantee us the right to  resist as long as the causes prompting this resistance have not  been eliminated."    Asked who is going to agree to support them financially if  efforts to establish a comprehensive settlement continue, Nazzal  said: "Despite our repeated affirmations that we have not  received any money from any official quarter, it seems there is  a determination to stir up this matter." He added: "I believe  that those who raise these questions are comparing us with those  on the Palestinian scene who received millions of dollars during  the decades in which conditions were favorable for confronting  the occupation, but they could not achieve what Hamas has now  achieved. So it is difficult for some people to accept the fact  that Hamas has achieved a lot with limited resources."    Nazzal stressed that "Hamas has not received any money from  any official quarter so far." He added that "it does not mean  that we consider such support for Palestinian action a crime  that should be denied. We believe that bolstering the  Palestinian people's steadfastness and resistance against the  occupation is a pan-Arab and Islamic duty for all Arab and  Islamic quarters, official and popular." He added that Hamas  does not reject such an unconditional support. "But the facts  should be stated as they stand in order to put matters straight."    Nazzal described Hamas' relations with the other nine  factions of the "Palestinian Forces Alliance" opposed to the  Oslo accord as "good. We are coordinating with them in order to  consolidate and unite our efforts and tackle the challenges of  this stage." He stressed that Hamas "is not accused by anyone.  It declares its positions clearly and courageously. We offered  our opinion clearly on a number of issues" during the alliance's  meeting two weeks ago. It was "from the position of an ally  seeking common denominators."</p>

The consent decree settles an action brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for injunctive relief and reimbursement of costs. The PSC Resources Superfund Site was operated as a waste oil recycling facility from 1970 to 1978 and is located in Palmer, Massachusetts. As a result of the waste oil operations, the Site became contaminated with hazardous substances and was placed on the National Priorities List. The Environmental Protection Agency performed a removal action and a remedial investigation and feasibility study to identify the nature and extent of the contamination at the Site and to examine how best to remediate the Site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of the proposed decree, eleven defendants (``Performing Settling Defendants'') will perform the required remediation of the Site. The remediation is today estimated to cost $7.35 million. A remedial trust fund will be established to fund the remedy. Approximately one hundred and forty-five (145)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  settling defendants will contribute $3,755,484 to the remedial trust fund. The New Jersey Department of Transportation will contribute $3.5 million and the federal agencies will contribute $625,152, respectively, to the remedial trust fund. The Performing Settling Defendants and settling federal agencies will pay $3,175,000 to the Environmental Protection Agency and Commonwealth of Massachusetts for costs incurred in performing the RI/FS, removal activities and for other past costs and interest, totalling $4,291,333. The Performing Settling Defendants within 30 days of entry of the decree will also pay $153,720 to the Department of Interior in compensation for natural resource damages. Additionally, over the course of the remediation, the Performing Settling Defendants will pay $537,500 of an estimated $575,000 in oversight costs to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Commonwealth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed consent decree.

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Dealers disappointed at investors' response to auction IN a quiet market, US Treasuries eased slightly yesterday after an afternoon auction of two-year notes that left dealers mildly disappointed at the response from investors. In the absence of fresh economic reports, the attention of investors and dealers was firmly focused on the Treasury's sale of Dollars 14.75bn in two-year notes. The two-years were trading at 5.41 per cent in when-issued form just before the auction, and the sale was completed soon after with an average yield of 5.42 per cent, which suggested investors had approached the new issue cautiously. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/32 at 99 1/2 , yielding 8.038 per cent, while at the short end of the market the two-year note was  1/16 lower at 100 5/8 , yielding 5.386 per cent. Trading activity was reported to be light. THE UK government bond market marked time as investors digested news of the latest Pounds 2.5bn auction, due to be launched next Wednesday. The 25-year bonds were quoted yesterday in partly-paid form to yield around 9 per cent, almost identical with yields on other benchmark gilt issues with maturities stretching to 15 years and beyond. Analysts expect a successful auction to provide gilts with another lift, giving a new lease of life to the post-election rally which has run out of steam this week. A lacklustre response, though, could point to a difficult period ahead for the heavy UK borrowing programme. Yesterday, sterling's strength on the foreign exchange market - widely attributed to strong buying overnight in the Far East - helped gilts to get off to a good start. Money supply figures for March, which showed weaker growth than had been expected, added to the positive mood for the bond market. The figures were taken with a pinch of salt in some quarters, though, since they related to the month ahead of the UK election, when uncertainty about the outcome generally held back activity. The 9 per cent gilts maturing in 2011 opened slightly firmer at 99 11/32 and traded higher to end the day at around 99 19/32 , giving a yield of 9.04 per cent. The 9 3/4 per cent gilts maturing in 2002, meanwhile, gained  3/32 to end the day at 103 27/32 . ELSEWHERE in Europe, government bond markets drifted up in thin trade. In France, there were reports of switching out of 10-year and into five-year bonds as some investors positioned themselves for a possible interest rate cut, encouraged by a strong performance from the franc. However, such flurries of activity are still widely seen as highly speculative, given last autumn's failure to sustain a French interest rate cut. Yields on French 10-year bonds remained stubbornly over 70 basis points, despite widespread expectations of a decline in the wake of the recent government reshuffle. Fears of fiscal easing, and political concerns about next year's national elections, continue to figure high in most investors' minds. German government bond prices edged up in listless trading as the market continued to await a new direction for bunds. One possible source for such a direction is the public sector pay dispute: with a strike ballot starting yesterday, the market may not have to wait much longer for a resolution. Technical trading helped the futures contract on Liffe to a gain on the day, rising from its opening of 87.94 to end the day at 87.95. AFTER their setbacks of recent days, Japanese government bonds marked time yesterday. With a sombre mood still hanging over the market, the yield on the benchmark bond no 129 rose on the day to 5.645 per cent, from 5.625 per cent the day before.</p>

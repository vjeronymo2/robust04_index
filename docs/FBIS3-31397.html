Pawlak said the appointment of a finance minister would  be discussed by the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance  (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL).    The prime minister said he was not planning to make any  personnel changes in the Ministry of Privatization as recently  "it considerably changed its style of work" and "the changes in  its leadership were very profound."    Asked about appointments of coalition deputy ministers in  the  so-called presidential ministries, Pawlak said: "We are not  priding ourselves on certain matters but there are some  achievements." He also suggested that newsmen should  concentrate on the functioning of these institutions and not on  symbols.    Pawlak said that in case of possible amendments to the  budget  law in mid-1994, if incomes were bigger than planned, he would  spend the money to animate the economy and on significant social  goals, namely, social assistance and combatting unemployment.    When told that the decisions of the Sejm Budget Committee  adopted on Wednesday were contradictory to his announcements of  the "pro-social budget," Pawlak stressed that press reports on  the cabinet amendments were incomplete. He also recalled that  education, science and culture were planned to receive the  biggest possible means. The prime minister also added that if  it were not for the internal indebtedness, the state budget  would be balanced.    While speaking about a Polish visit by the mission of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pawlak stressed that Poland  fulfilled the conditions included in the agreement. He also  added that the success did not depend on such agreements but "on  the way we control social and economic processes in Poland."</p>

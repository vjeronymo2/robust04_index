			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: TONY ROBERTS WILL STAR IN 'JEROME ROBBINS' BROADWAY'  </P> <P> Tony Roberts and two actors who won Tonys for their roles in "Jerome Robbins'  Broadway" will head the cast of the Los Angeles production, due to open Oct. 10  at the Shubert.  </P> <P> Roberts, best known for his performances in Woody Allen movies, will narrate  the show and step into a series of roles in the show's excerpts from the  Robbins oeuvre. He has done this on Broadway since January. Jason Alexander won  a Tony, as best leading actor in a musical, for creating these roles in 1989.  </P> <P> Debbie Shapiro and Scott Wise will re-create the roles that won them Tonys for  featured acting in a musical.  </P> <P> Although the rest of the casting hasn't been announced, there will be 12 fewer  cast members in Los Angeles than there are on Broadway, said a spokesman for  the producers. However, he added, "at no point will there be fewer dancers  onstage. Each dancer will be doing more."  </P> <P> He also reported that there will be four black cast members in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This comment was in response to a question raised by criticism of the Broadway  production of "Robbins" for its lack of African-American performers. Actors'  Equity officials met with the producers earlier this year to express their  concern about the issue.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Shubert Organization chairman Gerald Schoenfeld said, "We  are endeavoring to increase the number of Afro-Americans in the Los Angeles  cast." At the time of the protest, he added, "we had a representative cast of  many minorities, including Asian- and Hispanic-Americans" -- but only one  African-American.  </P> <P> There are now two blacks in the New York cast, reported the producers'  spokesman. Director Robbins has total casting authority.  </P> <P> THE PRICE OF PRYCE: "Robbins" is not the only big musical that has been  challenged for its minority casting policies. The Equity council met Tuesday in  New York for a long discussion on whether to grant permission for British actor  Jonathan Pryce to star in the New York production of "Miss Saigon," where he  would play the same Eurasian role that he created in the London production.  </P> <P> Asian-American activists have urged the union to insist on the casting of an  Asian actor in the role by using its veto power over foreign performers working  on Broadway. The council adjourned without taking action.  </P> <P> But Equity executive secretary Alan Eisenberg did issue a statement Wednesday  that condemned "the idea that the producers wish to cast a Caucasian actor  'painted yellow' to play the part of a Eurasian. . . . The Council further  believes that it was always the producers' intention to cast the original actor  in this role" -- despite a statement from the producers' casting director that  hundreds of Asian performers were auditioned in New York, Los Angeles, Orange  County, San Francisco, San Jose, Hawaii and Manila.  </P> <P> According to a report in Variety, "Miss Saigon" producer Cameron Macintosh told  Equity officials that he will call off the entire production, scheduled to open  in March, if he can't cast Pryce.  </P> <P> KISS 'CHORUS' GOODBY: They say it's for real this time. "A Chorus Line," at Las  Palmas Theatre, will close Sunday.  </P> <P> The producers had announced earlier closings, then extended the show with  half-price ticket discounts. It was most recently extended through Aug. 5  without discounts, and "box-office receipts have fallen steadily," according to  a statement from the producers.  </P> <P> Refunds are available at point of purchase for the performances that were  scheduled after Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / People: Ellis takes on Wang UK Rick Ellis, a New Zealander in his early 40s, takes over as head of Wang UK this week. He follows in the footsteps of such illustrious predecessors as Ian Diery, now in charge of of Apple Computer's global marketing, and Alan Davis, whose move to Ascom Timeplex created the vacancy Ellis is filling. Ellis has been with Wang for nine years and has held a number of senior management positions, ending up as general manager of the troubled minicomputer manufacturer's New Zealand subsidiary. Wang UK is a frustrated company these days. Wholly owned by its US parent which is now languishing in Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code after years of losses, it has managed its own business rather well and has proved to be Wang's most successful overseas operation.

Ford, for example, has shrugged off worries about Wang's future to place a Dollars 1m order for mid-range computers - IBM machines, that is, with a Wang badge on the front. ***** The Lancaster University Management School is fast becoming a forum for the leading lights of London's advertising and design worlds.

Joining him now as another visiting professor is Winston Fletcher (left), chairman and eponymous co-founder of Delaney Fletcher Slaymaker Delaney and Bozell. (One of the lingering curiosities of the advertising world is why the agency has not yet shortened itself to an acronym as have many others. . .) Like a number of advertising colleagues, Fletcher is clearly a man of great energy. He adds his new academic life to his agency work, his role as director of the Central London Tec, his trusteeship of the Open College of Arts, his weekly column for The Times, and his fellowship of the Royal Society of Arts. Fletcher says 'teaching at a first-class management school is often as beneficial for the teacher as it is for the taught.' His first management lecture could understandably be on the theme: 'The prioritising of working time.'</p>

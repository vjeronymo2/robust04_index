			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Observer: Entertaining Lygo While John Birt's shake-up at the BBC has terminated a few careers, it looks to be good news for Kevin Lygo, son of former British Aerospace chairman Admiral Sir Raymond Lygo. Young Lygo, an executive producer with the Beeb, already has the job of winning higher ratings by developing popular new shows, and the word is that he may well be tapped to take over as head of light entertainment following this week's departure of Jim Moir. The latter has been promoted to deputy director of corporate affairs for the corporation, which more cynical BBC watchers regard as genuine light entertainment. Given the BBC's recent dismal performance in the ratings game, a lot will be required of the new head of light entertainment. Kevin won plaudits for his recent Comic Relief programme . . . and being a good mate of BBC1 controller Alan Yentob always helps.</p>

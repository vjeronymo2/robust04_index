As early as six months ago, General  Ivashov, secretary of the CIS Council of Defense Ministers,  spoke about the imminent integration of the commonwealth Armed  Forces. Vyacheslav Morozov, correspondent of the Radar studio,  talked to him.    [Begin recording] [Morozov] Leonid Grigoryevich, has the  idea  of setting up CIS Armed Forces already been dropped or is it  still alive?    [Ivashov] I believe that nobody has dropped this idea. It  has simply been postponed in connection with quite complex  processes related to the formation of national armed forces,  which are compounded by economic and financial difficulties as  well as other difficulties which our society, our Commonwealth,  is going through. Therefore, the idea has not been discarded,  but it has simply been decided to move toward it stage by stage.  And the things that took place in Ashgabat, at the joint  meeting of the Council of Defense Ministers, the Council of  Foreign Ministers, and the meeting of the Council of Heads of  State show precisely that we are entering a new phase of our  military cooperation. Quite specific decisions were adopted  there. First, a headquarters to coordinate military cooperation  was set up, its statute was approved, and the principles of its  financing and the functions of the headquarters were defined.    I would note as a second point the fact that more than 18  months after the Tashkent collective security treaty was signed  specific steps were taken to implement its provisions. A  secretary general was appointed, a decision on priority steps to  implement the treaty was adopted, and a mechanism was determined  for other states to join the treaty. Georgia and Azerbaijan,  for instance, have already joined the collective security  treaty. Nine Commonwealth states now support the idea of the  treaty, and they are starting to work on creating a collective  security system.    Army General Vitaliy Grigoryevich Radetskiy, Ukrainian  defense minister, made a heartening statement in the spirit of a  constructive approach to the collective security system and  military cooperation within the Commonwealth framework in  general. So the idea is not only alive but has already been  filled with specific content.    We are now in a period of transition to military integration  and construction. An earlier stage was aimed at more or less  civilized division of the Armed Forces, at our divorce, as it  were, in the post-Soviet period. But now a creative stage is  beginning, and I hope I am not mistaken on this matter. We will  draw closer, step by step, restore a single defense space, and  create a defense and security system by joint efforts. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ORTMAYER WANTS TO FOCUS ONLY ON GAME  </P> <P> Because of developments on the field and in the front office, the AFC West  rivalry between the Raiders and San Diego Chargers has evolved into something  especially intense.  </P> <P> Today's game at Jack Murphy Stadium will mark the return to San Diego of Raider  assistant coach Steve Ortmayer, who served as the Chargers' director of  football operations for three seasons before being fired Dec. 18.  </P> <P> Ortmayer, in effect, assembled the Charger team he hopes the Raiders (5-1) will  disassemble in 60 minutes today. He notes that 39 of the 45 players who  finished the season on San Diego's 1989 roster were his products.  </P> <P> After being fired, Ortmayer came back to the Raiders and coaxed a few Chargers  up the freeway with him: wide receiver Jamie Holland, running back Napoleon  McCallum, tight end Andy Parker, tackle James FitzPatrick, defensive tackle  Mike Charles and cornerback Elvis Patterson.  </P> <P> Ortmayer won't allow emotion to stand in the way of Raider success. He built  the present Chargers, for better or worse, but now hopes they lose every game.  </P> <P> "I know this is hard to believe," he said. "But you get caught up so much with  the emotions of winning a division title that you can't afford to root for  other teams in your division, even if you have friends there. You can't. It's  too competitive on a day-to-day basis. Yet, individually, there's a lot of  people there I'd like to see succeed."  </P> <P> Ortmayer's stay in San Diego was controversial from the beginning. Remember, he  left the Raiders to take over operations of a divisional rival, raising the  usual suspicions that anyone who once worked for Al Davis never really works  against him.  </P> <P> Those fears were confirmed in some minds after Ortmayer's role in a major  three-team trade that (1) landed the Raiders quarterback Jay Schroeder, (2)  sent the Washington Redskins a Pro Bowl left tackle, Jim Lachey, and (3) gave  the Chargers lineman John Clay, out of the league because of an injury, and  later, McCallum, who has since returned to the Raiders.  </P> <P> Ortmayer heard the whispers, that he was a Raider masquerading as a Charger. He  was always "Ort the Raider" to some San Diego loyalists. As in most rivalries  involving the Raiders, paranoia rules.  </P> <P> Ortmayer will try to block out the past and concentrate on what promises to be  a game that would have been interesting without the added dimension of Bo  Jackson, who is expected to make his 1990 debut.  </P> <P> The Chargers, Ortmayer can tell you, are well stocked with defensive talent.  They possess a punishing ground game, led by Marion Butts, and have a true star  in receiver Anthony Miller. Yet on the road to 2-4, they've looked awful (two  weeks ago against Pittsburgh) and brilliant (last week against the New York  Jets with their most lopsided victory in 10 years, 39-3).  </P> <P> Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said the Chargers have to find a happy medium.  "You have to play at a consistently high level every week that you go out," he  said. "A lot of it comes from experience. But you can overcome some of those  things if you go out with enthusiasm. That's what we're going to try to do."  </P> <P> Into this mix the Raiders will throw Jackson. Coach Art Shell isn't saying how  Jackson might be used today, but Jackson is expected to take Greg Bell's spot  in the second-quarter tailback rotation.  </P> <P> Shell said he's looking for more out of Jackson this season.  </P> <P> "I want him to become more involved in the passing game," Shell said. "I think  that's important. I don't want it to be a one-dimensional thing, that when Bo's  in the game, then Bo Jackson's going to run, because he's a pretty good  receiver."  </P> <P> Other than that, this game is merely another meeting between mutual friends and  enemies and one former general manager who returns to the scene of the firing.  </P> <P> "Resentment has never been the right word," Ortmayer said of his dismissal.  "Disappointment is certainly a much better word. Disappointment that we weren't  allowed to complete the job we started."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> As expected, the Raiders activated tailback Bo Jackson and defensive end Howie  Long on Saturday. Jackson takes the roster spot vacated by safety Vann McElroy,  traded last week to Seattle. To make room for Long, the team placed tailback  Greg Bell on four-week injured reserve with a sprained right ankle. The Raiders  also activated linebacker Alex Gordon off the team's practice squad, placing  linebacker A.J. Jimerson on injured reserve with a neck injury. Gordon, a  former second-round pick, was acquired earlier this week from the New York Jets  for cornerback Dennis Price.  </P> <P> The Raiders lead the series in San Diego, 17-10-1. . . . Charger running back  Marion Butts is the AFC's second-leading rusher with 505 yards in 105 carries,  an average of 4.8 yards a carry. . . . Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder  continues to lead the AFC in passing with a rating of 101.1. No other AFC  quarterback has a rating as high as 90.  </P> <P> If running back Bo Jackson plays in all of the Raiders' remaining 10 games this  season, he will earn $140,000 per game. . . . Billy Joe Tolliver, San Diego's  second-year quarterback, on the Raider-Charger rivalry: "You don't have to be  here very long to understand the importance of the game. We've got two guys on  this team that between them have 35 years playing experience, that's (assistant  coaches) Ed White and Charlie Joiner. So they can tell us all we need to know."  </P> <P> Raider receiver Mervyn Fernandez leads the AFC with 522 yards on 28 catches. He  and teammate Willie Gault are averaging 18.6 yards a reception. . . . The  Raider and Charger defenses have 20 sacks each through six games, second in the  AFC to Kansas City's 24.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK stores The depression in UK food retailing shares this year has been matched only by that of the drug companies. There are short term explanations for this - food retailers are defensive companies in a market obsessed by potential recovery shares. Low inflation hurts food retailers because they are much more dependent than other stores on rising prices for growth. Yet the fall is too great to be fully explained by such factors. Food shares now stand at a 25 year low compared with stores, a level which was only approached during the price battles of the late 1970s. What the chart really shows is that investors are anticipating a disaster in food retailing. There is a fear that a combination of competition from discount chains and consumer resistance to high margins may spark a price war between the superstore operators, which would cut their selling margins and undermine the value of their extremely expensive sites. Unfortunately, superstores cannot compete fully against the discounters on price because cutting prices that far would eliminate profits. Their strategic options are thus limited, and they are trying to preserve their margins with other marketing tricks. But a price war cannot be ruled out if superstore sales volumes start to sag and cash flows weaken. The current sector valuation is a balance between the probability of a mild rerating if these fears evaporate and the outside possibility of a collapse in margins, profits and asset values. That outside chance may be enough to keep buyers at bay, unless the news improves.</p>

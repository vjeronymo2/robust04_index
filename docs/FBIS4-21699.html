			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 30 March  commenting on the ROK-China discussion on the North Korean  nuclear issue.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Does Our Position on the North Korean  Nuclear Issue Change Again?"    The editorial refers to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's  opposition to the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and the  deployment of Patriot missiles during his talks with ROK  President Kim Yong-sam and writes: "This again shows that China  consistently supports North Korea's position regarding the  nuclear issue." The editorial asks the ROK Government to  elaborate on what Jiang actually told President Kim Yong-sam  during the talks and how the ROK responded to Jiang's remarks.    The editorial describes China's passive attitude toward  international efforts to ensure North Korea's nuclear  transparency and writes: "China turns a blind eye to the North  Korean nuclear issue, which constitutes the most grave challenge  to a post-cold war world, but intervenes, unfairly, into the  ROK's defensive Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of  Patriot missiles. We cannot understand this." The editorial  writes the ROK's diplomacy has "lost its balance" by blindly  believing that the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise may  lead North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty or that the adoption of a resolution at the UN Security  Council may incite North Korea.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 800-word  editorial entitled "Truth and Falsehood of Chinese-Style  Solutions."    Citing the fact that President Kim Yong-sam stressed the  nuclear issue during his visit to Japan, while stressing  economic cooperation during his visit to China, the editorial  writes: "Even though the leaders of Japan and China may have  felt comfortable because of such an attitude, President Kim  Yong-sam failed to make the valuable opportunities to meet with  the leaders of the two countries more valuable." Describing the  U.S.-DPRK talks, a package deal, and the use of persuasion  regarding the North Korean nuclear issue as "Chinese-style  solutions," the editorial writes that China's opposition to some  points in a statement of the UN Security Council chairman is  "disappointing" and describes China's opposition to the  resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of  Patriot missiles during the summit talks as an "almost  uncourteous act." The editorial concludes: "We are under the  impression that our government relies on the Chinese-style  solutions too heavily. It is necessary to examine whether China  is using the North Korean nuclear issue as its diplomatic card."    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Why Does the Policy on the North Korean  Nuclear Issue Change Again?"    The editorial first describes the ROK's acceptance of  China's  preference for dialogue and its logic that "no one must incite  North Korea" and writes that this means that the ROK was  "persuaded" by China, instead of persuading China to accept the  ROK's view. The editorial writes: "The ROK Government may have  its own reason to change its nuclear policies. However, we  cannot but express our worry that the chaos at home and abroad  caused by this policy change may weaken the ROK's  trustworthiness and cause a confusion in the security structure."    Citing ROK Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae's remarks on  the ROK's decision to discuss the nuclear issue with China, in  addition to the United States, and to take joint action, the  editorial writes this is "shocking" and may cause a "mess" in  the ROK's diplomatic axis centering on the United States and  Japan. After writing that all powerful countries in the ROK's  neighborhood are competing to intervene in Korean peninsula  affairs, the editorial concludes: "We already learned a century  ago what invited competition among the powerful countries in our  neighborhood and what resulted from that competition. Our  country must not tremble in dealing with such important  diplomatic issues as the North Korean nuclear issue."</p>

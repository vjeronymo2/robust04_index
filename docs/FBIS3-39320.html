			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Giorgio Bocca article: "Anticommunism Without Communists"] </F>   [Text] Two temptations attributable to the fear of the new  have become widespread in this confused election campaign --  anticommunism and Berlusconism.    Anticommunism without communism creates figments of the  imagination which are completely without foundation but for that  very reason irresistible. The RAI [state radio and television  service] is dominated by the communists! How? Where? It is  better not to ask, because it will make you look like either a  communist or a gullible idiot.    No matter that the RAI's director is Gianni Locatelli, a  Catholic, surrounded by professorial figures reminiscent of  Bocconi or originating from Giuseppe de Rita's ultra-Catholic  CENSIS [Social Investments Studies Center].    No matter that two out of three television networks do not  belong to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] area and that  when it comes to radio, the Catholic, Aldo Grasso, is in charge  of cultural programs and the liberal-socialist, Livio Zanetti,  head of news. Never mind that: The RAI is dominated by  communists. The proof? The RAI does not like [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi, who is leading a crusade against communism;  "therefore" it is communist itself. "Is it not that the RAI is  justifiably afraid that if Berlusconi is victorious he could  gobble it up?" "Don't talk nonsense. It is communist."    The judiciary too are communists. This was said yesterday,  to deafening applause, by red Titti [Judge Tiziana Parenti] --  apart from her hair, a few years ago she was also red by  political affiliation. None of the magistrates involved in the  corruption investigations -- Di Pietro, Colombo, Davigo,  D'Ambrosio -- has ever been a communist party member, but if  Titti Parenti says so, they definitely are communists. "But are  they not trying almost obsessively to make Sama confess that  Gardini paid the communists a billion lire?" "Yes, but it is  all a sham."    The universities are communists, and so are the major  newspapers. "But are their bosses not members of the haute  bourgeoisie, major businessmen?" "Yes, but of the kind that  flirt with communism in order to jointly trample honest  anticommunist businessmen."    Anticommunism without communism is spreading like wildfire  because it conceals a fear of the new -- which is indeed real, a  constant factor in Italy's tradition of quick-change acts, in a  country where, from Garibaldi to Mussolini, all destroyers of  the old state resigned and promptly began to rebuild it. Not  that we have confidence in the transformation of the progressive  alliance; what has happened in France and Spain prompts caution,  but be that as it may, a left-wing government must surely change  a few details, must surely try to eliminate some bad habits,  must surely correct some inefficiencies and instances of wastage  -- enough to terrify the moderates who, if the ruling parties  had not died of their own account, through a process of emptying  and paralysis, would want them back again.    Berlusconism is the other side of the fear of the new; it is  the old in a superficially new guise, and the moderates seek  nothing more than superficial change. The League and the MSI  [Italian Social Movement] could not succeed on their own. For  90 percent of Italians, the League is something alien and  dangerous, parochial and secessionist. It may be only a paper  tiger, but you never know what things will lead to -- look at  what happened in Yugoslavia. Gianfranco Fini's MSI is less  worrying, but still disreputable. The right man is Silvio  Berlusconi, who represents the Italian people's two great loves  -- soccer and television, the self-made man, from pauper to  millionaire, but always easy to get along with. Who better than  him could painlessly carry out the great and painless changeover  of Italian politicians? Out with the old faces of the criminals  and corrupt, and in with the unknown faces that are by that  token new.    Silvio Berlusconi is said to have told journalists who asked  him about his program: "I will not tell you; otherwise the  others will copy it." Such a reply would sound ridiculous in a  country that really wants to change, but it is a stroke of  genius in a country that has no desire to change. A great and  painless changeover of the political class: This is what the  moderates expect from Berlusconi. The greedy service-sector  bourgeoisie, with their carnation [Italian Socialist Party  symbol] buttonholes, that used to applaud Bettino Craxi have  been replaced by a second generation who applaud Berlusconi in  the expectation of being able to further their careers and their  own interests.    If the system of party rule was somehow similar to fascism,  we must unfortunately admit that it collapsed without any  anti-Fascists. At the Rome conference of Forza Italia,  representing the same old Italy motivated by the principle of  just getting along somehow, the audience applauded loudly -- and  I would say with relief -- the vague hymns to economic  liberalism, deregulation, and to God, country, family, and  individuals that leave things as they are.    Both the moderates' anticommunism without communism and the  vilification of Berlusconi, described as the "Black Knight" and  founder of a Fascism clad in a cashmere sweater are both  imaginary. What the moderates expect from Berlusconi in the  event of victory is that he will recycle the democracy of the  First Republic, complete with soccer and television.</p>

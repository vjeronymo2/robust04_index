			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814): "Reform Has </F> Liberated the Most Active Factor of Productive Forces -- The  Lesson of Our Country's Grain Output Increasing by Leaps and  Bounds"]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Feb (XINHUA) -- Despite a decreasing  amount of arable land, our country's total grain output reached  456.4 billion kg in 1993, thus exceeding the previous record  high by 10.2 billion kg. These figures signify that our  country's overall grain production capability has stabilized to  reach the level of producing 450 billion kg annually.    China's grain output has jumped by leaps and bounds over the  past 15 years, increasing from 300 billion kg in 1979 to 450  billion kg in 1993. Fifteen years is a very brief period in the  long history of humans. The sharp increase in grain output over  the 15 years represented a quantum jump in the several thousand  years of history of farming in China. It is exactly because of  this quantum jump in grain production that the Chinese people  have realized the dream of having attained the sufficiency in  food and clothing that had long eluded our ancestors.    With only 7 percent of the world's arable land, China has  solved the problem of feeding and clothing 22 percent of the  world's people. This undoubtedly represents a great  contribution to the entire human existence and development, and  it has surprised the entire world. According to a foreign  economist's analysis, between 1980 and 1991, China contributed  20 kg out of every 50 kg of the increase in the world's gross  grain production. The same foreign economist observed: "It is a  miracle in the history of the world economy; it is simply  incredible."    This is a towering monument to bountifulness erected by  China's 900 million farmers on some 1.4 billion mu of farmland.  The most fundamental reason behind it is the reform that has  liberated the most active factor for productive forces -- human  beings.  <H5>  (1) </H5>   When New China resolutely parted with the old age, which had  lasted for thousands of years and which was a synonym for hunger  and poverty, it failed to establish a set of excellent operating  mechanisms that could effectively encourage production and help  increase the market supply. Possessing neither the right to  manage the land nor to manage the produce, farmers' enthusiasm  for production was greatly dampened. From 1957 to 1978, a span  of 21 years, our country's per capita annual increase in grain  production was less than 0.6 kg. This cruel reality had forced  the state to practice a rationing system for the supply of some  staple agricultural products. By 1978, when the Republic marked  its 29th anniversary, there were still more than 200 million  people in the nation struggling against hunger.    "If people go hungry, can we call this socialism?" In  December 1978, farmers in Xiaogan village, in Fengyang County,  Anhui, while running the risk of being thrown into prison,  ignited the spark of the contract responsibility system and  unveiled the curtain on rural reform. The spark spread  throughout the nation and in one stroke reversed the stagnation  that had long affected the agricultural sector. In 1982, the  total national grain output reached 354 billion kg, an increase  of about 50 billion kg over 1978. By 1984, the nation's gross  grain output increased to 407.30 billion kg, a further increase  of 50 billion kg from 1982, and the per capita possession of  grain reached 400 kg, thus nearing the world's average level for  the first time.    Farmers elatedly hummed tunes while harvesting. Ordinary  people, however, were puzzled by the agricultural miracle that  the farmers had helped to create. They noted that before the  introduction of the reform, the emphasis on "taking agriculture  as the key link" had been repeated time and again and that 800  million farmers were bound to the earth for farming. Despite  all this, grain production remained stagnant. Following the  introduction of the contract responsibility system, not only  grain production posted sharp increases but the production of  other agricultural sideline products, forestry products, animal  husbandry products, and aquatic products also registered great  increases.    An economist had the following explanation: A comparison  between 1949 and 1952 showed that because of farmers' heightened  enthusiasm for production due to farmland having been  distributed to them, they helped boost overall annual grain  production by 13 percent. However, we miscalculated the  situation, thinking that collective farming would bring about  higher efficiency than family-style operations. Farmland  operations were then turned into collective and unified  operations, and areas of farming activities that were put under  control were further expanded. Because laborers, who in the  first place should be the most active factor of the productive  forces, were "dead," the key production element for farming  could not be "enlivened." The household contract responsibility  system, which links remuneration with output, gave the farmers  the right to manage the land. The benefit mechanism fired up  farmers' enthusiasm for farming, which brought about creativity  that was unthinkable in the times of people's communes.    Farmers had a simpler explanation: "After fulfilling the set  quotas for the state and for the collectives, the rest is ours."  The results of labor and the benefits for the producers were  thus closely interlinked. The contract responsibility system  elicited a sense of responsibility, inspired enthusiasm, and led  to bumper harvests.  <H5>  (2) </H5>   Today, if we take a walk through urban and rural market  places, we will find an abundant supply of grains, fowls, fish,  meat, eggs, vegetables, and dairy products. There is a dazzling  display of various lines of food products in stores. Following  the successful solution of the basic problem of "filling the  hungry stomachs" in the mid-eighties, we then entered a stage  where we become particular about the nutrition, tastes, and  varieties of what we eat. This shows the historical change that  has occurred to grain varieties and product quality.    Production and consumption is an inseparable "pair." Market  is an indispensable link between them. But before our country  carried out the rural reform, the link was artificially cut off  and the "pair" was separated. In the area of crop planting,  people were told: "Plant as told." In the area of eating,  people were told: "Eat whatever is available." Both producers  and consumers lost the right of autonomy.    Reform finally dismantled the barrier that separated the  producers and consumers and established a link for the market.  From 1985, the year that saw the issuance of the CPC Central  Committee Number 1 Document, which announced the reform of the  system of the state's monopoly over grain purchase to the  nineties which saw the lifting of controls on grain procurement  and marketing, grain has entered the market as a commodity.  Amid the gradual yet positive and steady reform, the market's  role was recognized, market forces were constantly expanded, and  market mechanisms were introduced one after another.    The opening of the market gave the right and room of  maneuver  for farmers to decide on production on their own. This  undoubtedly is another liberation of the productive forces in  rural areas.    Now, hundreds and thousands of farmers can hold their heads  high. They plant crops with market demands in mind. They say:  "I will plant whatever the market demands." In 1992, farmers  in six provinces, including Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian,  riding on the crest of the tide of reform, reduced the acreage  of long-grained nonglutinous rice which suffered sluggish sales  on the market; instead, they increased the planting acreage of  17.90 million mu of superior-quality rice. The following year,  the craze to engage in "high-yield, high-quality, and  high-efficiency farming" infected the entire nation. According  to the Agriculture Ministry, the nation saw the shrinking of the  planting acreage for long-grain nonglutinous rice by over 12  million mu and the increase over 100 million mu of acreage for  superior-quality rice in 1993; compared to the previous year,  the acreage for superior-quality wheat was increased to over 3  million mu; acreage for soya bean and other food grains was  increased to over 34 million mu over the previous year. It may  be said that the product quality and the structure of varieties  of the current 450 billion kg of grain are far superior to those  in the past.    "When the people are alive, the market gets enlivened, and  the earth also awakes." The folks use the above simple yet  concrete language to describe the truism that has brought about  all the changes that have occurred so far.  <H5>  (3) </H5>   Capital, materials, and science and technology are three  major factors for developing grain production. But these three  major factors require the efforts of farmers. Increasing  chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic sheeting output  and widespread promotion of agricultural science and technology  over the past 15 years have greatly contributed to the increase  in grain production by leaps and bounds.    What gives us much food for thought is that prior to reform  and opening up, there existed the same key elements for  production and the same degree of importance had been attached  to those key production elements. But they were like "a  cesspool of dead water."    People still remember the policy of the "Eight-Point  Character for Agriculture" proposed by Mao Zedong. However,  even at Mao Zedong's personal prompting, it was difficult to put  that Eight-Point policy into practice. The state invested a lot  of funds into the agriculture, but they produced little results.  Despite a lot of scientific achievements in those days, they  failed to take root.    It's easy to find the reasons for the above problems. Under  the shackles of the old system, farmers "started and stopped  working at the sound of the whistle." They just did not care.  As they did not have autonomy, they were powerless to make  things move. They used to say: "What is the use of producing  more grain?"    Reform has liberated millions and millions of farmers from  the shackles of the old system. When this human factor becomes  brisk, all other key elements for production will no longer  remain in "a cesspool of dead water." Statistics show that in  15 years of reform, the overall generating power of our  country's farm machinery jumped 1.6 times, the number of  tractors owned by farmers increased 3.4 times, trucks for  farm-use grew 8.5 times, of which 80 percent of the growth in  farm machinery came through farmers' purchases. The fact that  hundreds and thousands of farming households' snapping up  farm-machinery has brought about the following changes: Acreage  plowed by farm machinery in China has increased 26 percent;  acreage sown by farm machinery jumped 95 percent; and farmland  harvested by farm machinery is up 3.5 times.    Reform and opening up have liberated the most active factor  in the productive forces and enabled science and technology to  display its power as the "primary productive force." When the  prairie fire of the contract responsibility system swept through  the great earth of central China, there were reports of news on  people "fighting for the god of fortune." Now, the farmers'  longing for science, technology, and talented people is the  strongest of any time. They not only try every possible means  to "fight for things that grow money," for "technology," and for  "patent rights," but are willing to spend money to train "local  talents." In just five years during the Seventh Five-Year Plan  period, the acreage of China's cross-bred paddy rice fields was  expanded from 100 million mu to 230 million; cross-bred corn  field from 190 million mu to 270 million; and farmland covered  by plastic sheeting from 31.50 million mu to 53 million.    When talking about the tremendous changes that had been  brought to agriculture, farmers invariably attributed those  changes to the party's good policies. They did not say that  just to flatter the party; they really meant it.    The lesson from the grain output increasing by leaps and  bounds over the past 15 years is: Human beings are the most  active element of the productive forces. When the human factor  gets activated, it will produce a chain reaction upon other key  elements for production and lead to a situation where "one will  try his or her best; things will serve their proper purpose; and  the earth provides of its own accord."</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Framatome net slips to FFr950m FRAMATOME, France's state-controlled nuclear reactor group, yesterday announced a slight fall in net profits, to FFr950m (Dollars 170.55m) in 1992 from FFr986m in 1991. It warned of a further fall in profits in the current year. Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman, said he expected to see the group's net profits settle at around FFr800m in 1993. This would be a reduction of 15 per cent on last year's figure. The pressure on Framatome's profits comes at a time when the group is trying to reduce its reliance on traditional nuclear activities by diversifying into new fields. Earlier this year, it agreed terms to buy Jeumont-Schneider, the electrical components division of the Schneider electrical engineering group. One of the conditions of the deal, which formed part of a pre-electoral reshuffling of state assets by France's old socialist government, was that Framatome agreed to sell the non-nuclear side of Jeumont-Schneider to Alcatel-Alsthom, the electronics concern privatised by the last centre-right administration. The diversification is expected to help Schneider's return to profits growth. The group last year saw sales slip to FFr12.66bn, against FFr14.17bn in 1991. However it benefited from an increase in orders, which rose to FFr37.19bn from FFr33.17bn during the same period. Mr Leny said he expected group sales to rise to FFr15bn this year.</p>

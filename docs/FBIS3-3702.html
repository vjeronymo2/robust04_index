Urbanization in this fast-booming province has hit a rapid  pace in the past decade. However, this is the first time for  the local government to begin to stress planning for urban and  rural construction.    Central townships in the Pearl River Delta will have to make  blueprints on local construction before 1995. All cities will  have to revise their original blueprints. Certain laws to  ensure the implementation of the blueprints will be made,  according to the provincial urban and rural construction  administration.    Infrastructural construction, especially of the sewage and  refuse treatment system in urban areas, is to take priority in  urban construction planning. Underground facilities must be  completed ahead of above-ground buildings.    Officials from the administration said in a recent meeting  that land which is not yet planned in detail is not to be  leased. Construction of buildings in a line along both sides of  a highway is banned, and houses already built along highways but  in contravention of the new regulations will be removed.    In addition, architectural styles will be diversified soon.  Alongside major railway stations, ports, public squares,  airports, trade and commercial buildings and administrative  buildings and along major urban streets, groups of buildings and  scenic spots bearing symbols of each local city will be  constructed.    Guangdong now has 39 cities and 1,462 towns, with a total  urban population topping 19.04 million.    In the past decade, many small towns and townships expanded  to become medium cities. However, a lack of planning has  resulted in air, water and noise pollution in the area.  Transportation has also become difficult as many shops and  other facilities have been built at random along highways.</p>

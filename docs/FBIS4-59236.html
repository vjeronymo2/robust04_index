			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "United States Informs Jordan of </F> Decision To Lift al-'Aqabah Blockade"]    [Excerpts] Amman -- Authoritative Jordanian sources said  yesterday that the United States has informed Jordan of the  decision to lift the blockade imposed on al-'Aqabah port and its  acceptance of Jordan's proposal calling for sending  international civilian inspectors to inspect cargoes after they  have been unloaded in the port.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. decision, which  opens  the door to Jordan's resumption of negotiations with Israel,  came in a message sent by Secretary of State Warren Christopher  the evening of the day before yesterday. [passage omitted]    Official sources have said that the U.S. decision to end sea  inspection operations by U.S. ships in the Strait of Tiran  "removes a major obstacle to an effective Jordanian role in  reactivating the peace process in the future." King Husayn had  made it conditional that the blockade be lifted before his  country can resume peace negotiations with Israel. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: More optimistic note as account ends THE TWO-WEEK trading account in the London equity market closed on a more optimistic note yesterday. The City of London interpreted Thursday night's speech by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, as confirmation that domestic interest rates are headed lower, while the latest political reports suggested that Mr John Major's government will next week secure the support needed for the Maastricht proposals. Equities closed just under the day's best levels, however, and the government bond sector heeded a warning from the chancellor against over-enthusiasm on interest rate prospects. Long-dated gilts shed about  1/8 of a point while index-linked gilts, the securities markets' prime anti-inflation hedge instruments, put on  3/4 of a point. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,658.3, plus 16 on the day. This week has seen the Footsie give back 19.4 points as hopes for another early reduction in base rates from the present 8 per cent level have been cooled by the Bank of England. But over the two-week equity account, the Footsie has gained around 3.4 per cent in the wake of the UK government's move to a policy of economic growth. Yesterday's recovery in share prices indicated significant confidence for the medium term in the face of a round of very gloomy trading reports this week from leading names in British industry - notably ICI and British Steel. Trading volume remained brisk, with the Seaq-reported total at 558.3m shares compared with 567.1m in the previous session. Thursday's retail or customer business was worth Pounds 1.3bn, maintaining the improved trading volumes of the past two months. The London market came off the top at the close when Wall Street came in with a fall of 21 Dow points early in its new session. Now that tensions on the domestic political front appear to be easing, the next test for investment confidence is the US presidential election; the latest opinion polls from across the Atlantic were indicating a dead heat between President Bush and Governor Clinton. ICI remained depressed following the third quarter trading report which has cast over the UK blue chip company the same worries over the dividend outlook as have already unsettled other European chemical groups. After slipping back from the best levels achieved following sterling's exit from the ERM network, retail business has begun to rise again.</p>

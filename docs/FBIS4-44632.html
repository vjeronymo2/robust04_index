			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cui Yachao [1508 0068 6389]: ``Jilin University </F> Develops Semiconductor Laser Rapid Electro-Optic Sampler'']    [Summary] In a 5-year project wherein they broke a foreign  technology blockade, Jilin University engineers have developed  the nation's first semiconductor laser rapid electro-optic  sampler. This new test instrument, which provides parametric  data used in designing and fabricating GaAs-based and other  high-speed ICs and optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs),  has been mastered by only a small number of nations including  the U.S. and Japan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Declaration of National Unity and Accord signed </F> in Tbilisi on 25 May 1994]    [Text] We, the undersigned [as received], remaining loyal  to the ideals of 26 May and realizing our immense responsibility  to the country and its future, recognize that stability and  consolidation are the necessary preconditions for the  implementation of the unswerving will of the citizens of Georgia  to build an independent and democratic state and strive for an  open society.    Despite differences in the positions of various political  forces, the basic principles shaping the country's future which  are shared by a large proportion of the citizens of Georgia are  to be laid down. A single state mentality, civic patriotism,  and striving for a common goal must become the foundation for  national consolidation.    We agree to the main principles in order to establish  national accord and unity in the country. Our unswerving and  undeviating principles are the following:    1. [word indistinct] the independence and territorial  integrity of Georgia.    2. Adherence to democratic ideals, efforts to build a civic  society, and strict observance of human rights.    3. Tolerance, compassion, and protection of the rights of  ethnic minorities.    4. Implementation of economic reforms.    5. Establishment of law and order, uncompromising struggle  against corruption, terrorism, and illegal drugs business, and  support for the law-enforcement bodies.    6. Securing Georgia's rightful place in the world and the  Caucasus region.    7. State and military construction.    8. Refusal to resort to violence or to forging alliance with  special services of foreign countries, and shunning social and  other forms of destabilization in order to achieve political and  other goals.    9. Solving all state issues constitutionally, and deciding  the issue of power through elections or, if necessary, pre-term  elections.    By achieving national consensus we will clearly demonstrate  that the building of an independent and democratic state in  Georgia is the unswerving will of the Georgian people, which  they are capable of implementing.    Our aim is an independent, strong, single, and democratic  Georgia, which we all must build in unity, accord, and respect  for one another.</p>

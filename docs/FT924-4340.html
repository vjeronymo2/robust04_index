			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Five EC states fall behind on single market laws BRITAIN and four other countries appear to be falling behind their EC partners in the race to put EC legislation on the single market into force. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, has written to Britain, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium and Italy urging them to accelerate the progress of single market legislation through national parliaments as the January 1 deadline for opening borders to goods gets closer. According to Commission officials, Spain and Britain - which lays particular stress on the proper implementation of EC laws - have not replied to Mr Bangemann's letters. However, a senior UK official said that London had not even received the Commission warning. EC directives cannot take effect until they are transferred into national law, and the Commission is worried that if it does not put pressure on laggard countries now, the single market will be badly flawed when it opens for business on January 1. Brussels is particularly worried about the failure of some countries to implement important legislation harmonising the system for collecting value added tax and excise duty - the basis for lifting internal border controls on goods. Commission officials say directives which would open up the EC financial services market have also been poorly transposed. The same officials indicated yesterday that Brussels might take emergency legal action against the worst offenders in January, although they stressed that this would be a political decision. They also pointed out that individual citizens could sue member states for failure to implement EC laws, while other member states could refuse products and services coming from member states which did not conform with Community legislation. Britain, which holds the Community presidency, was until recently among the most efficient transposers of EC law. According to October figures, however, Britain has only converted 72.8 per cent of the relevant directives into national law. That puts the UK eighth out of the 12 and compares with the Community average of 79 per cent. 'It's not as good as we would like,' admitted a British official, but said efforts were being made to increase the score by the end of the year. Denmark, which has transferred 94.7 per cent of the EC legislation into law, heads the table of member states, followed by France, Greece, and Germany. Brussels yesterday decided to back suggestions that the transparency and implementation of EC rules should be improved, partnership with member states to enforce rules should be encouraged, and national courts' duty to enforce EC law should be strengthened. The original proposals were included in the Sutherland report on implementing the single market, which was published in October.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mostafa Hidshri, chief of the Kurdistan </F> Democratic Party -- Iran, by Thomas Dreger in Bonn on 16 June:  "Kinkel Did Not Answer Me"]    [Text] [Dreger] Whom did you meet in the FRG?    [Hidshri] The Berlin senior public prosecutor in connection  with the "Mykonos lawsuit," and deputies from the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the Greens, and the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU].    [Dreger] That is to say, you did not have any contact with  representatives of the government or the Foreign Ministry?    [Hidshri] I asked for a meeting with Foreign Minister  Kinkel, but I did not get an answer. I think that this is  connected with the presence of Iranian Foreign Minister  Velayati. Apparently, economic interests are more important to  the FRG Government than human rights and support for democratic  forces.    [Dreger] Mr. Velayati was received by the chancellor,  Foreign Minister Kinkel, and Economics Minister Rexrodt. If you  had had the chance to also talk to these persons, what would you  have told them?    [Hidshri] I would have said: Your support keeps the inhuman  Iranian regime alive. It enables the Islamic Republic to  continue its hostile attitude toward world peace -- for example,  toward the agreement between the PLO and Israel -- to support  fundamentalist organizations, and to oppress its own people.  Democracy in Germany has fallen victim to economic interests.    [Dreger] You discussed the "Mykonos lawsuit" with a public  prosecutor. What is your impression of this lawsuit?    [Hidshri] I think that the real perpetrators are standing  trial. However, I am convinced that Iran is trying to influence  these proceedings by economic concessions to the FRG. An  example is the visit of Fallahian, Iranian minister for security  and intelligence services, shortly before the beginning of the  lawsuit. Mr. Schmidbauer (minister of state in the FRG  Chancellor's Office and coordinator of the German intelligence  services, who received Fallahian in October 1993 -- the editors)  admitted that Fallahian had pressed for the abandonment of the  lawsuit. I am afraid that the clarification of the murder will  be sacrificed to economic interests.    [Dreger] Your two predecessors were murdered in Europe. Do  you feel safe on this trip?    [Hidshri] I do not feel safe anywhere. It is the policy of  the Islamic Republic to eliminate its opponents all over the  world. The leading persons of my party are sentenced to death.  I have a copy of a letter from the chief of staff of the  Iranian Revolutionary Guards. In it, the order to murder two  persons is given. One of them is Chao Hosseini [name as  published], member of the Central Committee of my party and  foreign representative of the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP]  -- Iran in Paris. In 1991 an attempt on my life was made with a  bomb in Iraqi Kurdistan. My bodyguard died. All that is  happening at a time when the FRG Government calls the Iranian  leadership "pragmatic."    [Dreger] How is currently the situation in Iranian  Kurdistan?    [Hidshri] There are more than 50,000 Iranian soldiers and  Revolutionary Guards in Kurdistan. Since the founding of the  Islamic Republic, Iranian troops have destroyed 300 villages.  Our political work is done underground. Our partisans act as  guerrillas.    [Dreger] What are the chances of a Kurdish movement in Iran  at present?    [Hidshri] It can weaken the central government and motivate  the people to put up resistance and to draw the attention of  Europe and the neighboring countries to itself. However, it  cannot force the leadership of the Islamic Republic to initiate  democratization. It will struggle against any democratic  movement to its last breath.    [Dreger] How stable is the Iranian leadership? The economic  situation of the country is bad, there have been riots.    [Hidshri] All indications of stability are due to economic  support from the West.    [Dreger] What are your relations with the Iranian  opposition?    [Hidshri] We have good relations with all, except for the  Mojahedin-e-Khalq and the monarchists.    [Dreger] What is your primary objective: An independent  Kurdistan or a democratic Iran?    [Hidshri] A democratic Iran where our national rights and  human rights are guaranteed.    [Dreger] You have now arrived from Iraqi Kurdistan. What  does this autonomous region, which has been in existence since  the end of the second Gulf war, mean for the Kurds as a whole?    [Hidshri] No matter in what part of Kurdistan the Kurdish  people attain their rights, this has positive effects on the  other parts. The founding of such a democracy in (Iraqi)  Kurdistan is contributing to the democratization of the whole  region. Exactly for this reason, the neighboring countries are  trying to kill this democracy. For one year, Iran has been  shelling Iraqi Kurdistan with grenades and it has sent  terrorists to the region.    [Dreger] For six weeks, however, not only Iranians have shot  at Kurds, but also Kurds at Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. What are  the causes of this conflict?    [Hidshri] Iran created the prerequisites for this war.  Since the establishment of the Kurdish regional government in  summer 1992, it has infiltrated its agents into the ranks of the  two big Iraqi-Kurdish parties, the KDP and the Patriotic Union  of Kurdistan.    [Dreger] Is it not somewhat simple to say that everything  comes from the outside?    [Hidshri] The two Kurdish parties are not innocent.  However, the Islamic Republic is the most important factor in  this war.    [Dreger] Do you see a chance to settle this conflict?    [Hidshri] Iran will not stop sabotaging the Kurdish  autonomy. In order to put an end to the war, both parties have  to struggle against this main cause.    [Dreger] The autonomous region is viable because aircraft  of the Gulf war allies are circling above the area. Their  mandate is prolonged every six months, but it does not offer  more long-term prospects. What would have to happen to secure  the future of the Kurds?    [Hidshri] The allies should regard the Kurdish issue as a  political, not a humanitarian question. In Iraqi Kurdistan,  only humanitarian support has been provided so far. Of course,  this has to be welcomed, but there is a lack of political  support.    [Dreger] Would that mean the recognition of an independent  Kurdistan?    [Hidshri] An independent Kurdistan is not at issue. The  allies should see to it that the Kurdish regional government can  establish itself in a federatal Iraq. Iraqi Kurdistan is today  quite up in the air. This problems should be solved with the  Iraqi central government in a federatal system.    [Dreger] The conflict in north Iraq is nourishing the cliche  of the Kurds being at variance. Can you envisage a joint state  some day?    [Hidshri] We are not talking of an independent Kurdistan.  It is not in our program and today it is impossible to  translate it into reality. It is not our problem that we have  parties with different political orientations. One of our  problems is that we do not deal democratically with each other.  However, we are not to blame for it. Our people never learned  democracy. We need a democratic atmosphere in which we can deal  with each other.    [Dreger] The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] is the best  known Kurdish organization here. What is your policy toward it  and what do you think of the ban on the PKK by the FRG  Government?    [Hidshri] We are in contact with the PKK, but we criticize  its course of action. I think that the ban is inappropriate.  The world must understand that the PKK actions are reactions to  the inhuman course of action of the Turkish Government against  the Kurdish people.    [Dreger] The Iranian Government has become notorious by  Khomeyni's call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. What do you  think of the conflict over Rushdie?    [Hidshri] I condemn the call for his murder. But I also  say: The regime that sentenced Rushdie to death murdered  thousands of people, without anybody doing something against it.  Europe seems to have divided the people into classes. Salman  Rushdie as a European must not be threatened. Iranians,  however, may be killed, their life seems to be worthless.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Trade News: Russian space plans struggle to take off THE RUSSIAN space industry has hit difficulties in its western sales drive less than two weeks ahead of the official signing of its first commercial contract, worth Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.8m). Three obstacles to further contracts emerged yesterday. Inmarsat, the London-based telecommunications satellite operator which is the Russians' first western customer, said the export licence for the US-built satellite scheduled to be launched on board a Proton rocket from Kazakhstan in 1995 could be a one-off. The new administration in Washington appears keen to protect the struggling US space launch business against cut-price competition. At last week's Clinton-Yeltsin summit in Canada, the talk was of co-operation at a scientific, rather than commercial, level. At the same time Russia has not yet established whether it will be able to make commercial use of the former Soviet launch base at Baikonur in Kazakhstan. Mr Dmitri Poluhin, director general of DB Salyut, which designs the Proton, the commercial launch vehicle, said yesterday that Russian President Boris Yeltsin would hold talks next month with Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, over the base. Finally there have been differences between DB Salyut and Khrunichev, which builds the Proton, over their dealings with the west. Mr Poluhin said DB Salyut was the senior partner and would be signing the contract with Inmarsat. But he conceded that Khrunichev had bypassed DB Salyut and dealt directly with Motorola of the US over three Proton launches for a planned global mobile telecommunications network. Mr Poluhin said he expected Motorola to deal with DB Salyut but had no sign yet of an approach. The confusion was underlined by Mr Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat's director general. He said the precise costs of the Russian launch had not yet been established, and would probably be only slightly cheaper that the Dollars 62m charged by the market leader, Arianespace. The Russian space industry dwarfs that of the west. Its potential to charge low prices for reliable launches has raised hopes that it could be a significant hard currency earner. But this has alarmed western rivals, especially in the US where recent launch failures have triggered a rise in space insurance premiums. Insurance already costs satellite owners more than Pounds 300m a year.</p>

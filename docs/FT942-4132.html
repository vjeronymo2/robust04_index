			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Poultry plant to create 450 jobs Sun Valley Poultry, the convenience-foods manufacturer, is to spend Pounds 32m on a food-processing plant at Wolverhampton, West Midlands, creating 450 jobs over four years, Paul Cheeseright writes. The plant, part of a Pounds 100m expansion programme, is expected to open in May. Sun Valley Poultry is a subsidiary of Cargill, the US foods and agriculture group. It will use the plant to process poultry either as branded products or as own-label lines for retailers. The plan is thought to be the largest single investment in the Wolverhampton area for 60 years and is a fillip to the gradual restructuring of the local economy away from heavy industry and engineering. Sun Valley is receiving Pounds 2.75m of regional selective assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): United in diversity  -Europe should exploit its variety, argues Hugh Aldersey-Williams The European Commission will today make public plans to design a logo to attract Far East and American tourists and businesses. The idea will bring a shudder to many nationals of European countries. How can a region of such cultural diversity possibly be abbreviated into one symbol? The same dilemma confronts many European businesses. They are having to join forces with other European businesses in order to compete against companies from the more homogeneous trading blocs of Japan and North America. In doing so, they must surmount their own cultural differences to present a united front to the wider world. Fons Trompenaars, director of the Centre for International Business Studies in the Netherlands, points out in his recent book, Riding the Waves of Culture (Nicholas Brealey Publishing), that national culture is treated as a luxury or an inconvenience by many managers, especially perhaps by the insular British. 'The main dilemma which those who manage across cultures confront is the extent to which they should centralise, thereby imposing on foreign cultures rules and procedures that might affront them, or decentralise, thereby letting each culture go its own way . . . ' he says. Corporate identity consultant Wally Olins - in the first in a series of lectures on global companies to be published later this month by IMPR of Henley on Thames - says: 'There is no European corporate tradition comparable with the clear and comprehensible corporate traditions of the US and Japan.' Attempts to carry on regardless of that tradition founder. Alcazar and Volvo-Renault are recent reminders. Olins sets out five models for how European companies might proceed, based on what Europe does best and on how it is seen from the outside. Some models expect to bring about such a fusion of corporate cultures that national cultures become insignificant. Others will continue, like Airbus Industrie, to overcome them with governments' help. But many will choose to remain mono-cultural and will be so perceived within their own countries. Olins writes: 'That, I suspect, is where most big European companies will stay until the constraints become unbearable or their ambition grows irresistibly.' One difficulty is that people are at a loss to say what is the character of Europe as a whole. One of the reasons why people perceive a threat to national identity with each step towards closer European union is that no other identity appears to be on offer. However, could a Europe logo help us define ourselves? Olins believes this is too simplistic. To a large extent, Europe's identity lies in its diversity. With considerable effort, this attractive if hard-to-define quality could be exploited for competitive advantage. Many travellers no longer seek American-style homogeneity and European hotel groups could trade more effectively on the fact that the hotels they own - acquired over long periods and often with strong family or local histories - are highly varied. Likewise, Volkswagen - the maker of Seats in Spain, Skodas in the Czech Republic, and Audis and VWs in Germany - could, if it so chose, position itself as the maker of a mixed portfolio of European products rather than as the German controlling interest in a scattered collection of car factories. But 'Europeanness' will have to be authenticated by Europeans, and recognised and appreciated by people from outside Europe whose impressions of the place may have little to do with its realities. 'It's got to happen organically,' says Olins. 'Anything else will curdle.' If Europe's identity is to be its diversity, it will not be easily captured in any logo.</p>

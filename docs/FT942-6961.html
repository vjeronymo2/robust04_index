			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel bridges the gap It is a miracle of financial as well as civil engineering that Eurotunnel has come this far. With its third round of funding secured, the project at least has the chance to be tested against alternative forms of transport in the open market. But it is too early to hail Eurotunnel as a triumph for private-sector funding; that would require all capital providers to receive adequate compensation for their risk. While the banks are earning a healthy interest margin on their loans, it is not yet clear that shareholders will see a decent return. With construction now completed, further disappointment on costs looks remote. But the revenue Eurotunnel will generate remains a matter for educated guesswork. The latest financing package includes Pounds 500m leeway in case revenues fall short of the company's projections. Still, a revenue shortfall of more than 17 per cent between now and 1998 could leave the company short of cash. That would push dividends back beyond 2004. Without hard evidence of the business Eurotunnel can attract, the possibility cannot be ruled out. The next 18 months, including the first full summer season, will be critical. With its enormous fixed costs, Eurotunnel would have little option but to react if price competition from the ferries left it running well below capacity. Tourist traffic outside the summer season is especially price-sensitive. While ferry operators have little incentive to start a price war, it remains an open question whether Eurotunnel's current pricing strategy will fill its expensive pipe. If revenue exceeds expectations in the early years, though, Eurotunnel could equally lock into a virtuous circle. High borrowing costs are the penalty for relying on private-sector funding. An average interest cost of over 9 per cent on Pounds 7bn bank debt - and a whopping initial 2.5 per cent margin over interbank rates on its latest loan - leaves precious little for shareholders. While Eurotunnel's forecasts already assume a modest reduction in borrowing costs, a credible cash flow would greatly strengthen its negotiating position with the banks. Dividends might then come earlier than expected. With a year or two of solid cash flow for comfort, institutional investors might also reduce the rate at which dividends are discounted in their theoretical valuations of the shares. The combination could have a dramatic impact on the share price. A victory for Eurotunnel in its tariff dispute with the railways would be icing on the cake. But having been so sorely disappointed on costs, sceptics are not inclined to take revenue projections on trust. Institutional investors cajoled into underwriting the rights issue will see no pressing need for closer involvement.</p>

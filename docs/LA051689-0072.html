			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELP THE CHILDREN NOW  </P> <P> Oregon Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt last year went to Portland's City Club and  ticked off what the assembled business and civic leaders must do together to  give children a healthy start in school. He expected a modest response. He got  a standing ovation.  </P> <P> The people were ahead of him, he discovered. The people are ready to address  children's issues in the 1990s. And the proposals are ready before the U.S.  Congress and the California Legislature. Small programs are even in place here  and there across the country. What is needed now is leadership to secure the  money, votes and commitment to duplicate those demonstrated successes.  </P> <P> One of the most comprehensive proposals comes from Rep. George Miller  (D-Martinez), who chairs the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and  Families. He and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) are co-sponsoring a measure  that emphasizes helping children early in life. Miller can point to report  after report to buttress his case. For example, he says, "the Committee for  Economic Development, composed of the leaders of Fortune 500 companies,  estimates that each year's high school dropouts cost the country $240 billion  in lost productivity and forgone taxes."  </P> <P> Miller's bill sets 1993 as a target to provide all impoverished pregnant women,  their infants and children with health-care coverage under the Medicaid  program. There would be a similar 1993 goal for complete coverage of those  groups by the federal Women, Infant and Children nutrition program and for full  immunization of all preschool children. Miller also wants appropriations  increased for disabled preschool children and for ensuring an adequate vaccine  supply.  </P> <P> His program is ambitious -- and not as expensive as not acting. The first year  of the four-year effort would cost $1.4 billion. In the long run, this  investment in children's futures will save billions more than it will cost.  </P> <P> Congress also must pass and pay for a child-care bill. Not a tax credit, as  President Bush proposes, but the kind of bill that creates new child-care  spaces, helps parents pay for decent care, requires that safety standards be  set and helps improve the training of child-care workers. The Act for Better  Child Care, sponsored by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), is such a bill.  </P> <P> There also is much that can be done in California, where one out of every nine  American children lives. Leaders of a California advocacy group, Children Now,  report that only a small fraction of needy children here receive health  checkups, preschool education and other preventive measures. Not only must  state government devote more of its resources to children, it must not cut  valuable programs like the Office of Family Planning or community mental health  services. More, not less, must be done to help prevent child abuse and  supervise children who must be placed in foster care. None of these programs  can be expanded unless the Gann spending limit that straitjackets the state is  lifted.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the issues of income and housing for poor families must be squarely  addressed as well. All these tasks are made difficult by the fact that neither  the United States nor California has any coherent policy on what should be done  for children. President Bush could provide leadership by reporting each year on  the tasks that remain.  </P> <P> But the real work is done on the local level with state money. A few counties  and private agencies may lead the way to better coordination. For example,  Ventura County has established a network that coordinates mental health, social  services, corrections and special education programs to help treat all of a  child's needs. Stuart House in Santa Monica, which helps abused children,  brings together under one roof social workers, medical personnel and law  enforcement agencies to reduce youngsters' trauma. The state could profit by  these examples of coordination. Citizens need to get far more involved as well,  by helping their local programs or working as Children Now does to push for a  stronger state commitment.  </P> <P> The people are indeed ahead of their government on this issue. The children,  the greatest resource for the nation's future, are ready, too. Where are the  leaders?  </P></p>

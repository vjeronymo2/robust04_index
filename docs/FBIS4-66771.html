			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Adil al-Bahnasawi: "While Awaiting Political </F> Decision, Energy and Oil Experts Urge Government To Adopt  Nuclear Plan and To Implement It Immediately"]    [Text] AL-SHA'B continues to sound the alarm regarding one  of Egypt's most important economic and social independence  issues, namely the issue of our peaceful plan to generate  electricity from nuclear energy. The Egyptian Government closed  this plan's dossier under pressure from a number of  international circles, despite repeated appeals by Egyptian  nuclear energy experts stressing the inevitable entry into this  strategic field.    At the end of last month, the Arab Mining and Petroleum  Association held a symposium, entitled "Energy and Constant  Development Challenges," that was attended by a large number of  petroleum, electricity, and nuclear plant experts. They included  Dr. Hafiz Hajji, chairman of the Nuclear Plants Authority  [agency name as published]; Dr. Nabil al-Hadhiq, chairman of the  Nuclear Materials Authority; Dr. Mustafa Suwaydan, deputy  chairman of the Egyptian Electricity Studies Authority; Engineer  Mahmud Sami Zaffun, chairman of the New and Renewable Energy  Authority; Dr. Husayn 'Abd-al-Muhsin, former chairman of the  Nuclear Materials Authority; and a large number of people  concerned with energy in Egypt.    Most of the experts' debates were on the issue of nuclear  energy in Egypt. Upon concluding its meeting, the first  recommendation the symposium made was that it is inevitable that  we enter the nuclear age peacefully as of now so we can meet the  coming oil shortage in Egypt. The same thing was stressed by  petroleum experts who announced that Egypt's oil reserves will  hardly last 30-40 years. Some experts referred to the petroleum  minister's statement that "oil reserve is a dynamic reserve,  meaning that it increases at times as a result of new finds."  These experts have said that even if the reserve increases as a  result of new finds, it will be depleted some day, and this has  been confirmed by the reports of Egypt's Higher Energy Council.    Dr. Husayn 'Abd-al-Muhsin, former chairman of the Nuclear  Materials Authority, said that officials must move promptly to  make the political decision immediately because we already have  studies in place. Moreover, it is important to begin  implementation now because the construction of a nuclear plant  takes 10 years, considering that bids have to be invited and  agreements concluded, all of which takes years. This is what  makes us declare that this plan has to be started now.    In this report, AL-SHA'B presents the latest developments it  has learned from the statements of nuclear energy experts,  especially since officials use the two points of "cost and  nuclear safety" as an excuse to kill this plan.    First, the point concerning the plan's costs; a high-ranking  nuclear energy official has disclosed to me that financing is  secured by Law No. 45 of 1975, in accordance with which  President al-Sadat set up the Alternative Energy Fund in 1975 to  finance the nuclear power plants project. At the time, the fund  had $700 million, which has now risen with interest to more than  $1.3 billion. This fund's revenues are not touched by the  government because it was set up especially for nuclear plants.    The official has said that a number of countries are in the  process of concluding contracts for nuclear plants, especially  for the Cando [design] from Canada. These countries include  South Korea (three plants) and Romania (five plants). Turkey has  also initiated steps and contacted the Canadians to build a  power plant, and so has Indonesia, because these plants are  distinguished by their lower cost and their high degree of  safety.    The official added that the cost of this plant is $1.35  billion, which will be divided as follows:     -  There is an existing plan for the possible manufacture of  some parts of this plant locally, in cooperation with the  Canadian Atomic Energy Agency. A number of domestic Egyptian  firms have been comprehensively surveyed. What this means is  that we will contribute at least 25 percent in Egyptian pounds.    -  The second point is that the Alternative Energy Fund has  enough  at present to purchase this plant, whose cost does not have to  be paid all at once. If we consider the matter, we will find  that we will have to pay just $160 million annually. This means  that we will take only $600 million from the Alternative Energy  Fund and that we will acquire the rest in bank interest.     In addition, Egypt has at present programs to transfer  Canadian technology in this particular area so as to strengthen  domestic industry. The Nuclear Plants Authority will study anew  the types of raw materials available and will conduct a survey  of construction companies that can contribute to building a  nuclear plant. This program will determine the percentage of  domestic participation.    Nuclear energy esperts surprisingly revealed that Bechtel, a  U.S. Firm, has applied to the Ministry of Nuclear Energy to  cooperate with Canada and the Nuclear Plants Authority and that  it has, according to an expert, received the "go-ahead signal"  on the grounds that "Egypt is a signatory of the nuclear weapons  nonproliferation treaty."    The second point used is the "nuclear safety" point,  especially since the Egyptian Government has used the incident  at Chernobyl--a Russian reactor that did not meet minimal safety  requirements and where the people in charge of operating the  reactor made a mistake--as a justification to kill this plan.    Dr. Hafiz Hajji, chairman of the Nuclear Plants Authority,  has said, "High levels of safety have been developed in nuclear  plants. It is sufficient to know that the Canadian-made Cando is  distinguished by the fact that the possibility of reactor core  meltdown is absolutely nonexistent because Cando's cooling  systems are highly sophisticated, contrary to the PWR  [pressurized water reactor]. Moreover, this plant's operation is  computer-controlled and the plant has two independent safety  systems."    Dr. Hajji added, "This safety issue is over. As an example,  I  will note in this regard the earthquake that hit Los Angeles  recently. A report published by an international magazine says  that nuclear plants are the only plants that were not affected  by the earthquake and that withstood it and continued to supply  the state with power, whereas gas and coal-operated plants came  to a halt. Moreover, the United States, Germany, and France are  developing safer reactors so as to achieve greater assurance and  safety. So, there is absolutely no problem."    Dr. Hisham Fu'ad, deputy chairman of the Atomic Energy  Authority, has said, "Experts are in a poor psychological state  and there is increased fear that specialists in nuclear  technology will flee to other countries. I don't wish to repeat  what I have already said about nuclear plants meaning life. They  supply us with electricity and they involve great technology, in  which we should absolutely not lag behind. These plants also  contribute to development in all areas, including agriculture  and industry, and they are used for sea water desalination."    Dr. Fu'ad added regretfully, "At a time when we kill the  plan  with our own hands, we find that Israel works systematically;  that it has future plans; that it uses its reactors for the  military; and that it is now trying to build a powerful reactor  for electricity production. We have reiterated this fact again  and again, but who is listening?"    The truth has actually been reiterated again and again. But  nobody has listened. It is sufficient to restate that, while  inaugurating a nuclear power plant two weeks ago, China's prime  minister said, "there will be no recurrence of another Chernobyl  catastrophe."</p>

When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit shall be used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a 16-pound sample shall be used to determine if the fruit meets the minimum size requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) As used herein, ``U.S. No. 1'', ``mature'', and ``standard pack'', mean the same as defined in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines [7 CFR 51.3145 through 51.3160]; and ``No. 22D standard lug box'' means the same as defined in section 1380.19 (17) of the ``Regulations of the California Department of Food and Agriculture''. ``Well matured'' means a condition distinctly more advanced than ``mature''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 917_FRESH PEARS AND PEACHES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

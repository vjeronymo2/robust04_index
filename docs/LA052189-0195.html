			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: GIRL, 20 BY KINGSLEY AMIS (SUMMIT BOOKS: $8.95)  </P> <P> Originally published in 1970, this satirical novel reflects 1960s England  through the perverse prism of two classical musicians. The narrator, Doug, is  the music critic for a London daily; his chum, Roy, is a composer, conductor  and violinist knighted for solidly second-rate contributions to England's  cultural Establishment. Sir Roy, propelled by a voracious appetite for  ever-younger girls -- his wife has worked out a mathematical equation that  describes the increasing age differential -- drags Doug along as abettor to his  middle-aged lechery.  </P> <P> An undercurrent of "incoherent yelling" is carried on throughout the story by a  series of secondary characters: the toddler son of Roy's latest marriage; his  daughter's boyfriend, who, when not screaming wordlessly in the background,  goes about hurling accusations of "fascist" at anyone within earshot; unnamed  caterwaulers in dimly lit nightclubs. In the course of his forced exposure to  the pop culture he'd rather deplore from afar, Doug begins to see "the possible  virtues of Bruckner's 8th Symphony" and to feel "sorry for having too hastily  rejected those musical works which consist of a stated period of silence under  concert conditions." As always, Amis' aim at the modern world, not to mention  eternal human foibles, is dead on.  </P></p>

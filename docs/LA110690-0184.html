			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WAIT-AND-SEE DOW CLOSES 17.08 LOWER  </P> <P> The stock market fell today as traders pondered the uncertainties raised by the  elections, the Persian Gulf crisis and an enormous sale of new U.S. Treasury  debt.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 17.08 to 2,485.15.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 697 up, 769 down and 505 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 141.13 million shares, compared with 147.51 million in  the previous session.  </P> <P> The market had posted a gain of 11.39 points Monday.  </P> <P> Analysts saw no real pattern in the trading.  </P> <P> "It's uncertainty more than anything else," said Sara Cerato, a vice president  at Nomura Securities International Inc. "I'm hearing more rumors about war  breaking out after the election."  </P> <P> Some investment strategists are even starting to pick days that they believe  will be the beginning of the war, she said.  </P> <P> Jack Solomon at Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said traders were also nervously  watching oil prices and waiting for the results of the quarterly government  bond auction, which began today and will be completed Thursday.  </P> <P> The Treasury is selling a record $34.25 billion in 3-year, 10-year and 30-year  debt securities.  </P> <P> "I don't think the market's fundamentals are getting any better. The trend is  down rather than up," said John McElroy, a principal at 1838 Investment  Advisors.  </P> <P> In midafternoon trading on the NYSE, Browning Ferris was down 6 1/8 to 24 1/8  on a disappointing earnings report that came as a surprise to many analysts.  </P> <P> Waste Management was off 1 3/4 at 33 1/4 after announcing it will pay a court  settlement of $19.5 million to avoid fighting civil price-fixing claims.  Analysts were not sure whether the settlement was moving the stock.  </P> <P> Circuit City dropped 2 5/8 to 11 5/8 following the release of sales reports  that were not as strong as analysts were hoping. Unisys fell 1/4 to 2 5/8 amid  concern that it may have to sell assets at distressed prices.  </P> <P> U.S. Treasury bonds turned narrowly mixed in early trading today as dealers  awaited the first portion of the refunding auction.  </P> <P> By midday, the government's key 30-year issue was up 3/32 point, or 94 cents  per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell to  8.61% from 8.62% late Monday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> APARTMENTS FIND FAVOR AS INVESTMENT;  </P> <P> S.D. COUNTY PRICES ATTRACT BUYERS FROM OVER THE SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> For two years now, San Diego commercial real estate brokers have been urging  investors to buy apartments, saying that the residential units would soon be as  good as gold. But buyers, still leery of hard times investors suffered during  the mid-1980s when a glut of apartments were built, seemed to shy away from  such advice.  </P> <P> Not any more.  </P> <P> Investors, particularly from Los Angeles and Orange counties, are increasingly  turning to San Diego County for properties to buy, especially in North County.  With new residents flooding into the region, many of them unable to buy San  Diego's pricy homes, newcomers tend to become tenants, which raises demand for  apartments.  </P> <P> "It's an ideal situation," said Bruce Blumenthal, director of acquisition for  Schickler &amp; Meringoff Properties, a Los Angeles-based real estate  investment firm. Blumenthal's firm spent $22 million in March to purchase  Emerald Point apartments, a 456-unit complex in Vista. He added, "We're looking  to acquire more in San Diego."  </P> <P> So is Paul A. Laubach, president of Providence Capital Group, an Orange-based  real estate investment firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking in Oceanside  </P> <P> "I'm still looking in Oceanside . . . and I would love to pick up a building in  the beach communities, Del Mar or Encinitas," Laubach said. Providence Capital  Group has already purchased 210 units in San Marcos, Escondido and Fallbrook  for $10.5 million. In addition, Laubach said, the firm has 374 units worth $20  million in escrow.  </P> <P> Laubach and Blumenthal are just two of the many Los Angeles and Orange county  investors -- discouraged by the limited number and more expensive buildings in  their region -- who are turning south to cash in on investment opportunities,  according to Kevin Mulhern and Edward Aloe, apartment specialists at Coldwell  Banker Commercial Real Estate.  </P> <P> Nearly half of the 44 transactions involving apartment projects with 15 or more  units (67% of 3,026 units sold) in North County so far this year have involved  buyers from Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to Aloe. Industry  experts say even more investors, including out-of-state and foreign buyers,  will be eyeing the San Diego market as well in coming years.  </P> <P> High demand has helped push up the price per unit that investors are paying for  apartments here to an average $70,000, up from $45,000 to $50,000 per unit four  years ago, said George Carlson, an apartment broker with John Burnham &amp; Co.  in San Diego.  </P> <P> "San Diego was ranked in the top 10 in economic growth between 1983 and 1988  and is also projected to be in the top 10 through 1993," said Aloe, citing a  Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. study released at the 1989 Annual Apartment  Conference held this month in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "San Diego is also in the top 10 for population growth," Aloe said. "Those are  two factors that will drive any real estate market."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frenzied Sales Activity  </P> <P> In addition, today's high construction costs and slow-growth ordinances should  prevent new units from coming on line, making existing apartments all the more  valuable, industry experts say. That has spurred frenzied sales activity, said  Carlson of John Burnham &amp; Co.  </P> <P> According to a recent apartment sales report released by Burnham, 1,029  projects (or 16,155 units) have been sold in the county through August, up 12%  over the 913 projects (or 11,959 units) sold during the same period in 1988.  </P> <P> "At the current pace, 1989 sales activity is running slightly ahead of 1985's  record pace," Carlson said. "In fact, this could be San Diego's strongest sales  year this decade."  </P> <P> But even enthusiastic investors, such as Blumenthal, express some reservations  about the San Diego apartment market's potential.  </P> <P> "You can't miss on anything that you buy -- that's what a lot of the brokers  want us to believe, but that's not necessarily true," Blumenthal said. "San  Diego is a wonderful marketplace, but it's not a gold mine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Lot of Variables'  </P> <P> "If all the indicators come through, yes, we'll probably have an attractive  market with annual rent increases," Blumenthal said. "But there are a lot of  variables and, if any one of them turns against us, we could have a lot of  problems. For example, if we go into a recession, you can forget about it."  </P> <P> Although many brokers tout what they expect to be double-digit rent increases  in coming years, Blumenthal reminds investors that rents have remained flat for  three years.  </P> <P> "I think there's still a glut of apartments, and, although many cities have  building moratoriums in place, I've seen plenty of developers get around such  limits."  </P> <P> Without question, however, apartment construction has slowed dramatically -- a  natural occurrence following overbuilding between 1984 and 1986, and in part,  because of slow-growth initiatives and higher construction costs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rental Prices Flat  </P> <P> "Back then rent prices were increasing by 10-12% each year," said Mulhern,  referring to the early 1980s. "Developers were saying, 'Wow!' and came running  over here to build apartments. Such a building spree resulted in an annual  average gain of 25,000 units.  </P> <P> "The developers built themselves right out of a rent increase market," said  Mulhern, adding that rental prices stayed flat from 1986 to 1988. Consequently,  construction has declined; according to Coldwell Banker analysts, only 7,000 to  8,000 apartment units will be built this year, down from about 15,000 units in  1987.  </P> <P> Industry analysts expect even fewer apartment units in the years ahead.  </P> <P> "We've had so much growth lately that there is a backlash now, a lot of  slow-growth, anti-growth sentiment," Mulhern said. "People are asking, 'What  about schools? What about parks?'  </P> <P> "And, even if a city doesn't have a slow-growth ordinance, practically every  city has slapped on expensive building fees," Mulhern added. "That alone is  enough to deter developers." Building fees and rising land costs are the  principal factors that have escalated the price of building apartments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Surplus Absorbed  </P> <P> Such curbs on construction and a net migration last year of more than 70,000  new residents into the county each year are combining to finally allow the  absorption of surplus apartments.  </P> <P> "Most people moving into San Diego County are not ready to become first-time  home buyers," Mulhern said. "With the median county home priced at $179,000,  the majority of these people are going to be renters."  </P> <P> Already such factors have helped lower vacancy rates to about 6% countywide  from 10% to 12% two years ago. Once vacancy rates drop to 5% -- a pivotal  figure that industry analysts say signifies a switch from a renter's market to  a landlord's market -- San Diego should see true rent increases for the first  time in three years.  </P> <P> "Some might say that they have increased rents in recent years, but that's  deceiving," Mulhern said. "In many of those cases, owners may have been  charging higher prices, but at the same time they were offering a lot of  concessions.  </P> <P> Aloe says the era of concessions is coming to an end and expects true rent  increases starting in 1990. Industry experts say 5% to 8% annual increases in a  year or two are probable. Opportunistic investors are hoping for more.  </P> <P> "We've looked all around, Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura . . . they're all  overpriced," Laubach said.  </P></p>

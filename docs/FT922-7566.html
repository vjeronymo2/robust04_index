			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: L'Opera Francaise in New York The City Opera season ended back in November and the Met season in mid-April, but the city has not been left quite opera-less. L'Opera Francais de New York put on three performances of a Milhaud centenary bill, Le Pauvre Matelot and Esther de Carpentras; and the Juilliard gave the New York premiere of Delius's Fennimore and Gerda. Fennimore needs no long notice. Most of its productions from the British premieres onward (BBC in 1962, staged by Hammersmith in 1968) have been reviewed in these pages; and the Juilliard's version was essentially a recreation of the St. Louis 1981 production, which visited the Edinburgh Festival two years later. Frank Corsaro, its producer (and the artistic director of the Juilliard Opera Center) has long been Delius's American champion, responsible also for the US premieres of Koanga (Washington, 1970), A Village Romeo and Juliet (Washington, 1972, and then taken up by the City Opera for three seasons) and Margot la Rouge (St. Louis, 1983). His Delius productions, collaborations with the designer Ronald Chase, were all executed behind a gauze, with a continuous show of movies, photographs and paintings projected upon it while the actors appeared in pools of light behind. This is a form of operatic presentation (we have had a Corsaro-Chase Tote Stadt and Doktor Faust in the same mode) that proves undramatic. Although a gauze may be acoustically transparent, it always seems to put a damper on things, and it certainly inserts a visual barrier between the singers and their audience. Moreover, the method emphasises only the dreamy, movie-music aspect of Delius's scores. The composer specified five 'pauses', of from three to five minutes, to indicate the passing of time between his scenes. They would be dramatically fatal; most producers ignore them; Corsaro inserted punctuation of his own in the form of 'new-age' environmental tapes (the sounds of waves, winds, and birds) - one six minutes long - accompanied by more home movies of blossom and bough and by invented new actions behind the gauze. But, as Beecham said of Fennimore, 'The problems confronting successful production are not few in number.' Corsaro faced them, and though I didn't much like his solutions, it was good to see and hear the opera again. We can blame the gauze for the fact that the young singers did not come across strongly. Christopher Keene conducted. Le Pauvre Matelot has a grim, neat little Cocteau libretto: wife murders a stranger for his wealth so that she can give it to her beloved sailor husband, expected back after many years away; she has failed to recognise him . . . Milhaud sets it 'objectively', to tuneful chanties handled in his wrong-note and polytonal way. It is a clever, piquantly disturbing work. Esther de Carpentras, a comedy, is closer to his Provencal and Jewish roots. The Pope's nephew, a blithe young Cardinal, has been banished to Provence in disgrace because in Rome he had an affair with a Jewish girl. He devises a way to regain favour: when the Jews of Carpentras celebrate Purim with an enactment of Esther, he takes over the role of Ahasuerus himself and offers the company a choice between baptism and banishment. But when the beautiful young actress playing Esther falls into his arms . . . The score includes chromatic chant, Provencal mirth in the manner of Bizet's L'Arlesienne, cabaret song, opera-comique couplets and a C-major fugue. Milhaud was a bewilderingly uneven composer. As the Record Guide puts it, his style 'varies from a dry gravity to a vulgar nonchalance', but 'if his taste is uncertain, his music is hardly ever dull.' For 30 years he was important on the American scene. Nearly a quarter of his works (which run to Opus 464) had their first performances here. No big celebration is billed - not even, in Columbus year, a professional Christophe Colombe; not even a Creation du monde at the Philharmonic. But L'Opera Francais is a stylish enterprise, with the exceptionally gifted young Canadian conductor Yves Abel at its helm. I've enjoyed his Gluck, Gretry and Bizet. In Milhaud he was equally alert and stylish.</p>

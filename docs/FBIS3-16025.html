That is what the Secretary  of State on the Elchibey Administration, Ali Kerimov, has told  Interfax. Kelekiy is the home village of ousted President  Elchibey.    In Kerimov's view, government forces are attempting to  disarm  the Ordubad garrison which is loyal to Abulfaz Elchibey.    The local authorities, with their heavy representation of  the  opposition Popular Front, have sent protests to Baku and  Nakhichevan.    Ali Kerimov holds the Baku Administration led by President  Aliyev responsible for the negative developments in Ordubad.    The press center of Azerbaijan's Ministry of Internal  Affairs  says, however, it has had no information on developments around  Elchibey's home village.</p>

Chernyshevskiy;  UDC 528.83]    [Abstract] Two methods for satellite measurements of  outgoing radiation fluxes are examined (with scanning  narrow-angle and nonscanning wide-angle radiometers) in  connection with determination of the Earth's radiation budget,  requiring a knowledge of the mean intensity of radiation over  extensive areas. The problems involved in processing the  measured quantities for determining the outgoing radiation  fluxes are discussed and a comparative analysis of the measuring  capabilities of both methods is presented. It is shown that  measurements made with scanners are inferior to wide-angle  radiometers. A wide-angle radiometer immediately registers the  instantaneous mean value of outgoing radiation over a great  area, whereas scanners give a better result when it is necessary  to obtain a more detailed regional distribution of outgoing  radiation (in grid units measuring 2.5 x 2.5). The color  effect arising due to the difference in the spectral composition  of radiation between the calibration target and the object is  much greater for a scanner. A wide-angle radiometer operating in  the SW range can be calibrated quite simply directly in ordinary  actinometric units, whereas the calibration procedure is  extremely complex for scanners and must be accomplished  virtually continuously, a serious source of errors. The scanner  is structurally more complex, whereas wide-angle radiometers are  simpler in design and operation and have a longer useful life  and provide an accuracy in determining budget parameters equal  to scanner determinations. However, it is concluded that both  types of instruments (scanning and wide-angle radiometers)  effectively supplement one another. References 15: 8 Russian, 7  Western.</p>

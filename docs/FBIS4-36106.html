			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tunis, 7 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  has stated that Egypt stands by Yemen's unity, noting that this  unity cannot be preserved by shedding more blood. He said Egypt  supports international and Arab legitimacy in this and other  issues.    In an interview with the Tunisian newspaper AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM  today, Musa said fear of Arabizing or internationalizing the  Yemeni crisis should not be a justification for the Arabs to sit  with their hands tied without working to stem the bloodshed in  fraternal Yemen.    He added that the fear of Arabizing the crisis is not a  justification for an indifferent stand which some are asking us  to adopt and leave the brothers fight each other. He went on:  We had feared Arabizing and internationalizing the crisis in  the Gulf and are now doing the same thing as if we are invited  to let Arab blood spill all the time. [passage omitted]    On the $275-billion African debts, Musa emphasized the need  to repay them according to schedules leading to the revival of  African economies. He urged the industrial nations to set an  annual percentage to help development processes in African  states reach the international target figure of 0.7 per cent of  the gross national product. He noted that this percentage  barely reaches 0.3 despite these countries' pledges in various  international forums.    The foreign minister said Egypt has put forth several  proposals to the OAU, including one on the need to adopt  specific measures urging the international community to help  resolve the African debt problem.</p>

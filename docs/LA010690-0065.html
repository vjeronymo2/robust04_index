			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA HILLS PROPOSES TRADING PARK TO DEVELOPER  </P> <P> Agoura Hills officials disclosed Friday a plan to swap a finished park for a  larger, undeveloped piece of land, where new park facilities would be built  with money the city does not yet have.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, about 60 condominiums would be built on the 2.7 acres of  what is now Agoura Park. In a trade with the condominium developer, the city  would acquire a nearby 10-acre parcel for a future park.  </P> <P> The Agoura Hills City Council is scheduled to discuss the proposal at its  regular meeting Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Agoura Park is on the west side of Chesebro Road south of Driver Avenue.  </P> <P> The land for the proposed new park, known locally as the Stroud property, is  slightly to the north, at the northwest corner of Chesebro Road and Driver  Avenue.  </P> <P> The city's plan calls for building about $1.1 million worth of facilities on  the 10 acres, including a recreation building, a baseball field and an  equestrian staging area.  </P> <P> Although smaller, the existing Agoura Park has a ball field, playground,  basketball court, recreation building and a craft building.  </P> <P> But city officials said a plan to pay for the future park improvements has not  been developed. Councilwoman Fran Pavley said the city might ask the Santa  Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency, for substantial aid.  </P> <P> Pavley said the new park, which is at the end of the Zuma Ridge Trail, would  have an equestrian emphasis.  </P> <P> Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said he did not know  the details of the Agoura Hills proposal.  </P> <P> But he said the agency would be unlikely to fund urban park amenities such as  baseball fields.  </P> <P> Edmiston also noted that the conservancy is considering locating another  equestrian staging area nearby and would not pay for more than one in the same  vicinity.  </P> <P> Pavley and Councilwoman Darlene McBane said the parkland swap proposal has  merit because it would place the Stroud property in the hands of the city,  preserving it from development.  </P> <P> The land is zoned for about 16 homes, and its owner, Charles Stroud, had plans  to sell to a developer, they said.  </P> <P> Chesebro Development Group has an option to buy the Stroud property and build  single-family houses on it.  </P> <P> In the swap, Chesebro would receive Agoura Park, on which the company wants to  build condominiums for which it needs city approval, City Manager David N.  Carmany said.  </P> <P> A condominium development on Agoura Park would be consistent with the land next  to it, he said.  </P> <P> If the city agrees to the land swap but later refuses to permit construction of  the condominiums, the entire swap would be voided and Chesebro would be free to  build houses on the Stroud property, Carmany said.  </P> <P> Pavley estimated that completing a park on the Stroud property could take as  long as three years.  </P> <P> In the meantime, programs at Agoura Park such as youth baseball and a "tiny  tot" preschool would be displaced, said Joe Donofrio, city parks director.  </P> <P> Parks officials would try to find alternate facilities to house those programs,  he said.  </P></p>

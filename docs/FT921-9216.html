			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: US insurers warn on weak economy TWO of the largest US composite insurers yesterday renewed warnings about the depressed state of the domestic property market and the impact of this on the sector, although both pointed to the benefits of earlier cost-cutting measures on underlying operations. Travelers, the Hartford-based multi-line insurer, unveiled an after-tax profit of Dollars 317.8m for the year, against its loss of Dollars 178.4m in the previous 12 months. The improvement stemmed from a turnround on the realised investment gain/loss front. In 1990, Travelers made a Dollars 650m pre-tax addition to reserves to cover souring real estate investments and mortgage loans, causing it to register a net realised investment loss of Dollars 566m. Last year, there was a net realised investment gain of Dollars 1m, plus a further Dollars 10.4m tax credit - although the company did add a further Dollars 103m pre-tax to reserves due to the real estate situation, of which Dollars 56m fell in the final quarter. Commenting on the figures, Travelers warned 'weakness in the economy continues to delay any meaningful improvement in the real estate markets', but it claimed to have established 'substantial reserves in anticipation of the environment we foresee'. Write-offs during the year on the property front totalled Dollars 270m, taking the real estate reserve balance at the end of the year to Dollars 909m, against over Dollars 1bn a year ago. Travelers' net income before investment gains/losses was actually lower in 1991, at Dollars 306m, against Dollars 388m. Again, real estate took its toll, with 'underperforming' mortgage loans depressing investment income. However, it reported an improvement in underlying property-casualty operations, where it claimed earlier restructuring moves had improved the cost structure. Its shares rose  7/8 to Dollars 23. At Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, net profits fell from Dollars 614m in 1990 to Dollars 505m last year. Again, the difference is largely explained by investment gains/losses and the depressed state of the property market. Its shares rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 3/4 . Aetna's 1991 figures are scored after net realised capital losses of Dollars 186m - which included a Dollars 357m after-tax addition to reserves for potential mortgage loan and real estate write-downs. In 1990, net realised capital losses were Dollars 82m, with a Dollars 163m addition to reserves for property-related investments. The 1991 fourth-quarter addition to reserves for real estate investments was Dollars 154m, against Dollars 102m in the same period last year, prompting a net realised capital loss in this period alone of Dollars 116m, against a loss of Dollars 95m. 'Our views about the depth, geographic breadth and during of problems in these markets became more pessimistic late in the year,' said Mr James Lynn, Aetna's chairman. 'It is still very difficult to assess what will be happening to the economy and commercial real estate markets and, in turn, the effect on our portfolios.' He added the total mortgage loan reserve balances and real estate write-downs stand at over Dollars 1.2bn. Without the net capital losses, he added, results for 1991 were 'very close' to 1990. Like Travelers, Aetna pointed to the benefits of reorganisation, and noted the commercial property-casualty operations contributed to earnings despite the 'difficult environment'.</p>

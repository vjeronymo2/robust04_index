I. Omelayev, candidate of technical sciences, </F> and Yu. V. Rukhlyadev, candidate of physical and mathematical  sciences; UDC 621.384.326]    [Abstract] A comparison revealed that of two portable  optoelectronic instruments that with a scanner based on a  12-facet prism with differently tilted facets and matched  optical channels has advantages with respect to angular  resolution, image quality and nonparallelism of the axes over an  instrument with a scanner based on five pairs of two-mirror  rhombi with separate IR- and visible-wavelength channels. The  two compared instruments are the OEP-1 and the OEP-2. A table  gives their comparative technical specifications; a block  diagram of the first identifies 12 components and a block  diagram of the second identifies 14 components. These two  annotated block diagrams are used in a detailed discussion of  instrument structure and functioning. The comparison of the  experimental and theoretical performance of the two types of  systems revealed that in the OEP-1 its energy potential is not  fully realized due to the great diameter of the entrance pupil  of the optical unit and the lesser _D_T[.sub]equiv noise[/]  level. Moreover, its angular resolution is poorer than for the  OEP-2 both due to the lesser focal length (153 vs. 170 mm) and  due to special features of the scanner and the presence of  separate channels, resulting in the worsening of angular  resolution. The angular resolution of the OEP-1 could be  increased by increasing its focal length, but that would  considerably increase its size and weight. The OEP-2 can ensure  greater linear scanning fields than the OEP-1, which makes it  possible to use photodetectors with a greater number of sensing  elements. Figures 3; references: 3 Russian.</p>

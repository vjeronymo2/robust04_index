			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / FT guide to corruption in France France has been hit this year by a wave of high-profile corruption investigations. Who has been affected, and how high have the investigations reached? The striking feature of the corruption investigations is that they have involved some of France's leading businessmen and senior politicians. So far this year, one cabinet minister, Alain Carignon, the communications minister, has resigned following a corruption probe. Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, faces pressure to resign following an investigation into payments for his holiday home in Saint Tropez. And colleagues from his Republican Party have been cited in probes concerning illicit political funding. The chairmen of some of France's leading companies, including Saint Gobain, Alcatel Alsthom and Schneider, have also been placed under investigation in cases involving alleged fraud or influence peddling. Why has there been such a surge in corruption cases? These investigations are not new in France. In the 1980s, for example, the Socialist party found itself the target of investigations, following the discovery of Urba, a national network of bogus consultancies which channelled money from business contractors to the party's coffers. But the snaring of senior figures reflects a more aggressive approach by France's investigating magistrates, who have been influenced, according to some observers, by the experience of Italy's corruption-hunting judges. At the same time, the decentralisation of decision-making to the provinces over the past decade has increased opportunities for corruption. Is corruption widespread? Is France like Italy? Prime minister Edouard Balladur firmly rejects the comparison. 'Corruption in France is nothing like the situation in Italy', he said earlier this month, arguing that the spree of investigations reflected the increased freedom of the judiciary to pursue cases which largely date back to the 1980s. He is probably right to dismiss the parallel. But the extent of the problem in France does appear significant. A poll by Le Monde last month found that two out of three French company chairmen suspect that illegal practices are common in the business world, while a study by Le Nouvel Observateur, the weekly magazine, claims there are more than 60 ongoing corruption investigations into businessmen and politicians. Is there a common thread to the various probes? Often, yes. The investigations into Saint Gobain, Cogedim, the property developer, and utilities companies all involve alleged links to a politician, a political party or a public contract. The cases often involve accusations that contracts were awarded in return for political funds. The investigation into Carignon, for example, includes allegations that a utilities company bailed out a publishing group which supported his electoral campaigns in return for a water supply contract in Grenoble. Alcatel and Schneider are different. In the former case, the chairman is accused of using company funds for building work at his private properties. In the latter, a Belgian magistrate claims that the chairman short-changed minority shareholders in the group's Belgian subsidiaries through a series of offshore companies. What are the political implications? Does the spate of investigations represent a threat to the government? The various cases represent a growing dilemma for the prime minister. Balladur's presidential ambitions depend partly on the support of Longuet and his Republican Party, the biggest element in the UDF, the junior partner in the ruling coalition. Should Longuet be forced to resign, and should his party be dragged more deeply into corruption investigations, the prime minister would be deprived of a potentially important ally in his bid for the conservative candidacy in the presidential poll. More broadly, the fact that the political right is now in the firing line could damage its standing with voters, in the same way that a perception of corruption contributed to the Socialist party's heavy defeat in last year's general elections. How is the government responding, and what reforms are necessary to resolve the problem? Balladur's initial response was to let the investigations work their course. But he has come under increasing pressure to take further action and is now proposing an annual audit of the personal assets of ministers, MPs and senior local officials. Several influential politicians, including Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, have raised the prospect of a complete ban on corporate funding for political parties, thereby extending legislation of 1988 and 1990, which set limits on contributions and limited spending by candidates in elections. The two principal options are: to establish a system in which the French state picks up the tab for the country's politicking, with a direct and controlled system of financing for political parties; or to introduce a buffer between individual companies and politicians through the creation of foundations to receive general corporate donations, as happens in Germany.</p>

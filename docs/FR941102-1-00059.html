			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted, NHTSA is proposing alternative amendments of S5.1.2 as a means of implementing its grant of DSET's petition. The agency asks commenters for their views on each of the alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This alternative would substitute SAE J576 JUL91 for SAE J576c, May 1970, and make conforming amendments in the text of S5.1.2. This alternative would also replace ASTM D&hyph;1003&hyph;61 with ASTM D&hyph;1003&hyph;92 with respect to measurement of haze (which, as proposed at 58 FR 13042, would not exceed 7 percent). A specimen thickness tolerance of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.25 mm (0.010 in.) would also be allowed as there is no technical reason to limit the test specimen thickness tolerance to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.005 in., and the value proposed by NHTSA as recommended by DSET appears to be a more reasonable tolerance for test specimens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two new paragraphs would be added, maintaining the performance requirements required of plastic materials by SAE J576c for the heat test, and specifying positioning of test samples during the test. These have been omitted from J576 JUL91. NHTSA believes the J576c heat test should be retained because the test is the only heat resistance requirement in Standard No. 108. The test acts to eliminate flagrantly inferior material for reflex reflectors. (Use of material with insufficient high temperature performance can result in reflectors that lose color and reflectivity.) The positioning of test samples will allow the sample to droop if its strength is adversely affected by the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This alternative would retain the current SAE and ASTM specifications but would allow processing techniques other than injection molding to produce equivalent test specimens, test specimens other than a disc of 3-inch diameter, and a test specimen thickness tolerance of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.010 inch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments on the proposal will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

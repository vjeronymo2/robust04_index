Squatter leader Prince  Mhlabi told reporters that Zulus sniped at squatters from behind the walls of  their compound. Mhlabi linked the fighting to opposition by supporters of Zulu  Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha movement to the prominence of  African National Congress leader Mandela, who is Xhosa. More than 100 people  have died in 10 days of nationwide fighting.  </P></p>

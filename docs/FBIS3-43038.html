Rumyantsev, Taganrog Radio Engineering </F> Institute, under the rubric of ``Environmental Data Collection  and Processing Systems'']    [Text] Under the conditions of today's scientific and  engineering revolution, the development of mankind's productive  forces has reached a level at which almost the entire surface of  the planet is involved in the production process. Furthermore,  industrial development of the country has run into the problem  of a sharp deterioration in environmental conditions.    The resolution of environmental problems is closely related  to the availability to the society of the hardware capable of  effectively monitoring the conditions (parameters) of the  environment and humans living in it. The tasks of this  monitoring are diverse: determining the composition and  concentrations of small impurities with a natural or man-made  origin; measuring the physical environment condition parameters  (temperature, pressure, moisture content, velocity of air and  water masses, etc.); and examining the energy and mass transfer  among the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.    This section of the journal is primarily dedicated to the  studies and developments carried out by the Taganrog Radio  Engineering Institute (TRTI) in the field of environmental  monitoring and medical and biological diagnostics of the  functional status of humans. The Taganrog Radio Engineering  Institute is one of the largest academic, scientific, and  production complexes in the Northern Caucasian region and  consists of an institution of higher learning, a scientific  research institute, two design offices, an experimental pilot  base, and problem-oriented and industrial laboratories.    In the framework of the republic-wide program of ``ecology  and environmental protection in the Russian Federation,'' the  Institute's scientists are developing sensors and transducers  for monitoring the environmental parameters, hardware for remote  sensing of the environment, computer and data networks,  environmental information display systems, and expert systems  for the on-line assessment and prediction of the environmental  conditions.    The Institute has a considerable stock of research already  completed in each of these fields as well as the necessary  scientific potential and experimental base. Moisture content,  temperature, pressure, water vapor, smoke, NO gas, and ammonium  sensors have already been developed at the Institute. Elements  of secondary transducers of physical quantities have been  developed and manufactured in a micro-electronic form. Remote  sensing methods have been implemented in radar and laser  instruments for detecting and mapping the water surface  contamination and soil moisture content and for detecting  groundwater. Scientific and research work on developing a  station for monitoring gas discharges, systems for collecting  and processing environmental data, and nonlinear hydroacoustic  instruments for remote measurement of the thickness of sludge  deposits resulting from industrial enterprise discharges have  been carried out at the complex.    Equipment and software for the diagnostic-recovery center  are  being developed and manufactured at the Institute; it contains  the following:     -  a model of a computer-aided system for monitoring the  health of workers under the conditions of their productive  activity developed on the basis of a computer    -  a psychological and physiological status simulator developed  on  the basis of a microcomputer together with a color graphics  display and a module for recording physiological parameters  (pulse rate, breathing rate, temperature, and skin potential) as  well as electric stimulation facilities;    -  a SKENAR-type energy neurostimulator which was developed and  manufactured for measured application of electric pulses for  therapeutic purposes on reflexogenic segments of the skin cover  in patients with diseases of the peripheral nervous system,  skeletomuscular system traumas, or to be used as an auxiliary  facility in respiratory diseases, in the initial stages of  cardiovascular system diseases; it will be used starting from  the foundation of scientific research, subsequent execution of  experimental design work on its basis, and all the way to the  production of pilot prototypes and pilot batches of the  instruments being developed. Moreover, the Taganrog Radio  Engineering Institute complex has accumulated considerable  potential in the field of information science and computer  science which makes it possible to automate the collection and  processing of environmental and medical and biological data and  develop a system of regional ecological data banks and knowledge  bases. This is especially important since contacts have been  made at an international level: a joint Soviet-Italian  enterprise, contacts with Czecho-Slovakia, contacts with  Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Germany, etc.    This issue of the journal contains applied articles  dealing with the problem of monitoring the environmental  parameters recommended for publication by the scientific and  engineering seminar ``Radiophysical Methods in Environmental  Research'' and by the coordinating center for organizing  scientific research at the RSFSR State Committee on Science and  Higher Education.    Moreover, the issue also contains the findings of research  in  related fields carried out by scientists from other institutions  of higher learning.</p>

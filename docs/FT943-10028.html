			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Nicola Foulston Nicola Foulston, owner and chief executive of Brands Hatch racing circuit, began running her own business at an early age. She inherited Brands Hatch and three other racing circuits from her father, John, seven years ago when he was killed in a race at Silverstone. Two years after that, aged 22, she took over the running of Brands Hatch and quickly developed a reputation as an astute and strong-willed manager. What item of office equipment would you need, along with a fax and telephone? I'd like to take my PA who I rely on for many things and who I really couldn't do without. But outside the human element it would have to be a TV and video. I'd need those because I do a lot of reviewing of events, but also I imagine that I would get pretty bored on a desert island, so they would provide some amusement too. Who would you take with you? I'm newly married and I would definitely take my husband. Probably 20 years on I wouldn't say the same thing, but right now I'd take my husband. He'd be the best entertainment value. We met when I started learning to fly - he used to be my flying instructor. You can have a vehicle to get around the island? The new Porsche 959. I've got sports cars and they're fun to drive, but I especially like that model. It's very stylish. You're allowed one type of food? Chinese. I eat more Chinese than anything else and would miss it if I couldn't have it. Like most of us, it is mainly the western-style Chinese that I eat most rather than the true Cantonese from China. One non-essential item to preserve your sanity? It would have to be a light aircraft. I love flying, it's one of my favourite pastimes. My aircraft has quite a limited range so I wouldn't be able to escape from the island. What would be the best thing about being marooned? Being able to concentrate. People are always in and out of my office, and while I like the buzz of that, just being able to get on with things would be a bonus. You're allowed to watch one sport. It would have to be a motor sport. I'm not a big fan of other types of sport, I've never been able to get into football for example. And also I would need to keep up with what was happening in motoring. One condition can be imposed on the island. It would have to have a mountain that was snow-capped so that I could go skiing. I'm a skiing fanatic and really love to go each year. If you couldn't return from the island, what would you like to be remembered for? For commercial awareness. I've tried to make a lot of changes in what is quite an old-style and very traditional business, especially with events such as the touring cars. It is not a business that welcomes change very readily so that is what I would like people to remember.</p>

Their  meeting was followed by a meeting between the delegations of the  two states. Afterwards, Andrey Kozyrev and Josef Zieleniec gave  a joint news conference. Correspondent David Stahlavsky, who was  there, reports:    [Stahlavsky] Journalists' questions concerned two main  areas--the Russian effort aimed at settling the Bosnian conflict  and the position of the Czech Republic in the policy of Russia,  as a superpower.    Kozyrev confirmed that no direct clash of interests exists  between our states and that, when some differences do occur,  they are generated by the complexity of the problems that have  to be solved jointly. The Russian minister mentioned the need  to quickly draft documents for the visit of Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus to Russia, agreed by presidents Havel and Yeltsin  last summer.    Minister Zieleniec said he sees no big differences of views  existing with regard to our country's efforts aimed at being  incorportated into West European integrational structures.    Kozyrev declined to comment directly on Russia's continuing  to regard the Czech Republic as a sphere of its vital interests.  The only interest he admitted was that Russian artists should be  influential in our country and that Czech artists should be  influential in Russia because both countries are interested in  each other.    Responding to a Czech Radio question, Kozyrev said that the  purpose of the talks is not that the Czech Republic should back  the Russian attitude to Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular,  although the views held by Moscow and Prague are very close.  The purpose of the talks is to jointly find an answer to this  very complex situation. Russia has influence there because it is  familiar with this region. It is evident that Czech foreign  policy also has influence in this region. They should pool  their efforts aimed at solving the conflict.    Kozyrev said he did not want to even think, let alone  comment, on the new political situation that would evolve after  a bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia. As is known, Russia  regards the ultimatum on the withdrawal of Serbian artillery  from the vicinity of Sarajevo as illegal and strongly disagrees  with it.</p>

Tomorrow Mr John Smith, party leader, is set to secure collective agreement to a clear policy on Europe at meetings of the national executive committee, Labour's ruling body, and the shadow cabinet. Party chiefs have made clear that shadow cabinet members will have to abide by an agreed policy. Yesterday, however, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow national heritage secretary, renewed his call for a referendum in Britain. 'If we were to face the prospect of having to endorse the treaty, I would certainly take the view that it should not be done without consulting the British people,' he said.

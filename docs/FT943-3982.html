			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Poll shows Bildt gaining ground An opinion poll yesterday in Sweden's Svenska Dagbladet newspaper showed that Mr Carl Bildt's minority right-centre coalition government had gained some ground over the past week ahead of next Sunday's general election. However, it still trailed the Social Democrats by 46.7 per cent to 41.1 per cent, indicating that Mr Bildt urgently needs voters to swing to the right if he is not to lose power. The Social Democrats, under the leadership of former prime minister Ingvar Carlsson, are expected to perform strongly enough to form a government, probably seeking an unusual alliance with the Liberal party, a member of Mr Bildt's coalition, to reach a majority. In the absence of any single party or Bildt-led majority government, such a coalition would almost certainly be welcomed by the financial markets as the best prospect for producing a credible fiscal policy to attack Sweden's big budget deficit and spiralling public debt.</p>

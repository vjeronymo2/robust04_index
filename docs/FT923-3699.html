			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Curbs on regulators urged THE TUC made its first serious contribution to the national debate on the regulation of utilities yesterday by calling for greater accountability for the regulators and less favouritism for business customers. Moving a motion on the regulation of public-service industries, Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the NCU communications union, said: 'For too long we have ignored the role that regulators have to play. We've seen them as agents of the Tory government, instead of realising they could just as easily work for the country.' The call is a response to the government's sale of about 25 per cent of British Telecom shares last year, which ruled out the prospect of a return to state control of the company under any future Labour government. Previously, the possibility of renationalisation prevented the NCU from entering the regulation debate. The motion urges new responsibilities for regulators to protect the needs of all regions, promote training and research, and ensure that business and individual customers benefit from new technology. Mr Young criticised bodies such as Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, for ignoring the public interest.</p>

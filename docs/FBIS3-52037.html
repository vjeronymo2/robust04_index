			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Special Correspondent Marcia Carmo] </F>   [Text] Leticia, Colombia -- President Itamar Franco  believes the country should carefully follow the developments of  the trial of legislators involved in mishandling the budget. He  added he is willing to investigate within the executive branch  should the situation demand it. The president will carefully  review the final budget CPI [Congressional Investigating  Committee] report and submit it to the civilian cabinet to  verify if it is necessary to investigate the Executive Branch.    After stating that the executive branch cooperated with the  CPI investigations by providing information requested by its  members, the president said: "If the situation requires it, we  will continue the investigation through the Special  Investigating Commission." Established by the president to  investigate irregularities in the Executive Branch, the Special  Investigating Commission will be installed either on the 25 or  26 January. It will be headed by Federal Administration  Secretary (SAF) Romildo Cahim. It comprises, among others,  members of the Ethics in Politics Movement.    Itamar Franco is satisfied with the CPI works that have  concluded but he believes the issuance of the CPI final report  will mark the beginning of an investigation into the mishandling  of the public budget. He said: "Congress did what had to be  done," adding: "Of course, this is only one stage. It will  continue through the Senate and Chamber of Deputies justice  commissions and joint sessions of Congress."    On his way back from Leticia, a town on the  Brazilian-Colombian border where he attended the installation of  the Brazilian-Colombian Neighborhood Commission, the president  said the Executive Branch will continue to submit all requested  information to help clarify the mishandling of the budget.    "Our cooperation can be confirmed by any CPI member" he said  between sips of mineral water. He did not want to comment on  whether the Judicial Branch will follow the example of the  Legislative Branch and investigate its own activities. "The  Judicial Branch is a different government entity," he said.    During the interview with JORNAL DO BRASIL, the president  said he will meet with Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], the government  leader in the Senate; and Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP) [Sao  Paulo], government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, to discuss  the appointment of the new mines and energy minister. Itamar  Franco will chose the successor to Deputy Paulino Cicero  (PSDB-MG) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Mato Grosso], who  left his post to run in the elections. He declined to comment  on whether former Civilian Cabinet Minister Henrique Hargreaves  will be appointed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Urges Japanese Authorities </F> To Declare Total Amount of Its Plutonium" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK  Foreign Ministry in a statement today regarding the discovery of  70 kg of plutonium at the nuclear fuel-making plant in  Tokaimura, Japan, says this extra-large case is a breach of the  publicly recognized international law which must be taken as a  serious case and condemned.    "This vividly shows that Japan's much-touted `three  non-nuclear principles' are a `screen' for stepping up nuclear  armament in full scale while keeping a large amount of plutonium  in hiding and that the noisy row Japan has raised over the  fictitious `nuclear issue' of the DPRK, taking the van in the  intrigues to stifle it, is a petty trick to conceal its own  nuclear armament and divert the public attention elsewhere", the  spokesman says.    He urges the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy  Agency to pay due attention to this problem in compliance with  the principle of impartiality.    "The United States which has abused the `nuclear issue' of  the DPRK for its sinister political purposes, talking about a  `cooperation system' aimed at `stifling' the DPRK in league with  Japan, a nuclear criminal, can never evade its responsibility  for this case," he says, and goes on:    "The Japanese authorities must declare to the international  community the exact total amount of plutonium they keep in  hiding nationwide and immediately stop their nuclear armament.    "We consider the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  virtually meaningless since Japan's nuclear armament being  promoted on the danger line has been verified in actuality.    "We call upon the governments of all countries in the world,  international organizations and anti-nuke organizations to exert  unbiased efforts to remove the danger of nuclear development  from our planet and, in particular, to take a joint action  against Japan's nuclear armament which is being accelerated  recklessly with the ambition to become a military power, a  nuclear power."</p>

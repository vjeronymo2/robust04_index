			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (AFP)--Leading Chinese dissident  Xu Wenli was released here Tuesday after spending five days in  police detention for apparent parole violations, a friend of  Xu's said.    Xu, a leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement and one  of China's longest serving political prisoners, had been  detained Friday as part of a police sweep of dissidents in  Beijing and Shanghai that coincided with the visit of French  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.    Journalists were prevented from entering Xu's home Tuesday  evening by uniformed and plainclothes police. There was no  official confirmation of the release by the Chinese authorities,  who said Monday that they were continuing "investigations" into  Xu and China's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng who was  detained April 1.    According to the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry, Xu was  detained for having "violated the terms of his parole." Xu,  49, was released on parole in May last year after serving 12  years of a 15-year sentence for "counterrevolutionary" crimes.    The detention of Xu -- who has always had a strong interest  in France and, in particular, its revolutionary history -- was  an embarrassing snub to the French Government during Balladur's  visit. It was also followed by the detention of three dissidents  -- Wang Fucheng, Bao Ge, and Yang Zhou -- in Shanghai, when  Balladur visited the eastern Chinese city after Beijing.    All three dissidents were released Sunday.    Wei Jingsheng, who had been released in September six months  short of a 15-year sentence, is still in detention and  officially being investigated for "new crimes." Wei's sister,  Wei Ling, said Tuesday that she had heard "no further news" of  his present circumstances.</p>

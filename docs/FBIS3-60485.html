			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC Biotechnology Policy"] </F>   [Text] It is generally agreed that biotechnology is a  vital key to future industrial competitiveness and strength, but  the EC Commission is concerned that Europe is lagging badly  behind the United States in this very important field.    This was the major point made by the Commission speaker at a  well attended IETT [Institute of European Trade and Technology]  conference on the subject in London on November 9th. The  speaker was Dr. Maurice Lex, who, before moving to the CEC's  [Commission of the European Community] Biotechnology Unit in  Brussels, was Acting Director of SERC's [Science and Engineering  Research Council] Biotechnology Directorate. He went on to list  what the Commission sees as Europe's chief weaknesses in the  area. These are:    -- Lack of consensus on the scientific objectives to be  aimed  for;    -- The relative isolation of academic research;    -- A complex regulatory system which many find hostile to  research;    -- Under development of the SME sector;    -- A poor and declining public perception and understanding  of biotechnology. (This Dr. Lex identified as perhaps the most  significant weakness. Even a small amount of negative coverage  on TV, he said, can have a powerful effect on public opinion,  even putting students off deciding to specialise in the subject).    It was sad to see European companies moving their research  activities to the United States where regulations are easier, he  commented.    So far, Member States had come together in joint projects as  part of CEC programmes. More collaboration is needed.    But Europe does have its strengths, too:    -- Biotechnology is given reasonable priority in the Member  States;    -- There are substantial investments in R&amp;D by large  companies, mainly chemical, agro-chemical, seed and  pharmaceutical companies;    -- Collaborative behavior has been stimulated by previous EC  programmes;    -- There is strong involvement of a large cross-section of  industry in horizontal activities -- CEFIC [European Council of  Federations of the Chemical Industry], SAGB [Senior Advisory  Group on Biotechnology], National Biotech Associations,  Industrial Platforms etc.;    -- High expectations from various parts of society for  various reasons.    There would be a very significant increase in the funds  available for supporting biotechnology research in the fourth  framework programme, Dr. Lex told the conference. He also  referred to three recent reports issued by the industrial R&amp;D  committee (IRDAC) of the EC on the life sciences programmes --  covering in particular biomedical research, and agriculture,  biochemical and food, with reference to the fourth Framework  Programme.    IRDAC calls for more industrial participation in all  projects, and identifies a number of lateral issues which merit  special attention including training, productive systems, safety  regulation, intellectual property and education. Copies of  these reports can be obtained from Dr. Lex, Fax: Brussels  296-4322.    As previously reported, there is a third call for proposals  under the current CEC Biotechnology programme with a deadline of  12.1.94. An information pack may be obtained from: E. Magnien,  DGXII-E/1. Fax: Brussels 295-5365.</p>

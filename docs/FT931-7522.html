			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Jobs: Even boredom can be a surprise - Although emotions affect people's performance, no one knows much about how they work DO you happen to be bored out of your skull? If so, then although the Jobs column will make every effort, perking you up is likely to prove a struggle. The reasons, if we are to believe German researchers Reinhard Pekrun and Michael Frese, are twofold. The first is what's technically called mood-congruence. Memory tests show that people in a happy mood tend to be best at recalling happy things, and sad folk sad ones. So presumably anyone who starts out bored will be mentally predisposed to find anything that happens more wearisome still. The second reason why you'll probably resist my struggles is that the very topic of boredom is boring, even to psychologists. Although there is clearly a lot of it around in the workplace and elsewhere, hardly any of them have bothered to study it. Still, such research as they've done is not without surprises. For example, while it seems tediously obvious that people in crassly monotonous jobs will function like zombies, that is not always so. On occasion, they are almost super-humanly productive. A possible explanation is that dreary tasks sometimes go beyond merely boring us into a stupor, and goad us into exasperated action. Shrinks have now noted the difference in their jargon. They use the term 'boredom' only for the stupefying kind, calling the energising sort 'satiation a state of high arousal with a strong negative emotional content of resentment.' Alas, whether you're satiated or just bored, the mood tends to persist. In particular, it has more sticking-power than the 'positive emotions' like happiness that can slip away like wet soap in a bath. Even they produce the odd surprise in a work setting, the German pair say*. Take decision-making for instance. Although positive emotion 'seems to enhance an intuitive and holistic mode of thinking', it 'can induce risk-aversion for higher risks' even while promoting a happy-go-lucky approach to lighter risks. By contrast, sadness apparently 'induces more analytic, detail-oriented, narrowly focused ways *In International review of industrial &amp; organizational psychology, 1992. John Wiley, Pounds 30. of cognitive problem-solving and making decisions'. Yet when it comes to helping colleagues and customers, the opposite moods tend to have the same effect. If either happy or sad, compared with feeling some emotion between, we're more apt to help. Either way, too, the motive may be selfish: helping in hope of hanging on to slippery happiness on the one hand, or on the other in the hope of earning relief from our own sad mood. Perhaps fortunately, however, that isn't a certainty. For the two Germans' prime finding is that what goes for boredom applies to emotions in general. Although they clearly have a marked effect on our work, they have been very little studied. Hence I'll return to them occasionally in weeks to come - unless readers would find it too boring, that is. NOW to the table alongside giving extracts from Day Associates' latest three-monthly survey of pay and perks in City of London banks. Anyone wanting the full report - covering 283 jobs in 123 banks of various sorts and priced at Pounds 220 to those not taking part in the study - should contact Joe Clark at Suite 2.31, 75 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel (0)71-375 1397, fax 375 1723. Limited to 16 managerial posts, the table starts with basic salaries. The lower quartile refers to the person a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same type of job, the median to the person half way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down from the top. Next comes the average salary, then the percentage of it typically received as a bonus. The last two columns show the percentage of the job-holders with cars, as distinct from car allowances which look to be coming into vogue, followed by the vehicle's average price. FINALLY today - a rare job, offered by Paul Child of Kramer Westfield for a UK group he may not name. He promises to honour applicants' requests not to be identified to the employer at this stage. Having applied for a public telecommunications operator's licence, the group is seeking a business development director to turn its plan into profitable reality. With seven senior managers to help, the recruit will lead the planning and implementation of all marketing and sales, including not only product definition and customer development, but also negotiations with regulatory bodies and potential associates. Candidates must have made a name in the same field as hands-on managers as well as strategic planners. They need to be as credible to merchant bankers concerned with the industry as to technical staff working within it. Salary indicator - which surely makes the banking figures to the left look lavish - around Pounds 50,000 with car among perks.

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Easter's moveable feast dishes statisticians: Critics say the CSO system of seasonal adjustment may itself need some adjusting A statistical health warning accompanies the UK consumer credit figures released yesterday. The data, the Central Statistical office noted, may have been distorted because of Easter and its effect on seasonal adjustment. Such warnings are not entirely new. Spending and borrowing both surge before public holidays and statisticians have always floundered over the fact that Easter is a moveable feast and Christmas can occur on any day of the week. But the timing of Easter this year has created particular problems. Because the holiday straddled both March and April, statisticians have been uncertain which month they should adjust to account for the anticipated surge in high street activity. The CSO insists that the statistical effect of these monthly 'glitches' is tiny and point out that the problem can be avoided by using the three-month average, which is generally regarded as the best indicator of trends. But this argument has failed to convince some observers who say a more radical overhaul of the system of seasonal adjustment may be needed. For example, the Credit Card Research Group - an industry research company - argues that the present system of seasonal adjustment is too limited since it fails to account for variations in the number of credit-card processing days. One reason why the credit figures fell this month, they point out, may have been that there were fewer processing days in April. Meanwhile, some British academics argue that the broad statistical methods used to calculate the seasonal adjustment are outdated and clumsy, and should be replaced by newer mathematical models. The CSO's method of seasonal adjustment, which is called 'X11', uses a technique known as a 'moving average'. This was first developed in the US in the 1960s and has since been adopted by most western goverments. Under this system seasonal adjustment is calculated by looking at fluctuations over several years. To calculate the adjustment for December 1990, for example, the system might look at the average spending surge in the months of December between 1986 and 1994. The system works well for calculating past seasonal fluctuations, where there is data before and after any month. But as Mr Tim Jones, senior statistician at the CSO, admits, the system is less accurate for the most recent data, since there is no 'future' data with which to calculate an average. As a result, the CSO usually assumes that the future trend will be the same as previous trends, and does not attempt to predict any events that might dramatically change it. The CSO argues that attempts are being made to make the adjustments more sensitive, and points out that a new system known as 'X12' is being developed in the US which addresses the problem of recent data. But academics such as Professor Andrew Harvey of the London School of Economics argue that the system is too rigid, since it cannot respond to rapidly changing patterns of behaviour. Prof Harvey believes it should be replaced by a mathematical model system which can take better account of any new seasonal factors. The Department of Employment has already adopted one such system for some of its labour data, and the Bank of England, which uses a system similar to the CSO's, has researched different options. But so far the Bank has decided against moving to a model-based system, partly because it fears a mathematical model might take longer to process the data. Meanwhile, budgetary restraints at the CSO leave Prof Harvey pessimistic that it will change its system rapidly. In the interim, some observers suggest that the best solution may be to place less emphasis on seasonal adjustment. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, for example, is said by former colleagues to be deeply suspicious of seasonally adjusted numbers. Meanwhile, the Building Societies Association does not seasonally adjust its own figures, arguing that it does not have the resources to produce a 'fool-proof system'. But as Mr Jones points out, the wild swings in non-seasonally adjusted figures, particularly in areas such as retail sales data, can make it extremely difficult for observers to make sense of non-adjusted figures. 'If we didn't seasonally adjust then every analyst would just create their own systems of seasonal adjustment,' Mr Jones says. He insists that the CSO has no intention of abandoning seasonal adjustment - leaving most officials to conclude that the most practical solution to any uncertainty may be to increase the size of the statistical health warnings.</p>

Khin Nyunt, first secretary of Myanmar's State Law and Order  Restoration Council, told Japanese reporters that the legitimate  period of her house arrest will expire in July. Myanmar's law  limits the period of house arrest to a maximum of five years.    Aung San Suu Kyi, 48, a Nobel peace prize laureate, led the  National League for Democracy (NLD) to a landslide victory in  the 1991 general election but was denied the power to head the  government.</p>

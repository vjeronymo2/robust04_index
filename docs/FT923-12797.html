			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Carrington sticks doggedly to EC remit COMFORTABLY ensconced on a settee in the chairman's office of Christie's, the auctioneers, Lord Carrington does not look like a man under fire. Indeed, it almost seems as if he is daring those, like the French government, who want to transform the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia, over which he presides, into a wider international forum, to do their worst. 'I was employed by the European Community. The Foreign Ministers of the EC are meeting in Brussels on Monday. If they want to do something different, that's absolutely fine with me.' But he is quick to make clear he still feels he has a useful job to do and does not despair of the current negotiations on a Bosnian or overall Yugoslav settlement. Nor does he believe an alternative to the EC conference would do any better. 'The problems are not going to go away by finding a new forum. One has to recognise that a new forum other than the EC would be much more unwieldy. And there are certain other difficulties involved in such a procedure, if it involves the United Nations and permanent members of the Security Council. 'The Russians and the Chinese have recognised Serbia and Montenegro as the new Yugoslavia, which the EC and the Americans have not. And when you are talking about minorities, one would have to consider whether some permanent members of the Security Council were necessarily the most suitable people to talk about minorities.' He clearly had Russia in mind, though he did not mention any names. What then is Lord Carrington's plan to break the present deadlock in the negotiations being held in London between the three warring Bosnian parties? He does not believe there is any real chance of negotiating a ceasefire that will stick at the moment, despite the protestations of all the parties that they want one. So a different approach must be attempted, in which a halt to the fighting will be the end product rather than the precondition of a political settlement. 'What the Moslems are saying is that either there will be military intervention by the United Nations or we die. It is not my job to talk about military intervention or what the UN ought to do. What I'm saying is that there is a slim possibility that you could get an agreement between the three communities on a constitution of an independent Bosnia so that the reasons for fighting would no longer be there. 'I think it's a slim chance, but it's one which I think the Moslems ought to take because the outlook for them is very serious in the absence of a settlement. This is particularly so, since in the past neither the Serbs nor Croats have made any pretence about favouring a partition of Bosnia.' Lord Carrington stresses that his own aim is to stop Bosnia from being partitioned. He is 'increasingly irritated' by the attempt to saddle him with the so-called 'cantonisation' plan of March this year, which has been interpreted by critics as breaking up Bosnia into a number of constituent national units, and which was subsequently rejected by the Moslems. 'They all agreed on a set of principles, including the Moslems, providing for a good deal of autonomy for the three communities under a federal state. This was one of the reasons why the Community actually recognised Bosnia-Hercegovina's independence.' As late as April, the Moslems reiterated that the principles of this draft constitution were acceptable to them. But subsequently they made clear they were no longer prepared to negotiate on those principles and repeated their demands for a unitary state. 'They are now talking to Mr Jose Cutileiro (the EC mediator, for whom Lord Carrington has the highest regard) about their own plan which is simply going back to the old constitution. I think that will almost certainly be rejected by the other two sides.' Lord Carrington insists he is not proposing a simple break-up of Bosnia into three ethnically homogeneous geographical areas. 'What I have in mind is a certain degree of local autonomy for ethnic people, not geographical boundaries in the sense that you have one slab which is Serbian, another that is Croat and another that is Moslem, because the whole thing is a patchwork quilt anyway.'</p>

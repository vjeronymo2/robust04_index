			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Business mood at six-year peak Business leaders are more confident about the economy than at any time since 1988, says a survey published today by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company. While construction companies and exporters of manufactured goods are the most optimistic about increasing sales and profits in the last quarter of this year, many retailers are still relatively gloomy as a result of only sluggish increases in consumer spending and concerns about the impact of last month's increase in interest rates. Even with the warning that many retailers face a poor Christmas the latest snapshot of industry opinion will be welcomed by the Treasury, which wants to create foundations for long-term growth through a non-inflationary recovery led by industry. Indications of greater confidence among businesses are supported by a survey from Lombard Business Finance, a finance and leasing group, which says the main reason companies are investing is to increase capacity rather than to improve efficiency. In September 52 per cent of respondents planning to invest were doing so to increase capacity, compared with 39 per cent three months earlier, according to the survey. Meanwhile, another report out today from the Henley Centre, an economic consultancy, warns that consumers are increasingly out of step with Britain's boardrooms in failing to feel cheered by signs of upturn from the early 1990s recession. The report says the government, if it wants to win the next general election, may have to do more to make consumers feel that they are benefiting from the characteristics of low inflation, higher exports and increased investment that have so far characterised the recovery. It says: 'The job of striking the right balance between appearing virtuous (over the economy) and satisfying voters' desire for rising living standards will become an increasingly difficult one.' In the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey a balance of 59 percentage points of companies said they expected to increase sales in the last quarter compared with 12 months previously. The balance is the percentage of respondents forecasting an increase, minus those expecting a decrease. The figure for the balance compared with 51 points a year ago. It was the highest for a fourth quarter since 1988. The survey was conducted among 1,600 managing directors and took place between September 28 and October 6, just after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, increased bank base rates from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent. Companies were similarly upbeat in other areas that Dun &amp; Bradstreet reckons affect overall business confidence. These areas include companies' thoughts about the possibilities of increasing profits and taking on new staff. A balance of 48 percentage points expected new orders in the fourth quarter to exceed those a year ago, well up on the 36 points recorded for the final quarter of 1993. The general mood of bullishness contrasts with less sanguine attitudes among retailers. According to the survey a balance of just 28 percentage points of stores are looking for higher sales in the last quarter, while a mere 4 percentage points expect order books to increase. The survey showed business leaders in north-west England, the Midlands and Wales to be the most optimistic. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Holmers Farm Way, High Wycombe, Bucks HP12 4UL.

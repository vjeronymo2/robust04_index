			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / End to unlimited liability at Lloyd's urged A senior figure at Lloyd's of London yesterday cast doubt on the insurance market's 300-year-old tradition of unlimited liability for its Names - the individuals whose assets support the market. It follows the successful admission to the market of investment trusts and companies backed by corporate investors in the past few months. Mr Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman of the market, said Lloyd's should next year 'stand back and consider' whether it should admit new Names with unlimited liability. 'You shouldn't have two classes of shareholder,' said Mr Hiscox, who has headed the market's successful drive this year to attract corporate capital. Sixteen investment trusts and companies have already raised more than Pounds 800m in capital and are eventually expected to provide more than Pounds 2bn of capacity (the amount of premiums syndicates are allowed to underwrite) next year. Individual Names, who are theoretically liable for losses down to their last personal possessions, still provide the bulk of the market's capital, with about 19,000 underwriting Pounds 8bn next year. But their numbers have declined sharply in the past few years. More than 13,000 Names have resigned or been forced out of the market by losses of more than Pounds 5bn since 1989. In spite of rising premiums and good prospects for profitability, only about 50 new Names have so far signed up to join Lloyd's for 1994. This decline is expected to continue during the rest of the decade, partially reflecting the gradual rise in the average age of Names, which is now 58. Unlimited liability 'causes too much grief', insisted Mr Hiscox. 'Every 30 years or so we have blown Names out of the water; I just don't want anybody in future to have to sell their homes to meet losses.' Many existing Names are expected to choose participation on a limited liability basis as soon as they are able to transfer liabilities incurred by syndicates with 'open years'. Syndicates leave years of account 'open' because of uncertainty about the scale of future claims. Lloyd's aims to transfer several billion pounds of liabilities stemming from 1985 and earlier years of account to a new reinsurance company which it hopes to form within the next two to three years. Most Names, however, will participate at Lloyd's in members' agents pooling arrangements or Mapas, a kind of unit trust allowing them to reduce risks by spreading their investments across a much wider range of syndicates than is possible for typical individual Names. Mr Hiscox said Lloyd's agents might seek to convert Mapas into limited liability companies after the formation of the new reinsurance company. Separately, Lloyd's yesterday put the final touches to a settlement offer for loss-making Names, expected to amount to about Pounds 900m. The offer will be sent to over 21,000 Names and made public next week. The Names, who are claiming Pounds 3.5bn in compensation from their agents, will be offered varying amounts of compensation depending on their syndicates and their chances of legal success. It is understood that as much as two-thirds of the amount of compensation - between Pounds 500m and Pounds 600m - could be channelled to Names who were members of Feltrim and Gooda Walker syndicates, allowing for settlement at the rate of about 50p in the pound. Compensation will also reflect other factors. Names involved in legal action are expected to be offered greater sums, especially if they have court dates. The worst-hit Names, who were in heavy loss-making syndicates, should also receive above-average compensation. Finance for the settlement will come from three main sources. Errors-and-omissions insurers, which cover agents against legal awards for negligence, are expected to pay up to Pounds 400m while Lloyd's is expected to make a contribution of at least Pounds 400m from its central fund. Some Lloyd's agents and brokers will also contribute.</p>

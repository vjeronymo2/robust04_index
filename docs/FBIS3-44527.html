This Standing Committee meeting is held  when Comrade Mao Zedong's birth centenary is being marked.  Members of the Standing Committee attended a commemoration  meeting sponsored by the party Central Committee and paid their  respects to the remains of Chairman Mao. At this standing  committee meeting, Comrades Qian Qichen and Wen Jiabao made  important reports on the international situation and the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, respectively. Members of the Standing Committee put  forward many good opinions and suggestions. This meeting has  just adopted a "Decision on Studying and Implementing the  `Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning  the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure,'"  and we must conscientiously carry it out. Now I would like to  discuss several views.    The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  was another extremely important meeting held in the course of  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization in our country.  The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  held in December 1978, effected the strategic shift of the  stress of work throughout the party, marking the great beginning  of reform and opening up in our country. At that time, the  stress of reform was put on rural areas. The Third Plenary  Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee, held in October 1984,  adopted the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on the Reform  of the Economic Structure," indicating that the reform of the  economic structure, with the stress on urban areas, was in full  swing. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, held last month, adopted the "Decision of the CPC  Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of  a Socialist Market Economic Structure," signaling that the  reform of the economic structure in our country has entered the  period of combining package reform with breakthroughs in key  areas. This "decision" represents a profound summing up of  historical experiences since the founding of the PRC, especially  a profound summing up of experiences in reform and opening to  the outside world over the past 15 years; and it is an overall  plan for establishing a socialist market economic structure in  our country as well as the program of action for reforming the  economic structure in the nineties. Striving to carry out the  tasks set out in the "decision" and to effect the transition  from the old economic structure to a new one is of great  practical and far-reaching historical significance for further  liberating and developing the productive forces; accelerating  the pace of reform, opening up, and modernization; and promoting  the great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    Establishing and improving a socialist market economic  structure is a great system-engineering project, a great  practice of history- making by the Chinese people. In this  process, it is inevitable to encounter many hardly predictable  difficulties and unusually complicated situations. We must keep  a clear head and make a full assessment of and preparations for  all of this. We must understand that it is an entirely new  undertaking to establish a socialist market economic structure.  Human society thus far only has experience in developing the  market economy under capitalism, and it is undoubtedly an  unprecedented exploration to integrate the socialist system  organically with the market economy. For a fairly long time  after the founding of the PRC, we considered planning and the  market to be criteria for distinguishing socialism from  capitalism and took a critical and rejective attitude toward the  market economy. As a result, people, including leading cadres  at various levels, had little or no understanding of the general  laws and key elements of the market economy. Through reform and  opening to the outside world over the past decade and more,  market regulation has gradually expanded; but we still have to  familiarize ourselves with laws, principles, mechanisms, and  international practices generally observed in the modern market  economy. How to persevere in and give play to our political  superiority under the conditions of a socialist market economy  is also a new question for study. We must note that  establishing a socialist market economic structure is a profound  revolution. For a long time, things from the management system,  rules, and regulations, to people's way of thinking, work  methods, and habits in daily life have become suited to the  planned economy. The development of a socialist market economy  and the values and the code of conduct required by such  developments are bound to produce a powerful impact on such  things. This impact will touch on vast political, economic, and  cultural spheres as well as on social life and every link of  work in various regions, departments, and units. This calls for  making a series of changes in both the economic base and the  superstructure, remolding our subjective world while changing  the objective world, practically and effectively strengthening  the socialist legal system and the building of a socialist  spiritual civilization, and coordinating all these and making  them harmonize with the socialist market economic structure so  as to provide an effective guarantee for a healthy development  of the socialist market economy. We must note that establishing  a socialist market economic structure is a very difficult job.  The decades-old planned economy has left behind many  long-standing, big, and difficult problems, some of which are  very hard to solve. In the process of changing to a market  economic structure, it is hard to avoid causing some new  economic and social problems. When new contradictions mingle  with old ones, they will present a complicated picture of good  and evil, advantages and disadvantages existing side by side.  This will often make our choice difficult, and there will be  also many knotty problems to deal with. If reform measures,  especially those involving the adjustment of the masses'  immediate interests, are not prudently handled, it could cause  social turbulence [she hui bo dong 4357 2585 3134 0520]. We  must note that establishing a socialist market economic  structure will be a fairly long process. The developed Western  countries are where they are today because they have employed  the market economy for several hundred years. In a big Eastern  country like ours with a weak economic and cultural foundation  and with a deep-seated influence from the planned economy, we  just cannot reach our goal of such a deep social change in one  step even though we have many favorable conditions. Moreover,  stagnation or even a reversal may occur for various reasons in  the change from an old structure to a new one. This requires us  to be mentally prepared to wage a long struggle, to carry out  overall planning and to take all factors into consideration, to  do our work in the order of its importance and urgency, and to  stress continuous and coordinated efforts. In the entire  process of establishing, developing, and improving a socialist  market economic structure, there always exists the question of  how to properly handle the relationship between reform and  development and stability. Reform is our driving force,  development is our goal, and stability is the prerequisite. We  must take the protection of the people's immediate interests as  the starting point, modestly heed their opinions, attentively  observe their feelings, grasp the principle of benefiting the  people and the principle of their tolerance, and strive to make  all our policy decisions accord with their wishes in order to  win their support. We must seize reform opportunities, see to it  that the intensity of reform is proper, take reform into account  in doing everything, make a correct assessment of the situation,  try to see from a small clue what is coming, and strive to  smoothly carry out reforms in a relatively stable and harmonious  social environment.    To accomplish the historic mission of building a socialist  market economic system and to avoid major twists and turns or  losses, we must always arm our minds with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. We must assiduously study the recently  published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, which is the theoretical foundation of the  socialist market economic system. We must study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's stand, viewpoints, methods, and character so that we  can become more capable of understanding and rebuilding the  world. We must integrate theory with reality and constantly sum  up our experiences so that we can become more aware of the need  to uphold the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering.  Through studying the third volume, we must firmly establish the  ideological line of emancipating our minds and seeking truth  from facts and be good at upholding the fundamental criteria  that our work must be conducive to three causes [developing the  productive forces of the PRC's socialist society, increasing the  overall strength of the PRC's socialist country, and improving  the Chinese people's living standards] so that we can creatively  deal with all sorts of problems arising from the development of  the socialist market economy. The "decision" has summed up the  experience that China has gained in launching reforms and  opening up to the outside world, and we must continue to gain  more experience from our work under the new historical  conditions. While the "decision" has outlined the basic  framework of our socialist market economic system, we must  reinforce the small parts when we do our work. The "decision"  is a programmatic document for guiding the nation's reform of  the economic system, and its implementation must be integrated  with actual local situations. During their implementation, the  basic principles and policies stated in the "decision" must  become the common awareness and actions of people throughout the  country. The issue of building a socialist market economic  system is, in the final analysis, an issue of practice. While  we must set our minds on studying the "decision" painstakingly  in order to implement it, we must dare to put it into practice.  We must practice under the guidance of theory, and we must  study and develop theory during practice. The process of  practicing, summing up, practicing again, and summing up again  is the process of the development of China's reform, and it is  also the process for us to deepen our understanding. We must  always respect the masses' initiatives. The masses are the  knowers and the doers, and they are the source of strength for  reform and construction. While the "decision" has incorporated  developed countries' applicable experiences in developing their  market economy, it has summed up the fresh experiences which  Chinese people have created while launching reforms and opening  up to the outside world. When the "decision" is being  implemented, the masses certainly will continue to demonstrate  their initiatives and creativity, which were restricted by the  highly centralized planned economic system, and they will  certainly come up with many innovative ideas. We must warmly  approach the masses' inventions and creativity and be good at  employing their experiences to guide them. We must continue to  wage arduous struggle. Now that the cardinal policy of carrying  out reforms has been established, the most important job we must  do is to firmly implement this policy and immerse ourselves in  hard work. Reform and opening up are a cause that will benefit  the whole nation, but it is not likely that each and every one  of us will benefit at the same time. In fact, certain people  may have to suffer a little. Thus, we must be prepared to do  hard work and be ready to make some short-term sacrifice for the  sake of national needs. Because of the socialist market  economic system, China certainly will certainly become a  prosperous country and Chinese people certainly will become an  affluent people; but if Chinese people of various nationalities  fail to make concerted efforts and to work hard, our grand plan  cannot be achieved. Whether people are willing to work hard  lies primarily in whether those in leading positions can set  good examples. Leading cadres at all levels must be ready to  work hard mentally and while doing their work, and they must  live plainly. Leading cadres must go deep into the realities of  life and immerse themselves among the masses. They must take  the initiative to solve problems and create a new situation at  places with many problems. In short, the opportunity for us to  speed up reform and development is good, and the situation is  favorable in many ways. As long as we study theory earnestly,  respect practical experience, maintain close ties with the  masses, and persevere in doing hard work, we certainly can  surmount all sorts of difficulties and can accomplish the  historic mission of building a socialist market economic system.    The issues mentioned above are issues that must be attended  to and studied when we implement the "decision." These issues  are also important issues which members of people's political  consultative organs must deal with when they are involved in  managing government affairs. We must throw ourselves into the  great cause of building a socialist market economic system, give  full scope to our strengths, and contribute what we can.    Fellow Standing Committee members, 1993 will soon be over. I  remember I said at a previous meeting that we were fortunate  that we can come together from various corners of the country.  Because of our close cooperation during the past year, we have  promoted mutual understanding and have deepened our friendship.  This has created a good beginning for members of this CPPCC  National Committee. During the new year, we must rally even  closer around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin  as the core, work with one heart and one mind, and continue to  work hard to create a new situation for people's political  consultative organs!    Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to wish you a happy  new year, good health, and happiness for all your families!</p>

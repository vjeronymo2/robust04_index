			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Turnround in exceptionals behind 25% decline at ECC PRE-TAX PROFITS at English China Clays, the industrial minerals and construction materials group, fell 25 per cent in 1992 to Pounds 86.2m, compared with Pounds 115.4m for the previous year. There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 14.3m, against a credit of Pounds 2.2m, mainly relating to the write down of housing land announced in September. Group sales fell 4.5 per cent to Pounds 966.3m. Lord Chilver, chairman, said the European markets were 'unlikely to show much progress' in 1993, but there were signs of recovery in the US. He said the group expected to at least maintain the dividend in 1993 at the 1992 level of 20p, itself unchanged from 1991. The shares rose 5p to 458p. Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said there had been 'intense pressure from customers for substantial price reductions' as the paper industry, the main user of china clay, struggled with overcapacity. He said ECC had resisted and volumes had been maintained. He said the group was in the middle of a five year programme to change the company around. 'We have done all the obvious things' he said, such as cutting costs, selling businesses and sorting out the balance sheet. The group was now the world's leading supplier of kaolin following the purchase of Georgia Kaolin in the US, at the end of 1990. The next step was to seek out business opportunities, such as expanding sales into the Pacific area, supplied from the US, and developing new uses for its industrial minerals. Operating profits from ECC International fell to Pounds 90.5m (Pounds 97.7m), although sales were marginally higher at Pounds 589.8m. Profits from construction materials, largely hard rock used in road building, fell to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 24.1m). Sales rose 2.4 per cent to Pounds 352.4m, as strong volumes were offset by price weakness. The housebuilding division, now being wound down, contributed Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 14.3m) in profits, and generated cash of Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 23.8m) as land was sold. Since 1990 Pounds 52m had been raised from this division, and the total could reach Pounds 200m. The interest charge was Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 16.5m) following the Pounds 209.2m rights issue last year. Net debt rose by Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 172.8m, 21 per cent of shareholders funds. The translation of overseas debt at lower sterling rates added Pounds 45.2m to debt. Earnings per share fell 30 per cent to 21.87p. An unchanged final dividend of 13.4p is proposed. Under FRS 3, which the group will apply to its published accounts, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 79m to Pounds 100.2m, mainly because of the reclassification of an extraordinary profit of Pounds 16m. Earnings per share were 27.26p, up from 15.09p. See Lex</p>

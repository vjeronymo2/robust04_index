			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 22, IRNA -- The U.S. is trying by all  possible means to hinder the expansion of relations between Iran  and Turkmenistan, an informed source told IRNA Sunday [22 May].    He said that the U.S., using its influence on oil and gas  consortium in Turkmenistan, was doing its best to obstruct the  construction of a pipeline for export of Turkmen gas via Iran  and Turkey. The source, who asked not to be named, said the  orders issued by President Niyazov on setting up of a gas  pipeline to Europe via Iran and Turkey were generally ignored by  those at the lower part of that country's chain of command  manily due to obstacles put by Washington.    The U.S. has so far created numerous problems for  Iran-Turkmenistan joint project by exercising its influence.  The Turkmen minister of oil and gas is said to be one of  critics of President Niyazov's views, having close links with  the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. People such as the Turkmen  minister of oil and gas have recently come out with new  proposals that the proposed pipeline pass through Azerbaijan and  Georgia instead of Iran and Turkey.    The source said that the Islamic Republic has informed  President Niyazov through various channels of its  dissatisfaction with Washington's attempts to block expansion of  ties between Iran and Turkmenistan.</p>

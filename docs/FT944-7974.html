			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Diploma 23% to Pounds 25m Strong growth from the electronics and building components divisions of Diploma enabled the group, which also has interests in special steels, to lift pre-tax profits almost 23 per cent in the year to September 30. Profits of Pounds 25m (Pounds 20.4m) pre-tax were struck on turnover of Pounds 192m (Pounds 158m). Operating profits grew to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 20.2m) while interest receivable slipped to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.3m) as the group had Pounds 24m cash at the year-end, against Pounds 28m. The group places great emphasis on strong cash flow, which financed the 21 per cent sales increase. Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman and chief executive, said Diploma was 'not as aggressive in acquisitions as we may well become', adding that the group's culture was one of 'slow diversification'. About Pounds 4m was spent on acquisitions in the year. The electronics division made Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 12.9m) on turnover of Pounds 127m (Pounds 104m). The main engine of growth remained the PC market. The expected downward turn of the UK semi-conductor cycle had been deferred, he suggested, by the recession in continental Europe and by the emerging potential in 'bridging devices' for multi-media applications. Sales at Macro, the semi-conductor business, achieved a 29 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 78m, outstripping the market's growth by 8 percentage points. Nortronic, the other electrical components distributor, lifted revenue 14 per cent and operating profits 10 per cent. Profits in the building components side bucked the cyclical trend and grew by 23 per cent to Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 7m) on turnover at Pounds 50.4m (Pounds 42.8m). The special steels division benefited from the recovery in the oil industry, winning orders by being 'able to respond from stock and with service'. Earnings per share rose to 28.9p (24.4p) and a final dividend of 9.5p (8.5p) lifts the total to 13.5p (12p). The shares gained 10p to 448p. COMMENT The stock has underperformed the market by 23 per cent over the past 12 months in anticipation of a cycle-induced profits slowdown. However, while these figures are at the lower end of the expected range, they are perfectly solid and show, most importantly, that demand for semi-conductors and building components is not slowing as the cycle dictated. Diploma, cautious and conservative as ever, is also gradually diversifying, to remove risk further. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 27.5m give earnings of 31.8p for the current year and a p/e of 13.8, a slight premium. The shares have scope for further progress.</p>

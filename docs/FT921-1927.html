			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Trouble in the pipeline MY NEIGHBOUR has renewed his entire water system, inserting pipework into the party wall between us; I was never consulted, nor did I give any approval for work affecting the party wall. We live in a 1950s terrace in London, and the walls between the houses are two courses of brick, without a cavity. Water noises now reverberate in the wall, so that anyone in the adjacent rooms is disturbed when water is used next door. I have approached the neighbour who is unhelpful. What rights do I have and what can I do to end this imposition? As your house appears to be in the area of the old London County Council you have the protection of the provisions of the London Building Acts (Amendment) Act 1939. Part VI of that Act requires certain notices to be served on an adjoining owner before any work is done to a party wall, to enable a Party Wall Award to be made. This evidently was not done. You should consult a solicitor as soon with a view to taking steps to restrain what is probably a trespass and certainly a nuisance. There may also be sufficient nuisance from noise to enable you to enlist the local authority's Environmental Health Department who can serve a notice requiring abatement of a statutory nuisance under section 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

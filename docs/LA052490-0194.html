			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAM DEFENSIVE SHUFFLE HINGES ON HUMPHERY;  </P> <P> NFL: IF THE FORMER NEW YORK JET CAN HANDLE THE CORNER, JERRY GRAY WILL BE MOVED  TO FREE SAFETY.  </P> <P> In case you have a shorter memory than Fritz Shurmur, the Rams were dead last  in the NFL in pass defense last season. Shurmur, the Rams' defensive  coordinator, had to watch as one of the league's best passing offenses shot  holes in his secondary during practice all week, then had to bear much of the  same Sunday before facing the onslaught of instant replays in the film room.  </P> <P> Shurmur is hardly the only one in the Ram organization who's determined there  won't be a repeat performance in 1990.  </P> <P> The grand scheme hinges on moving cornerback Jerry Gray to free safety, where  he will be free to wreak havoc at will, like San Francisco 49er Ronnie Lott.  The Rams are confident Gray can do the job, the question is whether or not they  can afford to move him out of the cornerback spot.  </P> <P> Bobby Humphery, the veteran cornerback the Rams acquired from the New York Jets  on the first day of the draft for a fifth-round choice, says not to worry. He  says he can help increase the efficiency of the Rams' zone defense and ease his  new coaches into a comfort zone at the same time.  </P> <P> Heck, he's already making an impact.  </P> <P> Ram Coach John Robinson: "We're very pleased with what we've seen so far."  </P> <P> Said Shurmur: "We are absolutely elated with the way he's performing."  </P> <P> Humphery may have been inexpensive, but this was not a capricious,  Let's-Make-a-Deal move by the Rams. They spent more time in the film room than  a movie mogul.  </P> <P> After the trade, Dick Steinberg, the Jets' new general manager, said Humphery  was a player who had peaked. But the Rams scoffed at that; they figured they  knew a lot more about Humphery than a GM who'd been on the job for three weeks.  </P> <P> "We tried to be certain when we made the call to try and get him that we knew  what we were getting," Shurmur said. "And we haven't been a bit disappointed. I  observe him out there and see the vast strides he's made in learning our system  already, and I can't find any area in which we're disappointed.  </P> <P> "We finished the season with a hole. LeRoy (Irvin) was leaving and we had some  young corners who had to develop quickly. We were uncertain. We were looking  for a guy who knew how to play corner, a player for our young guys to look at  and see how it's done."  </P> <P> Humphery played a lot of bump-and-run, man-to-man defense in New York and is  having to adjust to the Rams' zone-oriented defense. Shurmur says it's much  easier to make the transition from man to zone than the other way around, but  Humphery isn't so sure.  </P> <P> "Actually, I think it's harder to go from man-to-man to zone," he said. "Now,  you're playing an area instead of a person. You have to get to an area and know  how to protect that area instead of just following a man anywhere he goes. But  I think it's a pretty small transition. It's not a problem."  </P> <P> Robinson says the Rams might be willing to meet Humphery halfway, anyway.  </P> <P> "He's working on learning right now," Robinson said, "but we will adapt our  style to fit his a little, too, I'm sure."  </P> <P> At the moment, Humphery just wants to prove he belongs. In the fall, however,  he'll be trying to send a message back East.  </P> <P> "First, I just want to make sure the coaches are comfortable with putting me at  left corner and show the guys on this team that I deserve to be a part of it,"  Humphery said. "But there is another challenge that I welcome. I want to come  out here and prove to some people out in New York that I can still play."  </P> <P> The Rams, of course, are counting on it.  </P> <P> Quarterback Rick Johnson, signed by the Rams Wednesday, admits that he's "an  absolute longshot" to hang on with the team, but said he was going to stay in  the L.A. area and retire from football to pursue an acting career, anyway.  </P> <P> "I've had three movie roles and a spot on 'Dallas,' and I wasn't going to go  back to Canada," said Johnson, who played the past five seasons in the Canadian  Football League after spending two years in the USFL.  </P> <P> He also said his acting career had taught him a lesson about persevering in the  face of overwhelming odds.  </P> <P> "The deck is stacked, but I won't let it get me down," Johnson said. "And I  have a little extra incentive here, too. Chuck Long and I went to the same high  school (Wheaton North in Chicago) and every time I go back there, all I hear  about is Chuck Long, Chuck Long. They even have a Chuck Long Day at the high  school.  </P> <P> "I was the first guy from that school to make it to the pros, even if it was  only the USFL. Chuck graduated two years after me."  </P> <P> Johnson figures to lose out to Long and/or Mark Herrmann in the battle for the  job as Jim Everett's understudy, but maybe his role as Roger the masseur in  "Dallas" will be revived.  </P> <P> The only J.R. around Rams Camp, of course, is John Robinson, and it didn't take  Johnson much time to find out who's the leading man in uniform.  </P> <P> Asked to list his strengths as a quarterback, Johnson said, "I have a quick  release and I used to think I had a strong arm . . . until I saw Jim Everett  throw today."  </P></p>

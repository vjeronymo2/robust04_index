			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sofia DUMA in Bulgarian on 4 June  carries on pages 9 and 10 the text of the approximately  12,000-word report that Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Supreme  Council of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), delivered on the  first day of the 41st BSP Congress in Sofia on 3 June. The  report, which appears under the heading "Bulgaria Faces a New  Choice," is "on the political line of the BSP." In his opening  words, Videnov stresses that the aim of the 41st congress is "to  initiate a new political line in the party's life -- a line of  direct commitment of the Socialists to solving the immense  problems facing Bulgarian society."    In his introduction, having noted the unexpected  difficulties  of the transition to democracy, Videnov says that "our society  today faces a new choice: either to allow the present  uncontrolled state of economic anarchy, rising corruption, and  gross violation of the law to continue" or "to restore the  manageability of the economy in combination with the principles  of free economic initiative." He reiterates the BSP's support  of the reforms, but says that the strategy followed so far has  been erroneous, as it was "based on civil confrontation," for  which the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) carries most of the  blame.    In the first main section of his report, under the  subheading  "The BSP in the Institutions of Power," Videnov briefly reviews  the political developments in the period since the 40th BSP  Congress in 1991, which began by the SDS and Rights and Freedoms  Movement (DPS) imposing "an extremist formula of government,"  with the "new SDS nomenklatura" implementing "a  restorational, repressive, and revanchist policy in parliament,  the government, the Presidency, local government, the judiciary,  and the media." This prompted the BSP, "not without certain  hesitations," to support the Berov nonparty government of  experts. He admits that the Berov administration has achieved  only partial success in implementing the reforms, but stresses  that it "proved sufficiently strong in parliament (and chiefly  in society) to oppose with a solid majority the SDS claims for  confrontational, monopolist power based on force."    Videnov then turns to the economic crisis, giving figures on  the drastic fall in production in all spheres since 1989,  accompanied by falling living standards and inevitable social  tension. He asks how the social cost of the transition can be  made bearable for the population and whether "the lost of public  support for the reforms can be overcome." In seeking answers,  he states six "principled conclusions and lessons": First, "any  reform program in the socioeconomic sphere is doomed to failure  without broad public support"; second, "the sharp political  confrontation and primitive politicizing of economic problems  paralyze the work of the institutions and block the necessary  structural changes"; third, the crisis cannot be resolved  "through measures of a monetary nature, especially in shock  form"; fourth, the transition from a centralized to a market  economy must be carried out "gradually and following the  principle of continuity"; fifth, during the crisis, when most  property and means of production are still state owned, "the  state cannot abdicate from its obligation to regulate and adjust  the economic processes"; and sixth, "the entire potential of the  nation must be mobilized to find a new philosophy for the  economic reform, one most suited to the specific conditions in  Bulgaria." However, Videnov fails to propose any specific  solutions to the current economic problems, confining himself to  generalities such as: "Without a clear strategy for  restructuring a considerable number of large enterprises that  will remain in state ownership in the future, it is impossible  to successfully privatize the rest."    In the next section of his report, subheaded "The Present  Political Crisis and Its Solution Through Elections," the BSP  leader reviews the party's consistent attempts to seek political  dialogue with other parties to agree on "urgently required  measures in the socioeconomic sphere." However, he admits that  the attempts of the BSP and Prime Minister Berov to reach such  an agreement between the parliamentary groups have been  rebuffed. Accordingly, Videnov states, "the BSP Supreme Council  has decided to turn to you, the delegates to the 41st BSP  Congress, with the proposal that you should direct the  activities of the BSP toward holding early parliamentary  elections in October or November this year, so as to realize a  major change in the method of implementing the transition in  Bulgaria." He assures the delegates that the elections will  mean "the rejection of the shock model for the transition, a  clear left-of-center future for Bulgaria... and a clearly  defined political configuration capable of giving Bulgaria the  competent, stable, efficient, government of dialogue that it  needs." Although he admits that to press for early elections  involves certain risks for the BSP, he sees no other solution to  the present political impasse in parliament. He adds that "this  conclusion is also imposed by the grave political situation in  the country, for which homegrown politickers and wheeler-dealers  are to blame." He notes that many of those who have caused the  crisis "are accumulating dirty financial and political dividends  from the difficulties of the crisis." Finally, Videnov sees  elections as the way to avoid "additional severe socioeconomic  risks -- hyperinflation, devaluation of the lev, series of  bankruptcies, and the failure of the budget."    Videnov then proceeds to propose "a change in the model for  the transition." He points out that "the people have every  reason to insist that the social cost of the transition is  bearable" and that "a strong modern left party is needed to  ensure this." In contrast, "the Bulgarian right wing today is  dominated by radical trends that, under the guise of  ultraliberal slogans, are imposing restorational, authoritarian,  and anarchistic views of the transition."    In the section of his report subheaded "On a New  Socioeconomic Policy," Videnov first reiterates that "the BSP  supports building a democratic society based on a social market  economy." He then lists the main points in the Socialists'  socioeconomic program:    First, "Bulgarian production is top priority";    Second, "acceleration of the privatization process,"  promoting "shareholding forms of market privatization, which  presupposes the speedy consolidation and development of the  exchange markets in securities," including promoting "the  purchase of enterprises by workers' collectives," in addition to  "the existing preferences accorded to employees in enterprises  undergoing privatization";    Third, "realism in agrarian policy," combating the  fragmentation of farmland ownership by encouraging the formation  of "voluntarily organized cooperatives, and following the  worldwide practice of subsidizing agricultural production to  maintain its viability";    Fourth, "financial and foreign exchange stabilization," with  emphasis placed "on increasing budget expenditure on direct  investments and preferences for private entrepreneurs with a  view to promoting eventual rises in budget revenue," "finally  settling the problem of enterprises bad debts," and avoiding  "the present tendency to increasingly tie up our financial  balances by taking new loans from foreign sources"; and    Fifth, "an export orientation of the Bulgarian economy and  achieving a positive balance of trade," by such measures as  "moderate and selective protectionism of our internal market" to  give producers the necessary breathing space to become  competitive in the world market; Videnov points out that foreign  capital, though welcome, "can play only an ancillary role and  will come to Bulgaria only when the market situation in Bulgaria  guarantees sufficient profitability."    In the section on social policy, Videnov attacks the "shock  therapy and the liberal model of the reform that is completely  inadequate for Bulgaria and has reduced most of society to  poverty." He says that "the state is called upon to make  adjustments to the market mechanisms... to guarantee a certain  distribution and redistribution of the national income." He  advocates measures against "the price speculation that is  greatly contributing to the decline in the population's  purchasing power." The BSP's "active investment policy will  help to create new jobs in all spheres," Videnov says. He also  promises proper compensation for pensioners and supports the  establishment of independent pension funds and help for families  and children.    The next section of the report is entitled "The Political  System of Society -- Toward Restoration or Modernization?"  Videnov notes that "for Bulgaria, the `velvet resolution' of  1989 proved to be a step backward because it returned the  country to the doomed confrontational models of the past."  "Today," he says, "most Bulgarian parties consist of coteries  without a social basis that are not representative and have no  sense of responsibility." Videnov claims that the political  system should include the following seven elements: "social  democracy as the basis of the new politics"; "decentralization  and self-government"; "socialization in economic life,"  including "a decisive decentralization of ownership sand its  just distribution and social privatization" that "puts a great  part of the social production funds in the hands of their  creators"; following a "responsible left policy" to prevent the  risk of the restoration of authoritarianism; "a radical reform  of the legal system"; "democratization of the media"; and equal  social access to culture.    In the section entitled "BSP -- a New Party," Videnov  considers the changes that have occurred and are still taking  place in the BSP. He summarizes the main ideas that now guide  the party activities as follows:    1. "The BSP does not regard power as an aim in itself but as  a means for developing a free, just, and cohesive society."  Videnov claims that the Socialists realize that "power does not  oppose the civic society but supports its manifestations and  protects the social, intellectual, and economic autonomy of the  individual...."    2. The BSP is a firm supporter of the parliamentary system,  and its "indisputable feature is deep respect for the  Constitution and the laws, its political partners and opponents,  and readiness to conduct an open and equal dialogue with all  political formations...."    3. The BSP remains a party of the masses.    4. Replacement of leaders. Videnov draws attention to "the  complete replacement of leading figures in the BSP in recent  years, and the radical renewal of the leading organs, ranging  from the municipal organizations to the Supreme Council."    5. Democratization of the BSP. Videnov claims that "the BSP  today can convincingly be assessed as a party with developed and  expanding democratic principles within itself and as a party of  active pluralism of ideas."    In the penultimate section of his report, Videnov dwells at  length on the continuous intense ideological debate that has  taken place within the party since the 40th congress, claiming  that it serves as proof of the party's vitality and democratic  nature and noting that despite sharp debates on the various  draft versions of the new BSP program, the party has managed to  preserve its unity.    In conclusion, Videnov notes that "in the face of the  antisocialist propaganda campaign, relying on insinuations,  lies, and manipulations, the BSP counters by offering its own  honest analysis and sincere desire for change." He calls upon  the party "before the crucial elections, to strive to develop  its potential for social dialogue." "We have the moral  strength," he says, "and we have political grounds to seek a new  public vote of confidence, so as to assume our national  responsibilities."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--(Petra)--His Royal Highness Crown Prince  Hasan on Wednesday called on Muslim and Christian scholars to  promote the scope of Christian-Muslim dialogue and to highlight  Islam's position vis-a-vis Jerusalem.    Addressing a three-day meeting on Jerusalem which ended at  the King 'Abdallah Mosque Wednesday, Prince Hasan said scholars  also had the duty to clarify Islam's positive relations with the  Christians throughout the ages.    The meeting coincided with preparations by some people (in  the west) to observe the 3,000th year of "founding" Jerusalem,  Prince Hasan said.    "We have to discuss and prove by science and research that  Jerusalem existed before David and after him," the Crown Prince  said. "We do not talk about this in mere rhetorics or in an  emotional manner. We seek to remind the world of the historic  eras which are linked together starting from the Cannanites and  the other Arabs," the Crown Prince said in an address to the 40  scholars gathered at Basman Palace.    "I wanted to talk to you today about what we can call divine  sovereignty over Jerusalem that does not conflict with political  sovereignty. I would like to point out that divine sovereignty  derives its dignity and esteem from its value and from the  morals of the faithful who believe in it," Prince Hasan said.  "In this context, we can only express pride in the Al al-Bayt  University, which is due to embark on the experiment of setting  up an institute for Christian studies," he noted.    "We hope this institute, (the first of its kind in the  region), would yield good results because we believe that the  time has come for the world to realise that this nation has  always been oriented towards promoting culture," the Crown  Prince said.    Addressing the delegates, Prince Hasan said: "You have to  enhance the concept of the holiness of the city of Jerusalem and  promote dialogue among the religions and reaffirm the status of  the Holy City for the Christians and Muslims.    "We are facing a historic moment entitled `survival of the  more competent' in expression and best in presenting reason in  dialogue. I believe that the media in particular have a role to  play but without much rhetorics and excessive emotions.    "We have to conduct a dialogue that caters to the spirit of  the modern age and we have to be aware of our rights and  highlight them.    "Our dialogue could be emotional, but it should have reason  and responsibility, especially as we mourn our martyrs who fell  in the Hebron massacre. We have to direct our reason and  dialogue in a true and scientific manner away from selfishness  and we should not allow weakness to be the sole method of  expression because this would lead to counter-violence devoid of  reason.    "Through your courage and wisdom you can encourage people to  resort to reason and positive thinking and can enhance the  spirit of wisdom as we strive to remind the world of the  greatness of Islam and the greatness of the Arab Muslim  Christian project. Remember that Jerusalem is in need of your  efforts under the current difficult circumstances."    Several speakers among the delegates addressed the meeting,  focusing on the importance of Christian-Islamic dialogue.    Field Marshal 'Abd al-Rahman Siwar al-Dhahab of Sudan paid  tribute to His Majesty King Husayn's devotion and dedication to  safeguarding the holy places in Jerusalem.    He noted that the King sold part of his personal property in  order to finance the restoration of the holy sites in Jerusalem.    The scholars who took part in the three-day meeting,  organised by the general Islamic Congress for Jerusalem, issued  a statement at the end of their conference denouncing American  policies for their disregard of the international resolutions  regarding Jerusalem.    The statement condemned American policies, which "express  Zionism's ambitions and intentions to seize the Holy City and  make it the united capital of Israel."    The statement also rejected the American stand vis-a-vis the  Hebron massacre and Washington's "opposition to a resolution  that would have condemned Israel's terrorism."    It deplored Washington's retreat from the U.N. Security  Council resolution that considered Jerusalem as part of the  occupied territories and not a disputed land.    The statement called on the Arab and Islamic countries to  unify their rank and adopt a collective position with regard to  "the issues of destiny, foremost of which the issue of  Jerusalem."    It called on the Arabs and Muslims to "defend Arab and  islamic rights in the face of Zionism's expansionist and  aggressive plots."    The statement urged Muslims and Christians to "promote their  dialogue, encourage tolerance and solidarity among the faithful  and set up a special fund for the reconstruction of Jerusalem."</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: THE REAGANS AND THE HOMELESS PROBLEM  </P> <P> * Reagan Redux: San Diego radio talk show host Michael Reagan says his father,  Ronald Reagan, and stepmother, Nancy, are distraught about the latest broadside  from daughter Patti Davis -- a magazine article in which she blames the Reagan  presidency for exacerbating the homeless problem. "If she wasn't writing  articles and books about her father, she would probably be homeless herself  because that's how she's making her money," Michael, the adopted son of Reagan  and Jane Wyman, said.  </P> <P> * Peace Making: Talk-show host Larry King has been invited to a weekend in the  Poconos with the Pennsylvania beauty queen he denounced as ugly on a TV show.  The Tamiment Resort sent Mailgrams to King and Marla Wynne, who made the finals  of the Miss America pageant while King was a judge. The resort's weekend  includes a "love match of tennis," riding a bicycle built for two and dinner  with a special dessert called "Beauty and the Beast." King has apologized for  his remark.  </P> <P> * Book Turn: Cable television mogul Ted Turner's company has released its first  book, "Portrait of Great Britain and Northern Ireland," a glossy, 190-page  coffee-table volume depicting the countries' people and landscapes. The next  Turner book will be "Kisses," celebrating famous kisses of American stars taken  from film classics.  </P> <P> * Double Duty: U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II filed for divorce the same day he  sailed unopposed through the primary election. The Democrat is seeking a third  term representing parts of Boston and nearby Cambridge. On Tuesday, Kennedy and  his wife, Sheila Rauch, filed for a no-fault divorce. The financial and  settlement papers were sealed by the judge. Kennedy, 37, and his wife, 40,  separated in February, 1989, and have twin 9-year-old sons. Kennedy is the  oldest of the 11 children of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Compiled by YEMI TOURE  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Haitian ruler ignores peace plan as fleet gathers LT GEN Raoul Cedras, Haiti's army commander, yesterday ignored demands to respect the United Nations-brokered plan allowing the country's exiled president to return, despite the re-imposition of an international embargo, AP reports from Port-au-Prince. Six US and three Canadian navy ships were offshore to enforce the embargo yesterday, and a French frigate was on the way to join them. Britain said it would send a frigate. Gen Cedras relaxed with aides at army headquarters early yesterday after the midnight deadline for him to comply with the plan passed. News photographers snapped shots of him smoking and joking. Asked what the army would do if US troops came ashore to rescue Americans, he said: 'I'm certain it will not reach such a point.' The embargo aims to compel him to live up to an accord he signed to allow exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to office on October 30. Gen Cedras was a key part of the military coup which overthrew Mr Aristide - Haiti's first popularly elected president - in 1991. The capital, Port-au-Prince, came to life slowly on the first day of the embargo. 'Gas supplies are normal. There's no rationing, yet,' a pump attendant said. Prices remained stable at about Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) a gallon and there were no queues. But schools, government offices and some shops remained closed for a second day on Mr Aristide's orders, to mourn the assassination last week of Mr Guy Malary, the justice minister, who was part of the transition cabinet preparing for Mr Aristide's return. Mr Robert Malval, the prime minister, has blamed military authorities for the murder. The sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council include a ban on oil and petrol shipments, a ban on weapons, and a freezing of overseas assets of Haiti's de facto authorities or 'their agents'. While the blockade could stop tankers, the UN has taken no measures to halt petrol shipments from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. The Dominican government is close to Haiti's army, and previous cross-border embargo violations had been reported. The Haitian military is also believed to have stockpiled several weeks' supply of oil reserves. The dispute has raised tensions in Port-au-Prince. Hundreds of residents have fled to the countryside in anticipation of more army repression or a foreign invasion. Gen Cedras said the solution to the crisis lay in further negotiation, but UN envoy Mr Dante Caputo, the architect of the plan to restore Mr Aristide, rejected that idea.</p>

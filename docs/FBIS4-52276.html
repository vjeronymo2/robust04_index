			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul district civil  court on Friday dismissed a defamation suit filed by  Chongukyonhap, or the National Alliance for Democracy and  Unification, against President Kim Yong-sam.    Judge O Se-ip threw out the suit by the alliance, which was  seeking 300 million won in compensation from the president for  alleged damages caused by Kim's description of it as an  organization sympathetic to communism during the presidential  election campaign in 1992.    "The alliance, as an unincorporated association, is not  entitled to bring a civil suit," O said.    "Even though the alliance had the outward appearance of  being  an organization with a name, an organizational network and  operational functions, it could not be a plaintiff in a civil  suit because it was not incorporated as an association," he said.    The alliance had accused Kim Yong-sam of "wrongly damaging"  its reputation by describing its member organizations as  followers of North Korean President Kim Il-song's "chuche"  ideology.    The alliance filed the suit on Jan. 12, 1993.</p>

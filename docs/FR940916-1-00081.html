			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FRA Conclusions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA believes that the current training provided to the individuals charged with performing the required brake tests and inspections should be improved in order to ensure that these tests and inspections are performed properly. Several labor organizations and their individual members explicitly commented that they are not sufficiently trained to perform the inspections and tests required of them. In addition, several railroads affirmed that the training they currently provide could be improved. Increasing reliance on train crews to conduct train air brake tests, as a result of the consolidation of mechanical forces, means that it is more important than ever before that each person responsible for power brake safety be thoroughly trained in the functions which that person is called upon to perform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA recognizes that many railroads are attempting to improve their training programs; however, FRA thinks that minimum training and experience guidelines need to be established to assure that brake inspections and tests are being properly performed in order to protect both the public and railroad employees from the operation of equipment not meeting FRA requirements. Although there has been a decline in the number of train accidents, derailments, fatalities, and injuries over the last ten years, FRA believes that the number of these incidents will be further reduced if inspections and tests of the brake system are performed by individuals who have been instructed in accordance with these minimum training and experience guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, FRA proposes broad performance-based qualification requirements for individuals that perform brake system inspections and tests; individuals that inspect, test, and maintain the electronic and mechanical parts of the brake system; and individuals that supervise the work of the aforementioned personnel. FRA will supplement these performance-based qualification standards by issuing minimum training and experience guidelines that will aid the railroads in developing training programs sufficient to ensure that individuals are capable of meeting the performance-based qualification standards. FRA believes that each railroad should be allowed to develop and implement a program to train, qualify, and issue credentials to these individuals in accordance with these minimum requirements based on each railroad's own unique operating conditions and equipment. Furthermore, in order to insure that quality inspections, tests, and maintenance are continually being performed, FRA believes that periodic spot checks of inspections and maintenance should be performed by qualified supervisory personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc to sell additives unit RHONE-Poulenc, France's largest chemical group, plans to sell Societe Francaise d'Organao Sythese, its specialty chemicals subsidiary, to Great Lakes Chemicals group, the Indiana-based company. Terms were not announced. The subsidiary, which manufactures additives for lubricants and polymers, has a turnover of FFr525m (Dollars 107.1m). It employs about 340 at its Paris head office and two production sites at Persan (Val d'Oise) and Catenoy (Oise). Rhone-Poulenc, which warned last week it would not reach its target of more than 20 per cent earnings growth, said the business was no longer in line with its main strategic orientations. The sale is part of a Rhone-Poulenc's substantial disposal programme. In February, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, group chairman, said he hoped to raise as much as FFr3bn from disposals this year and between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn in 1993. The aim is to cut the group's debt to equity ratio from 0.78 at the end of last year to about 0.5 in 1993. Great Lakes, which specialises in bromochemicals and fuel additives, is expanding rapidly in Europe. Last month it paid Dollars 21m for the remaining 50 per cent it did not own of Octel Kuhlmann, a French gasoline additive business, which was a joint-venture with Rhone-Poulenc and Elf Atochem of France.</p>

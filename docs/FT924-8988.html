			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Books: Patients with talent FREUD'S WOMEN by Lisa Appignanesi and John Forrester Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 25, 563 pages WOMEN were crucial to Freud's life and work. His earliest women patients effectively invented psychoanalysis, and the psychoanalytic profession owed its rise, spread, and in time some of its most decisive transformations, to women who began as Freud's patients and later became analysts in their own right. The story is absorbingly told by John Forrester and Lisa Appignanesi, who marry an illuminating and highly readable 'psychobiography' of Freud with an account of the development of his theories. The women who figure large in Freud's life each get their own skilfully wrought biographical sketches. The closing chapters contain a discussion of Freud's views on women and women's views on Freud, particularly the recent all-out attack on psychoanalysis mounted by feminism. The book's careful tapestry of biographical and expository concerns are nimbly woven. It is one of those rare productions: a book hard to put down. But undoubtedly some of it - principally, the authors' analysis of Freud himself - will provoke controversy, especially within and among the quarrelsome tribes of Freudians, Kleinians and other descendants of the master. Even an amateur reader, of the sort occasionally apt to gasp at Freudian absurdities, can detect the authors' provocative stance. For example: Freud recalled, during self-analysis, a childhood incident in which he snatched flowers from a girl. 'To take flowers from a girl,' he mused, 'means to deflower her'. For Forrester and Appignanesi defloration becomes a key metaphor for analysis itself; analysis is penetration to depths beyond a veil of innocence. Whether one agrees with their placing of emphases here and in other cases important for understanding Freud, the tale they tell is riveting. Two of the most significant women in Freud's life, his mother and his wife, are dim presences in the book. This is not the authors' choice. Freud hid his mother behind a screen of sincere but nevertheless conventional filial respect. His wife is hidden too, but this time behind an absurd embargo on the Freud papers which seals them from view for another century. But their shadowiness is more than compensated by the striking presence in the book of other extraordinary women, who in different ways transformed psychoanalysis from an oddity on the medical fringe to an explosive force in 20th century consciousness. Freud always claimed that psychoanalysis was invented by his colleague Josef Breuer while treating a wealthy and beautiful young hysteric. This was Bertha Pappenheim, who effectively created her own therapy in the form of the 'talking cure'. Freud's experience with the woman he called his 'teacher', Anna von Lieben, confirmed this therapeutic possibility. Anna was his patient for six years, and taught him that it takes a talented patient to make a talented analyst. These early patients helped establish the technique of analysis. The theory emerged more slowly. Its painful growth is reflected in the different paths from Freud's couch taken by women as variously brilliant as Helene Deutsch and Lou Andreas-Salome when they became analysts in their own right. A salient example is Princess Marie Bonaparte, who established Freudianism in France. Great-grand-niece of Napoleon and hugely rich, Marie came to be called 'Freud-a-dit' ('Freud said . . ') by French analysts, and engaged in famous battles with Jacques Lacan over Freud's legacy. Freud sometimes likened himself to King Lear. In a major respect the comparison is apt, for his youngest daughter Anna proved crucial both to him and his cause. Although her differences with Melanie Klein over child analysis caused a major split in the analytic movement, Anna's tireless loyalty was central to the defence of Freudian orthodoxy against powerful voices of later dissent and criticism. In recent decades Freud has been the target of swingeing attacks by feminists scornful of his claims that girls suffer 'penis-envy' and that vaginal orgasm supersedes clitoral orgasm in the mature woman. Nevertheless, Freud's thought was a major factor in the openness which gave feminism renewed impetus in the 20th century. For this, and for the many ways in which his thought has illuminated the inner human landscape, Freud's achievement is astonishing. By locating it in the pivotal setting of his relations with women Forrester and Appignanesi have added hugely to our understanding of the man and his achievement.</p>

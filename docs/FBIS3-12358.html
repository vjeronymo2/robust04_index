			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Maronite patriarch Butrus Sfayr in Zuq </F> Mikha'il on 27 Feb-- recorded]    [Text] A massacre of this kind is indescribable because it  is very painful. It targeted not only this church but peace  itself not just in Lebanon but in the whole region. Therefore,  we vehemently condemn this massacre and implore God to remove  hatred and prejudice from people's hearts. The criminals should  respect human lives that belong to God and not to them. Those  who perpetrated this act have lost a great part of their  humanity. We invoke God to instill peace in people's hearts in  this homeland and in the region.</p>

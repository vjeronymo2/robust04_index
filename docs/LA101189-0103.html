			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> K MART UNVEILS PLANS TO ADD 700 STORES IN $1.3-BILLION EXPANSION  </P> <P> K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini on Tuesday outlined a major  $1.3-billion expansion plan designed to double sales and profits at the  second-largest U.S. retailer and burnish its image.  </P> <P> Antonini told a news conference that the expansion would be the biggest for the  Troy, Mich.-based company since the 1970s.  </P> <P> K mart, No. 2 behind Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. of Chicago, plans to add about  700 stores through 1995 to its current roster of 2,275 K mart discount stores.  </P> <P> The retailer also operates 1,815 specialty stores selling books, drugs,  hardware and other goods.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants to Overtake Sears  </P> <P> K mart, outlining its five-year strategy, told analysts last week that it was  confident about its prospects for growth.  </P> <P> The company has been seeking to improve profits and overtake Sears as the  nation's largest retailer.  </P> <P> But profit in the first half of 1989 fell nearly 16% to $239.1 million as  revenue grew about 4% to $13.07 billion.  </P> <P> Antonini said in a speech Friday that the retailer's expansion plans are  designed to yield sales of more than $50 billion by 1995.  </P> <P> Analysts said K mart is targeting annual net income of $1.75 billion by the  mid-1990s.  </P> <P> Last year, K mart reported earnings of $803 million on sales of $27.3 billion.  </P> <P> Regarding the expansion program, Antonini said Tuesday that K mart will open 85  to 100 new stores and an additional 100 stores will be expanded each year  through 1995.  </P> <P> He had indicated to analysts that an average of 20 to 30 of the stores will be  replacements for small K mart outlets.  </P> <P> Antonini said capital expenditures of about $1.3 billion will be allocated for  the expansion program.  </P> <P> K mart also expects a positive fourth quarter, which includes the all-important  Christmas shopping season, when many retailers post most of their profits.  </P> <P> "We don't expect a very troublesome fourth quarter," he said. Antonini said his  optimism is because the fall season is "shaping up better than anticipated."  </P> <P> Antonini said the company bases its projection in part on the fact that  inflation remains under control and interest rates appear not to be too high.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Change in Media Mix  </P> <P> The company last week said it expected to report a decline in third-quarter  earnings from the year-earlier's $126.1 million.  </P> <P> In his remarks to analysts, Antonini said K mart's strategy also includes:  </P> <P> * Creation of dominant life style departments.  </P> <P> * More centralized merchandising.  </P> <P> * Increased emphasis on everyday low prices.  </P> <P> * Major capital investment in automation.  </P> <P> * Growth and experimentation in non-discount store businesses.  </P> <P> Antonini also said the company is putting more emphasis on television  advertising, cutting back slightly on print advertising.  </P> <P> K mart stock closed down 25 cents a share at $38.50 in New York Stock Exchange  trading.  </P></p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Matra in asset swop with Fiat subsidiary MATRA, the French telecommunications-to-transport group, yesterday agreed to exchange assets with the French subsidiary of Fiat, the Italian carmaker, as part of a strategy of focusing on its mainstream businesses. Matra is to hand to Fiat France its 35 per cent stake in Ufima, a maker of automotive components which is already 65 per cent owned by Magnetti Marelli, Fiat's components offshoot. Magnetti Marelli has nine plants in France employing 5,000 people, generating FFr3.5bn sales (Dollars 640m), equivalent to 22 per cent of its total turnover. In exchange, Fiat France is to hand to Matra its 13.72 per cent stake in Labinal, a French producer of gas turbines, aerospace components and electrical connectors. On top of this, Fiat France is to pay Matra FFr40m, to make up for the difference in value between the two share stakes. Matra has been reorganising its business portfolio recently, with the sale of a large minority stake in its telecommunications business last July to Northern Telecom of Canada. Matra said yesterday that the disposal of its Ufima stake was in line with its decision to get out of automotive electronics, no longer seen as of strategic interest to the group. Compagnie Generale Maritime (CGM), the French state-owned freight transport group, said its holding company, CGMF, would sell the 65.25 per cent stake it has in Financiere de l'Atlantique to Compagnie d'Investissements et de Participations (CIP), a holding company, Reuter reports from Paris.</p>

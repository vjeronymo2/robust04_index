			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINDING NEW LIFE AFTER A BRUTAL DEATH;  </P> <P> LEGACY: CAROL STUART WAS MURDERED, BUT ALL OF BOSTON BLED. NOW A FOUNDATION SET  UP IN HER NAME HAS RECEIVED A FLOOD OF RESPONSES.  </P> <P> The donations to the Carol DiMaiti Stuart Foundation Inc. have come in small  increments, often as little as $5. With the checks come prayers and letters  that tear at the emotions of a family that has already seen its heart ripped to  shreds.  </P> <P> "I am 70 years old and living on a fixed income, otherwise my check would be  for a larger amount," wrote a woman who enclosed $10. "I had a beautiful  26-year-old daughter who was murdered by her husband, and I believe I know the  heartache of her family."  </P> <P> Another couple sent in an equally sad story along with their $10 check. "My  wife and I lost our 18-year-old son in December, 1984. He was shot to death,  and his girlfriend was raped. They have never found his killer, and after five  years, we still live with this every day."  </P> <P> Sometimes the donations are more lavish. David Rockefeller Jr., a Cambridge  resident, gave $1,000. Vice President Dan Quayle sent $150. Gov. Michael  Dukakis sent $50 and invited the DiMaiti family to lunch. Rep. Barney Frank,  the Democratic congressman from Brookline who has had troubles of his own of  late, included this handwritten sentiment with his check for  </P> <P> "The word is overused, so I generally avoid it, but you have done a genuinely  noble thing. We are all in your debt."  </P> <P> Small and large, the gifts to the foundation Carol Stuart's family started in  honor of the woman whose bizarre murder last October shocked the city have  "gone beyond our wildest dreams," her brother, Carl DiMaiti, said here Monday.  Since it was announced just a month ago, the Carol DiMaiti Stuart Foundation  has amassed more than $270,000.  </P> <P> "We are just amazed by the positive response we have received," said DiMaiti,  37. "We get bags and bags of mail. Caring letters, personal letters. Letters  from people we have never met, some of whom tell us that they, too, have lost  sons or daughters."  </P> <P> Does it help? Carl DiMaiti was asked.  </P> <P> "It helps," he said. "It definitely helps."  </P> <P> Like almost everyone who heard the story, which received national attention,  the DiMaiti family at first accepted Charles Stuart's account that he and his  wife, Carol, had been abducted by a black gunman who leaped into their car as  they were leaving a childbirth class and later shot the couple, killing Carol  and seriously wounding her husband. The crime, which occurred in Boston's  racially mixed Mission Hill area, stirred fears of urban violence and summoned  up racial anger and tension.  </P> <P> Carol Stuart was 7 1/2 months pregnant when she died. Delivered prematurely by  Cesarean section, her son Christopher lived for 17 days after the assault.  </P> <P> From his hospital bed, Charles Stuart wrote a tender, moving letter to his wife  that was read at her funeral. Later, he recovered sufficiently from his wounds  to view a police lineup and identify a suspect, Willie Bennett, as looking most  like the man Stuart said shot him and killed his wife.  </P> <P> But then Stuart himself became a suspect in the crime. His younger brother  Matthew told police that he had been at the crime scene, and he had picked up a  bag containing a revolver and Carol Stuart's handbag. Matthew Stuart said when  he got home and opened the handbag, he found jewelry that included his  sister-in-law's engagement ring. On Jan. 4, Charles Stuart plunged to his death  from a bridge over Boston Harbor, an apparent suicide.  </P> <P> The sensational case is now under investigation by a grand jury, which this  week heard testimony from several of Charles Stuart's five brothers and  sisters. In addition, charges of racial harassment by Boston police against  early suspects in the case -- all of them black -- have brought the FBI into  the matter.  </P> <P> Carl DiMaiti said his family has had no contact with the Stuart family since  Charles Stuart's death. He said he would have no comment on the grand jury's  inquiry.  </P> <P> Few people would have blinked if the DiMaiti family had chosen to turn its back  on the whole sad saga. But three weeks after Charles Stuart's death, the  DiMaitis called a press conference at which their lawyer, Marvin N. Geller,  announced the formation of a scholarship fund in Carol DiMaiti Stuart's memory.  In an effort to "promote better race relations throughout the city and greater  Boston," the foundation will grant college scholarships to students from the  Mission Hill area, where Carol Stuart was killed.  </P> <P> Reading from a statement the family prepared together the night before,  64-year-old Giusto DiMaiti, a former pasta salesman, lauded his daughter as  "truly the brightest of lights in our lives, a light that will never go out in  our minds. . . .  </P> <P> "All she ever wanted," Giusto DiMaiti read as his wife, Evelyn, 58, fought back  tears beside him, "was to be a good daughter, wife and mother and be happy in  her life."  </P> <P> Were she able to see the outpouring in her memory, Carol Stuart "would cry,"  her brother said Monday. Seven years his junior, Carol Stuart wore her emotions  close to her sleeve, he said.  </P> <P> Like his late sister, Carl DiMaiti, a former high school teacher and track  coach who now owns a wholesale pizza company, has a big, ready smile that seems  particularly forthcoming when he is talking about Carol. But he also confessed  to a hint of big-brotherly bullying when it came to his little sister's special  blend of constant cheer and easy tears.  </P> <P> "To torture her as a kid, I would make her watch things like 'Wuthering  Heights,' " DiMaiti said, and laughed.  </P> <P> In some ways, DiMaiti said, it would have been easier for his family to "just  put the nightmare behind us, pretend that it never existed, at least publicly."  </P> <P> But "walking away was never really an option," the son who has become the  family spokesman said. Until this week, when he agreed to discuss the  foundation but not the crime in which his sister was killed, even Carl DiMaiti  has refused interviews. His parents have still chosen to remain in seclusion.  </P> <P> "We have a moral obligation to Carol," DiMaiti said. "There's just too much to  say about her that existed prior to that one night."  </P> <P> DiMaiti said he and his parents bristle, for example, when they hear Carol  Stuart "pigeonholed" as "a yuppie, an upwardly mobile lawyer." It is true that  she graduated in the top one-third of her class at Boston's Suffolk Law School,  DiMaiti said, "but she also had huge loans when she got done." All through law  school, he pointed out, she worked as a waitress at a bar and lounge in the  blue-collar town of Revere. It was while working there in the year after  graduating from Boston College that she met Charles Stuart, then a young  dishwasher and assistant chef.  </P> <P> Even while working her way through law school, his sister was "a studyholic,"  DiMaiti said. Her efforts were especially appreciated, he added, by a father  who "went way beyond adoration" in the way he loved his only daughter.  </P> <P> "Listen, my father used to carry her report card around in his wallet," DiMaiti  said.  </P> <P> Still, DiMaiti said, the family never even considered establishing a  scholarship at Boston College or at Suffolk Law School.  </P> <P> "We just thought it could do the greatest amount of good in Mission Hill," he  explained.  </P> <P> In the wake of her murder and of the tensions aroused by the tale of racial  crime that Charles Stuart spun, "I think there's an unspoken bond between us  and the residents of Mission Hill," DiMaiti said. "An unspoken bond as  victims."  </P> <P> More than simply memorializing his sister, DiMaiti said he hopes the  scholarship fund might help to heal the wounds suffered by the community as a  whole.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be so presumptuous as to think this is the end-all," he said of the  foundation, whose exact workings have yet to be determined. "But it may help."  </P> <P> The gesture may help his family as well, he said. Calling the family's  involvement with the foundation cathartic, he said, "I think this has given us  a different focus. It's not that anything is over, but that there is a new  beginning.  </P> <P> "Carol is gone, there's nothing we can do about that, but there is something we  can do" to help keep her spirit alive.  </P> <P> Before the foundation was announced, DiMaiti said the family was racked by  doubts. "We asked ourselves all those questions: 'How can this be happening to  us? How can we have been so naive? How can she have been so naive, because she  was such a smart girl?' "  </P> <P> By shifting their attention and their energy to the foundation, DiMaiti said,  he and his parents have let go of some of those painful feelings. "We have a  commitment to stay here and see this through," he said. When the foundation  does begin issuing grants to the young people of Mission Hill, he went on, "I  think every student who receives a scholarship will remind my parents of  Carol."  </P> <P> Sometimes, DiMaiti said, he still battles the anger he felt when he learned  that his brother-in-law's story of a black gunman was pure fabrication, and  that Charles Stuart may have pulled the trigger himself.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine going to the hospital to see him?" he asked incredulously.  "Can you imagine comforting him? That's what I find so mind-boggling now."  </P> <P> But he acknowledges that such feelings are part of the "roller coaster" his  family has been on since last October.  </P> <P> "You think your faith in mankind can't get any lower," he said. And then, with  the flood of support the foundation has experienced, "you get pumped up. But  never back to the same level. You know it will never be the same."  </P> <P> But Carl DiMaiti obviously shares his late sister's sunny insistence that a  smile will brighten any darkness.  </P> <P> "I know I keep coming back to this, but this is the only positive thing we  could do out of all this," DiMaiti said.  </P> <P> "I think that gives us a tendency to hold onto it even harder."  </P></p>

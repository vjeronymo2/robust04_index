			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Yeltsin survives vote in congress to impeach him: Russian president strengthens his position - Deputies fail to unseat Khasbulatov MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday survived a vote by the Congress of Peoples' Deputies to impeach him. His rival, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, survived a simultaneous vote of no confidence. In a secret ballot, deputies cast 617 votes in favour of impeaching Yeltsin, short of the 689 required to remove him from office. It said about 400 members voted to oust Mr Khasbulatov, below the 517 needed for his dismissal. The attempt to remove both men was a furious reaction by the Russian parliament to an overnight compromise agreement by the two arch-rivals which would have called early elections and abolished the legislature. The vote against Mr Yeltsin's impeachment appears to mean that he retains the special powers he declared for himself last week. Under these powers, his decrees and instructions can be challenged only by the Constitutional Court and not by parliament. Mr Yeltsin drew strength yesterday from a rally of about 60,000 supporters, which gathered behind St Basil's Cathedral, just outside the walls of the Kremlin. He addressed them soon after a compromise offer had failed. He said he would 'not submit to any decision of the Congress to impeach me'. The rally, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, Mr Genady Burbulis, the former presidential aide and others, heard Mr Gavril Popov, leader of the Movement for Democratic Reform, say that: 'We're living badly because we're conducting the reforms badly. They're trying to turn out the president because he wants to deepen the reforms - but the people won't let them.' A rival gathering of some 10,000 nationalists and communists rallied on the Manezh Square to hear a succession of calls for the impeachment of the president. In contrast to the pro-Yeltsin rally, this was heavily policed, with mounted militia, armoured cars and water cannons ringing the relatively small group. It is the first Congress for over a year from which Mr Yeltsin has emerged strengthened, with no muddled compromise constraining his actions. However, on Saturday he had used his promised plebiscite on trust in the president on April 25, which he had represented as a critical opportunity to listen to the voices of the people, as a bargaining chip: he offered to cancel the plebiscitein exchange for an election in November for the president and a new two-tier parliament. However, deputies rejected this compromise - agreed between Mr Yeltsin, Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister - and then proceeded to vote themselves the right to ballot on the future of both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov. The speaker, who had made several dramatic turnabouts over the past few days, finally aroused the ire of the deputies who - according to one - had 'grown plain sick of him'. Several dangerous elements remain: The president and the parliament are now more bitterly opposed than ever. Deprived of the opportunity to impeach him by parliamentray means, hard line opponents will be tempted increasingly to turn to extra-parliamentary protest. The Congress passed a resolution taking control of TV and radio into its hands, by demanding the right to appoint supervising committees over all the stations with the right of appointment of the chairmen and of interference in programmes. Mr Yeltsin's main argument for his actions, underscored on Saturday by Mr Chernomyrdin, is the 'catastrophic' state of the economy and the need for rapid action. However, these actions will weaken his still impressive popularity and give extra support to his opponents. The president will be tempted, in the period to the April 25 plebiscite, to pass measures which will increase support in him by paying out extra beneftis. Jurek Martin, US Editor, adds from Washington: Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, yesterday said the US would be 'very steady' in its support of reform in Russia, of which 'by far the best exponent is Boris Yeltsin'. Interviewed on TV as the Russian parliament voted on the impeachment motion, he said Mr Yeltsin was right to have called a plebiscite.

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Women 'suffer race bias at work' Ms Jennifer Francis, a former 'black businesswoman of the year', was not surprised by the findings of a report from the Equal Opportunities Commission yesterday that women from ethnic minorities face widespread discrimination in the workplace and when trying to find jobs. The commission reported that while 6 per cent of white women were unemployed, as many as 16 per cent of ethnic-minority women were unemployed and one-in-three Bangladeshi women was registered as jobless. Ms Francis, an associate director of a London public relations company and a member of several public bodies, including the Radio Authority, said: 'The report mirrors the working experience both of us and our mothers since their emigration to the UK.' Ms Francis, who founded a successful PR company in the 1980s, said: 'Part of my motivation in working for myself has been the desire for independence - and that includes not being vulnerable to problems (that) women, and particularly black women, face in the workplace.' She said that discriminatory attitudes were open, visible and deep-seated. 'For example, when I attend professional conferences the typical attitude of a white male is that I am a secretary or a tea lady.' The report, which drew on the last census, said that women from ethnic minorities faced discrimination because of their sex and their race. Consequently, ethnic minority women were more likely to work longer hours than white women and to work in lower-paid and lower-status jobs. The commission expressed concern about deteriorating job prospects in many occupations. One of the most startling findings was that this higher rate of unemployment existed in spite of the fact that ethnic-minority women were more likely to continue in higher education than their white counterparts. Highly qualified women from ethnic minorities were twice as likely to be unemployed as white women with equivalent qualifications. Black Women in the Labour Market.

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Solicitor to head Serious Fraud Office MR GEORGE STAPLE is to succeed Mrs Barbara Mills QC as director of the Serious Fraud Office. Mrs Mills has been appointed director of public prosecutions after only 16 months at the head of the SFO. Mr Staple, a partner in Clifford Chance, the UK's largest law firm, is largely unknown outside City legal circles and was a surprise choice to spearhead the fight against fraud and white-collar crime. But those who know him well say he has just the right mix of practical, City and managerial experience for the job. Mr William Park, a senior partner at law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines, said Mr Staple had long experience of company and commercial practice, including civil fraud litigation. Mr Staple worked as a Department of Trade and Industry inspector in the Consolidated Gold Fields inquiry in 1986 and the 1988 inquiry into Aldermanbury Trust. Mr Park said Mr Staple's City perspective was probably better than that of his two predecessors at the SFO. Coming from a different culture, he might well have a greater awareness of the real evils in City fraud and its effects on the public. Mr John Clitheroe of Kingsley Napley, a leading defence solicitor, said it was a very imaginative appointment. He hoped Mr Staple could 'work towards an assimilation of the DTI and SFO investigations'. Although Mr Staple has spent most of his time at Clifford Chance doing commercial litigation since he qualified as a solicitor in 1964, Mr Nigel Fox Bassett, the firm's senior partner, said he had considerable experience of fraud and white-collar crime in the UK and abroad during a period in the firm's Hong Kong office. Mr Staple is chairman of the authorisation and disciplinary appeal tribunal of the Securities and Futures Association and acts as a legal assessor on the disciplinary committee of the Stock Exchange. Mr Gareth Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, welcomed his appointment and said the Bar was not disappointed that a solicitor rather than a barrister had been selected. Mr Rodger Pannone, whose firm defended Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman, and will be acting for Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International who faces criminal charges, described the choice of Mr Staple, a colleague on the Law Society council, as 'inspired'. Mr Pannone described him as 'a man of great ability, fiscal knowledge and breadth of vision, with tremendous experience of commercial litigation at the highest level.' He added: 'He's also an extremely likeable individual.' Mr Staple has been on the society's governing council since 1986.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 1 (XINHUA) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said here today that South Korea and the  United States have not yet reached a decision on conducting an  annual Team Spirit joint military exercise.    "We are continuing to discuss with the United States  concerning the Team Spirit `94, and we have not yet reached a  decision," Han told reporters at a press conference after  meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.    Han stressed that "we are prepared to deal with this issue  through dialogue and by peaceful means."    The U.S. administration decided on March 19 to resume the  joint military exercise with South Korean forces after the talks  between South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea failed over the issue of nuclear inspections and the  exchange of envoys.    "There is no final decision on when to have it," Han noted,  "the question on Team Spirit is still be discussed between the  two governments."    Han also said the UN Security Council president's statement  yesterday "represents a big diplomatic step toward dealing with  this North Korean nuclear issue."</p>

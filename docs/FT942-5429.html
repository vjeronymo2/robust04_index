			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mood change for bourses ahead of US data A bigger than expected fall in US unemployment was one of the prospects which European markets feared most earlier this week. But when it happened, the bourses had changed their mood, writes Our Markets Staff. US establishment figures did their best to calm any fears that might have been raised, saying that inflation fears were exaggerated. However, opinion in Europe had been moving that way by mid-week, and yesterday's reaction merely consolidated an already rising trend in equities. FRANKFURT came back refreshed from a day's leave with the Dax index 18.69 better at 2,148.39, 34.77 ahead of Wednesday's depressed post-bourse close. This left it 0.3 per cent up higher on the week but the Ibis-indicated Dax made another 10.49 to end the afternoon at 2,158.88. Kleinwort Benson said on Wednesday that a panic in the bond market had put equity prices to the test and pushed them down towards the bottom of their recent trading range. But, said the German team, led by Mr Andrew Thomson and Mr Adrian Phillips, 'with the economy turning and the bullish expectations for equity earnings looking daily more realistic, we see little further downside in prices. Trading remained thin following Thursday's holiday. There were outstanding pockets of strength in financials, where Allianz rose DM38 to DM2,452, and in engineering where Linde, frequently bypassed in favour of more lightly-priced stocks, jumped DM25, or 2.8 per cent to DM925. MAN rose DM7 to DM420.50, and Mannesmann by DM9.50, or 2.2 per cent to DM438.50. On a thin day for corporate news, the construction group, Bilfinger &amp; Berger, climbed DM19 to DM779 ahead of next week's results. AMSTERDAM was lifted through buying of financial stocks, with ABN Amro and ING both rising Fl 1.50 to Fl 62.40 and Fl 77.60 respectively, as the AEX index put on 3.29 to 403.03, barely changed on the week. Unilever advanced 50 cents to Fl 191.70 on news that the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group was to drop two court cases against Procter &amp; Gamble. The dispute had arisen between the two companies regarding a new detergent. MILAN remained quiet, as it has done for the past couple of sessions. Volume, apparently, was lower than average. The Comit index closed up 1.44 at 736.36 for a 0.8 per cent rise on the week. Paribas Capital Markets downgraded the market from overweight to underweight relative to the rest of Europe. In explanation the broker said that while it remained positive on the country's prospects, most of the good news had already been factored into equities. 'Italian equities carry higher risk, since in recent months high levels of fund flows have been the main factor during the market,' it said. Montedison was one of the day's features, up L32 at L1,429 on reports that the European Commission would approve its joint plastics venture with Royal Dutch/Shell. ZURICH could offer itself two explanations as the SMI index eased to register a mere 2.5 gain at 2,728.4, up 0.6 per cent on the week, after a day's high 12 points higher. The conventional one was that Swiss investors took a less sanguine view of US data and interest rate prospects than their neighbours. The other was the possibility of a hidden agenda in Roche, regarded as aggressively oversold in some quarters earlier this week but still seeing its certificates fall another SFr80 to SFr6,710 as other Swiss blue chips mostly gained a point or two. MADRID's general index ended 2.13 up at 326.29, but 1.4 per cent down on the week following a late recovery as Wall Street weathered the US data. Telefonica, a front line ADR stock, ended Pta50 better at Pta1,885, accounting for a quarter of yesterday's Pta32.3bn market turnover. ATHENS fell slightly but a more optimistic tone had returned to trading, brokers reported, as turmoil in the currency markets began to subside. The general index slipped 1.86 to to 868.50 but remained 1.5 per cent firmer on the week. ISTANBUL gained 2.1 per cent on buying interest which was mostly concentrated upon state-companies, the composite index ending 324.69 higher at 16,072.90 for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week.

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Italian voters face a profusion of parties: Robert Graham finds the choice is between more of the same and a step into the dark THE ITALIAN electorate could scarcely claim it is being denied a choice of parties or candidates in Sunday's general elections. The 47.4m voters have never before faced such a deluge of parties and candidates, confirming Italy's status as the most fragmented democracy in the EC. Against 34 party groupings in the 1987 elections, 50 are now in the field, including special interest lobbies from the League of Pensioners and the Car Drivers' Party to the much publicised Party of Love, headed by Ms Moana Pozzi, Italy's self-styled 'porno-star'. The Rome electoral district tops the list with a bewildering selection of 27 parties. The Interior Ministry has permitted 109 different party symbols of which 37 contain the word 'league', provoking the suspicion that government supporters have deliberately sought to confuse potential voters of the populist Lombard League which has emerged as the main challenger to the ruling Christian Democrats in the north. The number of candidates contesting the 630 seats for the chamber of deputies and the 315 seats for the senate is up 17 per cent to 11,027. Over one fifth of these candidates are contesting more than one seat - if they win in more than one, their votes can be transferred to another candidate of their party's choice. But this proliferation of choice is deceptive. Little attention has focused on issues, largely because the electorate is correctly assumed to know what these are (institutional reform and convergence with the EC) and because few politicians wish to commit themselves to concrete proposals. Instead the campaign, with increasing intemperance, has centred on the nature and composition of Italy's next and 51st post-war government. As a result voters face only two real alternatives. The first is for a majority to maintain their vote for the two main partners in the outgoing coalition government, the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, which alongside their minor allies, the Liberals (PLI) and the Social Democrats (PSDI), have ensured a stable parliamentary majority. Between them, these four parties mustered 52 per cent of the vote in 1987. Alternatively, the apparently large number of undecided voters - up to a third, which is unprecedented in Italian elections - could switch allegiance to some nine groupings which could loosely be called the opposition for the purposes of the campaign. This 'opposition' has presented itself as the champion of reform of the political system and has been drumming up a protest vote - but is not united in any other sense. The parties include the metamorphosised communists in the form of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS); the breakaway hardline communists, known as Reconstructed Communism; the centre-left Republicans (PRI); the anti-Rome Lombard League and its league affiliates; the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI); the Greens; the quixotic Radicals, the Referendum Party and the Sicilian-based 'clean government' movement, La Rete (The Network). It is thus a vote for the status quo to continue the Christian Democrats' uninterrupted 46 year hegemony, or for an uncertain change involving new players. In the past the same basic choice has existed; but the important difference is that uncertain change then meant allowing a communist party into government. Freed for the first time of this fear following the collapse of communism, voters may well feel more willing to step into the unknown. The Christian Democrats, commanding 34 per cent of the vote, have been unsettled by not having a well defined 'enemy' in the shape of a communist threat. They have hit out in all directions with a defensive slogan 'they want to break up Italy'; the all-embracing 'they' include highly responsible former government partners such as the Republicans along with the Lombard League. The Socialists have been equally defensive, exposed for having little to do with socialism any more, and for making retention of power an end in itself. The PSDI and the PLI have timidly clung to their partners' coat-tails. The 'opposition' has concentrated its fire on the Christian Democrats' record in government and sought to capitalise on a protest vote. This is especially the case of the Republicans and the Lombard League. But with few exceptions the attacks have been muted by ambitions to govern that would mean allying with elements in the outgoing government. In the case of the PDS, the party has spent a lot of time ensuring that the former communist vote, the second largest in 1987 with 26 per cent, does not haemorrhage either to its break-away former companions in Reconstructed Communism or to other parties. The PDS will do well to hold the line with 20 per cent of the vote. Italian post-war elections have shown an electorate remarkably faithful to individual parties with only minimal percentage swings. However, it would require a relatively small swing from the four parties in the outgoing coalition to undermine their chances of forming a new government. Even if the present coalition partners scrape home with around 49 per cent of the vote, the minimum to assure a working parliamentary majority, the nature of the next legislature will be radically different. Over 400 deputies, embracing a cross-party alliance of Christian Democrats and Socialists as well as Republicans and members of the PDS, are pledged, if elected, to reform an electoral system which creates political fragmentation and a political system which leaves the executive little accountable to the legislature. On economic issues no party disagrees on fundamentals - the need to tackle the huge public sector deficit, slim down the state and conform to the criteria of convergence with the EC laid down by the Maastricht summit. The electorate is merely being left to decide amid a welter of vague promises who is most capable of positive action.  ------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT THE MAIN PARTIES STAND FOR  ------------------------------------------------------------- Christian Democrats: in government since 1945 Democratic Left: Former mainstream communists Socialists: Christian Democrats' main coalition partner Reconstructed Communists: Breakaway hardliners Republicans: Centre-left, former coalition partners Lombard League: Populist champions of the north Italian Social Movement: Neo-Fascist The Network: Sicilian-based movement for clean government  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

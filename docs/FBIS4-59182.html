			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received  members of a Kuwaiti scientific delegation, comprising  chancellors and lecturers of faculties of law and science of  some universities and a number of writers and journalists from  that country.    At the meeting the president welcomed the idea of exchange  of  views between Iranian and Kuwaiti scientific delegations as a  valuable and beneficial move. Stressing that it should  continue, he said it helps to strengthen science and culture  ties between the two countries.    Referring to the problems facing the region, particularly  since the Persian Gulf war, the president cited the following as  the negative effects of the war: The way that America and some  western countries have taken advantage of the situation to  justify their illegal presence in the region; the difficult  living conditions of the people of Iraq; and moves of the West  in instilling fear through adverse propaganda representing Iran  as an enemy of the countries in the region, creating an  atmosphere of mistrust in order to sell western arms and  military hardware, and raising a hue and cry by exaggerating  peripheral and divisive issues in the region.    The president added: If the interests of the regional  nations, and not the world powers, are considered in cooperation  between Persian Gulf littoral states, and issues are reviewed in  a sincere atmosphere and with cooperation, the unfavorable  conditions in the region would be solved by the countries in the  region.    In reply to a question by a Kuwaiti writer about the present  situation in Iran, the president said: Iran's future is very  clear to us. Thanks to the patience and hard work of our good  people and the efforts of our sympathetic officials, we have  carried out important fundamental and infrastructural work since  the war imposed by Iraq, which is unprecedented in all eras of  Iran's history.    He added: Currently many of the raw materials for industry,  including metals and petrochemicals, are produced domestically.  Large-scale industrial projects -- from the research to the  operational stages -- are being implemented with domestic  materials and experts. You witnessed at close hand the knowhow  and expertise of Iran's specialists in the field in the course  of extinguishing the oil well fires in Kuwait.    The president declared Iran's preparedness to help  neighboring countries. [passage omitted]</p>

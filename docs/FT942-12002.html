			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Observer: Fast forward Whatever can have cropped up in Lord Parkinson's diary last week that prompted the Thatcherite, profoundly Euro-sceptical Conservative Way Forward, of which he is chairman, to postpone the launch of its new manifesto? Fielding Parkinson as its excuse for the sudden scheduling problem, the group says it is now postponing publication until mid-June. By then, of course, the local and European elections will be comfortably - or uncomfortably - behind John Major and his party. Even if CWF had a less than totally free hand in the rearrangement, it may still have the last laugh, though. The worse the Conservatives fare in the polling, the more plausible becomes the new manifesto as a recipe for averting disaster in the next general election.</p>

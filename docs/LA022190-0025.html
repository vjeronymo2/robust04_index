			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEACH DEBRIS  </P> <P> What a mess.  </P> <P> No, I don't mean the oil spill, I mean the debris left at the high water line,  day after day, week after week.  </P> <P> The oil companies have had only two accidental oil spills in the past 20 years.  And considering the millions and millions of gallons of oil that is handled,  that is not a bad record.  </P> <P> On the other hand, our beaches generally look very much like a garbage dump  until the cleaning crews can rescue them from the mistreatment of our so-called  "beach lovers."  </P> <P> If all the people who profess to be concerned about the environment at our  shores would not discard their used and unwanted waste wherever it happens to  drop, our ocean and beaches would be a lot cleaner and more beautiful.  </P> <P> BETTY WALKER  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

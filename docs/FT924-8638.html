			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Further purchases lift Tomkins' stake in RHM to 22.11% TOMKINS, the industrial conglomerate offering Pounds 935m for Ranks Hovis McDougall in an agreed bid, yesterday bought a further 36.26m shares in the milling, baking and grocery products group, taking its stake to 22.11 per cent. It also posted its offer document to RHM shareholders. The document showed that Mr Stanley Metcalfe, RHM chairman, was given a new five year contract in February this year at an annual salary of Pounds 347,000. His remuneration was shown in the previous year's accounts at Pounds 330,438. The new contract was agreed at a time when RHM was warning that its profits would fall. If Tomkins' bid succeeds Mr Metcalfe will stay with the group as a consultant for three months. If the remaining four years of his contract had to be bought out, it could cost Tomkins approaching Pounds 1.4m. Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, said no discussions on compensation payments had taken place yet. He said he was busy meeting RHM and Tomkins shareholders explaining the deal. The reaction he had received was positive, he said. With a recommendation for Tomkins' offer and a 22 per cent stake built up, the chances of another bidder entering the contest appears unlikely. Observers suggest that Tomkins' bid could win support from holders of over 50 per cent of RHM's shares by the first closing date, set at December 7. Tomkins must first win approval from its own shareholders, and has called a special meeting on December 4 to discuss the bid and the second instalment of the Pounds 653m rights issue Tomkins is making to help finance it. The share purchases yesterday were mostly at 260p, the value of the cash offer Tomkins is making for RHM, or at 269.54p, which includes the 9.54p dividend RHM shareholders are to receive. Tomkins has spent over Pounds 200m buying 78.65m RHM shares and has almost reached the limit of the share purchases it can make under rules which stop a bidder spending more than the equivalent of a quarter of its own net asset value on buying shares in its target.</p>

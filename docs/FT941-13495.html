			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario in CDollars 1.25bn global offer A CDollars 1.25bn global bond offering for the Canadian Province of Ontario was the highlight of an otherwise slow day in the Eurobond market. After record issuance during the first three weeks of the year, syndicate officials say the market may be in for a period of consolidation in the near term. 'Everyone is severely long of paper, and I think most of us would like a pause to digest all the recent supply,' said one official. Ontario's 30-year global bond met with strong demand and was oversubscribed, according to its lead managers and the issuer. 'There was tremendous demand in Europe - it came in much stronger than expected,' said Mr John Madden, assistant deputy minister of finance for the province. He said that some 43 per cent of the deal went to Canadian accounts, 16 per cent flowed into the US, 32 per cent of the issue was bought by European investors, and the remaining 10 per cent went to Japan and the rest of Asia. According to one of the lead managers, much of the deal had been pre-placed last week, ensuring a smooth launch. 'The book was so strong on Friday that the launch was even brought forward a bit,' he said. Investors' appetite for Canadian dollar bonds is based on widespread expectations that Canada's currency and bond market will outperform their US counterparts. In addition, the country's positive inflation outlook has increased investor interest in very long-dated bonds. Standard &amp; Poor's recent confirmation of the province's AA-minus long-term debt rating also helped boost investor confidence, traders said. The bonds ended the day at 98.58 bid, yielding 51.5 basis points over the corresponding government bond. That was below the 53 basis point launch spread, which in turn was at the low end of market expectations. Given the success of yesterday's deal, many syndicate officials now expect Ontario's planned US dollar global floating-rate note to be launched later this week. The issue will be lead-managed by Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, and traders are calling for Dollars 1.5bn of five-year floating-rate notes paying a spread of eight to 10 basis points above Libor. The day's other global bond, a SKr1.5bn five-year offering for the Nordic Investment Bank via Merrill Lynch, got a more muted reception. The issue will be priced today at an indicated spread of 10 to 15 basis points over the corresponding Swedish government bond, with most traders expecting the launch spread to be towards the upper end of that range. Given last week's heavy supply of Swedish krona five-year paper, the deal is likely to be quite slow to get off the ground. In the D-mark sector, LKB Baden-Wurttemberg Finance increased its outstanding issue of DM1.5bn 6.5 per cent bonds due September 2008 by another DM750m. The bonds ended the day at 101 bid, up from their 100.60 re-offer price, lead manager JP Morgan said. The yield spread remained stable at 67 basis points over bunds. According to one syndicate official, the D-mark sector is beginning to benefit from flows out of other so-called core European bond markets, such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands. 'Germany has underperformed so much it has become ridiculously cheap,' he said. In the Eurosterling sector, Rothschild Continuation Finance issued Pounds 125m of perpetual bonds via Hoare Govett, NM Rothschild and Salomon Brothers. At the re-offer price of 99.989 they yielded 240 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017. According to one of the lead managers, the paper was taken up mainly by UK institutions, though some demand from Switzerland was also seen. 'Investors like the high current coupon and it adds good duration to their portfolios,' he said.</p>

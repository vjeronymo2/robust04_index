			<p>BFN     [Text] Estonia does not intend to purchase significant  amount of weaponry in the near future. This was stated by  Estonian Foreign Minister Indrek Kannik [title as received] at  the airport today after his return from Israel.    During a week-long trip he had also visited Luxembourg and  France.    Kannik announced that Estonia needed electronic systems for  surveillance over its marine and land borders in order to ensure  its security. This issue was discussed during his visit to  Israel on the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.    France, Italy, and Sweden have also proposed that Estonia  purchase their radio radar equipment.    Kannik said a special working commission would make the  final  decision on the issue. However, the seller state will have to  allot the appropriate credit to Estonia since its budget  situation provided for no direct deal.    Kannik stressed that in any case this would not be such a  big  contract as that of the last year concluded with the Taas  Israeli company, which had sold to Estonia weaponry costing a  total $49 million.    Kannik repeated that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania had been  given associated partner status in the Western European Union at  the meeting of the defense and foreign ministers of this  organization in Luxembourg. Kannik emphasized that on this  issue the Western European Union made no difference between the  Baltic states and Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and  Slovakia.    Speaking on his visit to France, Kannik pointed to the  agreement on cooperation between the French and Estonian defense  ministers signed in Paris.</p>

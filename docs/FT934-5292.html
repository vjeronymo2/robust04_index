			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei's fall of 3.9% weakens the region's markets The Nikkei average fell 3.9 per cent, particularly on selling of bank stocks, and the index closed at a year's low of 16,078.71, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. After opening at the day's high of 16,688.57, the Nikkei declined on a plunge in futures and heavy arbitrage selling. The index crashed below the 16,000 level to 15,671.97 in the early afternoon, but later recovered some of its loss on short-covering and bargain hunting. The Topix index of all first section stocks dropped 74.06, or 5.2 per cent, to 1,350.48, breaching the 1,400 level for the first time since March 24, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was only 0.33 off at 1,091.26. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, ruled out any possibility of emergency measures to help share prices, while Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, said that although he was watching the stock market carefully, no government support was being considered. Traders said there were no firm technical support levels now that 17,000 on the Nikkei and 1,430 on the Topix had been broken. Volume was 370m shares, against 339m. Declines overwhelmed rises by 1,025 to 45, with 43 issues unchanged. Mounting fears about the country's financial system hit bank shares. Some banks remained offered only during the morning session. The fall prompted unwinding of positions in the Topix index, which is heavily weighted in bank shares. The Nikkei banking index lost 7.9 per cent from last Friday, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y330 to Y2,660 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y250 weaker at Y1,770. Trust banks lost ground, with Mitsubishi Trust and Banking shedding Y130 to Y1,050 and Yasuda Trust and Banking Y65 to Y675. Other financial stocks were also weak, with Orix down Y230 to Y3,130 and Nippon Housing Loan off Y5 at Y220. Nomura Securities dipped Y110 to Y1,660 and Nikko Securities Y80 to Y960. East Japan Railway tumbled Y24,000 to a new low of Y400,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y49,000 to Y636,000. Department stores were among the few gainers of the day, with Isetan advancing Y80 to Y1,830. In Osaka, the OSE average dropped 805.22 to 17,871.16 in volume of 22.7m shares. Roundup The region, with the exception of Taiwan, fell in line with losses in Tokyo and Hong Kong. Bombay was closed. HONG KONG finished sharply lower following the collapse of the latest round of Sino-British talks, but late bargain hunting brought the key index off its low to end above the 9,000 level. The Hang Seng index lost a net 261.65, or 2.8 per cent, at 9,012.77. Turnover amounted to HKDollars 5.6bn. The index had dropped to 8,870.59 early in the day on fears of a complete breakdown of talks on Hong Kong's political reform plans. HSBC was the most active issue, falling HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 84.50. Cheung Kong and Hutchison retreated HKDollars 1.25 apiece to HKDollars 35 and HKDollars 31 respectively, while Jardine Matheson lost HKDollars 3 at HKDollars 65. TAIWAN soared 5.3 per cent in heavy turnover in response to the ruling Nationalist party's victory in Saturday's local government elections. The weighted index ended 220.52 up at 4,384.51, its highest close since early June. Turnover came to TDollars 46.6bn. The electronics sector led gains, with Acer and United Microelectronics ending the day's limit up. SEOUL declined marginally for its fourth consecutive session, with the composite index losing 0.97 at 804.54 in turnover of Won618.8bn. Some investors showed renewed interest in steel, vehicles and electric and electronics shares on the back of expectations of a better than expected economic recovery. MANILA fell in reaction to events elsewhere. The composite index slipped 42.95 to 2,332.29 in turnover of 1.1bn pesos. SINGAPORE resisted sharp falls seen elsewhere, with the Straits Times Industrial index closing off 9.06 at 2,098.92. Volume was a thin 196.7m shares. AUSTRALIA weakened in line with the region, the All Ordinaries index dropping 32.8, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,010.3. Turnover was ADollars 364.7m. BHP ended 36 cents cheaper at ADollars 16.50 and News Corp was 34 cents, or nearly 3.5 per cent, down at ADollars 9.68. Among other leading stocks, CSR dipped 6 cents to ADollars 4.63, Amcor 10 cents to ADollars 9.35, Coles Myer 2 cents to ADollars 5.07 and Boral 5 cents to ADollars 4.02.

BANGKOK lost ground in thin trading but closed off the day's lows. The SET index relinquished 14.06, or 1 per cent, to 1,295.51 in turnover of Bt7.6bn.

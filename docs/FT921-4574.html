			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Moller sees threat in disclosure changes DENMARK'S biggest business, the A. P. Moller (APM) shipping, shipbuilding, energy and industrial group, is under political pressure to increase its financial disclosure. Rules covering companies listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange exempt shipping lines from the obligation of disclosing figures in half-year reports, if the companies judge disclosure would damage their competitive position. A committee of experts reporting to the industry ministry has recommended the continuation of this dispensation, which is utilised by the APM holding companies, 1912 and Svendborg. However three political parties with a combined majority in the Folketing - the Social Democrats, the Radical Liberals and the Socialist People's Party - are calling for an end to the exemption. APM argues that since many of its main competitors, especially Far Eastern shipping lines, do not publish annual reports, it has a strong interest in holding disclosure to a minimum. APM's Maersk Line is the world's second largest shipping company by container capacity. Taiwan's Evergreen is the largest. Maersk is so well-financed that it has not raised new equity capital through the market for many decades, raising speculation that it might withdraw its Copenhagen listing rather than meet more stringent disclosure requirements. Meanwhile, APM has disclosed that it owns 8.11 per cent of Den Danske Bank, the country's largest, making APM the second-largest shareholder after the National Labour Market Pension Fund, with 8.44 per cent. The disclosure follows new rules requiring those with more than 5 per cent of shares in a company to reveal their holdings. The same rules led to the disclosure of AMP's ownership. Mr Maersk McKinney Moller, 78, the shipowner who heads the group, personally holds 5.98 per cent of the voting shares in Svendborg and 5.81 per cent in 1912. Mr Moller and his family foundations together control 55.47 per cent of the votes in Svendborg and 62 per cent of the votes in 1912. As Moller business operations are owned by twin parent companies - neither of which holds a majority of the shares - APM is not legally a group under Danish law and therefore does not publish consolidated accounts.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Political Notebook: Turning villains into heroes ONLY this government could succeed in turning errant fathers into martyrs. That judgment on the operations of the Child Support Agency came not from an opposition spokesman looking for an easy headline but from a sharp, if world-weary, MP on the Conservative backbenches. Commentators at Westminster tend to focus their attention on what they judge to be the 'big' issues of the day. Has Mr John Major restored his grip on the premiership? By how much will Mr Kenneth Clarke raise taxes? Has Mr Malcolm Rifkind been forced to scrap another frigate? But every now and then an issue unexpectedly hits MPs over the head. Their postbags swell with complaints. Constituents queue at their weekend surgeries with tales of hardship and demands for action. Sometimes the preoccupations of the voters will coincide with the instincts of the legislators: the outcry over the imposition of value added tax on heating fuel is a good example. But more often the issue will take MPs unawares. The operations of the CSA, the subject this week of an investigation by the all-party social security committee, provide the latest example. MPs of all parties have stopped arguing about whether the government has broken this or that promise on taxes or whether or not Mr Major is done for. Instead they have joined forces to attack the CSA. The agency, of course, only exists because three years ago the government, with all-party backing, decided that absent parents - almost always fathers  -should be made to take more responsibility for their children. There was an easy coincidence of interest between those concerned about the poverty endured by many single parents - almost invariably mothers - and a government which realised that the taxpayer, through income support, was picking up the bill for many absent fathers. MPs should have realised, of course, there would be a fuss. As Ms Ros Hepplewhite, the chief executive of the agency, told the committee this week the basic intention behind the move was to achieve a significant redistribution of income. It was always intended that the average maintenance payment should double from Pounds 25 per week per child to Pounds 50 per week. Mothers and the Treasury (and mainly the latter) would be the beneficiaries. You cannot introduce a change like that without making waves. What few MPs realised at the time was that they were voting to give the CSA virtually unchallengeable powers in fixing maintenance in cases where their was no burden on the taxpayer and where parents had agreed 'clean-break' financial settlements. Nor did they appreciate that the crude formula used to assess maintenance payments would take little or no account of the transfer of assets, responsibility for children taken on through second marriages, or the financial shock of large changes in the liabilities of absent parents. Add to that the employment disincentive to those on low incomes facing a huge increase in maintenance payments and the fact that most of the extra money now being collected goes not to mothers but to the Treasury, and it is little wonder that constituency surgeries are full of angry parents. Ms Hepplewhite failed to offer any convincing response to the committee's concerns. It was all up to ministers, was her most frequent response. Her habit of answering questions in management school jargon (maintenance payments are the CSA's 'product') did not betray much sensitivity to the complicated world of family break-ups. Mr Alastair Burt, social security minister, who gave evidence yesterday, was similarly opaque. He signalled that in spite of the prime minister's pledge of a review, his department was opposed to change. It is true that only a small minority of the agency's cases at present involve reopening 'clean-break' settlements. But the number will increase sharply as the CSA spreads its net wider each year. So too will the number of low-paid absent fathers who opt for state benefits when they see their new maintenance bills. In the meantime, the formula gives a father leaving his partner and children a large financial incentive to ensure that the family home is sold and that he maximises the cost of his new home to minimise maintenance payments. Most MPs agree with Mr Frank Field, the select committee chairman, that the cultural shift that the agency is designed to create - a recognition that fatherhood bestows inescapable responsibilities - remains an essential aim. But their postbags confirm Mr Field's judgment that it is not working properly. Whatever Mr Burt says now, sooner or later the government will be forced to agree.</p>

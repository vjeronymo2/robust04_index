			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Leading Article: Disaster at Gorazde Saturday was a black day in the history of both Nato and the United Nations  -the two institutions on which it had seemed possible to build some semblance of world order after the cold war. The debacle at Gorazde is a disaster for Bosnia - one more, after so many. It is a catastrophe for Unprofor, the UN protection force in the former Yugoslavia. Many reputations will be tarnished. Those special envoys who last week were uttering optimistic statements about ceasefires and compromise solutions are left looking irredeemably foolish. A sadder casualty - given the hopes that had been raised by his efforts until last week - is the reputation of Unprofor's commander in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose. For two months General Rose's energy and ingenuity, backed by an apparently firmer sense of purpose among his political masters, had made it seem as if Unprofor was actually capable of carrying out its mandate, and even as if that mandate was clear and coherent. But in truth the mandate remained contradictory. It was often asserted, not least by General Rose himself, that Unprofor was a neutral peacekeeping and humanitarian operation, authorised to use force only in its own defence. Given the size and nature of the units composing it, that was perhaps the only realistic way for its commanders to interpret their mandate. But that interpretation ignored many paragraphs in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, which authorised the use of force not only to ensure that humanitarian aid reached the people who needed it, but also to defend the so-called 'safe areas'. It also ignored the political context in which those resolutions were passed, which was one of worldwide outrage at the violent dismembering of a state. The world at large has not wavered in its judgment that the principal aggressors are the Bosnian Serbs, aided and abetted by Serbia. The Security Council has imposed very tough sanctions on Serbia, and the 'safe areas' it proclaimed were all places still held by the Bosnian government, but threatened by the Serb advance. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Serb forces regarded Unprofor with intense suspicion, especially whenever its commanders showed signs of taking their mandate seriously and being prepared to use force to carry it out. Perhaps if General Rose had been given the extra troops he asked for, he might have succeeded. As it was, the Serbs called his bluff, and he underestimated the gravity of their challenge until it was too late. Then Nato provided 'close air support' at his request, but this was not enough even to protect UN personnel, let alone to protect the 'safe area' of Gorazde and its population. Only a much more intensive air bombardment of Serb forces could have affected the military outcome, and for this there was no stomach either in national capitals or at Unprofor HQ. Logically there are now only two options left. One is for Unprofor to be called out and the Bosnians left to fight their own war, with weapons and perhaps also air cover from sympathetic outsiders. The other is for Unprofor to be massively reinforced and equipped to fight. Neither option is likely to be adopted. The Serbs are in a position to make Unprofor's withdrawal very difficult, and few western governments will be prepared to take responsibility for the likely immediate consequences for Bosnian civilians, who for better or worse have come to depend on the UN humanitarian relief effort. But governments will be even less willing to contemplate an all-out war with the Bosnian Serbs. The sad probability is that Unprofor will stay, becoming ever more constrained in its relief role and in effect serving to ratify the results of Serb aggression. The reality of the new world order is proving very different from the prospectus offered in 1990-91.</p>

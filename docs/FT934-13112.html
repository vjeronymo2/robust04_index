			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Presonal Finance (29): How to make sure they do it your way - The cost of your funeral / There are sound reasons for pre-payment. Burial-cost increases have exceeded inflation, and relatives may be saved further stress when they are already under emotional strain ONE'S OWN funeral is not a subject most people like to dwell on. Planning and paying for it years in advance could seem a little morbid, but funeral directors have been working on changing public attitudes, with signs of success. Death is inevitable, and everyone expects friends and relatives to mourn them, but comparatively few people in the UK choose to make arrangements in advance. This is in contrast to the US, where up to three-quarters of funerals are pre-paid. The large undertaking groups are now offering schemes that allow you to choose the type of funeral you would like  - burial or cremation, church service or simple crematorium ceremony, one limousine or a whole fleet  - and pay for it at today's prices. The money goes into an independently administered trust fund, where it is invested in a mixture of low-risk index-linked gilts and some equities. When you eventually die, be it three years or three decades afterwards, the funeral you have chosen is provided, no matter how much prices have gone up in the meantime. One of the main arguments for paying for your funeral now is that, in recent years, the price of funerals has risen faster than the general inflation rate. According to a survey by Chosen Heritage, one of the largest sellers of funeral plans, the average funeral in England and Wales cost Pounds 867.29 in 1990, but Pounds 1,048.24 in 1992. In addition, there are considerable regional variations in the cost of funerals, but some plans offer the same price all over the country, which could be a good deal for people in the south-east and south-west of England. Companies that offer such plans say the other reason many customers choose them is to save their relatives the stress of having to organise a funeral when they are already coping with the emotional strain of a death. 'It's what he would have wanted,' is a phrase often heard on the lips of the bereaved, explaining their choice of funeral arrangements. But how many people really know what the dead person would have chosen? With pre-payment plans, you can leave instructions with the funeral directors for every detail of the proceedings in advance, even down to which hymns should be sung, the choice of readings, and the route of the funeral cortege. As soon as the owner of a pre-payment plan dies, relatives can call a 24-hour number, and the funeral directors take over, organising everything from the removal of the body from the home or hospital to contacting a minister for the funeral service. The more expensive plans even place an obituary notice in a local paper, and provide acknowledgement cards for senders of flowers. The market for pre-paid funerals is dominated by a few large operators: Chosen Heritage, run by Great Southern; the Co-operative Wholesale Society's Funeral Bond; Co-operative Retail Services also has a funeral bond and pre-payment certificates; Dignity in Destiny, owned by the Plantsbrook funeral group; and Golden Charter, which uses small independent funeral directors. Most of these offer a choice of three or four package deals, ranging from very simple to more ostentatious, but some can be customised to individual requirements. Package prices range from Pounds 825 to Pounds 1,450 with Chosen Heritage, and from Pounds 784 to Pounds 1,395 with the Co-operative Wholesale Society. The cost can often be paid in monthly instalments over one to three years, but that may involve a charge for finance. Such packages will not include extras such as embalming, headstones, flowers or catering. Three-quarters of funerals in the UK are cremations, so most pre-payment plans use this as the basis for costs. Burials are more expensive. If you choose to be buried, some plans allow you to pay for this in advance, others contribute a fixed amount and will expect your family to make up the shortfall at the time. The plans can be implemented only by funeral directors belonging to the organisation running the scheme  - most have several hundred branches or affiliates, so finding one locally should not be a problem. However, if you move abroad, or to an area in the UK where there is no affiliated funeral director to hand, most of the plans will return your money. The alternative to picking a group of funeral directors and paying in advance is the traditional option of a funeral insurance plan, offered by many life insurance companies. Many of the companies offer 'guaranteed acceptance' schemes for people aged over 50 or 55 and under 80, with no medical needed. Insurance policies of this sort are generally of the whole-of-life, without-profits type, so there is no cash surrender value, and the sum assured does not increase. Whether or not it is good value depends on how soon the policy holder dies. Most policies are taken out by people over 60, who may well live for another 25 years. By that time inflation will have eroded the value of the sum assured, and they may have contributed in premiums more than the final sum paid out. For example, with the Norwich Union, a 65 year-old man would pay Pounds 19 a month for a sum assured of Pounds 2,500, while a woman of the same age would pay Pounds 16.58. For a pair of 75-year-olds, the same level of cover would cost Pounds 34.55 and Pounds 28.28. If death occurred within two years of the policy's start, the company would only pay out 1.5 times the premiums paid, rather than the sum assured. By comparison, Chosen Heritage's mid-range Traditional plan, spread over two years, costs Pounds 45 a month for a person of either sex and any age. Once the full amount (Pounds 1,080) has been paid, provision of a funeral at the required standard is guaranteed. If the funeral service is needed before all of the instalments have been paid, the guaranteed price still applies, but the balance due must be paid by the family. The main advantage of insurance over pre-payment is flexibility in the choice of funeral directors: the money is not tied in any way. However, the full burden of planning the funeral does fall on the family with this system.</p>

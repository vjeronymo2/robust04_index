			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Defeat in Lords threatens sell-off of BR AN EMBARRASSING defeat for the government in the House of Lords on a central part of plans to privatise British Rail last night threatened to throw the future of the sell-off into doubt. In a fresh jolt to the administration of Mr John Major, rebel Tory peers joined with opposition parties to vote to allow BR to bid to run rail service franchises after privatisation. The government now faces the risk that a rebellion by Tory MPs, many of whom are already worried about the sale, will prevent it from overturning the defeat. Transport ministers had admitted that the change would amount to a 'wrecking amendment' and went to the heart of the privatisation proposals. If BR were allowed to bid for franchises it would, in effect, turn the sale into an exercise in compulsory competitive tendering. Labour and Liberal Democrats hailed the defeat as a humiliating blow to the privatisation plans. Last night, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said that he would look again at the proposals before the bill returns to the Commons in the autumn. He made it clear, however, that he would take a lot of convincing that the government's original plans had been wrong. Sir Keith Speed, who led the Tory rebels when MPs last considered the legislation, urged ministers to accept the Lords' decision, and warned that the result would be 'a close-run thing' if they tried to overturn the defeat. Ministers may be driven to seek some compromise if there seems a serious risk that the Lords' decision would be approved by MPs, in order to avoid the worst outcome of being stuck with the amendment after a second defeat. The change imposed by the Lords so undermines the bill, however, that the government is certain to try to reject it. Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport secretary, said the rail sell-off had been 'torpedoed', and promised a hard summer's campaigning to prevent ministers from reversing the Lords' move. The defeat was a further setback for Mr Major as he tries to restore stability to the government after a bruising year in which he has been buffeted by Tory revolts. In May, he faced rebellions by Tory MPs over BR privatisation - including one on the issue on which the government was defeated yesterday. Then the legislation only survived intact after Mr MacGregor made concessions which included an assurance that more emphasis would be put on motivating BR managers who remain in the public sector. Mr MacGregor has argued that to allow BR to bid to run services would be to undermine the main objective of privatisation - to transfer operation to the private sector. He has emphasised the financial help that the government would give to BR managers to launch management buyouts. The Lords approved by 150 to 112 an amendment proposed by Lord Peyton of Yeovil, a former Tory transport minister, during the Railways Bill's committee stage. Lord Peyton predicted that BR's expertise would be missed and those who prevented it from bidding would ultimately face censure. Earlier, BR took encouragement from a comment by Lord Caithness, government spokesman in the Lords, that if BR joined a junior partner in a private consortium bidding for passenger franchises, this would be permissible.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview of Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, in </F> Hebron, by radio correspondent Muhammad al-Aswad, in Cairo, date  not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program-- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Aswad] Mr. al-Natshah, we welcome you to the  Voice of the Arabs.    [Al-Natshah] Thank you.    [Al-Aswad] After the PLO and Israel reached agreement on  security arrangements in the Hebron area, President Yasir  'Arafat appointed you mayor of Hebron. In your opinion, what is  the significance of this step? Can it be seen as the beginning  of actual Palestinian authority and decisionmaking in the  occupied territories?    [Al-Natshah] We welcome this decision and regard it as a  step  toward legality and democracy. My return and the return of the  elected Municipal Council to our duties at Hebron Municipality  strengthen legality and democracy. The Municipal Council is  actually the elected body that was dismissed in 1983. Now,  thanks to PLO efforts, it can again carry out its tasks.    [Al-Aswad] Your appointment followed the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre in Hebron. What is the mayor's role in providing  protection for the Palestinians? Is this part of the mayor's  authority?    [Al-Natshah] Conditions in the city since the massacre are  unprecedented. The city center is closed off because of the  security measures imposed by the Israeli authorities to protect  the settlers. We have 750 shops that are closed. People living  in the downtown area need permits to reach their homes. The  schools in that area are closed because of the security cordon.  Generally the city is paralyzed. Therefore the Municipal  Council's first task is to reopen the city and restore normal  life. We hope to do this within a few days, God willing.  Second, the citizens have suffered a lot from assaults by the  settlers and the Israeli Army. We hope that the international  forces will protect the citizens and end the assaults.    [Al-Aswad] Mr. al-Natshah, as you know, there is an  agreement  to deploy Palestinian police and international observers in  Hebron. How do the Palestinians in Hebron view this step? What  is the general atmosphere like in view of these recent  developments?    [Al-Natshah] The agreement provides for the deployment of  international observers, meaning international protection, but  not Palestinian police. We welcome the international  protection; it has been a Palestinian demand for years. This is  the first time we are being given international protection. We  regard it as part of the implementation of the relevant UN  resolutions -- in this case, Security Council Resolution 904.  We hope this is a prelude to the implementation of the  remaining UN resolutions. We stress that an ounce of prevention  is worth more than a pound of cure. Evacuating 30 settler  families from inside Hebron would be the most important move to  protect the city's Arab citizens.    [Al-Aswad] The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will resume  in Cairo today to discuss ways of implementing the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on transitional  Palestinian autonomy, beginning with Gaza and Jericho.  According to some reports, the Israeli withdrawal from these  two areas will begin on 12 April. What is your assessment of  this step, judging from your perspective as a resident in the  occupied territories?    [Al-Natshah] We want peace in the region. We want a  withdrawal from the rest of the West Bank. We want it to be a  genuine, total withdrawal. We want the settlements issue to be  put at the top the agenda so that the settlers will also be  evacuated.    [Al-Aswad] Mr. al-Natshah, how do the Palestinians in the  territories regard the Egyptian role in making peace and  restoring the Palestinian people's legitimate rights?    [Al-Natshah] We greatly appreciate the stance of Egypt and  Mubarak and their backing for the Palestinian cause. We hope  this backing will continue until the Palestinian people can  exercise self-determination and establish a state on their  national soil.    [Al-Aswad] Mr. Mayor, we thank you very much. You are always  welcome on the Voice of the Arabs.    [Al-Natshah] Thank you.</p>

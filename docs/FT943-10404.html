			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Level of R &amp; D assistance criticised Two-thirds of small companies believe the European Commission and foreign governments provide more help than the British government with research and development and innovation, a survey says today. Research by the British Chambers of Commerce and Alex Lawrie, the business finance specialist, found that the UK's small businesses want more information and advice from the government about current R &amp; D/innovation schemes, finance and best practice. The findings will add to the debate over the government's role in industry. Consultancy for small companies was one of the areas named by Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment secretary, in his leaked letter urging big cuts in the Department of Trade and Industry's aid for industry. The survey of 394 companies with fewer than 50 employees found that the DTI's various innovation-related schemes, as well as European Union schemes, were not well known to small companies. The most widely known were regional information grants. But well over half the sample were unaware of any of the schemes open to them. The chambers said: 'This is an extremely unsatisfactory situation, and one which needs to be rectified by the DTI and the European Commission's information services as a matter of urgency.' The survey found that 38 per cent of small companies wanted the DTI to introduce innovation and technology counsellors in its Business Links programme.

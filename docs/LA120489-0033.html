			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> SMOLDERING HATREDS IN 'HOWARD BEACH' MOVIE  </P> <P> If the murder rate in the United States were as large as the percentage of  television time given murder, there'd be no one alive to watch television.  </P> <P> At least NBC's "Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder" -- 9 tonight on  Channels 4, 36 and 39 -- brings something to the table beyond gratuitous  bloodshed. Speaking with a sort of ugly eloquence, it's a crisp, sober account  of a headline-making crime case that inflamed racial tensions.  </P> <P> The violence here -- and it is brutal and vicious -- is merely a symptom, the  hacking smoker's cough telling you that something deep inside is rotting. It's  also the framework and explosive context for this movie, a visible  manifestation of the pockets of smoldering hatreds that underlie and burn away  at America.  </P> <P> The case begins on the night of Dec. 20, 1986.  </P> <P> A car with three black men breaks down in the essentially white community of  Howard Beach in Queens, N.Y. As in the darkest days of the old South, the  blacks are confronted, taunted, harassed and chased by a group of white teens.  Timothy Grimes (Anthony Russell Jr.) escapes. Cedric Sandiford (Joe Morton) is  severely beaten. Sandiford's stepson, Michael Griffith (Cleodis Ingram), flees  from his attackers onto the busy Belt Parkway, where he is hit by a car and  killed.  </P> <P> With this night of terror as a catalyst, Steve Bellow's script proceeds to  relate the Howard Beach case and its racially tense environment from the  perspective of Joe Hynes (Daniel J. Travanti), the able New York State special  prosecutor who triumphs here despite nagging political pressures and being  haunted by the memory of a previous case that he lost.  </P> <P> The cast is strong. Travanti is especially solid, as is Morton as the  determined Sandiford, who rebounds from his terrible beating to star in the  courtroom. And William Daniels is his snide best as shrewdly manipulative  defense attorney David Slaney.  </P> <P> A slave to its stopwatch, television has a way of abridging experiences and  skipping over the middle chapters right to the thundering conclusion. Hence,  rarely do TV portrayals of crime cases portray the tortuous process -- the  seemingly menial grunt work and the frustrations, false starts and dead ends --  of preparing for the courtroom.  </P> <P> "Howard Beach" is the happy exception. Directed with pace and precision by Dick  Lowry, these taut scenes of Hynes and his legal team methodically constructing  a case for the grand jury, and later for trial, are just fascinating.  </P> <P> Where "Howard Beach" falls down in some respects is in the courtroom. The trial  depiction is suspenseful and punctuated by sharp dramatic twists, but also so  truncated that chunks of critical testimony appear to have been abandoned to  the cutting room floor.  </P> <P> Of course trials must be abbreviated for TV, but this goes too far. For  example, the prosecution team is shocked to learn during the course of the  trial that one of the surviving victims, Grimes, had 10 times as much cocaine  in his system as was previously reported. "Slaney will have a field day with  that," predicts one Hynes associates. "Tell me about it," Hynes agrees glumly.  </P> <P> But the revelation never surfaces in court. Nor does one of the white  assailants who makes a deal to testify against his comrades.  </P> <P> "Howard Beach" is still an intriguing two hours, however, and just as  important, a jolting look at the worst of ourselves.  </P></p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Airbus steps up Japanese discussions - European consortium widens co-operation talks on super jumbo aircraft THE European Airbus consortium is stepping up discussions with Japanese aerospace manufacturers about possible co-operation in future Airbus programmes, including the development of a 600-800-seat super jumbo aircraft. Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive, said he would visit Japan at the end of this month for talks with Japanese aerospace officials and the three big aerospace companies, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries. The Japanese initiative coincides with discussions between Airbus partners and Boeing of the US over possible co-operation in development studies for a super jumbo aircraft. The discussions with Boeing have been led by Deutsche Aerospace, the 37.9 per cent German partner in the European consortium. The talks with Boeing, the world's largest maker of commercial jets and Airbus's main competitor, have led to speculation of rising tensions inside the European consortium. But Mr Pierson said the four Airbus partners - Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - remained united and there was 'no question of treason' inside the consortium. He said Deutsche Aerospace received a mandate last year from the Airbus supervisory board to conduct exploratory talks with Boeing about possible co-operation in developing a super jumbo. However, he acknowledged that not all Airbus members agreed on the benefits of collaboration with Boeing and there were still serious doubts over Boeing's motives for co-operating with the Europeans. The question was whether individual members were conducting separate talks with Boeing which could undermine the cohesion of the consortium, several aerospace industry analysts suggested yesterday. Despite Mr Pierson's confidence about the unity of the Airbus partners, the consortium has continued to be affected by the conflicting interests and problems of the four partners. For this reason, Mr Pierson yesterday spoke of an urgent need to transform the Airbus partnership into an independent public limited company so it could operate as a conventional enterprise. Mr Pierson cast doubt on whether a super jumbo would ever be built, saying the technological and financial challenges were 'huge'. Neither Airbus nor Boeing could undertake such a project on its own. For this reason, Mr Pierson said, Airbus had approached potential Asian and Russian partners. He indicated it was open to discussions with US manufacturers: 'But let's not get excited. I don't know if anything will happen and if there will be a larger new aircraft at all.' But Mr Pierson said his main concern was not so much the discussions on the development of a super jumbo as the immediate challenge of competing against Boeing on current airline business and ensuring Airbus was efficiently coping with the aerospace industry slowdown. He said he saw no signs of a recovery in the civil aerospace business this year or in 1994. Airbus last year had sales of Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds 5bn) compared with Dollars 7.7bn in 1991. It expects an increase to Dollars 8.7bn this year. Although the consortium suffered cancellations from Northwest Airlines, it won 136 new aircraft orders last year, compared with 101 in 1991. But the slump in the airline industry has forced it to scale down its production rate. Airbus output is expected to total 150 aircraft this year compared with 157 last year and will now grow to only about 170 aircraft in 1995, down from an original target of 220.</p>

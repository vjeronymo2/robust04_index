			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar surplus estimate soars THE WORLD sugar supply and demand balance is heading for a surplus of 4.6m tonnes for 1990-91 - the biggest surplus since 1982-83, according to ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. Man's sharp upward revision of the surplus from an estimate of 1.9m tonnes comes in a week when sugar prices hit their lowest levels for more than three years. On Tuesday the London Daily Price for raws was Dollars 194 a tonne, the lowest level since November 1987. The latest estimate compares with a 3.33m tonne surplus predicted by FO Licht, the German statistician, in February, and a surplus of 1.2m tonnes made in the same month by Czarnikow, another large London trade house, which is expected to revise its estimate upwards later this month. Man's latest monthly sugar review predicts that prices will be further depressed by the 'weight of the existing, as well as the impending supply surpluses'. When added to a revised surplus of 1.7m tonnes for 1989-90, the total accumulation of sugar from the two seasons is 6.3m tonnes. Production this season is now put at 113.8m tonnes, compared with a previous estimate of 110.4m tonnes and 1989-90 production of 108.7m tonnes. 'This is the largest annual increase since 1981-82; with beet production increasing by over 5 per cent and cane by 4.4 per cent and it is a testimony to the response of sugar producers to the higher world prices in 1989 and 1990,' says the review. Adjustments to production estimates for China, India and Thailand account for 2.1m tonnes or more than 60 per cent of the total increase. The consumption forecast is little changed at 109.2m tonnes. About two thirds of this season's forecast surplus is held in stock by traditional importing countries such as the US, India and Mexico, says Man. Usually these countries only re-export at times of high world prices, but this season, 'influenced more by logistical and domestic financial considerations', both India and Mexico have sold sugar. Recent talk of Mexican sales to China has been one of the factors depressing prices. Man believes that any purchases would be surplus to China's domestic needs, and that it is rebuilding depleted stocks.</p>

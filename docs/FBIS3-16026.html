Azerbaijan's law-enforcement bodies blocked the building  after they found ammunitions and uniforms in the building's  basement. The APF leadership declared that part of the building  is occupied by the apparatus of the executive power of Baku's  Sabaylskiy Region and announced that they have nothing to do  with the discovered objects.    The APF representative declared that after the Front was  removed from power last summer, the headquarters has remained  under actual supervision of the police and was repeatedly  subjected to searches.    The source expressed fear that the authorities would take  the  APF building situated in the center of Baku. He reported that  the APF signboard was removed from the building on March 9.    Azerbaijan's ex-president Abulfaz Elchibey who is hiding in  his native village of Keleki in the Nakhichevan autonomous  republic now is chairman of the Front.    Interfax interlocutor also underlined that normal work of  the  Front has been paralyzed due to the fact that the headquarters  building remains under police control. He reminded that the  last sitting of the APF majlis was held under illegal conditions.    The Majlis of Azerbaijan's Popular Front made a decision to  abstain from mass actions of protest despite the authorities'  attempts to draw the Front into confrontation.</p>

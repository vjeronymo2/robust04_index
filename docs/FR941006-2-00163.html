			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cash match includes funds directly contributed to the project by the applicant, or by other public or private sources. It does not include income generated from tuition fees or the sale of project products. Non-cash match refers to in-kind contributions by the applicant, or other public or private sources. This includes, for example, the monetary value of time contributed by existing personnel or members of an advisory committee (but not the time spent by participants in an educational program attending program sessions). When match is offered, the nature of the match (cash or in-kind) should be explained and, at the application stage, the tasks and line items for which costs will be covered wholly or in part by match should be specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Which of the two budget forms should be used? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section VII.A.3. of the SJI Grant Guideline encourages use of the spreadsheet format of Form C1 if the funding request exceeds $100,000. Form C1 also works well for projects with discrete tasks, regardless of the dollar value of the project. Form C, the tabular format, is preferred for projects lacking a number of discrete tasks, or for projects requiring less than $100,000 of Institute funding. Generally, use the form that best lends itself to representing most accurately the budget estimates for the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> How much detail should be included in the budget narrative? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The budget narrative of an application should provide the basis for computing all project-related costs, as indicated in section VII.D. of the SJI Grant Guideline. To avoid common shortcomings of application budget narratives, include the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Personnel estimates that accurately provide the amount of time to be spent by personnel involved with the project and the total associated costs, including current salaries for the designated personnel (e.g., Project Director, 50% for one year, annual salary of $50,000 = $25,000). If salary costs are computed using an hourly or daily rate, the annual salary and number of hours or days in a work-year should be shown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Estimates for supplies and expenses supported by a complete description of the supplies to be used, nature and extent of printing to be done, anticipated telephone charges, and other common expenditures, with the basis for computing the estimates included (e.g., 100 reports x 75 pages each x .05/page = $375.00). Supply and expense estimates offered simply as ``based on experience'' are not sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to expedite Institute review of the budget, make a final comparison of the amounts listed in the budget narrative with those listed on the budget form. In the rush to complete all parts of the application on time, there may be many last-minute changes; unfortunately, when there are discrepancies between the budget narrative and the budget form or the amount listed on the application cover sheet, it is not possible for the Institute to verify the amount of the request. A final check of the numbers on the form against those in the narrative will preclude such confusion. The Institute will provide an illustrative budget and budget form upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> What travel regulations apply to the budget estimates? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Transportation costs and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization, and a copy of the applicant's travel policy should be submitted as an appendix to the application. If the applicant does not have a travel policy established in writing, then travel rates must be consistent with those established by the Institute or the Federal Government (a copy of the Institute's travel policy is available upon request). The budget narrative should state which regulations are in force for the project and should include the estimated fare, the number of persons traveling, the number of trips to be taken, and the length of stay. The estimated costs of travel, lodging, ground transportation, and other subsistence should be listed separately. When combined, the subtotals for these categories should equal the estimate listed on the budget form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> May grant funds be used to purchase equipment? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Generally, grant funds may be used to purchase only the equipment that is necessary to demonstrate a new technological application in a court, or that is otherwise essential to accomplishing the objectives of the project. Equipment purchases to support basic court operations ordinarily will not be approved. The budget narrative must list the equipment to be purchased and explain why the equipment is necessary to the success of the project. Written prior approval of the Institute is required when the amount of computer hardware to be purchased or leased exceeds $10,000, or the software to be purchased exceeds $3,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To what extent may indirect costs be included in the budget estimates? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly; however, if an applicant has an indirect cost rate that has been approved by a Federal agency within the last two years, an indirect cost recovery estimate may be included in the budget. A copy of the approved rate agreement should be submitted as an appendix to the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an applicant does not have an approved rate agreement, an indirect cost rate proposal should be prepared in accordance with Section XI.H.4. of the Grant Guideline, based on the applicant's audited financial statements for the prior fiscal year. (Applicants lacking an audit should budget all project costs directly.) If an indirect cost rate proposal is to be submitted, the budget should reflect estimates based on that proposal. Obviously, this requires that the proposal be completed at the time of application so that the appropriate estimates may be included; however, grantees have until three months after the project start date to submit the indirect cost proposal to the Institute for approval. An indirect cost rate worksheet on computer diskette is available from the Institute upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Does the budget truly reflect all costs required to complete the project? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After preparing the program narrative portion of the application, applicants may find it helpful to list all the major tasks or activities required by the proposed project, including the preparation of products, and note the individual expenses, including personnel time, related to each. This will help to ensure that, for all tasks described in the application (e.g., development of a videotape, research site visits, distribution of a final report), the related costs appear in the budget and are explained correctly in the budget narrative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendations To Grantees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Institute's staff works with grantees to help assure the smooth operation of the project and compliance with the SJI Guidelines. On the basis of monitoring more than 800 grants, the Institute staff offers the following suggestions to aid grantees in meeting the administrative and substantive requirements of their grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRAY FALLS TO ANOTHER EUROPEAN FIGHTER  </P> <P> John Bray still has a world to conquer.  </P> <P> The Van Nuys resident is the top-ranked U.S. amateur heavyweight boxer but has  yet to prove himself against Eastern European fighters, who along with the  Cubans have traditionally dominated international amateur boxing.  </P> <P> East Germany's Axel Schulz decisioned Bray on Friday night, 20-5, in a  first-round bout in the World Amateur Boxing Championships in Moscow.  </P> <P> Fighting under a new scoring system designed to reward aggressiveness and  eliminate controversy from decisions, Bray was tentative during the three-round  fight and did not throw enough punches.  </P> <P> "I feel terrible," a tearful Bray said after losing to Schulz, a silver  medalist in the European championships. "I should have done what my corner told  me. I didn't listen and you saw the result."  </P> <P> This is the second time in four months that Bray has looked unimpressive while  fighting an Eastern European boxer. In June, he lost a unanimous decision to  Viktor Akshonov of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Bray is expected to get another chance at the Eastern Europeans in November at  the USA-USSR Heavyweight Invitational.

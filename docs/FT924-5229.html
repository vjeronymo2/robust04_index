			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Central Capital's creditors approve restructuring plan CREDITORS of Central Capital, once a fast-growing financial services group with assets of CDollars 17bn (USDollars 13.2bn), have approved a final restructuring plan to avoid bankruptcy. Most company operations have been taken over by the secured creditors, led by the Royal Bank of Canada, to satisfy CDollars 1.1bn in borrowings. In effect, the founders and controlling shareholders, Mr Reuben Cohen and Mr Leonard Ellen, are left with 10 per cent of the company. Unsecured creditors get 90 per cent of the equity, plus CDollars 21m in new debt securities. Court approval is being sought next month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent from the Information </F> Center of the 107th Chivalrous Motorized Brigade of Gradacac]    [Excerpt] Attacks on the free territory of Gradacac have  lasted all day, since early this morning. The projectiles from  all types of weapons are showering the positions of our fighters  and the central part of the free territory.    [Unidentified correspondent] Three tanks and numerous  mortars, guns, howitzers from all the well-known chetnik  strongholds took part in the attack today. After two infantry  attacks had been successfully repelled, with the enemy suffering  major losses, artillery continued to attack the town and the  entire front. These attacks are mainly indiscriminate, nervous,  and without a particular aim. Stunned by yet another defeat,  the Serbo-fascists have been pounding the town all afternoon.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-STAFFER, MCDONNELL SETTLE; DETAILS SECRET  </P> <P> A former employee of McDonnell Douglas' helicopter manufacturing unit Wednesday  settled a civil fraud suit that had accused the company of overcharging the  Army $175 million on the Apache helicopter program, but his lawyers refused to  reveal the terms of the agreement.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William D. Keller approved the settlement and a  confidentiality agreement providing that its details will be kept secret.  Keller said the secrecy pact was "part of the bargain" that led up to the  settlement and "I'm prepared to honor it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Justice Backed Out  </P> <P> In late July, former employee Rod Stillwell told The Times that McDonnell  Douglas had agreed to pay him nearly $500,000 to settle the case and that all  major issues had been resolved. On Wednesday, Stillwell was not available for  comment. His lawyers, William R. Ramsey and Louis J. Cohen, said they could not  comment, as did Robert Scoular, McDonnell Douglas' lawyer.  </P> <P> The suit was filed under provisions of the False Claims Act that allow a  private person to file a suit on behalf of the government. If there is recovery  of damages in the case, the person gets up to 30% of the money. The rest goes  to the U.S. Treasury.  </P> <P> Stillwell's suit was filed in 1987. The Justice Department at one point joined  the lawsuit, then bowed out, saying there was no evidence that the government  had been damaged. In such circumstances, the statute allows the private  plaintiff to proceed with the case.  </P> <P> The lawyers for both sides issued a joint statement after a brief court hearing  Wednesday afternoon. It said, in part:  </P> <P> "After conducting an extensive investigation, the Department of Justice  withdrew from the case, concluding that there was insufficient evidence that  the alleged acts of the defendants resulted in any damage or injury to the  United States. Consequently, no monies were paid by McDonnell Douglas  Helicopter Co., Hughes Helicopters Inc. or Parker Hannifin Corp. (the other  defendants) for, or in respect of, damages or any other amounts claimed or  which might have been claimed on behalf of the United States."  </P> <P> Other knowledgeable sources said the language in the statement does not mean  that Stillwell might not have received a monetary settlement.  </P> <P> Later in the day, Cohen would add only that "the litigation has been settled  and dismissed to the satisfaction of all parties."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consented to Settlement  </P> <P> Since the suit was filed under the False Claims Act, the Justice Department had  to approve the settlement. Judge Keller initially indicated that papers filed  by McDonnell Douglas concerning the government's approval of the settlement  were not specific enough. So, he had Scoular, McDonnell Douglas' lawyer, place  a call to Justice Department lawyer Stephen Altman in Washington and the judge  spoke to him over a speaker phone.  </P> <P> Altman confirmed that the Justice Department had consented to the settlement.  Keller asked him if the department's reason for agreeing was that "irrespective  of any misfeasance, there had been no damage to the government." Altman  answered yes.  </P> <P> Scoular said the company's negotiations with the government had been conducted  in confidence and asked that the settlement with the government be kept  confidential, too. Altman said the government had not made a confidentiality  agreement with McDonnell Douglas.  </P> <P> Amy Brown, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said Wednesday evening that  McDonnell Douglas, the prime contractor on the helicopter, and Parker Hannifin,  the subcontractor, each agreed to reimburse the Army $14,000 for investigative  costs incurred in connection with the case. She said the two companies also  agreed that they would not pass on to the government "in the form of future  overhead" any costs they incurred during the case.  </P> <P> In addition, Brown said, the two companies told the government that they each  had incurred $115,000 in in-house costs in litigating the case. McDonnell  Douglas told the Justice Department it had incurred $1.3 million in outside  expenses, including legal fees in the case, she said, adding that Parker  Hannifin said its outside costs had been $337,000.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, McDonnell Douglas attempted to have the suit thrown out of  court on grounds that the law under which it was brought was unconstitutional.  But Judge Keller rejected that argument in June, and a federal appeals court on  July 31 declined the company's petition to review the case.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable legal sources said they believed that this was the first  settlement of a False Claims Act suit that had not been made public.  </P></p>

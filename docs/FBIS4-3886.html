			<p>BFN     [Text] Dhaka, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The bangladesh Foreign  Ministry stated here today that the recent visit to China by  Foreign Minister A.S.M. Mustafizur Rahman is "very successful"  and several major achievements were made during his China tour  from April 13-17.    Foreign Secretary Mufleh R. Osmany made the statement at a  regular bi-weekly news briefing to journalists from local and  overseas media.    According to the spokesman, Chinese Premier Li Peng has  accepted an invitation from Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda  Zia to visit this South Asian country in the second half of this  year.    The Chinese side has agreed to buy more Bangladeshi goods in  order to reduce trade imbalance and to continue to extend  economic cooperation, he said.    China has also agreed to finance the construction of the  Rupsa Bridge in Khulna in southwest Bangladesh, which is likely  to cost more than 100 million U.S. dollars, he noted.    During the foreign minister's stay in Beijing, China  reiterated its stance that the water-sharing dispute between  Bangladesh and India should be settled through bilateral  negotiation, the spokesman said.    He added that Bangladesh has also been firm to settle the  dispute through bilateral talks.    At the news conference, the spokesman strongly condemned  Bosnian Serbs' killings and bloodshed activities in Gorazde and  he called on the Organization of Islamic Conference to take  immediate steps for deterring "the continued Serbian aggression".    Referring to the slow pace of the repatriation of Myanmar  [Burmese] refugees from Bangladesh, the spokesman said the  government is now reviewing its process as well as the country's  cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) on the issue.    "They are Myanmar nationals, and sooner or later they have  to  go back," he stressed, insisting that Bangladesh has the  privilege to solve the problem which has cost the country  enormous resources and involved some 700 personnel specially  assigned to deal with the matter.</p>

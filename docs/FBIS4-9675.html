			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- June Diane  Werwitok, a U.S. tourist who has been accused of stealing  children by a group of neighbors in the northern town of San  Cristobal Verapaz, had her "skull and her right arm broken by a  mob of peasants" who tried to lynch her.    A police source told ACAN-EFE today that the 54-year-old  tourist was in that Alta Verapaz Department town when 20  peasants started chasing her because allegedly she had stolen a  child. Diane, who is from Florida State, was able to find  refuge in the town's court building, which was later partially  destroyed when the enraged peasants attacked it with rocks,  sticks, and other objects and set court files on fire.    The incident took place Tuesday. The Army was sent to the  town and gained control of the situation, according to volunteer  firefighters. The source noted that the U.S. woman suffered a  broken skull, her right arm was also broken, and was hit and  stabbed in several parts of her body. After receiving first aid  in San Cristobal Verapaz, the woman was admitted to a Guatemala  City hospital because of the seriousness of the wounds. Diane  was looking for a place to stay in the town when she was  attacked by the peasants, the source reported.    This attack comes 22 days after another U.S. woman, Melisa  Carol Larsen, 37, was almost lynched by Santa Lucia  Cotzumalguapa peasants who accused her of forming part of a band  dedicated to the abduction and trafficking of children. Carol  Larsen was protected by the police and this brought about  serious street demonstrations that resulted in 32 wounded  persons, 52 arrests, and a small police station burned. This  woman was set free a few days later when a court was unable to  establish that she had been involved in the abduction of  children.    The Attorney General's Office revealed today that so far in  1994 it has received 66 files on child-stealing cases. A police  source has informed ACAN-EFE about the arrest of three  Guatemalan women accused of abducting as many children in this  capital.</p>

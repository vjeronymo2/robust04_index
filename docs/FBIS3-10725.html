			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Energy and Mines Minister Guido </F> Nule Amin by Dario Arizmendi; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900"  newscast -- live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] Mr. Minister, is the Colombian  Government going to reverse itself in its negotiating process  with the Cuban Government about the possibility of selling fuel  to Castro's island beginning in June, as you suggested to  Caracol a few weeks ago?    [Nule] Good morning, Dario. The situation is as follows: We  are continuing the same process that we explained a few weeks  ago following our visit to the island. The negotiations  continue; we expect that there is a possibility of selling to  the island between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil daily  beginning in July, [as heard] but this is subject to  negotiations, analyses, and evaluations of the terms of these  negotiations; that is, a review of purely trade terms, which is  a guarantee that Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise]  usually requests. The process continues. No contract has been  signed yet. We have clarified this already, but the  negotiations continue, and we may or may not reach an agreement.    [Arizmendi] Mr. Minister, won't the boycott that Miami  Cubans  announced make the Colombian Government reverse itself on the  possibility of exporting oil and other oil products?    [Nule] No, we have not thought about it. Personally, I think  this would be very serious, because it would mean subjecting any  commercial activity [peticion], in this case a commercial  activity of the country, to pressure by a very respectable  group. [sentence as heard] I believe, however, that this is  not the way to proceed. Among other reasons, this type of  negotiation with the island has also been held with many other  countries that maintain embassies in and business with the  United States, and there have been no reprisals. I do not see  why there would be reprisals against Colombia, nor do I see why  Colombia would have to change its trade policies due to, I  repeat, pressure from a group, regardless of how respectable it  might be.    [Arizmendi] The front page of EL TIEMPO newspaper today, Mr.  Minister, carries a report stating that the Simon Bolivar  National Guerrilla Coordinating Board was in Havana at an  intercontinental summit that was also reportedly attended by a  diplomat, a bishop, other prominent personalities of the  continent, and of course, from Colombia, persons who have been  part of subversion. Would this fact, if proven, stop the  negotiation process with Cuba?    [Nule] I do not know, Dario. We at the Mines and Energy  Ministry deal with nonpolitical issues, much less with foreign  policy. We know that we have diplomatic ties with Cuba, and  this allows our trade relationship and do not understand why it  cannot be. If there is any inconvenience, we will be  appropriately notified in due time, but I do not think it is....  [pauses] besides, I am neither aware of this nor is this among  my responsibilities.    [Arizmendi] According to the estimates of the ministry you  head, Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule Amin, how much fuel  would Colombia sell to Cuba during the second half of the year  should the negotiations materialize?    [Nule] Should negotiations materialize, we would be talking  about some 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil per day. We need to  multiply this by a price that could be between $14 and $15 per  day [figures as heard]; that is, we could be talking about some  $5 million per month.</p>

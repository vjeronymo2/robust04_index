			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Jobless may spur exodus from Israel ISRAEL'S central bank yesterday warned that the country could face unprecedented emigration and unemployment approaching 20 per cent of the workforce if the government did not quickly enact economic reforms to cope with a wave of immigration by Soviet Jews. Prof Michael Bruno, governor of the Bank of Israel, also linked the issue to present efforts by the US to mediate a Middle East peace settlement. He said Israel risked losing vital US assistance for raising the huge funds the country will require to finance immigration if the peace process failed. 'US readiness to help finance (immigrant absorption) has a significant importance to our ability to raise money in the international financial marketplace and a greater expert than myself would tell you what the conditions are under which the US will be ready to invest here,' said Prof Bruno, who is due to leave his post shortly. A 60-page bank plan for absorption of Soviet immigrants, expected to total more than 400,000 by the end of this year, called for a series of radical reforms as well as short-term measures to boost employment and improve infrastructure. It said that as many as 200,000 immigrants and additional native Israelis might leave the country, and unemployment could almost double within two years if such steps were not taken. It called for cuts in taxation on business and employment, the scrapping of labour market rigidities, greater capital market freedoms, and a more liberal foreign trade regime. Mr Bruno complained that a government plan last September to enact a number of these prescriptions had never been carried out. 'Non-implementation of the policies would prevent the possibility of fully enjoying the fruits of the immigration. The pace of productive growth would be too slow, unemployment would grow to dangerous dimensions, followed by growing emigration,' the bank's plan said.</p>

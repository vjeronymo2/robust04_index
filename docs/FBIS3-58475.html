			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stefano Livadiotti and Maurizio Maggi: "And </F> After Ciampi, Carlo Azeglio"]    [Text] In L'ESPRESSO's exclusive poll of  Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry]  members, Segni's support is reduced by half, and 93 out of 100  oppose Berlusconi. The industrialists believe the former  governor of the Bank of Italy should remain in office. They do  not see the economy recovering before 1995 and fear there will  be massive layoffs.    The industrialists have finally decided that the best option  is to stick with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. The head of government  may not be the authentic magician of economic recovery that some  had expected, but he has succeeded in achieving more than one  concrete result. And after all, there is no alternative. The  year 1994, in fact, will also be a gloomy year. The production  system will function at a minimum level, and in the meantime,  unemployment will continue to flourish. In this context, the  helm of Italy, Inc., should be entrusted to safe hands. It is  therefore not advisable to run risks, as for example by backing  a Silvio Berlusconi who vacillates between the neofascists of  Gianfranco Fini and the Lega troops of Umberto Bossi.    The results of the L'ESPRESSO poll that interviewed half of  the Confindustria assembly (77 out of 157 members of the  council) demonstrate that the Italian entrepreneurs have a  specific objective and are marching in close formation to attain  it. Here, point by point, are the names of the men on whom the  industrialists have decided to put their money, what the  industrialists' predictions are for 1994, and what solution they  are proposing for emerging from the tunnel of the recession.  <H5>  Ciampi for President [preceding words in English] </H5>   After passing through a minor crisis of credibility, the  former governor of the Bank of Italy is beginning to regain  support in the business community. When he was sworn in at  Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister], he was greeted  with enthusiasm: a poll L'ESPRESSO conducted in May 1993 gave  him--on faith--a 7.0 approval rating. A slow decline then began,  and in the space of two months his rating dropped to 6.6,  leveling off at 6.4 in September. This trend has now been  reversed. The passage of the budget bill on schedule, and the  success obtained by the sale of the Italian Credit Bank (after  the sale, 52 percent of the industrialists said they were  convinced that the privatizations will actually be carried out)  caused Ciampi's rating to begin slowly to rise again, to 6.6.  And a majority (more than 52 percent) are asking him--in a loud  voice--to remain at Palazzo Chigi.    "The government has perhaps lacked decision-making  initiative  to some extent," Giancarlo Lombardi, a textile manufacturer and  respected member of the Confindustria council, maintains, "but  you have to give the prime minister credit for keeping the  promises he made and for performing with a certain style."  Walter Mandelli, the former vice president of the entrepreneurs,  agrees. "The head of government and his cabinet," he says, "have  given proof of their good faith by holding fast to an economic  policy line that is widely shared." Even Ernesto Gismondi, vice  president of CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor], is  in favor of giving him a passing grade. "In the temporary phase  that began with the earthquake caused by the kickback scandal,"  he says, "Ciampi is successfully performing the function of  administrator of a company that is in receivership."    A better job can be done: This is the slogan of his  unconditional critics who continue to be represented in the  Confindustria assembly. "The former governor of the Bank of  Italy has not measured up to expectations," explains  Confindustria council member Paolo Passanti, who is associated  with the organization's research center. "He has not been  sufficiently courageous in making decisions on the more  important questions, as for example the problem of how to  contain the cost of money and combat unemployment."    In any case, the financial statement for the past three  months also shows a favorable balance for Ciampi. Specifically,  in the sample polled by L'ESPRESSO, those who say they are  disappointed by the performance of the former governor of the  Bank of Italy dropped to 32 percent from the 38 percent recorded  in September, while those who judge him to be more capable than  they could have anticipated rose during the same period to 14.5  percent from 9 percent.  <H5>  Professor: You Flunked </H5>   Four passing grades and two failing grades: Two-thirds of  the  team of economic ministers got a passing grade from the  industrialists who gave the exam. Judged to be the most capable  was Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, who was largely credited  with getting the privatizations under way (he scored a 6.3). He  shared the awards platform, however, with Budget Minister Luigi  Spaventa and Industry Minister Paolo Savona, each with a 6.2.  Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta also passed, albeit by the  skin of his teeth (with a 6.0).    Thumbs down, however, on the two Socialist ministers, Franco  Gallo (Finance) and Gino Giugni (Labor). As far as the  industrialists are concerned, these two can stay at home  permanently.  <H5>  Go Back, Sir </H5>   If Ciampi is the best player on the field, the  industrialists' backup is named Mario Segni. But because the  referendum leader could not decide which side to take or with  whom to ally himself, he began to lose support: in June 1992, 49  percent of the entrepreneurs wanted him in Palazzo Chigi,  whereas his support has now been reduced to a more modest 25.7  percent.    After Ciampi and Segni, there is a void. The PDS [Democratic  Party of the Left], to be sure, is no longer a problem. Almost  three out of four entrepreneurs insist that they would not be  frightened if it were installed in the control room. For  example, Lombardi maintains that "despite some contradictions, a  significant part of the PDS has opted for a pro-market policy,  and if it were to be invested with the responsibilities of  government, it would be constrained to do everything possible to  keep its promises." But even if the former Communist Party no  longer causes fear, there is little confidence in the ability of  its leadership [preceding word in English] to lead: in the poll,  for example, PDS Secretary Achille Occhetto received not a  single vote for prime minister, and only three out of 100  industrialists indicated that they were fans of Chamber of  Deputies President Giorgio Napolitano.    The doors are also barred against Silvio Berlusconi. When in  recent weeks he announced that he was prepared to sacrifice  himself and take the field personally to halt the advance of the  left, His TV Eminence [pun on Italian word emittenza]  was, as usual, outspoken: "I want the leaders of industry, he  said." But they--the entrepreneurs--do not appear to be as  eager. Indeed, the poll results speak quite frankly; they say  that 93 percent of the Confindustria assembly has no intention  whatsoever of backing the boss of Fininvest. Not only do they  not intend to support the gentleman from Arcore, but they do not  even want him as the head of government, inasmuch as among his  own colleagues, "Burlesquoni"--as the authoritative ECONOMIST  renamed him in a headline--garnered only a handful of votes.  "Let us rise up and join hands," says Forza Italia, the party  song of his new party. If it were to be played in the hall where  Confindustria's council meets, 93 entrepreneurs out of 100 would  remain seated comfortably in their armchairs. In short, there  would be too few to play ring-around-the-rosey.  <H5>  Things Look Bad From Here </H5>   Whether it be Ciampi or Segni, what is wanted is an  authoritative leader. The fact is that in 1994 we will need  binoculars to see the economic recovery ahead. The forecasts  developed by Confindustria's top leadership and presented on  Tuesday, 14 December, speak of a 1.6 percent growth of the GNP,  sufficient to make it possible basically to maintain employment  levels and, according to associates of Confindustria President  Luigi Abete, the year should end with a loss of only 20,000  jobs, equal to less than 0.1 percent. The rank and file of the  entrepreneurs, however, do not put much stock in these  estimates. "Abete and his people have to appear to be  optimistic," Enzo Giustino, president of the Campania  industrialists, explains, "because if they told how things  really are, they would wind up scaring the bankers to death and  cause the stock market to crash."    The picture painted by the 77 industrialists polled by  L'ESPRESSO was, therefore, a darker one, although they  acknowledged that the worst may have passed. In September,  almost 90 percent of the companies said they had an assured  supply of work for only the six ensuing months, whereas today  that figure has dropped to 75 percent. They are unwilling to bet  so much as half a lira that a substantial recovery will take  place in 1994. In fact, six out of ten entrepreneurs say that  Italy, Inc., will have a growth rate next year of no more than 1  percent.    On the other hand, if the recovery is delayed, the  hemorrhage  of jobs will continue. On this front, the optimism of the  Confindustria leadership is truly at odds with the forecasts of  its rank and file: two out of three of those polled said they  are sure that the personnel of their companies will suffer a new  and heavy blow.  <H5>  How To Stay Afloat </H5>   The Italian industrialists' prescription for getting through  1994 intact--and for duly keeping their appointment with  economic recovery--consists of only a few points.    On the fiscal front, the entrepreneurs are calling for a  decisive crackdown on those categories that have always been  suspected of being involved most heavily in the practice of tax  evasion: a list headed by professionals, followed closely by  merchants and artisans. However, the proposal that all unearned  income be included on "Form 740"--so that all such income would  be taxed on a progressive basis--is also gaining support: 48  percent of the sample said they now favored this option,  probably out of a conviction that the stock exchange would have  everything to gain from a reform of this type.    More taxes, but also less spending. According to the  industrialists, the government's axe should come down hard on  the public sector and not spare either public health, pensions,  education, or--why not?--the Armed Forces. It is a veritable  declaration of war.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / A dog's life at Buck House: As they say in Europe EVERY foreign correspondent in London has seen the BBC film that celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne, Elizabeth R, or Isabel R as she is known in Spain. Isabel, Felipe, Carlos and Ana are familiar figures there: Spitting Image, the coarse British satirical television programme, has a wide audience. Such are the realities of the New Europe. So Enric Gonzalez in El Pais was writing for a well-informed readership in his useful summary of the Queen's decades. 'Elizabeth has seen the disappearance of the Empire, the hard recovery of the 1950s, the cultural revolution of the '60s, the trade union torments of the '70s and the petty bourgeois Thatcherite insurrection of the '80s without altering her routine.' The heart of this routine is tea. The Queen always takes tea with her corgis, 'for whom she personally mixes meat and biscuits which the little animals eat on the red carpets of her private homes.' Corgis were fully researched for Bernhard Heimrich's account in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. 'Corgis are short-legged, bustling little dogs from Wales, which in the handbook are described as ideal for the farmyard, vigilant guardians and good comrades. The queen has six corgis, which she feeds with meat and biscuits every day at half past four.' Heimrich finds the British almost as interesting as the corgis. He says that a third of us dream about the Queen, and most of the dreams include drinking tea with the monarch - sans corgis. So we enter the British subconscious, and a dark place it proves to be: 'The second surprise (after the dreams) is that it is mainly night in the Reich of Elizabeth II. This has been recognised for some time but has not been fully accepted. On the Empire of her predecessor the sun never set. The four decades of Queen Elizabeth II encompass the British generation which has to abandon this dream, and the Queen as a dream figure behind the walls of her palace in the middle of British reality, is there to help.' Le Monde's correspondent, Laurent Zecchini, emerges as a hitherto unimaginable entity - a French Barbara Pym. He too reports the dream of taking tea with the Queen. 'In the collective unconscious of her people, the Queen keeps her place at the centre of a pile of useless little things, dusty but essential, which make Great Britain in the eyes of so many people the vestal priestess of the cult of memories . . .' The elegiac theme then really takes hold: 'Forty years, and always that certain smile - a little fixed, this great professionalism, this intangible etiquette, these prime ministers who succeed one another for the invariable tea and conversations of no importance.' The Italians care little for psychological speculation, and less for tea, or even corgis. They are interested in not paying income tax. So in Il Sole-24 Ore, Alessandro Merli, with his usual good taste, celebrated 40 glorious years of getting away with it. He reverently asked: 'Is the Queen of England the UK's biggest tax evader?' Merli noted that earlier monarchs had indeed paid income tax. He then ran through the figures on the Queen's wealth and income and concluded she could well afford to pay. But he has fears about the succession: her non-payment of tax 'does not mean that Prince Charles, who likes to appear in the forefront of 'inner city' causes, will not start doing it again.' That will not satisfy the royalist Zecchini in Le Monde: 'The Queen will have to find a recipe for a sort of neo-monarchy for the next century, an alchemy which will bring together modernity and tradition. In the next decade the Queen will celebrate her golden jubilee and her 75 years. Until then, without any doubt, 'God Save the Queen.''

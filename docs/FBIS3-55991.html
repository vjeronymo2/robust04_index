"A personal meeting between the presidents of the two  countries after a new constitutional and political reality has  emerged in Russia is very important," he said.    Stankevich believes that until recently the United States  had  supported the most radical variant of economic reform in Russia.  However, the "October-December crisis" (October revolt and  December 12 elections which he also considers as a crisis) has  shown that such variant has clear-cut social limits. Judging by  many statements of American officials, the United States is  ready to introduce considerable changes in its relations with  Russia and stop supporting radical reform based on shock  therapy, he added.    Stankevich stressed that such corrections will constitute  the  subject of discussions during President Bill Clinton's upcoming  visit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MELCO) has  developed the world's first single crystal thin film for  application in semiconductors using a carbon material,  ``fullerene (C60).'' Fullerene has been getting much attention  recently as a new electronic material. A lcm x lcm single  crystal thin film was produced by depositing ionized molecules  on a substrate. The new thin film has high heat and radiation  resistances and can be made into large scale integrated  circuits, thus enabling development of a new semiconductor  substrate. Si and GaAs semiconductors have been available up to  now. MELCO expects the new single crystal thin film to be useful  for more complex material research on fullerene which is still  unknown in many respects.    Mica (potashmica) at 200C was used as the substrate  material to develop a fullerene single crystal thin film.  Fullerene molecules were deposited on this substrate by the  ionized cluster beam (ICB) method. The ICB method calls for  ionization of clusters such as molecules and atoms first, then  accelerating the ion movement by applying voltage, and finally  depositing the ionized clusters onto the substrate. Using this  method, fullerene molecules can be uniformly aligned. Proper  control of ionization and acceleration conditions made  production of a large single crystal thin film possible, and  this is the key to practical application for semiconductor  materials.    It was confirmed through transmission electron microscope  (TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) that 15 nanometer thick  single crystal thin film was formed on the entire mica  substrate, lcm x lcm. It was also confirmed that fullerene  molecules employed epitxial crystal growth, which is the  formation process in which the film molecules are uniformly  lined up according to the crystal orientation of the substrate.    At present, the molecular beam deposition method is used  mainly to form fullerene molecule film. However, this method is  useful only for polycrystal thin film formation. Formation of  single crystal thin films has been reported, but the size is  limited to a little over 100 nanometer each side at a maximum.    MELCO confirmed for the first time in 1992 that fullerene  molecules can be used for semiconductor materials. Their Central  Research Laboratory and Materials and Electronic Devices  Laboratory have been jointly conducting research on commercially  viable size single crystal thin film. MELCO will try to develop  a transistor device using this single crystal thin film in the  future. MELCO claims that this new single crystal thin film will  be useful for more complex material research on fullerene.  Polycrystal thin films turned out to be not as useful for this  purpose.  <H5>  Wide Application Potential--Useful for Optical Material </H5>   (Commentary) The history of research on fullerene is quite  short. Up to now, research has been focused mainly on the search  for new types of fullerene and basic properties. The newly  achieved result not only contributes to proper measurement of  fullerene molecule properties but also shows how they might be  used in semiconductors. The research on new carbon materials has  gone beyond the basic science stage and made progress in  materials development which consciously aims at applications.    ``Carbon nano tubes,'' ultra fine straw-like substances,  have  also been found. This is also a new kind of carbon material,  which belongs to the same group as the fullerene molecules. The  fullerene molecules are shaped like a hollow soccer ball, while  carbon nano tubes are characterized by a tube-like shape with  layers of carbon atom thin skins. R&amp;D on the new carbon  materials is still at the primary stage, but the application  potential is already considered to be extremely high. In  addition to semiconductor materials, optical materials, high  performance catalysts, and micro machines are under  consideration to name just a few. Because of their unique  shapes, the new carbon materials are a big challenge for  researchers.</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Call for more inner-city land sales MR John Redwood, the inner cities minister, is pressing urban development corporations to step up sales of land for low-cost housing or for other uses to supplement their grant incomes. The government believes that some UDCs have held back on land sales in the hope of capitalising on an improved market for commercial or industrial uses when a recovery comes. But Mr Redwood is urging the 11 English corporations to accelerate their disposals of land, particularly to private home builders, in order to help stimulate the construction industry and to increase the supply of affordable homes. With land values depressed, he believes that there is now a good opportunity for developers to produce highly competitive 'starter' flats at retail prices of between Pounds 35,000 and Pounds 40,000. 'I am very keen to see UDCs sell land in the current market conditions to developers who can make housing for sale available at low market prices,' the minister said. UDCs are currently preparing their annual plans and have registered Mr Redwood's proposal. However they also point out that in the current conditions the market for new properties is finite. Mr Martin Eagland, the chief executive of Leeds' UDC, said that in his area the recent authorisation of a 300-unit residential development, much of it low cost, meant that most local-market demand was probably satisfied. Of the 1,300 acres in the Leeds Development Corporation's area, it directly held 90 acres of which only 20 per cent would be suitable for preliminary study as potential residential development. Mr Eagland added, however, that Mr Redwood's plan would be closely examined, not least as the corporation's grant has been cut from Pounds 13.6m in 1991-92 to an estimated Pounds 4m in the coming year.</p>

Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan once had close relations  with  Vietnam. "They contributed greatly to helping the Vietnamese  people fight invading imperialist forces" for national defense.    "Following great political upheavals, which climaxed with  the  crumbling of the Soviet Union, the relations of cooperation  between Vietnam and CIS member countries have become stunted  somewhat because of the great difficulties encountered by these  friendly countries. But the status of the friendships and the  progress of international relations of cooperation in conformity  with the epochal trend have become an indispensable demand of  the peoples of our country and these friendly countries.    "We are very pleased to note that inheriting the traditional  relations between the former Soviet Union and Vietnam, the  Russian Federation has officially reestablished it diplomatic  relations with Vietnam since January 1992. It has continued to  help us complete the construction of various projects left  unfinished by the former Soviet Union. Its relations of  cooperation under the new format and new situation have been  expanded to many new areas. The Vietnam-Russia  Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Trade, Scientific,  and Technological Cooperation has been established and it has  held three annual meetings. The two sides have signed a number  of important documents such as the agreement on cooperation in  the areas of communications, transportation, civil aviation, and  maritime; the agreement on investment cooperation between the  two countries; the agreement on investment protection and  avoidance of double taxation; and the protocol on cooperation  between the two countries' state banks and trade ministries.    "Russia has carried on the work of the former Soviet Union  at  the Vietsopetro oil joint enterprise and the Hoa Binh  Hydroelectric Power Plant. It has helped upgrade various power  plants. Direct relations of trade exchanges and economic  cooperation under various forms such as partnerships and joint  ventures between various localities of the two countries have  also enjoyed favorable conditions. Now in Vietnam there have  been many partnership enterprises and joint ventures between the  two countries, whose status of operations is very satisfactory  as it meets the needs, aspirations, and new conditions of each  country.    "His Excellency Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yarov said in  his recent visit to Vietnam that through its economic  cooperation with Vietnam, the role of the Russian Federation in  Southeast Asia has been asserted. And it is this cooperation  that has contributed to consolidating peace and spurring  cooperation between the Russian Federation and other countries  in the region."    Vietnam and Ukraine have official established diplomatic  relations since 23 January 1992. Many delegations from various  echelons and sectors of the two countries have since exchanged  visits to share views on various possible areas of cooperation.  "During these visits, many cooperative agreements have been  signed such as the agreement on exemption of visas for travel by  citizens of the two countries, the agreement on the  establishment of the Vietnam-Ukraine Intergovernmental  Commission for Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technological  Cooperation, and so forth."    During his visit to Vietnam last April, the Ukrainian  foreign  minister expressed the fine sentiments of the government and  people of Ukraine to Vietnam. He said: "Ukraine is very keen  to develop its relations of cooperation with Vietnam."    As for the Central Asian Republic of Kazakhstan, it shares  some similar features with Vietnam. Vietnam and Kazakhstan have  established their diplomatic relations since 29 June 1992. "The  two sides have exerted efforts to promote relations of  cooperation in areas from which they have advantages such as the  production of light industry goods, the cultivation and  processing of tropical farm products, and the manufacture of  spare parts for some machine tools."    It can be said that the first visit by Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet to Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan has been long expected  by the three peoples. All the people assert that the potential  for the development of relations of friendship between Vietnam  and these countries is very great. It is their desire to  jointly exploit this potential for their common,  mutually-beneficial goal of contributing to the consolidation of  world peace.    "It is because of this that the friendly visit of Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet will be of great significance as it will  open up a new page in the relations of friendship among Vietnam,  Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan."</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / The Lex Column: ABF The strong rise in Associated British Foods' shares this year was prompted by hopes it might mobilise its chronically under-geared balance sheet and buy something big. With some Pounds 2bn of shareholders' funds and Pounds 356m of net cash, Mr Garry Weston certainly has plenty of dough to play with. But ABF remained quiet about any such intentions yesterday as Mr Weston kept playing his famously long game. So the market chose to fret instead about the continuing stodginess of ABF's milling and baking activities. One day ABF will generate a decent return on its Pounds 400m of assets in that area. But many suns will set before that day arrives. At least, the recovery in Irish retailing is providing some encouragement, while British Sugar is still proving its worth. Most of the moving parts at ABF are therefore at the margin. ABF took a Pounds 29m profit from writing up the value of its investment in Berisford and selling some of its nil-paid rights. But that was offset by the slump in investment income from Pounds 45m to Pounds 17m. The previous year's numbers were flattered by the exceptional markets which followed the pound's removal from the ERM. Even so, the returns ABF is currently generating on its cash balances look none too clever. ABF incurred some capital losses in the bond market. It would have got a better return leaving its money on deposit in the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. Given the importance of investment income to group profits, ABF should disclose where it now intends to puts its money.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Iceland's trade policy 'to blame for downturn' Iceland's trade and industrial policies have contributed to a squandering of its valuable fish resources, some of the world's highest food prices and a damaging bias against the manufacturing sector, says a report by Gatt economists published yesterday. Iceland, with a population of about 260,000, grew prosperous in the post-war period on the back of the fishing industry, which accounts for about 17 per cent of gross domestic product and 75-80 per cent of merchandise exports. However, since 1988 the economy has floundered, due partly to recession in Europe but also to cutbacks in the cod catch. The Gatt report says free-of-charge access to marine resources and state supports have led to over-investment and overfishing and the Icelandic government has been forced to reduce cod catches to replenish stocks. Membership of the European Economic Area, the giant free trade zone spanning western Europe which came into force last month should help the fisheries sector by eliminating most tariffs on fish exports to the EEA's 18 members, the report notes. However, Iceland's uncompetitive agricultural sector is likely to come under increasing pressure from imports from the EEA. Without government support, now being cut, the farm sector will inevitably shrink, Gatt says. The transfer of resources to manufacturing would help stabilise the economy, now vulnerable to changes in fish catches and prices. But the report expresses some doubts about Iceland's plans to base future economic development on energy intensive industries. Gatt says these make a much smaller contribution to net export earnings and national value added than fisheries because most of the raw materials and equipment have to be imported.</p>

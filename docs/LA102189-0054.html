			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY'S FALL POSSIBLY AVOIDABLE, EXPERT SAYS;  </P> <P> SAFETY: CONTRADICTING HIS BOSS, A STATE ENGINEER SAYS THE KNOW-HOW HAS BEEN  AVAILABLE FOR TWO DECADES.  </P> <P> A top State Department of Transportation engineer told The Times Friday that  technology exists -- and has existed for nearly 20 years -- that might have  prevented the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, where at least 32  people were killed during Tuesday's earthquake.  </P> <P> The engineer, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified,  contradicted Caltrans chief engineer William E. Schaefer, who has repeatedly  claimed that no such technology exists.  </P> <P> The engineer, a high-ranking seismic expert familiar with the Nimitz Freeway,  is the first such expert within the transportation department to confirm claims  made by private structural engineers that state highway officials failed to  take adequate steps to strengthen roadway overpasses after the 1971 Sylmar  quake, which collapsed freeway bridges in the San Fernando Valley and took 58  lives.  </P> <P> "The technology has been around since San Fernando," said the engineer, who  said the freeway columns were not strengthened because of "budget limitations"  and "priority" considerations.  </P> <P> "There is only so much money," said the engineer. "You just get caught in  trying to spread the money to where it is best used."  </P> <P> The engineer estimated that it would cost $100,000 a column to strengthen the  Nimitz Freeway. The roadway has more than 100 columns.  </P> <P> Although the columns supporting the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway  gave way during Tuesday's quake, it is not clear whether the columns themselves  were the weak link. At least one seismic expert said it is possible that some  other aspect of the structure, such as the joints that link the roadway to the  columns, failed first.  </P> <P> Caltrans is planning to bolster newer single-column freeway supports by  wrapping the uprights with steel reinforcement bars, but Schaefer maintains it  is not known whether this method will work for the older multiple column  supports -- such as those used on the double-deck Cypress Viaduct of the Nimitz  Freeway that collapsed.  </P> <P> "We don't have the technical knowledge, nor does it exist anywhere in the  world," Schaefer said earlier this week.  </P> <P> On Friday, Schaefer said the state has developed a steel jacket that can be  wrapped around concrete columns to provide earthquake resistance for newer  freeways. But that technique works only on those highways that are supported by  rows of single columns, not roadways, such as the Nimitz, that rest upon  multiple columns, he said.  </P> <P> "If we understood how to put those same steel jackets on the multiple-column  structures, that probably would have worked," Schaefer said. "We don't know how  to do that yet."  </P> <P> Schaefer acknowledged that the problem of reinforcing multiple columns could  have been solved by now -- probably preventing the collapse on the Nimitz -- if  the department had made that dilemma its top priority after the Sylmar quake.  </P> <P> But with limited funds, giving first priority to structures such as the Nimitz  would have meant delaying another project aimed at ensuring that roadbed  sections on other elevated highways did not separate during quakes. That  project, recently completed, prevented the collapse of an untold number of  freeways during the 1987 Whittier earthquake, said James Roberts, chief of  Caltrans' structures division.  </P> <P> This roadbed project, costing $53.6 million, was envisioned as the first phase  of a larger program to strengthen highway overpasses. It entailed tying roadbed  sections of bridges together with steel cables. Caltrans said that roadbed work  included the Nimitz.  </P> <P> A second phase, which is just beginning, called for strengthening single-column  supports of freeway spans. Overpasses supported by multiple-column supports  were to be done later.  </P> <P> But even as the first phase of the plan neared completion in 1985, and long  before the second phase began, Caltrans assured the public that California's  bridges were safe.  </P> <P> Ray J. Zelinski, design engineer in charge of seismic concerns and reinforced  concrete for Caltrans, said in an Aug. 8, 1985, Associated Press story: "We  feel all the bridges will go through an event (earthquake) without collapsing."  Zelinski went on to say, according to the article, that even older bridges  would withstand a catastrophic 8.3 earthquake -- more than 30 times stronger  than Tuesday's temblor.  </P> <P> "I made the quote and I don't deny it," Zelinsky said Friday. "I felt very  confident at the time." He said that he had been instructed by superiors and  attorneys not to comment further.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian expressed anger when he learned of the collapse of the  Nimitz Freeway and his spokesman said the governor was assured by Caltrans that  the freeways would withstand an earthquake of Tuesday's magnitude. On Friday,  Deukmejian's chief of staff said the governor would have ordered the structure  closed if he had known of the danger.  </P> <P> "But we were never told that," Michael R. Frost said. "There was no indication  ever that something like this would occur. Something obviously went very, very  wrong and we're determined to find out what it is, so we can prevent it from  happening again."  </P> <P> But the Professional Engineers in California Government said Friday in a  scathing news release that if Deukmejian is looking for someone to blame, "he  needn't look any further than his own bathroom mirror."  </P> <P> "Year after year, Caltrans requested funding to hire the staff needed to do its  work," said the organization, which represents state government engineers in  salary negotiations. "Instead, the governor imposed hiring freezes and budget  cutbacks . . . . No wonder that now, 18 years after the Sylmar quake, a . . .  project to strengthen these bridges is only one-third complete."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported Friday that a 1982 report by the state  Department of Mines and Geology had warned that the soil beneath the freeway  section that collapsed could liquefy in a much bigger quake, that with a  magnitude of 8.3. Tuesday's quake was magnitude 6.9.  </P> <P> "The hydraulic fills used to construct miles of freeway along the east shore of  the (San Francisco Bay) in Alameda County may liquefy during heavy shaking,  with long sections becoming totally impassable," said the report to the  Governor's Emergency Task Force on Earthquake Preparedness.  </P> <P> "I don't know if our people ever saw that particular report," chief  transportation spokesman Jim Drago said. "One thing I can tell you is we're  assembling all soil studies and everything else that might help us understand  what happened."  </P></p>

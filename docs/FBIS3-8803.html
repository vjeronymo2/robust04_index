			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by "vac": "1993--The Fourth </F> Year of the Reform"]  <H5>  [11 Mar p 7] </H5>   [Text] The dominant feature of the economic development was  stabilization; maintaining the balance and the trend to  dynamically reinforce it on the macroeconomic level. The  partition of the CSFR did not manifest itself in the Czech  Republic by any obvious economic problems. The monetary policy  caught the impact of the currency division in the first quarter  and maintained the stability of the currency, including its rate  of exchange. Favorable foreign currency reserves have been  established. The volume of exports grew significantly. The  economic standard measured by the volume of the GNP remained  basically at the 1992 level. The economic structure changed  only through the influence of private enterprise. Because of  the needs of the open economy of the Czech state, the structure  of large industry has not changed favorably.    The trend of the GNP development was responded to the  aggregate demand that indicated a recovery of economic activity.  In comparison with 1992, retail sales grew in 1993 by 1 percent  in constant prices, services soared by 15 percent, investment  demand rose 17 percent (in the first to third quarters of 1993,  in comparison with the same period a year earlier, it will  decline in the fourth quarter because of the huge increase in  the fourth quarter of 1992), and exports grew by 20 percent (by  approximately 11 percent, including Slovakia). Part of the  increased demand was covered by a stock reduction. The  aggregate supply from the main production sectors remained below  the 1992 level: Industrial output declined by 5.3 percent,  construction output by 7.5 percent, and agricultural output by  0.8 percent. So far, the changes in the general structure of  industrial production have not manifested themselves  significantly, which is demonstrated in the large setbacks in  several industrial sectors with a high degree of labor input.  The exceptions, like the manufacture of cars and some other  products, could not, overall, reverse the still-low  competitiveness of engineering production and the consumer  industry.    The manufacture of goods declined in comparison with 1992 in  all sectors of industry (in organizations with 25 or more  employees). The production of goods declined on a year-to-year  basis more than 10 percent in mining nonenergy raw materials,  the textile and garments industries, wooden goods manufacture,  the production and processing of stone and ceramics, and  particularly in the manufacture of machines and instruments.  Among the other sectors of industry, the lowest production  decline was registered in the manufacture of leather and leather  goods, the manufacture of rubber goods, and plastic goods  production--less that 2 percent each.    The decisive and still-growing share in industrial  production  belongs to food and condiments manufacture (16.5 percent);  power, gas, and water production (10.8 percent); metal and metal  goods production (14.3 percent); and vehicle manufacture (8.4  percent). In addition to the aforementioned sectors with a low  pace of production, the share of the manufacture of electrical  and optical instruments also declined (4.1 percent) so that,  together with the manufacture of machines and instruments (share  of 7.7 percent) and vehicle production, the share of the former  engineering and electrical engineering industries reaches  approximately 20 percent.    The small enterprises (with staffs of fewer than 25) and  natural persons, registered or not registered in the enterprise  register, demonstrated much greater economic activity.  According to a Czech Statistical Office estimate, the  production of small enterprises and individuals increased by 20  percent on a year-to-year basis, while the production in  organizations with more than 25 employees declined by 7.4  percent. The small business managed to increase the volume of  output in construction by 1.5 percent, while production in large  enterprises declined 10.1 percent.    The relationship between the growth of labor productivity  and  average wages did not develop favorably. While the GDP declined  1 percent, the average nominal wages in the economy increased by  25 percent and real wages by 3.5 percent; the productivity of  labor in industry declined 1.3 percent, while nominal wages rose  23.8 percent and real wages 2.5 percent; and, in construction,  the 12.2 percent decline in productivity compares with a 28.6  percent increase in nominal wages and 6.5 percent in real wages  (all in comparison of 1993 with 1992).    The rate of inflation reached 20.8 percent in comparison  with  1992. It has been affected, from the very beginning of the  year, by the transfer to the value-added tax, which was  reflected in an 8-percent price increase. If we adjust the rate  of inflation, taking away this effect, the inflation trend would  reach less than 1 percent per month. While overall consumer  prices rose 18.2 percent between December 1992 and December  1993, the prices of food products rose 13.2 percent and nonfood  products 18 percent, catering 21.9 percent, and services 25.3  percent. Manufacturing prices in industry rose 11.4 percent;  construction 26.9 percent; railroad, river, and air-cargo  transport 29.5 percent; communications 28.9 percent; and farm  products on average for the year 6.2 percent.    The political stability, continuing the favorable acceptance  of the economic reform and the economic development by a  majority of the population, and a relatively very low rate of  unemployment were the main reasons for social accord. The  overall unemployment rate of 3.5 percent indicates that the  fundamental material restructuring has not yet begun.  <H5>  [11 Mar p 3] </H5>   [Text] Foreign demand was boosted by undervaluing the rate  of exchange of the koruna [Kc], which is almost triple the  purchase parity. Exports, excluding exports to Slovakia, rose 20  percent in comparison with 1992; including Slovakia, it grew,  according to the estimate, by more than 11 percent. Imports,  because of the high volume of imports in 1992 before the  currency division, increased 2.7 percent, excluding imports from  Slovakia; including the estimate for Slovakia, it would be  between 1 and 3 percent lower than in 1992. The 1993 trade  balance ended with a surplus of Kc5.9 billion--without Slovakia,  with a deficit of Kc3.7 billion.    The favorable development of the real trade relations, which  reached the value of 104.1 percent, was achieved by a 2-percent  increase of export prices and a reduction of the prices of  imported goods by 1.7 percent. Projected into the volumes of  exports and imports (without Slovakia), the price changes in  1993 brought Kc12 billion to the Czech economy in comparison  with the price levels of 1992.    The largest trading partner was Germany: Its share of  imports  was 25.1 percent and of exports 26.9 percent.    The surplus on the current account of the balance of  payments  in convertible currency reached $620 million (approximately Kc18  billion). The convertible currency trade deficit was made up,  and the source of the surplus was the surplus of services and  transfers of private and enterprise foreign currency funds. In  services, tourism (foreign currency income from foreigners  reached $1.3 billion) and gas transit were the sectors most  responsible for the surplus.    Foreign currency reserves in the entire banking system rose  at the end of the year to $6.2 billion, of which the Czech  National Bank's foreign currency reserves amounted to Kc3.8  billion. The Czech National Bank's reserves cover a four-month  volume of imports of goods and services in convertible currency.    A large part of the increase of foreign currency reserves  reflects foreign currency funds drawn from abroad, which,  however, also appear on the other side as an increase in gross  indebtedness. In addition to the aforementioned surplus on the  current account of the balance of payments, it was also the  inflow of capital--above all, portfolio investments--that  contributed to the increase in foreign currency reserves. Two  issues of the Czech National Bank bonds, with a volume of $0.7  billion, should be mentioned first. Foreign investments in  securities on the domestic capital market also increased  significantly. Foreign currency credits obtained by domestic  firms directly from abroad were also among the sources of  long-term capital. The inflow of direct investments from abroad  declined in comparison with 1992 to reach $561 million (the  direct investments from abroad for 1992 to 1993 amount to $2,053  million).    The macroeconomic stability was actively affected in 1993 by  the state budget. As opposed to the countries of the former  Eastern bloc and most West European countries, the state budget  had a surplus of Kc1.1 billion, and that with planned revenues  surpassed by 4.6 percent and expenditures by 4.3 percent. The  basis of budget revenues was taxes, specifically income tax  (Kc71.9 billion), value-added tax and consumer tax (Kc107.5  billion), and social security premiums (Kc106.0 billion).    While the monetary policy of the Czech National Bank was  moderately restrictive and careful in early 1993, it relaxed in  the second half of the year. The stability of the purchasing  power of the koruna prevailed. The rate of exchange against the  dollar did not substantially change in the course of the year  and hovered about Kc29.15 per dollar. Money supply rose by 17.5  percent in the course of the year--i.e., it moved more slowly  than inflation.    The main reason for the growth of the money supply is the  credits provided to the enterprise sector. The credits  increased overall by Kc107 billion to reach Kc678 billion at the  end of the year. The decline of the share of long-term credits  and the concurrent increase in short-term credits were affected  by the unclear nature of the development programs, the  uncertainty of the management stability, and the worsening  financial situation of the enterprises, together with fear on  the part of the banks of the growing volume of risk credits,  which are estimated at more than one-fifth of total credits.  The credit policy was marked by high security for the credits  and relatively high credits. The interest rate began to decline  after the June reduction of the discount rate from 9.5 percent  to 8 percent, but it still is higher than the interest rates  charged on credit abroad. Therefore, in late 1993, the inflow  of foreign capital in the form of credit became more  significant. The volume of deposits increased in 1993 by Kc117  billion to reach Kc636 billion.    The trend in the living standard sphere was characterized in  1993 by a high growth of nominal wages--i.e., 28 percent in  comparison with the previous year. Even with the 20.8-percent  consumer price increase, the real income of the population rose  by 6 percent. Real wages rose by 3.5 percent. In comparison  with 1989, the real income of the population was still 15  percent lower.    With the aforementioned average data, the living standard of  individual groups and strata of the population began to  significantly differentiate according to the per capita income  in the applicable household groups.    The demographic development of the Czech Republic was  marked,  as in the previous several years, by a low natural increase of  the population.</p>

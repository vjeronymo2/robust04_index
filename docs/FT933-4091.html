			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Congress votes for electricians' return THE TUC Congress voted by a comfortable majority for the return of the electricians to the TUC as part of the AEEU engineering and electrical union yesterday - but only after one of the most bitter debates seen in the trade union movement for a long time. Delegates voted by 4,303,000 to 2,837,000 for the TUC's peace formula, which should return the electricians to the TUC from the end of this month. Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said: 'I am pleased at the outcome. The vote was for the future of trade unionism, but the sound and fury of the debate put the ugly face of trade unionism before the public. We have to build bridges to get over the disgraceful scenes seen at the rostrum.' However, Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, said he had no regrets over his savage attack on the electricians, during which he tore up a written guarantee from Mr Jordan that the AEEU would abide by the TUC rules. 'We have been the victims of plundering and pilfering,' said Mr Morris. 'What has been agreed today by Congress is a short-term fudge which won't last. We will have the same drama next year.' It took an effective and reasoned intervention by Mr John Monks, the new TUC general secretary, to calm the atmosphere. 'I bet the government has loved this,' he said. But he later welcomed the decision to allow the return of the electricians. 'It was a good day for the TUC though deep scars remain and work has still to be done,' he said. 'I did not like some of the things I saw but these were done in the emotion of the moment.' Mr Jordan said that the gesture by Mr Morris during the debate, in tearing up a written guarantee promising not to poach members, 'showed a disregard and contempt for the trade union movement. It gave the worst glimpse of trade unionism the public has ever seen.' Waving in the direction of the AEEU delegation Mr Morris declared: 'We stand here as the victims and not the aggressors - they are over there. You can't build unity on the basis of 'take it or leave it'.' With the real threat that the AEEU would leave the TUC rather than accept the continuing exclusion of the electricians, Mr Jordan said his union had gone a long way to satisfy the demands of as many as 11 unions which lost members to the electricians in the six years since the electricians' expulsion from the TUC. The savagery of the attacks on the electricians reflected the frustration and anger among many union delegates, he said.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MCC litigation may realise Dollars 300m ADMINISTRATORS to Maxwell Communication Corporation estimate that up Dollars 300m may be realised from litigation connected to the business empire, according to documents circulated to creditors this week. No potential defendants are named in the disclosure report, which was sent to 10,000 creditors around the world. But legal action could include writs against professional advisers to MCC such as Coopers &amp; Lybrand, its auditors. The report to creditors slightly upgrades previous estimates on total realisations for non-preferential and priority creditors into the range Dollars 781m - Dollars 1,364m. That excludes any recoveries from litigation. The latest figures were produced before Reed signed a letter of intent for the purchase of Official Airline Guide for Dollars 425m. But Mr Alan Jamieson, one of the joint administrators and a partner at accountants Price Waterhouse, said yesterday that this price 'falls firmly within our range'. The document shows that MCC has preferential and priority claims of Dollars 4m-Dollars 8m and claims from other creditors of Dollars 3.2bn-Dollars 3.6bn. That would give creditors an estimated dividend in the range 22 per cent to 43 per cent before any recoveries from litigation and the resolution of a dispute over the ownership of Berlitz shares. Payment depends on approval by creditors by proxy or at a meeting on July 1 in London of the proposed MCC joint scheme of arrangement under UK insolvency law and plan of reorganisation under US bankruptcy law. The US court will then consider the plan on July 14, the English court on July 21 and the scheme begin at the end of that month if it is approved. Any claims would need to be received by the end of September, which could clear the way for an initial payment to creditors in November.</p>

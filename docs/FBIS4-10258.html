			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Itamar Franco on 7 March told Planning  Minister Beni Veras to call in specialists of all ministries to  draft the federal budget. They will replace officials of the  Budget and Finance Secretariat who have been on strike for the  last 36 days. "The country will not go without a budget," the  president said, as he announced that he had stopped payments to  the strikers. "They will not be paid for the days that they are  on strike," he stressed. [passage omitted]    Legal expert Celso Bastos has said that Franco could be  impeached [preceding word in English] for not having submitted  to Congress the necessary documentation for the approval of this  year's budget. The legal basis for an eventual request of  impeachment is foreseen in Article No. 85, Paragraph VI of the  Constitution. This says a crime has been committed if the  president's actions abuse the budget law. Bastos said the fact  that the country does not have an approved budget shows that  Franco has violated the constitutional norm twice: For not  having given Congress the documentation to approve the budget  law, and for not permitting it to be approved.

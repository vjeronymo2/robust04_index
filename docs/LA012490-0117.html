			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOES OF O.C. MEDFLY SPRAY GAIN SUPPORT  </P> <P> A day after persuading two Orange County cities to challenge the state's  Mediterranean fruit fly spraying campaign, malathion critics gained more  support Tuesday from two state legislators but acknowledged that they still  face an uphill court fight.  </P> <P> "Elected leaders are finally waking up to the anger of the people over this  issue," said Jerry Yudelson, a Garden Grove activist who helped draw several  hundred malathion opponents to a City Council meeting. "But winning in the  courts isn't going to be easy; the answer may have to be a political one."  </P> <P> In addition to legal challenges over the safety of malathion spraying, critics  say they may take the state to task for what they call its failure to  adequately inform the large Vietnamese community in Garden Grove and  Westminster about the plans to spray in their areas Thursday night.  </P> <P> State guidelines require door-to-door notification in English -- or in Spanish  for Latino communities -- but make no provision for other ethnic communities.  Officials put out notices to the Vietnamese media and civic leaders in English,  but some community members said they are still angry.  </P> <P> "This is irresponsible . . . to ignore the Vietnamese community," said Co Long  Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Westminster. "Not all  of us understand English. . . . They have not done enough to properly warn us  of the dangers and the possible consequences."  </P> <P> Other community leaders said the notification problem is particularly  troublesome because the spraying is scheduled just a day before the start of  celebrations for this weekend's Tet Festival in the Little Saigon district of  Garden Grove and Westminster.  </P> <P> But Gera Curry of the state Department of Food and Agriculture insisted: "We've  made an enormous effort to reach out to these people."  </P> <P> Unanimous and unexpected decisions Monday night by city councils in Huntington  Beach and Garden Grove to seek court orders to halt the state's Medfly assault  mark the first legal challenge in Southern California to the controversial  policy, officials said.  </P> <P> And Tuesday night, the Westminster City Council followed their lead, voting 4  to 1 to seek a temporary restraining order blocking Thursday's spraying.  However, such tactics have failed in past court tests in Northern California.  </P> <P> Those cities and parts of seven others in a 36-square-mile area are to be  sprayed Thursday night. While attorneys in Huntington Beach scrambled Tuesday  to line up expert witnesses to go to court before then, lawyers for Garden  Grove decided that there won't be time for that tactic and will try instead to  halt next month's sprayings.  </P> <P> State Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) joined the Medfly fray on  Tuesday, becoming the highest elected official in Orange County to oppose the  spraying. In a letter to Gov. George Deukmejian, he questioned the extent of  the Medfly infestation and urged the governor to suspend spraying plans.  </P> <P> Malathion critics in Orange County got another encouraging sign Tuesday when  county Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder abstained from voting on a proclamation of  continued support for the state policy. She had previously voted for the  measure, thought to be largely symbolic. It passed anyway, 3 to 1, with  Supervisor Roger R. Stanton again voting against it. He had expressed his  opposition to the spraying in the past.  </P> <P> Wieder said she thinks the state needs more information on malathion. "A lack  of knowledge (among residents) certainly does breed fear," she said, adding  that, with more information, "the hysteria will stop."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) unveiled two bills Tuesday  that would bring an immediate halt to the use of malathion in urban areas.  </P> <P> His proposal, which will almost certainly face strong opposition from the  influential agriculture lobby, represented the first major political attack to  date against the state's policy.  </P> <P> But state officials, undeterred by a recent groundswell of opposition among  both residents and politicians, said they are going ahead as planned with the  first-ever spraying Thursday in an area of Orange County that includes parts of  Cypress, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Stanton, Orange, Anaheim, Westminster,  Garden Grove and Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> "The legal statutory authority for the spraying decision lies with the director  (of Food and Agriculture) and no one else," said Curry, the state agriculture  official. "I don't really see that there's an issue here."  </P> <P> Charles Getz, a deputy attorney general who will defend the state against any  lawsuits, noted that efforts to challenge the state's spraying authority failed  several times in Santa Clara County in 1980-81 and face a similar fate now.  </P> <P> The decisions by the Huntington Beach and Garden Grove councils to go to court  were unexpected, surpassing even the hopes of the malathion opponents. Just  last week, council members in Garden Grove refused to oppose the malathion  spraying, saying that the city had no power over the issue. But they reversed  themselves after hearing impassioned pleas from speaker after speaker at the  jammed council meeting Monday night.  </P> <P> "I truly believe that the amount of malathion used in the spraying is not  harmful," Mayor W.E. (Walt) Donovan told residents. But he voted to seek court  relief anyway. "I just changed my mind. It was a compromise really," he said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Donovan wrote to mayors of the 11 other North County cities in the  spray zone, asking them to join Garden Grove in taking "whatever legal means  necessary to prevent the Medfly spraying."  </P> <P> The Anaheim council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday night to ask the city attorney to look  into what legal grounds the city might have to halt the spraying and report  back on Feb. 6. Councilman Irv Pickler, who cast the no vote, said he wanted to  take action immediately.  </P> <P> Groups and municipalities in the Los Angeles area, hit earlier and more often  than Orange County by malathion spraying, have talked about a lawsuit but have  not reached any decisions.  </P> <P> That Orange County cities took the lead on the issue surprised Los Angeles  environmental activist David Bunn of Pesticide Watch, who has been involved in  the protests.  </P> <P> "In terms of environmental and health issues, a lot of people think of Orange  County as not exactly a hotbed of activism," Bunn said. "This proves that  false."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Bob Schwartz and Ashley Dunn contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THURSDAY'S MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> ABOUT THE SPRAYING:  </P> <P> No repeat spray application has been planned at this time. Officials will  continue to monitor the 1,500 traps distributed over an 81-square-mile area  that includes that spray zone plus surrounding area. If additional flies are  found, a second spraying would be possible.  </P> <P> The Medfly hot line in the Orange County Agricultural Commission office will be  open from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. for residents with questions. The number is (714)  447-7118. The hot line will be shut down after Friday. Inquiries after that can  be made to the agricultural commissioner's office at (714) 447-7100.  </P> <P> The droplets that were sprayed in North County are from a mixture that is about  three-quarters protein-corn syrup bait, to lure the fruit flies, and  one-quarter malathion, the pesticide being used to kill them. About 12 ounces  per square mile were scheduled to be applied over the target area.  </P> <P> Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered new tests of  malathion, to try to resolve questions about its effect on human health, state  officials assert that it is "one of the safest insecticides in use today."  State officials say that the low doses used in aerial spraying pose no health  threat to anyone, including pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly and  the chronically ill.  </P> <P> They also say that no one should have any reservations about going outside  after the spraying is completed. Animals with the exception of fish, which are  considered very susceptible should not be affected either, officials say.  </P> <P> Agriculture officials assert that if possible, they would prefer to avoid the  public concern and inconvenience that malathion use can cause by infiltrating  infested areas with millions of sterile Medflies and thus preventing the  spread. However, they say a shortage of sterile Medflies has eliminated that  option, forcing sometimes repeated sprayings around the Southland.  </P> <P> AFTER THE SPRAYING:  </P> <P> Friday morning, all patio furniture, play equipment, tools and household items  left outdoors during the spraying should be hosed down. If a car has been  sprayed, it should be washed with soap and water.  </P> <P> Source: State and Orange County agriculture officials  </P></p>

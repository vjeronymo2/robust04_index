			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposes to exclude marine propulsion engines, examples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which, in this power range, include outboard marine engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is developing emission standards for marine propulsion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines in a separate action. However, small SI engines used on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine vessels for purposes other than propulsion, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generators and pumps, are not excluded in this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to incorporate in this rule the nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine definition proposed in the large CI rule. EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include in this rule any changes to that definition included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final large CI rule. EPA is also proposing to amend the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of nonroad vehicle proposed there by adding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following sentence: ``Nonroad vehicle also includes equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is powered by nonroad engines.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statutory definition of nonroad vehicle adopted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress in the 1990 CAA Amendments provides little guidance as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to what is a nonroad vehicle. Rather, statutory language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describes only what is not a nonroad vehicle, namely, motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and vehicles used solely for competition. A review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Conference Report, the Statement of Senate Managers, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement of House Managers does not provide any additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance. It is necessary to examine both the House and Senate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee Reports of the original legislation before this issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States House of Representatives, Committee on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy and Commerce, Report on H.R. 3030, offers some insight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the meaning of both nonroad engine and vehicle. In part the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report states, ``(T)he term `nonroad engine' is defined for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of this section to include certain internal combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines not used in a motor vehicle or a competition vehicle,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while a nonroad vehicle is a vehicle powered by (a) nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine that is not a motor vehicle and not used solely for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition. Stationary internal combustion engines are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under Title I of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are not subject to the requirements of this section.'' <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> H. Rep., Legislative History of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1990, Committee on Energy and Commerce to accompany H.R. 3030, May 17, 1990, at 310.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Equally enlightening is the report of S. 1630 from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States Senate, Committee of Environment and Public Works,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which discusses at some length the Committee's understanding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what the terms nonroad engine and nonroad vehicle mean. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertinent part of the report states, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> * * * ``non-road engines'' include a wide range of engine uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and vehicles. The term includes, for example, diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locomotives, farm and construction equipment, utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines such as lawn and garden equipment, marine vessels,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forklifts and airport vehicles. The definition in the bill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for non-road vehicles is an inclusive one that covers all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines that are not used in motor vehicles, or in a vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used solely for competition in vehicle racing, that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated by standards promulgated under section 111 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, and that are not subject to regulation under part B of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title I of the Act, related to aircraft. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> S. Rep. Legislative History of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Committee on Environment and Public Works to accompany S. 1630, December 20, 1989, at 104&hyph;105.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that Congress used the terms ``non-road engine,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``equipment,'' and ``vehicle'' interchangeably. It is EPA's belief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Congress intended nonroad vehicles and nonroad engines to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be inclusive terms covering all manner of equipment not defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as motor vehicles, vehicles for competition, and stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. Furthermore, there is a practical interrelationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between an engine and the equipment that houses it or is powered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by it. Equipment or vehicle characteristics may have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant impact on the emissions associated with the operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the engine. The nonroad engine definition proposed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large CI rule and incorporated in this rulemaking relies to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> great extent on this interrelationship between an engine and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> piece of equipment to determine whether an engine is a nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine. In future development of a small SI engine program, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may become necessary and appropriate to regulate aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment to control fuel spillage, evaporative emissions, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling emissions. EPA believes that CAA section 213 provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority for such regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Definition of Handheld Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that engines intended for use in equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined as handheld be certified to standards much less stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than those applicable to engines used in nonhandheld equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, on a percentage basis, the reductions obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handheld and nonhandheld engines will be of similar magnitude.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the unique characteristics of handheld 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines, it is not feasible, given the timing of this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the unique performance requirements of handheld equipment, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that all engines covered in this proposal meet emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels that can be achieved by 4-stroke engines used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhandheld equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This distinction is based, in part, on the substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between emissions from current 4-stroke and 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines, which is an inherent result of the design differences of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these engines. Because of scavenging losses, current 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines generally emit approximately ten times more unburned HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (on an energy-specific basis) than their 4-stroke counterparts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, current 2-stroke engines are generally lighter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than current 4-stroke engines of the same rated power and can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated in any orientation. As a result, applications requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the operator pick up and/or carry the device while using it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (for example, chain saws), are nearly exclusively powered by 2-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stroke engines. On the other hand, nonhandheld applications such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as lawnmowers, which are currently sold in both 2-stroke and 4-stroke versions, can clearly be powered by 4-stroke engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 90 percent of the lawnmowers sold in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States are powered by 4-stroke engines. Section VII discusses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the present market mix of small engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

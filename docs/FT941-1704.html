			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Curb on charity accounts planned The Charity Commission intends to clamp down on charities which present misleading information in their accounts by failing to comply with new accounting guidelines, it emerged yesterday. A letter circulated in the last few weeks suggests that new statutory guidelines on charity accounting, reporting and auditing have been substantially delayed by the government and are unlikely to appear before the summer at the earliest. The letter from Mr Michael Webber, a charity commissioner, was sent to all who commented on Sorp 2, the draft statement of recommended practice for charities. Sorp 2 attracted widespread criticism when it was circulated early last year and was revised after discussions with the Accounting Standards Board, which highlighted a number of areas in which it contradicted UK standards for companies. About 350 bodies commented on the draft. The Charity Commission has taken on responsibility for ratifying Sorp 2, the previous version of which was issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Mr Webber says in the letter that the commission will not criticise charities simply for failing to comply with Sorp 2, which is not mandatory. But it will criticise charities if this failure leads to 'a distorted, misleading or unclear view of some aspects of the charity's affairs'. He warns that any departures will have to be 'clearly justified in a positive way'. He says a revised version of Sorp 2 will be issued with Home Office draft regulations, which are not expected until after June. A statement on the timetable is expected in the first half of this year. Mr Webber stresses the need for the guidelines to reflect the burden of compliance with the accounting guidelines on smaller charities. The financial difficulties facing charities are highlighted in the Henderson Top 2,000 charities survey, published this week, which shows that 31 charities have had their accounts qualified by their auditors. Of the 2,071 charities analysed, more than 17 per cent did not even have a full audit.</p>

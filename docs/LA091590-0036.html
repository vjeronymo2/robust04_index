			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS / L.A. FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> FOREIGN CLASSICS HIGHLIGHT WEEKEND  </P> <P> Following are reviews of selected screenings in the Los Angeles Festival's  final weekend:  </P> <P> The Realm of Fortune  </P> <P> Mexico  </P> <P> Sunday at 8 p.m., Melnitz Theater, UCLA  </P> <P>  This 1986 social melodrama has the inevitability of a nightmare.  </P> <P> Director Arturo Ripstein's tale -- from a Juan Rulfo story -- shows a truly  horrifying rise, decline and fall: a sentimental, bumbling, childishly selfish  town crier becomes a swaggering cockfighter, seducer and high-stakes gambler.  But his wealth proves more squalid than his poverty. . . . Ripstein, with  corrosive cunning, traps his protagonist in a quagmire of fetid success, a  no-exit of splendid misery. The movie has a hypnotic rhythm, wonderfully seedy  decor, and a crazy fairy-tale inevitability; some of Ripstein's jokes are as  savage as Bunuel's. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

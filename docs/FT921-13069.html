			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / EC food aid to 'pull down' Russian prices EC FOOD aid went on sale in Moscow and St Petersburg this week in an attempt to bring down soaring prices in markets and state shops. Some 8,500 tonnes of meat, skimmed milk and butter have been delivered to the two cities this month, with supplies coming in at the rate of 400 tonnes a day, building up to 2,000 tonnes a day over the next few weeks. Mr Michael Emerson, head of the EC delegation in Moscow, said prices had reached 'exotic' levels, but were bound to come down as it became clear that average households could not afford them. He said prices being set for EC food would 'probably' pull down the higher prices. The price agreed between the EC and the Moscow city government for a kilo of butter - Rbs56 - represents a hefty rise on pre-liberalisation levels. The price in peasant markets and some shops is around Rbs130 per kilo. Senior officials of the International Monetary Fund in Moscow yesterday warned that measures to privatise enterprises and shops must be taken quickly if the government is to reap real gains from liberalisation of prices. The officials said that while the Russian government programme was proceeding 'very much in the right direction, we would like to see action taken on budgetary and monetary policy, in view of the magnitude of the imbalances to be corrected' Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent, adds: Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries will try to agree how to admit the republics of the former Soviet Union to membership of the IMF at their meeting this weekend. G7 officials say there is broad agreement the republics should become IMF members as soon as possible. But difficulties concerning the size of their quotas, or membership subscriptions, to the fund and the representation of the republics on the IMF's executive board could cause delay.

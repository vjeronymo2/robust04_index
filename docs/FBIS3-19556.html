			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of message from PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, read to </F> the 12-13 March international conference on North Kurdistan in  Brussels by Kani Yilmaz, representative of ERNK, National  Liberation Front of Kurdistan in Europe--all quotation marks as  published]    [Text] "The Kurdish problem, which has gradually become  internationalized and attained a level eliciting the world's  close concern, and in particular the problem of northern  Kurdistan has reached the solution phase owing to the  development it has achieved. Before reaching this stage, our  people, led by our party, achieved its national awakening and,  to attain freedom, it furthered its national liberation war on a  fully legal basis at the cost of enormous suffering and  sacrifice in northern Kurdistan.    The Turkish state's approach has always been one of denial  [of Kurdish existence] and justification of this denial by  disregarding the historical facts. Any stance against this  approach by the Turkish Republic has been rather brutally and  cruelly suppressed. Our people's demand for freedom has been  choked in blood.    Despite the world's close interest in the Kurdish problem,  the position of certain European states has made solving it  difficult rather than easy. The support given has been such as  to encourage the Turkish Republic in its massacres in this  unjust war against our people.    In addition, these states, motivated by their economic and  political interests and an incomprehensible mentality, have  branded our party, which has the support of millions and is the  real partner in a solution, a "terrorist" movement. Again, the  unfounded statements made in a spirit of antagonism against our  struggle to the effect that "the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] does not favor a solution," or that "the PKK has no  policy other than the establishment of a separate state," are  unfounded allegations.    During the press conferences held before the eyes of the  world especially during the cease-fire period, I tried to  explain that we are not averse to a solution and that it is the  Turkish Republic that rejects the peace proposals. Such  allegations are being constantly and intentionally dwelled upon.  In view of this and on the occasion of the conference I find it  useful to very clearly reiterate our position:    1. We will remain open to every proposal for a solution, and  to the initiatives that might be taken by foreign countries or  international organizations on this issue.    2. I want to state with the upmost clarity that we have  absolutely no intention of dividing Turkey and that propaganda  to this effect does not reflect our real position.    3. I want to state that we will be a participant in a  process that might be initiated with the Turkish state on the  basis of talks and dialogue within democracy to give expression  to our people's legitimate demands and achieve results on this  issue. From the very start, we have not opposed or been averse  to concrete proposals for a solution. We are prepared to  discuss all the alternatives, including the establishment of a  federation.    4. We will not avoid or obstruct the establishment of a  mutual cease-fire to be followed by talks on a solution under  international supervision.    5. Most importantly, I pledge to accept the decisions on a  solution that you might make at the conference. I am also  announcing that we will pave the way for the total termination  of the armed struggle if the ground is prepared for a political  solution and free political activity.    It is obvious that ours is not a position that seeks  solution  only in war. Besides, the war is not of our own choosing. It  is the Turkish Government that has forced us into this and  reduced us to defending our national existence by such methods,  and which behaves with intransigence and cruelty to terrorize  our people, thinking that it could obtain results only by waging  special warfare.    With this, I wish your endeavors to be productive and  efficacious. I express my conviction that you will reach  important decisions for a solution, and wholeheartedly salute  the conference.    Wishing you success, Abdullah Ocalan, general secretary of  PKK."</p>

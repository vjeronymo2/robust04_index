The communique stated that the Central American presidents'  visit was agreed upon in early December and that the trilateral  agenda does not include "the topic of the situation in Los Altos  de Chiapas," where an armed Indian rebellion has been taking  place since 1 January.    The communique also stated that on the night of 3 January  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio spoke with Salinas to  discuss several topics, including the situation in Chiapas. The  communique explained that the Guatemalan president proposed to  the Mexican president "an exchange of information."    The guerrilla outbreak by the Zapatista National Liberation  Army [EZLN] is taking place in southern Chiapas State, on the  border with Guatemala.    Guatemalan Army sources have reported the possibility of a  link between the EZLN and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity, which has rejected that charge.    Mexican Government sources told AFP that the idea that there  are Central Americans in the EZLN ranks is being confirmed, and  they even said that "there is a Guatemalan" in the leadership of  that guerrilla organization.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Pakistan secures Dollars 1.5bn in World Bank and IMF loans THE Pakistan government said yesterday it had finalised agreements to secure new loans worth Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 1.02bn) from the IMF and the World Bank over the next three years. The boards of both institutions and the Pakistani cabinet still need formally to ratify the deals but the formal announcement is expected early next year. Mr V A Jaffery, the prime minister's adviser on finance and de facto finance minister, told journalists, an agreement had been reached to provide 'assistance under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the Extended Finance Facility (EFF) from the IMF, and PSAL (Public Sector Adjustment Loan) from the Bank'. He said that the government expecved to achieve a gross domestic product growth rate of at least 6.5 per cent a year, reduce inflation to 5 per cent and strengthen its international reserves significantly over the next three years. It must also reduce the burden of domestic and foreign debt. Foreign debt rose to Dollars 23bn - Dollars 18.5bn long term and Dollars 4.5bn short term  -at the end of June 1993. The announcement provided fresh signs that many reforms introduced by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former prime minister, will remain on track. Mr Jaffery said the government had committed itself to continue with measures to improve tax collection, reduce tariffs, privatise state enterprises and deregulate the economy. In response to questions on whether the inflation reduction target was a realistic one, Mr Jaffery said: 'It is not an impossible target to achieve', adding that the government had three years to do so. However, some officials privately expressed concern over the viability of such a commitment.</p>

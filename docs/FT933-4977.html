			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Use of Intel technology casts shadow on AMD ADVANCED Micro Devices has disclosed that its latest microprocessor chips, to be introduced later this month, will incorporate Intel technology that is at the centre of a long-running legal battle between the two Silicon Valley chipmakers. AMD's sales of 30m clones of Intel microprocessors have greatly boosted the company's revenues and earnings over the past two years. However, the legal disputes with Intel - the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer - have cast uncertainty over AMD's future microprocessor sales and could potentially make the company liable for substantial penalties. Previously, AMD had said that it would lift the cloud of legal uncertainty and achieve 'technological independence' from Intel by designing its own microcode for the new chips. Microcode is the internal software that controls the functions of a microprocessor chip. However, AMD now says its 'independently derived' microcode for new 486 microprocessors - widely used in personal computers - is not entirely original. About 25 per cent of the software is 'substantially similar' to software Intel created for an earlier generation of 386 microprocessors, the company said. 'The (microcode) development team was exposed to certain Intel 386 intellectual property that had been awarded to us by the arbitrator of our breach-of-contract dispute with Intel,' said Mr Richard Lovgren, AMD associate general counsel. He acknowledged that an appeals court ruling in June had overturned the arbitrator's award, compromising AMD's right to use the Intel microcode. Mr Tom Dunlap, Intel's chief counsel, said: 'Once again, it seems that AMD would rather take legal risks than develop products independently.' AMD , however, expressed optimism that its rights to the software will be restored by the California Supreme Court, which last week granted the company's request for a review of the June ruling. 'We are very pleased the Supreme Court has agreed to review a ruling that we believe is wrong and manifestly unjust,' said Mr WJ Sanders III , AMD chairman and chief executive. The review effectively vacates the negative ruling of the appeals court, AMD said. AMD also noted that it has been granted a new trial, to begin in November, of a related microcode copyright infringement dispute with Intel.</p>

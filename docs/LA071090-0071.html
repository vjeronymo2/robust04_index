			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHROP WILL LAY OFF 1,400 AT B-2 FACILITY  </P> <P> Northrop will lay off about 1,400 workers at its B-2 bomber plant in Pico  Rivera, starting this month and continuing through September, the Los Angeles  aerospace firm said Monday.  </P> <P> Northrop also said it will transfer production of the center fuselage section  of the B-2 bomber from Pico Rivera to its facility in Palmdale to cut costs.  </P> <P> Northrop is preparing a consolidation plan, in which it may close some  facilities in Hawthorne, sources say.  </P> <P> The layoffs are part of a 3,000-worker cutback this year that was announced in  May, Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said. Last month, Northrop notified  workers at its aircraft division in Hawthorne that 1,350 jobs would be cut this  year through retirements, voluntary leaves, contract labor terminations and  layoffs.  </P> <P> When Northrop announced its plan to cut 3,000 jobs this year, it had 41,000  workers, about 75% of whom were in Southern California.  </P> <P> Virtually every major defense contractor in Southern California is trimming its  work force, making for one of the most bleak industry outlooks since the early  1970s. McDonnell Douglas is cutting nearly 10,000 workers this year, and  Lockheed may eliminate as many as 7,000.  </P> <P> Northrop's layoffs are being driven by a Pentagon decision to trim B-2 orders,  by an internal effort to cut costs and by a change in the skills needed for B-2  production as the program matures.  </P> <P> The 1,400 jobs to be eliminated at Pico Rivera plant will be partly offset by  hiring of hourly production workers in Palmdale, Cantafio said. The Palmdale  plant employs 2,200 and will grow to 3,000 by year-end.  </P></p>

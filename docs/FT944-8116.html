			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Luanda warns over attack Angola's government accused Unita rebels of attacking its positions yesterday and said the raids jeopardised a peace pact signed only 24 hours earlier. State radio quoted a government statement as saying the rebels had attacked the northern town of Uige on the eve of a permanent ceasefire which is scheduled to be implemented at 12.00 GMT today. Government forces captured Uige from Unita last week in what the rebels said at the time was a violation of a truce aimed at paving the way for the peace pact. Delegations from both sides signed the pact in the Zambian capital of Lusaka on Sunday. But the ceremony was undermined by the failure of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi to sign it personally, as originally planned.</p>

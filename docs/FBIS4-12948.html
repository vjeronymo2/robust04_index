			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Brothers: Neither Rabin nor the U.S. White House  understood the massacre at al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron very  well and accurately; otherwise, the U.S. Administration would  not have brought the Security Council to a standstill for over  two weeks, during which it paralyzed it, coerced it, fettered  its will, and abstained from voting on the preamble of the  resolution. Neither would Rabin have done as he pleased when he  refrained from transferring 400 settlers from within the town of  Hebron to where they should be transferred one day with other  settlers. The issue of the settlers and the settlements needs  to be resolved in order to ensure a successful settlement.    Since the settlers perpetrated the massacre, although they  are not alone in this, this issue has become urgent and the  transfer of the settlers should now be deemed more important  than anything else, in order to give peace a better chance. The  number of settlers in the heart of the town of Hebron is  inferior to the number of victims who were killed or injured  during [the massacre]. This means that Rabin was not serious  when dealing with the causes, effects, and consequences of this  massacre.    Consequently, the violence that is now continuing is natural  and will remain so, because its causes and justifications can be  easily found in this official Israeli violence and in the  violence of the settlers towards the [West] Bank and the [Gaza]  Strip, particularly towards Jerusalem and Hebron. Sadness and  anger are useless and they do not mean anything it. The  expression of this sadness and anger is a cajolery [as heard]  which is of no use to the Israelis in the same way as it does  not console the Palestinians. The occupation is continuing and  the defense of 400 settlers in the town of Hebron allows Rabin  to think that the Bank and the Strip and the Palestinian people  can be appropriated. Therefore, he goes ahead and closes Hebron,  seals off the Bank and lays siege to and starves these  Palestinian people to whom the negotiations offer no bread, no  security, and not even tranquillity.    Nobody supports terrorism, but it is unacceptable to  everyone  and to human conscience that our people remain subjected to  terrorism and that the experiments of violence and racism are  carried out against them. It is also unacceptable to expect  them to remain silent and calm. Our people have the right to  resist.    The U.S. Administration should clearly realize that any  mishandling can only result in violence. The U.S.  Administration and Rabin now have to handle matters on the basis  of the principles and good intentions required by the peace  process. The first of which being the removal of all the  explosive fuses every time a fuse appears to be endangering this  process in its entirety.</p>

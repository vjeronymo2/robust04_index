There are curious  similarities between now and the years after the second world  war when Russia and the West were not yet adversaries and the  fate of East Europe was still unclear. The ghosts of the  statesmen who failed to head off the cold war, and who then  created and extended the alliance--of Bevin and Eden, of Truman  and Dulles, of Eisenhower and Adenauer-- seem to hover behind  today's leaders in the group photographs with which every  summit, like a school reunion, begins and ends.    We can imagine their expressions as far from benign for, in  spite of appearances, the present NATO leaders have agreed  nothing in Brussels that adds to the security of North America,  of Europe, or of the states of the former Soviet Union. Of the  four "achievements" associated with the meeting, three--the  Partnership for Peace proposals, the agreements on strengthening  the European side of the alliance and on flexible task forces,  and the deal on Ukrainian nuclear weapons--were put together in  advance and one, the resolution on possible air strikes in  Bosnia, was cobbled together on the spot. None of the four  could be described as worthless, yet there is a lack of  substance, a sense that the real objective has been to avoid the  issues concerned rather than to tackle them, that must give deep  cause for concern.    The conjunction of the Ukraine deal and the Partnership  proposals is particularly ironic. Ever since the Soviet Union  broke up, it has been an eminently worthwhile object of American  policy to persuade all the successor states except Russia to  give up their nuclear weapons. If the Ukraine deal is not upset  by local extremists that has now been achieved. For President  Clinton, it must have seemed like a piece of perfect political  geometry--the kind that works from every angle. It would please  the European members of NATO because it gets rid of a heap of  nuclear weapons on the continent's doorstep. It would please  Americans, because some of the weapons are still targeted on  them, a fact which Clinton emphasised, even though he knows that  the only conceivable targets for Ukrainian nuclear weapons are  now in Russia. And it would please the Russians, because a  Ukraine without nuclear weapons is likely to be more open, to  put it mildly, to Russian influence than one which retains them.    Yet in the light of the Partnership for Peace proposals what  does that mean? In effect the two taken together consign the  Ukraine, and by extension most or all states of the former  Soviet Union, to a Russian bloc while not in any certain way  gathering in the East Europeans to the West. This is the  problem with the argument for a cautious NATO and European Union  approach to the East Europeans. It ignores the fact that  rightly or wrongly there already is a Russian bloc, a Russian  sphere, wanted by the Russians and already conceded by the  Americans, and that the question is what is in it and what is  not. If NATO can only bring itself to offer the Poles,  Hungarians and Czechs a vague right of future entry, we can be  sure that the Baltic states, the Ukraine and Belaurus will never  enter the organisation as full members. That is probably right,  practical, and even proper. But it shows that there already is  a line of demarcation between the states on the "Russian" side  and those on the "European" side; and it underlines the fact  that we have unwisely left the status of the East Europeans  unclear as between the two.    Neither the so-called strengthening of the West European  "pillar" nor the flexibility that the proposals on joint task  forces appears to offer are what they seem. The first registers  the fact of American troop withdrawals and represents a success  in the long French campaign to diminish American influence in  Europe. That is a campaign which the French have waged for so  long during years when it was impossible of achievement that  now, when it perhaps can be achieved, they have long ceased to  examine whether the objective is either worthwhile or realistic.    Flexibility, meanwhile, simply means arrangements for  European members of NATO to do things without the Americans.  But the whole strength of NATO in the past was that, exemptions  for France and one or two smaller members aside, it always did  things together. Doing things together in fact became its main  purpose. Sometimes the things were illogical or trivial or even  dangerous, but that was less important than the fact that they  were done. To end this often painful tradition of unanimous  action is not an achievement but a defeat.    Which brings us to the Balkans. Can it be that something  finally, is about to be done, by NATO, working together, in  Bosnia? Unhappily, the threat of air strikes which was revived  in Brussels is not a policy or even part of a policy. It is the  product, again, of the French determination to display  leadership in Europe, and to satisfy a French public opinion  which has lately become more interventionist. The British have  joined in for tactical reasons. Both countries are  contemplating an eventual withdrawal and a display of firmness  now might make that both a little safer and a little less  undignified. The chances are that the threat will make the  Serbs more co-operative in both Srebrenica and Tuzla, and may  also reduce the firing on Sarajevo. If not, there might even be  a strike or two to produce the same effect. Such benefits are  not to be sneezed at, but air strikes would only be genuinely  worthwhile if they were part of a larger intervention, now an  exceedingly remote possibility.    NATO was never just an alliance against the Soviet Union. It  represented an internationalisation of military force in the  industrialised world, wrapping armed forces together in a web of  common purposes, common action, and common weaponry in such a  way that they could never fight one another again and in such a  way that most of them, with the exception of the United States,  were incapable of fighting anybody outside the alliance on their  own any more. It is for these reasons that it was and is worth  preserving.    Such assets do not come down to us in logical ways--as an  expression of European separateness, as the French would like,  or as an instrument of Russian and American partnership, as  Moscow perhaps thought in the days when it too spoke of NATO  membership. They come down to us in the package in which they  have been bundled by history. All the more reason to worry when  that package, in spite of superficial successes, threatens to  unravel.</p>

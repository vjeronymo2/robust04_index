			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Effect on households Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, writes: Families of all types will lose out from tax changes this year, although these are mostly the ones announced in 1993. Their effects, together with those of the new ones, are shown in the graphic for different family types. Clearly, the new measures in the Budget will have only tiny effects compared with the ones we have known about for a year or more. Some types of household will do better than others, though. Pensioners will actually lose less money on average than others. This is partly because of the increases in pensioner tax allowances announced on Tuesday; partly because the VAT compensation package is much more generous to pensioners than others; and partly because pensioners are less affected by tax increases like the restriction of mortgage interest tax relief. Other groups, such as working families, will be hit much harder. This chart was omitted from Wednesday's Budget section.</p>

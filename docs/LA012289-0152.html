			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN OPEN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> MCENROE AND KRICKSTEIN, LAST U.S. MEN, TO MEET IN 4TH ROUND  </P> <P> The number of American men who can win the Australian Open has dropped to only  2 on the seventh day, and it's going to get smaller soon.  </P> <P> In a situation ugly for Americans, John McEnroe and Aaron Krickstein won their  matches Sunday, which means one will eliminate the other when they meet in a  fourth-round match Tuesday.  </P> <P> Krickstein, seeded 10th, defeated Niclas Kroon of Sweden, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4, and  McEnroe had an even easier time in what should have been a tougher match. The  seventh-seeded McEnroe defeated hot-and-cold West German Patrick Kuhnen, who  was mostly cold, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2.  </P> <P> Krickstein, still on the comeback from injuries, said he wished more Americans  had entered. He and McEnroe are the only Americans in the top 20 who chose to  play.  </P> <P> "I think everyone should be down here," Krickstein said.  </P> <P> Brett Garnett, 21, a qualifier from Myrtle Beach, S.C., was eliminated by  16th-seeded Amos Mansdorf, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2.  </P> <P> On a cool, cloudy and windy day, Ivan Lendl considered asking for permission to  wear a warmup suit for his match against Nicklas Kulti.  </P> <P> "I decided to rub hot cream on my legs instead," said the second-seeded Lendl,  who defeated Kulti, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3, then rubbed it in afterward, saying the  Swede's game was full of holes.  </P> <P> At the same time, fourth-seeded Stefan Edberg posted a 7-5, 7-5, 7-5 victory  over Johan Kriek, then warmed up for his fourth-round match against Pat Cash.  </P> <P> It was clearly the day's hottest moment. Edberg said that Cash, who eliminated  Jeremy Bates of Great Britain, 7-6, 6-2, 6-3, performed less than admirably in  Friday's 5-set victory over Richey Reneberg.  </P> <P> "Well, it seemed like he tanked in the fourth set, and I thought it was pretty  bad for him to act the way he did," Edberg said. "He didn't deserve to win.  It's very seldom you see that, especially in a Grand Slam tournament."  </P> <P> McEnroe was asked if he agreed with Edberg.  </P> <P> "I saw that part of the match and I think he was pretty accurate," McEnroe  said. "Tank may not be the right word, though. Maybe he lost concentration."  </P> <P> Cash, of course disagreed. "No, I didn't tank and that's as simple as that," he  said. "What was it, 6-4? That doesn't sound like a tank. Well, 6-0 is a tank.  Enough of that, all right?"  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Steffi Graf, who scored a straight-set victory over Nicole Provis of  Australia, was nevertheless forced to play out of a 4-4 game score in the first  set.  </P> <P> Graf, who had a 4-1 lead, won, 6-4, 6-0. She also wondered where all the nice  summer weather has gone.  </P> <P> "For sure, I don't know what's going on," said the West German, who will play  Claudia Kohde-Kilsch in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Besides Kohde-Kilsch, who defeated American Donna Faber, 17, 6-3, 6-3, also  reaching the quarterfinals was Zina Garrison, a 7-5, 6-1 winner over another  American, Cammy McGregor. Third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, who will meet  Garrison in the quarterfinals, defeated Raffaella Reggi of Italy, 6-0, 4-6,  6-1.  </P> <P> Boris Becker reached the round of 16 Saturday night with a 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 defeat  of Canadian Chris Pridham, in a mismatch that required Becker's presence for 1  hour 10 minutes.  </P> <P> "I feel like Steffi Graf," Becker said.  </P> <P> But Pam Shriver had a different feeling after her match.  </P> <P> "I feel pretty rotten," she said.  </P> <P> Shriver, seeded fourth, lost in the third round to Catarina Lindqvist, 0-6,  6-4, 8-6, in something that is becoming kind of an Australian Open tradition --  her third loss to Lindqvist in this event in the last 4 years.  </P> <P> Shriver didn't take this latest defeat very well, knocking over every potted  plant in her path as she walked through the tunnel to the dressing room.  </P> <P> On a farm it would be the back 40, at a movie studio the back lot. But at the  Australian Open it's Court 15.  </P> <P> The most outer of outer courts, Court 15 is the utmost in the outback at this  Grand Slam event.  </P> <P> Its home is the National Tennis Center, which is located on a wedge of land  squeezed between pasta ribbons of railroad tracks and the muddy brown Yarra  River.  </P> <P> The area is called Flinders Park, named after Australian Naval pioneer Matthew  Flinders, whocircumnavigated Tasmania in 1802.  </P> <P> Getting to Court 15 requires skill similar to Flanders'. It is at the farthest  reaches of the tennis complex, a fact that American Elise Burgin discovered  when she started looking for it to play her doubles match.  </P> <P> Players are not assigned to Court 15, they are exiled.  </P> <P> "It took about 3 hours to get there," she said. "I laughed when I saw it."  </P> <P> After weaving through a maze of paths around the 11 other outside courts,  Burgin found Court 15 resting uneasily with a railroad track on one side and a  hospitality tent on the other. It is the only court at the Open with no  spectator seating, except for a single park bench.  </P> <P> "It's definitely the boonie of the boonies," Burgin said.  </P> <P> Spectators could lean on the chain link fence within inches of the players, who  are sitting during changeovers. Burgin said Lori McNeil, her doubles partner,  knew what to expect.  </P> <P> "She said people were coming up to her, asking for autographs and talking to  her in the middle of her singles match," she said.  </P> <P> Actually, Court 15 compares to one of the outside courts at the U.S. Open in  Flushing Meadow, where smoke from grills cooking hamburgers wafts across the  court during matches.  </P> <P> Said Burgin: "At New York, you smell food. At Brisbane, you smell yeast from a  giant brewery. Here, you've got trains, fans in your face and you can't get  here without a map."  </P> <P> Perhaps taking the train would help. Shriver, who played a match at nearby  Court 5, was distracted by spectators standing on the tops of trains just on  the other side of the windscreen.  </P> <P> "It takes a bit of getting used to," she said. "I felt like charging them  admission."  </P> <P> As the Australian Open finished its first week Sunday, courts were used closer  to the showcase courts, Center Court and Courts 1 and 2, as the field got  smaller and fewer outside courts were needed.  </P> <P> Court 15 fell silent, or as silent as it gets with the trains running by.  </P></p>

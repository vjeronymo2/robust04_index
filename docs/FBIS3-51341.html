			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Public workers began a series of demonstrations  today, Friday, against a referendum slated for 30 January.  Trade unions, human rights defense groups, and other people's  organizations staged a demonstration to voice their opposition  to the referendum, claiming that the changes to the Constitution  do not meet their expectations.    The government employees unions which demonstrated this  morning demanded a 40-percent salary increase, claiming that the  price increases for consumer basket articles are extremely high  compared to current salaries. Leaders of the government  employees unions that participated in the demonstration  announced that they are calling on all government employees  unions to participate in a strike on 28 January.    The demonstration, which was slated to begin at 0900, did  not  start until 1030 because the demonstrators did not arrive on  time. The leaders were forced to make emergency calls to begin  the march that left from the El Trebol area and went down  Bolivar Avenue to the downtown area. The demonstration ended at  the main plaza.    The national police carefully watched the demonstration to  prevent any infiltrations by other individuals. There were no  problems during the demonstration.</p>

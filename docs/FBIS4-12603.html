			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who will be  departing for Oman this weekend, says that this visit is a big  leap forward as far as the Arab boycott is concerned. According  to him, Oman is hosting the multilateral talks on water affairs  because it wants to solve its water problems, and Israel can  offer it know-how and joint research projects. Beilin was  interviewed by the Arabic- language weekly PANORAMA, and his  remarks were reported by our correspondent Qaysar Kabaha.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT on 11 April  reports that "the four-members Israeli preparatory team returned  from Oman this afternoon."]</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Penny Stock Investors' Law Advances: The House Subcommittee on  Telecommunications and Finance approved legislation to protect investors who  buy low-priced "penny stocks" and to crack down on violators of securities  laws.  </P> <P> One measure would give the SEC more authority to regulate the penny stock  market and punish manipulative operators. It also would require promoters to  disclose more information about the stocks and companies they are pushing. Both  measures now go before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for  consideration.  </P></p>

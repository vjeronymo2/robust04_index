			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / World Bank ready to lend Dollars 4.5bn to ex-Soviet states THE World Bank will be able to lend the former Soviet Union between Dollars 4.5bn and Dollars 5bn a year by the end of 1993, Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, said yesterday. Mr Preston said the bank could lend about Dollars 500m (Pounds 280m) now to Russia to help with the importing of vital goods. The World Bank's lending to Russia and the other former Soviet republics could total abut Dollars 1.5bn in the bank's coming financial year from July 1. Mr Preston said that World Bank lending would be contingent on the republics implementing economic reform programmes developed by the International Monetary Fund. That lending would be directed to improving agriculture, oil exploitation and transport. Oil prices in Russia are set to rise sharply in the middle of the year, pushing consumer prices up by 150 per cent, Mr Andrei Nechayev, economic minister, said yesterday, John Lloyd writes from Moscow. After a cabinet meeting in Moscow, he said the government would impose an effective ceiling of Rbs2,200 a tonne (with a floor of Rbs1,800), up from the present subsidised price of Rbs350 a tonne. Gas prices will also rise to Rbs1,100-1,600 per thousand cubic metres for all except domestic users, who will continue to pay the subsidised price of Rbs260. The rise of energy prices, the largest price subsidy left on the budget, is seen by the International Monetary Fund as an essential step towards stability of the currency.</p>

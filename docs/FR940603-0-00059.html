			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There exists a wide range of human activities that may impact the designated critical habitat for northern right whales (NMFS, 1991, 1992). Resource uses in the critical habitat areas are currently, and have been historically, dominated by vessel traffic and fisheries. Vessel activities can change whale behavior, disrupt feeding practices, disturb courtship rituals, disperse up food sources and injure or kill whales through collisions. Thirty-two percent of the known strandings of northern right whales since 1970 have been caused by human activities (Kraus, 1990; NMFS, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vessels that operate in the areas being designated as critical habitat include recreational and commercial fishing vessels, commercial transport vessels, passenger vessels, recreational boats, whale-watching boats, research vessels and military vessels (e.g., surface ships and submarines). Helicopters and low-altitude aircraft also fly over the critical habitat. Results of human activities that occur within or near the designated critical habitat for northern right whales, and that may disrupt the essential life functions that occur there, include, but are not limited to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Mortality due to collisions with large vessels: Seven percent of northern right whales identified have propeller scars from a large vessel (NMFS, 1992); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Entanglement and mortality due to commercial fishing activities: More than one-half of all cataloged animals have scars indicative of entanglements with fishing gear, resulting in scars, injuries, and death. Fishing nets and associated ropes may become entangled around a flipper, at the gape of the mouth, or around the tail (Kraus, 1985, 1990). Gill nets are believed to be the primary cause of scars and injuries related to fishing gear, although whales have also become entangled in drift nets and lines from lobster pots, seines and fish weirs (Kraus, 1985). Fishing practices and locations may need to be managed more closely when the fishing season overlaps with the presence of right whales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Possible habitat degradation through pollution, sea bed mining, and oil and gas exploration: Exploration and development for oil, gas, phosphates, sand, gravel, and other materials on the outer continental shelf may impact northern right whale habitat through the discharge of pollutants (such as oil, drilling muds and suspended solids); noise from seismic testing, drilling and support activity; and disturbance of the environment through vessel traffic and mining rig activity. If these types of activities are proposed, their timing and location may also require special management considerations, including the establishment and maintenance of buffer zones. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Pollutants may also affect phytoplankton and zooplankton populations in a way that decreases the density and abundance of specific zooplankton patches on which northern right whales feed. In addition, pollution may affect the feeding patterns and habitat use of other components of the marine ecosystem, which in turn could impact food and habitat availability for the northern right whale. Pollutants may also have direct toxic effects on the whale. Monitoring of known and potential pollution and discharge sources in this essential habitat may be necessary to insure that these sources are not affecting prey species abundance or composition, or the northern right whale's ability to gain maximum benefit from use of the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Turbulence associated with vessel traffic may also indirectly affect northern right whales by breaking up the dense surface zooplankton patches in certain whale feeding areas. Special vessel traffic management or restrictions may be necessary in certain areas when northern right whales are present. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Possible harassment due to whale-watching and other vessel activities; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Possible harassment due to research activities (on permitted sites and during specified times throughout the year). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effect of any of these activities on individual whales or on their habitat could have consequences that may impede the recovery of the northern right whale population. Therefore, special management considerations may be required to protect these areas and promote the recovery of the northern right whale. The following are some, but not necessarily all, of those activities that occur in each of the designated critical habitat areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cape Cod Bay: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In CCB, vessel traffic associated with the Cape Cod Canal, the Boston Harbor traffic lanes, dredging and disposal traffic, recreational boating, commercial fishing and whale-watching activities comprise the majority of the vessel activity in the immediate area. Of these, recreational boating, commercial fishing and whale-watching contribute greatly to the level of activity in the critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recreational boating begins with the onset of warmer months, particularly in June. Commercial fishing vessels and gear are dominated by the lobster industry, which does not typically begin its season until the middle of June. Whale-watching boats, ferries and other vessels increase activity in the area with the onset of warmer weather and the tourist season, which typically begins in May or June and ends no later than November. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Discharges from municipal, industrial and non-point sources, dredging activities, dredge spoil disposal and sewage disposal may degrade essential habitat in Massachusetts Bay/northern CCB. The cumulative effects to baleen whales (including right whales) by these activities may affect the northern right whale in Massachusetts Bay/northern CCB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Great South Channel: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the GSC, vessel traffic and fisheries constitute the majority of activities within the critical habitat area. However, in this area, these activities are not contingent on warm weather. Shipping vessel traffic lanes for Boston Harbor are used throughout the year to import and export metal, salt, fuel and a variety of other products. Similarly, the commercially important fishing grounds on Georges Bank involve year-round vessel traffic from the mainland through right whale essential habitat to the fishing grounds. The bottom-trawl is the most dominant type of fishing gear used in this area. It is not known whether the bottom-trawl, or any other type of fishing gear, has an impact on the whales' habitat. Mesh sizes used in this area do not pose an immediate threat to the whales' planktonic food supply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Southeast United States: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Vessel traffic and fisheries are the major activities in the SEUS calving grounds. Major commercial shipping and military ports operate throughout the winter/calving area. The majority of commercial fishing vessels that use the inshore waters to harvest shrimp and other commercially important species use these and other neighboring ports as well. Recreational boating traffic is also fairly extensive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

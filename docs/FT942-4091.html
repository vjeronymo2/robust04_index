			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A Cohen Pounds 522,000 in the red Turnover of A Cohen &amp; Company was little changed at Pounds 78.2m, against Pounds 78.4m, but this manufacturer of non-ferrous metal ingots suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 522,000 for 1993, compared with profits of Pounds 215,000. The directors said that the long-awaited revival in the fortunes of aluminium had eventually arrived and, on the basis of results so far, a return to profitability was expected for the 1994 first half. In view of the losses the directors do not recommend any dividend payment for the year (6.8p). Losses per share were virtually doubled at 61.1p against 31.7p on a net basis.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Training funding attacked Government funding policies have encouraged a dramatic fall in the number of training places for the most disadvantaged, including the long-term unemployed and people with disabilities, according to a study from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. The charity, in a letter to Mr Michael Forsyth, minister of state at the Department of Employment, has asked for a full-scale review of funding which it says discriminates against the recruitment of the most disadvantaged on to government-funded training programmes. Training and enterprise councils, which administer government training schemes including the scheme for adults, Training for Work, are being paid according to the volume of qualifications their trainees attain. This can encourage them to recruit on to schemes those who are likely to get qualifications in the shortest period of time. According to the charity the long-term unemployed made up 50 per cent of those on Employment Training (now called Training for Work) in January 1990. This had fallen to 37 per cent in September 1993. Entrants from ethnic minority groups had fallen from 12 per cent of the total to 11 per cent while disabled entrants had fallen from 12 per cent to 11 per cent. Cuts of up to 10 per cent in budgets for Youth Training, the training scheme for young people, are being forecast by some Tecs as they begin negotiations with the Department of Employment. Tecs had been aware of proposed cuts to the budgets of Training for Work but the cuts in YT were not anticipated.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / People: Sir Michael Edwardes squashes in another job Hi-Tec Sports, the sports shoe designer and distributor which has seen its share price collapse from 208p last May to 30p currently, has lured former British Leyland boss Sir Michael Edwardes on to its board as a non-executive director. This follows the retirement of Gordon Dunlop, British Airways finance director between 1983 and 1989, last November at the age of 64. Frank van Wezel, chairman of Hi-Tec, says he had got to know Edwardes via the latter's presidency of the Squash Rackets Association as well as of the Veterans Squash Club of Great Britain. 'He has been very prominent in fighting to give squash a higher profile,' according to van Wezel, who notes that 62-year-old Edwardes is these days on the courts five times a week. Hi-Tec sponsors the British Open Championships in squash. Van Wezel says he goes for the Edwardes 'no-nonsense, direct approach' and is looking forward to his contribution to company direction after what he describes as Hi-Tec's annus horribilis. After a year of bruising price wars in the UK market with Nike and Reebok, van Wezel claims the order books are 'looking healthy again, and at a decent margin. Sir Michael comes at a time when I feel we have hit the bottom'. While Hi-Tec has traditionally had only one non-executive on its board, van Wezel says he is now looking for a second outside director. 'We have all read Cadbury. . .,' he says.</p>

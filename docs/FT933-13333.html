			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Scots' complaint - Legal briefs Recent complaints by the English Law Commission, the government's law reform advisory body, that few of its recommendations for legislative change reach the statute book are echoed by the Scottish Law Commission. According to Ms Lynne MacMillan, of the Scottish Consumer Council, Scotland faces the additional disadvantage that, when parliamentary time is found for Scottish law reform, it is often kept to a minimum by adding Scottish provisions on to the end of legislation primarily intended for England and Wales, or gathering issues together into a Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency speculation colours trading SPECULATION about currencies and interest rates continued to influence continental trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was barely changed, having largely ignored comments by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, that there was no room to ease monetary policy in the near future. However, the market remains hopeful that interest rates will be reduced early in 1993. The DAX index closed up 0.55 at 1,544.89 as turnover fell to DM4.5bn from DM4.9bn. Veba improved DM5.30 to DM354.50 after the group said that it expected its dividend to remain steady at DM12 and that it planned to continue to reduce its workforce. An official report which increased its forecast for new car registrations for 1992 had little impact on car stocks. Volkswagen, down DM4.50 at DM263.00, was still feeling the effects of a weekend magazine report which suggested that the group would make a DM1bn loss in 1992, dealers said. Preussag was DM4.50 lower at DM347.50 ahead of today's results for 1991/92 which are expected to show an improvement over the 1990/91 period. PARIS rose further as the franc's weakness, in spite of intervention by the central bank, fanned speculation of a devaluation in the currency or even its withdrawal from the ERM. The CAC-40 index ended 20.92 higher at 1,792.29. Trading was indifferent until just before the last hour of trading when a series of block trades in CAC-40 stocks were put through the market, lifting turnover to a hefty FFr3.2bn from barely FFr1bn at midday. Euro Disney bucked the firmer trend, losing FFr3.30 or 5.3 per cent to FFr59.40 in heavy volume of 1.3m shares following Goldman Sachs's decision on Monday to treble its estimated pre-tax loss for fiscal 1993. Yesterday an analyst at a French broker nearly quintupled his net loss forecast for the 1992/93 year to over FFr1bn from the FFr210m he had published only three weeks earlier. MILAN ended mixed as selling of industrial blue chips eroded a firmer opening. The Comit index rose 3.43 to 441.77 in turnover estimated at close to Monday's L141.7bn. Fondiaria, the insurer, and its parent company, Gaic, remained targets for speculators on continued rumours about the future of the insurer. Fondiaria rose as high as L30,950 before ending L350 lower at L29,600, while shares in Gaic were suspended to the end of the session when they were fixed L52 higher at L1,402. AMSTERDAM saw some renewed buying of chemical stocks while Ahold remained positive following Monday's third quarter results. The CBS Tendency index gained 0.6 to 104.3. The market was disappointed by the details of the planned merger between KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG-Groep announced on Monday, with the shares in the three companies rising only 50 cents, 30 cents and 60 cents respectively to Fl 29.40, Fl 29.50 and Fl 23.80. Chemicals improved on bargain-hunting with DSM up Fl 4.20 at DM78.80 and Akzo Fl 1.70 higher at Fl 134.40. Pirelli Tyre Holding was suspended at Fl 13.70 before announcing that it was cancelling plans for a one-for-one rights issue and that its second-half loss would be bigger than its previous forecast. ZURICH fell back on disappointing economic news and the SMI index finished down 2.0 at 1,929.2. Chemicals remained active as Ciba-Geigy fell further following a downgrade. Its bearers lost SFr4 to SFr605. Financial stocks were firm with UBS bearers adding SFr5 to SFr813 and Winterthur registered shares putting on SFr20 to SFr2,460. OSLO jumped 2.3 per cent in active trading as the economic outlook appeared to improve. The all-share index added 8.36 to 367.30 in turnover worth NKr426m, with sharpest gains coming in industrial and shipping stocks. STOCKHOLM weakened on profit-taking following its recent strong run. The Affarsvarlden index slipped 5.3 to 896.1 as turnover dropped to SKr793m from Monday's SKr922m. Volvo B shares weakened SKr17 to SKr340 on news of sharply lower November new car registrations. MADRID continued to fall with the general index closing down 1.85 at 212.01 in low turnover of some Pta8.4bn. VIENNA's ATX index ended 2.38 lower at 760.1. OMV lost Sch8 to Sch626 while Austrian Airlines fell Sch10 to Sch1,600. ISTANBUL rallied on bargain-hunting and the 75-share index finished 96.99 ahead at 3,883.23 in turnover estimated at TL199.5bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 1                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1056.19    1054.54    1054.36    1054.87 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1130.74    1129.66    1128.05    1129.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1055.28    1058.42    1057.36    1056.79 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1130.65    1134.44    1134.62    1135.62  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Nov 30    Nov 27    Nov 26    Nov 25    Nov 24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1057.75   1049.92   1048.05   1042.55   1038.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1132.14   1122.37   1118.56   1111.41   1110.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1059.16; 200 - 1135.77 Low/day: 100 - 1053.99  200 - 1127.14  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Logging charge angers Malaysia Malaysia has reacted angrily to Australian accusations that Malaysian logging companies are seriously damaging the environment in countries of the South Pacific. 'What is the business of Australia to criticise the presence of Malaysian or other foreign logging companies in the South Pacific islands?' said Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries. He suggested that Australia was jealous of the success of Malaysian companies in winning timber concessions in the region and was using a half truths to 'jumble up environmental facts'. At a recent meeting of leaders of South Pacific nations in Brisbane Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, accused Malaysian, South Korean and Indonesian logging companies of 'ripping off' the Solomon Islands by paying too little for valuable timber products. 'Unless the environmental piracy of foreign companies operating in the South Pacific region is controlled, the future for the region will be bleak,' Mr Keating declared. In recent years Malaysian timber companies have expanded their logging operations to countries in the South Pacific and there have been increasing protests about what are seen as the uncontrolled activities of these financially powerful concerns. In Papua New Guinea, where one privately controlled Malaysian concern is believed to control more than 60 per cent of log exports, the government recently brought in a series of measures to curb the activities of foreign loggers. A senior executive of one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates recently resigned after being accused of trying to bribe a Solomon Islands minister in connection with a timber deal - although he denied the charge.</p>

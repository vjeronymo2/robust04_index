			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Dandong, China's  biggest border city, achieved a turnover of 17.34 million U.S.  dollars in border trade from January to April this year, up 93  percent over the same period in 1993.    Located in northeast China's Liaoning Province, on the  northernmost part of the country's coastline, the city is  separated from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by a  river.    In its trade with Korea, Dandong exports grain, beef, meat,  textile goods, household electrical appliances and light  industry products, and imports steel, timber and aquatic  products.    The city now has more than 170 companies doing business with  Korean partners.    During recent trade talks in Pyongyang, the city's  representatives signed 11.9 million U.S. dollars-worth of  contracts for imports and exports with their Korean opposite  numbers.    This year, the city has issued a set of measures to  encourage  the border trade.    Dandong was included in the opening up coastal area in 1988  and became a government-approved border trade zone in 1992.</p>

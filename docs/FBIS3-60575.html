Dr Arthit said the ministry's epidemiology and AIDS  divisions  estimated that AIDS patients would increase from 16,250 in 1993  to 31,500 cases a year in 2000.    ``We can't ignore the AIDS problem any more. It is time to  collect state and private resources to control the spread of the  disease,'' Dr Athit said.    He said the Government had a clear policy on AIDS and would  do everything to prevent and control the problem. [passage  omitted]    The minister vowed that the ministry would develop and  expand  its services to cope with the problem and would provide equal  opportunities for use of public health services.    To mark World AIDS Day, the ministry yesterday organized  campaigns to fight AIDS in all provinces. [passage omitted]    The country has 3,769 reported cases of AIDS and 2,727  reported AlDS-related cases (ARC), Dr. Athit said.    Chiang Rai, Bangkok, Chiang Mai Lampang and Phayao are the  provinces with the highest number of reported AIDS cases.    Dr Athit said surveys conducted every six months since 1989  showed the rate of increase among individual drug users group  (IVDU) was constant at 35.21 per cent, whereas that of the sex  workers group had increased from 23.8 per cent to 28.67 per cent.    He said the statistics also showed an increase in pregnant  women with AIDS from one per cent to 1.39 per cent. [passge  omitted]</p>

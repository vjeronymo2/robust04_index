			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: New superstore for Berkshire town The P&amp;0 company BOVIS CONSTRUCTION has begun work on a Pounds 10.5m contract to build a 67,000 sq ft superstore for Safeway in Reading, Berkshire. Situated on Basingstoke Road, the new store will also offer a range of other facilities including a petrol station, post office, restaurant, baby changing rooms and a dry cleaners. Originally a rubbish dump and later a car showroom and servicing facility, the site required special preparation before building work could begin. This involved clearing waste materials and stripping off contaminated top soil up to a depth of 6m. As well as the construction of the store, petrol station and creation of a 667 space car park, Bovis is managing associated roadworks which will create a new roundabout and access to the store. Bovis will also fit out 35,000 sq ft of sales floor area in a 15-week programme. Work carried out will involve the installation of all shop floor services including underfloor heating, refrigeration units, checkouts, cash transfer systems and security systems. All back-up services for the coldrooms, freezers, ambient storage, bakery and food preparation areas will also be installed. Building work is due for completion in February 1994 and the store will open in March 1994.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Thirst for Old Speckled Hen lifts Morland to Pounds 9.1m Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer, trebled sales through wholesalers of Old Speckled Hen, its leading beer brand, in recording a near-20 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.62m to Pounds 9.12m. 'The results were achieved in the face of a particularly hostile environment both economically and climatically,' said Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chairman. 'Technically, we are told, the recession has ended. There is little indication of that in our market place.' Earnings per share improved 16 per cent to 30.3p (26.1p) and a final dividend of 6.96p increases the total in line with earnings growth to 9.74p (8.4p). Mr Clutterbuck said the figures, quoted on a pre-FRS 3 basis, gave 'a far better measure of the true performance of the company'. Under the new accounting standard, pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 rose 60 per cent, from Pounds 5.55m to Pounds 8.87m; earnings per share were 76 per cent higher at 29.1p (16.5p). Operating profit, before exceptionals, rose from Pounds 8.52m to Pounds 11.5m on turnover ahead 24 per cent at Pounds 50.9m. Old Speckled Hen's growth came mainly from trading agreements with national and regional brewers and increasing distribution in the take-home trade, but direct sales to independent pubs were also 14 per cent higher. 'It can now claim to be a national brand,' said Mr Clutterbuck. Overall, Morland's ale volumes rose 29 per cent and, with contract brewing for Courage, boosted production at the company's Abingdon brewery by 50 per cent. Two new ales, after successful test marketing, are to be launched in the new year. The retail division, comprising 75 managed outlets in the estate of 365 pubs, maintained margins and raised profits 15 per cent. Food now accounts for 26 per cent of turnover. Meals sold through the 11 Artist's Fares catering pubs increased 47 per cent to 450,000. Morland's tenanted pubs, which contribute 47 per cent of group profits, 'traded respectably during a particularly difficult time,' said Mr Clutterbuck. The 72 pubs bought from Inntrepreneur Estates last year have been integrated into the estate and are cash positive. Capital expenditure was Pounds 7.7m with Pounds 6.3m invested in the pubs and core business.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Moussa 'optimistic' on accord 'I WANT to assure you that this is a baby for sure, but when it will be born depends on a lot of things, but born, it will be,' Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said yesterday as he spoke of progress towards a Palestinian-Israeli peace in which his country has played a considerable behind-the-scenes role. While Mr Moussa did not wish to claim credit for having facilitated negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Israelis, there is no doubt that Egypt is assuming crucial importance in helping to deliver an historic agreement between once bitter foes. Mr Yassir Arafat, the Cairo-born Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, has visited Egypt three times since details emerged late last month of a ground-breaking agreement with Israel, using the Egyptian capital as a staging point for his forays into the wider Arab world. In Cairo yesterday, he held yet another round of talks with Egyptian officials, including President Hosni Mubarak, before heading off to Oman in the Gulf to drum up support. Mr Arafat had been unwelcome in almost all the Gulf states since his embrace of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. Mr Arafat's stance alienated his most important paymasters, the Saudis and Kuwaitis. Mr Moussa, who had participated in private talks yesterday with Mr Arafat, said in an interview he was 'cautiously optimistic' that the agreement on mutual recognition could be concluded by the weekend ready for signature in Washington next week. The Americans have nominated next Monday for the signing. 'We see good intentions on both sides,' he said. But 'formalities are formalities, and technicalities are technicalities, so discussions continue.' The Israelis are pressing the Palestinians to give specific undertakings to revise the PLO charter which, among other things, calls for the elimination of the State of Israel. Palestinian officials say they will give these undertakings, but formal revision of the PLO covenant would require approval of the Palestine National Council, or parliament-in-exile, the PLO's supreme policymaking body. Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel - the two countries signed their peace agreement in 1979 - is providing the benefit of its experience in negotiating detailed agreements with the Jewish state. Interestingly, several officials providing counsel to Mr Arafat were intimately involved in the Camp David process following late President Anwar Sadat's groundbreaking visit to Jerusalem in 1977. Among these officials are Mr Moussa himself who was head of the international department of the Egyptian foreign ministry at the time of Camp David, and Dr Osama al-Baz, who was a key aide to Mr Sadat and is now Mr Mubarak's political adviser. The two men were among a small number of Egyptian officials who were aware of developments from an early stage of the secret Palestinian-Israel negotiations in Norway. Mr Moussa is careful in describing Egypt's role to date, saying merely: 'The Palestinians I would say trust our judgment. Our opinion is given honestly with no ulterior motives. We provide advice when needed.' While the minister is careful about claiming credit for positive developments, he is less coy about his own country's interest in a successful outcome. Egypt is anxious that other Arab countries should join it in making peace with Israel. It also believes that peace between Israel and its neighbours is the best antidote to the worrying spread of Islamic extremism throughout the Arab world. Egypt itself has been a particular target recently. Describing Camp David as the first stage in a long process aimed at calming the region, the Madrid conference of 1991 as the second, and the proposed mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO as the third, Mr Moussa says: 'The major instability in this region emanates from this particular problem. If it is settled it will contribute to the amelioration of the general climate, and it will militate in favour of a more stable Middle East.'</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COWBOY ACTOR JOEL MCCREA DIES AT 84  </P> <P> Joel McCrea, a real-life cowboy who became one of the best of Hollywood's  make-believe saddle heroes, died Saturday at the Motion Picture and Television  Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills. He was 84.  </P> <P> Eileen Singer Brown, hospital supervisor, said McCrea died at 4:50 a.m. of  pulmonary complications. She said he had been a patient a short time, and that  his wife of 57 years, actress Frances Dee, had been constantly at his bedside.  </P> <P> McCrea's last public appearance was Oct. 1 when he attended a Beverly Hills  fund-raising dinner for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who is campaigning for  governor. Paramount Pictures executive producer A.C. Lyles, a friend of  McCrea's for many years, said First Lady Barbara Bush went over to McCrea after  her speech, put her hand in his hand, and said, "My hero."  </P> <P> "He lit up," Lyles said. "That summed up everybody's feeling about Joel."  </P> <P> Tall and taciturn, good-looking and good-humored, McCrea may have ranked just  behind John Wayne as the most believable of Western heroes. During a career  that spanned three decades, he made 86 motion pictures, starring in many of  them.  </P> <P> Although best remembered for his cowboy roles, he was a versatile actor who  handled frivolous light comedy and adventurous melodrama with the same skill he  brought to Westerns. Some of his best-known films were Westerns such as "The  Virginian," "Union Pacific" and "Wells Fargo," thrillers such as Alfred  Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent," and comedies such as Preston Sturges'  "Sullivan's Travels."  </P> <P> McCrea worked in at least three pictures with his wife, one of the most sought  after leading ladies of the 1930s.  </P> <P> Gossip columnists often referred to their union as "an ideal Hollywood  marriage," and it was one of the few that proved to be just that. They were  married in 1933, and were together until his death.  </P> <P> One of their three sons, Joel Dee, who is known as Jody, played the deputy in  McCrea's 1959-60 television series "Wichita Town."  </P> <P> Off screen, McCrea was as low key and down to earth as he appeared before the  cameras -- a working rancher, a shrewd businessman and a public-spirited  citizen active as a school board trustee in Ventura County.  </P> <P> McCrea was born Nov. 5, 1905, in South Pasadena, the son of a successful  executive. His Western heritage was strong: His maternal grandfather, Major  Albert Whipple, came to California during the Gold Rush in a covered wagon, and  his paternal grandfather, Major John McCrea, was an Indian fighter and  stagecoach driver.  </P> <P> Oddly, McCrea's future wife was born only five blocks away from his South  Pasadena home, but moved to Chicago at a very early age. They did not meet  until both were starting their movie careers.  </P> <P> The McCrea family moved to Hollywood when Joel was 8 or 9 and he then came into  contact with film figures -- he delivered the Los Angeles Times to such moguls  as Sam Goldwyn and Jesse Lasky, and stars such as William S. Hart and Wallace  Reid.  </P> <P> "I learned a good deal about life -- and Hollywood -- back then," McCrea  reminisced many years later. "There were certain stars, supposed to be worth  millions, who couldn't dig up the 60 cents, which The Times cost then, at the  end of the month."  </P> <P> Possibly because of such experiences, the lanky, adventurous youngster was less  star-struck than horse-struck. He loved and understood horses -- and started  hanging around the back lots of Hollywood, volunteering as a "horse-holder" for  cowboy star Tom Mix and one of his newspaper customers, Hart.  </P> <P> McCrea first went before the cameras at age 12. Ruth Roland, a star of silent  serials, was making a shoot-'em-up in the hills above Sunset Boulevard, and  young Joel was again a horse-holder. A New York stage actor had been brought  out to co-star with Roland.  </P> <P> "The guy could act all over the place," McCrea recalled in an interview many  years later. "But when they brought out the horses he was scared stiff. That's  how I got to ride his horse in a couple of shots. They dressed me up in  buckskins and for two days' work I was paid $5. Boy, that appealed to my Scotch  blood. I forgot about wanting to be a cowboy and decided to be an actor."  </P> <P> Not long afterward, he started working summers as a cowboy on the King Cattle  Co. ranch in the Tehachapi Mountains. He loved to tell stories about the cowboy  life.  </P> <P> "In rainy weather, I was sent to hoist mothering (pregnant) cows out of low  places," he remembered. "It rained like sixty. I found a cow that was bogged,  and I roped her and pulled."  </P> <P> After a pause to let his drawl catch up with his anecdote, he went on: "The  cayuse I rode wasn't too well broken -- he decided to turn around, fast, four  times. One end of the rope was wound around the cow's horns, the other tied to  my saddle-horn. I was in the middle. After almost being cut in two, I freed  myself."  </P> <P> It was then, he said, that he came up with a practical solution. "A horse, I  figured, gets up by raising his front legs first. A cow the opposite. Knee-deep  in mud, I got down behind the cow. I bent over, put the cow's tail around my  neck, gripped it with both hands and raised up with all the strength I could  manage. It worked."  </P> <P> No one but a real cowboy could tell such a story.  </P> <P> He graduated from Hollywood High School and enrolled at Pomona College. It was  there that he began acting in amateur roles.  </P> <P> McCrea decided that he liked the acting life and after college graduation in  1928 began haunting the studios and picking up occasional work as an extra.  </P> <P> His first feature role came in 1929 in "The Jazz Age," and in the same year he  played in "So This Is College," "Dynamite," and "The Silver Horde." He began  winning star roles the next year.  </P> <P> Ironically, considering his authentic cowboy background and rugged physique,  many of his early roles were as the effete, snooty rich kid.  </P> <P> Critics consider that his career peaked in the 1940s with "Foreign  Correspondent," "Sullivan's Travels," and "Palm Springs Story."  </P> <P> The general public undoubtedly remembers him best in big-budget Western epics  because his open, honest face, easy-going manner and relaxed seat on a horse  combined to make him more at home on the range than almost any other actor.  </P> <P> As producer Harry Sherman once put it: "Joel is the greatest natural Western  star since the old days of Tom Mix and William S. Hart. He has an authentic  background, and he is one of the finest natural horsemen I've ever seen. . . .  Just a guy who knows how to sit on a horse with grace and authority."  </P> <P> Or, as an admiring columnist expressed it: "A horse to him was like a sonnet to  Keats."  </P> <P> Real cowboys verified the judgment of these Hollywood types by electing McCrea  to the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City in 1958.  </P> <P> McCrea's poetic way with a horse and gritty Western look were perhaps most  evident in Sam Peckinpah's 1962 film "Ride the High Country," in which he and  Randolph Scott co-starred as a pair of over-the-hill lawmen transporting gold  to a bank.  </P> <P> McCrea was reputed to be one of the wisest investors and wealthiest actors of  his era, although he sometimes joked about his business acumen.  </P> <P> "My first business deal was with my mother," he once recounted. "I invested in  chickens. I sold the eggs to my mother. Then (after she had cooked them) I ate  the eggs. That's an ideal bargain."  </P> <P> McCrea attributed his financial success largely to the late Times columnist  Harry Carr and the late actor-humorist Will Rogers.  </P> <P> Early in his career, when McCrea had a reputation as something of a playboy,  Carr wrote privately to the star: "Don't let yourself slip into a state of mind  where you believe that these little screen games of pretend are life. . . .  Take all the easy money and save it. Accept what you find in Hollywood that is  good and valuable and turn your back on the rest."  </P> <P> McCrea said that he always tried to act on Carr's advice. On the advice of  Rogers, McCrea invested his Hollywood earnings in a 1,000-acre working cattle  ranch near Camarillo in Ventura County. He added to it over the years until he  owned 3,000 acres of prime ranchland, which later became prime residential  land. At one time, his ranch was producing 200,000 pounds of beef annually.  McCrea was active in its management and in riding, roping and branding.  </P> <P> In 1959, according to news reports, he sold 540 acres for $1.2 million, and  four years later sold another 1,000 acres for $3 million. He lived on part of  his original spread near Camarillo, and had another large ranch near Palos  Verdes and two more in New Mexico.  </P> <P> McCrea served as president of the local school board, chaired the fund-raising  committee for the Camarillo Boys Club and donated $35,000 toward a new  clubhouse. He also made substantial gifts to local colleges and the Tri-Valley  YMCA.  </P> <P> In addition to his wife and son Jody, now a rancher in New Mexico, he is  survived by two other sons, David, also a rancher in New Mexico, and Peter, a  real estate developer in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Funeral services in Westlake will be private. The family has asked that any  memorial contributions be made to the Conejo Valley YMCA, Camarillo Boys and  Girls Club, or Motion Picture and Television Fund.  </P></p>

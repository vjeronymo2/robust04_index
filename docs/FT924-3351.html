			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (6): US pioneers lured to new frontier by rich packages - European banks' activity in a growing market ENTHUSIASM FOR the derivatives market among banks and securities houses in Europe is unabated, even though most other areas of their business are contracting. European and Japanese banks are struggling to catch up with the US banks which were at the forefront of developing many innovative derivative instruments. The size of the derivatives market has increased substantially in the past two years. While the exchange-traded futures and options business is now considered a mature market, the market in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives  -specialised products designed to suit clients needs - is still expanding rapidly. 'A lot of European banks still have to complete their teams,' said Mr Tim Sheffield, an executive consultant specialising in derivatives at Jonathan Wren. 'Last year, many of them established their operations and entered the market. This year they have been building upon that base.' The US banks, which were the pioneers of OTC derivatives business, have started to see their dominance threatened in Europe, particularly by European banks anxious to take advantage of their strong credit ratings. The main strategy of European banks has been to hire experienced people from the leading US banks. In order to attract key people, European banks have had to offer substantial packages. But the tendency has been to offer increased bonuses and other perks, rather than raise basic salaries, in an attempt to control costs more effectively than in previous recruitment efforts. For example, a top equity derivatives salesperson is expected to generate revenues of Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m a year, for which he or she would receive a package consisting of Pounds 85,000-Pounds 100,000 basic, plus a bonus of around Pounds 300,000, according to Mr Sheffield. The policy of hiring a well-known market professional to head up a new derivatives team has proved an effective means of showing commitment to the market, and therefore of attracting the right team at the lower levels. The classic example is Credit Suisse Financial Products, now a market leader, which was set up 2 1/2 years ago under the leadership of Mr Allen Wheat, who had headed Bankers Trust's strong derivatives-led London operation. CSFP was then able to recruit top derivatives specialists, including a team from Bankers Trust, even though Credit Suisse First Boston, its sister company, did not previously have a strong presence in the derivatives market. From a start-up operation consisting of 30 people, the front- and back-office staff of CSFP now totals close to 500. 'It won't see the same helter-skelter growth over the next couple of years,' said Mr Wheat. He explained that the liability-management side of the business was mature, but that there would be some expansion on the investment management side. Although no separate results are published, CSFP is known to be a significant contributor to the bottom-line of Credit Suisse, its parent. 'The return on capital is way in excess of the average for the firm,' said Mr Wheat. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which has made a more recent push into derivatives, has followed an aggressive hiring policy in an effort to build its presence in the market. For example, the firm recently recruited Mr Ramy Goldstein, from Goldman Sachs, to head up its equity derivatives business in London. 'Recruitment became easier for them after that, and they were able to hire some top-quality sales people,' said Mr Sheffield, of Jonathan Wren. But the rapid expansion of the OTC market has made it hard to find experienced derivatives personnel. Most banks first look internally, perhaps moving staff from, say, fixed-income to equity derivatives, or from futures broking to OTC derivatives trading. There has been a strong build-up this year in equity derivatives, which many banks believe will see the fastest expansion, as more fund managers become users of derivatives. But there has also been a recent surge of growth in the area of structured foreign exchange derivatives, following the upheaval in the currency markets this autumn. Although exchange-traded futures and options are a much more mature business, the continued increase in the number of users of futures contracts in Europe has encouraged European banks to build teams in that area as well. While approaches to the structuring of derivatives business still vary - some institutions differentiate between equity and debt products, or between exchange-traded and OTC derivatives - many banks have been restructuring their derivatives operations this year. For example, National Westminster has been consolidating its exchange-traded business under NatWest Futures, and has set up a derivatives unit called NatWest Financial Products. But salaries are generally lower in the exchange-traded than in the OTC market, partly because exchange-traded markets tend to be more competitive and therefore less profitable. 'A good broker can be a loss maker if paid incorrectly,' said Mr Sheffield. For example, a successful broker earning Pounds 50,000-Pounds 60,000 could become a loss-maker if he was hired away for Pounds 80,000. Meanwhile, US banks, which have been suffering some loss of business as a result of their declining creditworthiness, are considering ways of creating credit-enhanced units through which to channel derivatives business. A number are likely to set up separately-capitalised derivatives units in the coming year, based loosely on the model of Merrill Lynch Derivatives Products, which was established a year ago. According to Mr Christian Schade, vice-president in charge of European swaps marketing at MLDP: '(Our derivatives business) has expanded across the board, because of the vehicle. We can deal with counterparties who would not normally consider us.' After its first year of trading, MLDP has a portfolio of 550 transactions with a notional value of Dollars 22bn, made up of 106 active counterparties. Revenues for the nine months ending in September totalled Dollars 13m. Salomon Brothers is expected to set up a credit-enhanced vehicle in the next few months, while other banks currently believed to be planning separately capitalised units are Continental, Citibank, Chase, Lehman Brothers and Kidder Peabody. Goldman Sachs set up a separately-capitalised derivatives unit earlier this year, but with somewhat different objectives. 'We had certain positions which it made sense to put into a special purpose vehicle; now we are starting to look at other ways to use it,' said Mr Kipp Nelson, an executive director at Goldman. 'It is not, broadly speaking, the vehicle we use for derivatives transactions.' While most banks with weak credit ratings, which are involved in the market, are now considering setting up credit-enhanced vehicles, the concept is still met with scepticism in some quarters. 'To go the full route, you have to put up a lot of capital, so unless you can generate a lot of activity, the return on capital may not be satisfactory,' said one banker. The derivatives market boasts many success stories. But some banks and securities houses have paid a price for their rush to participate. Inadequate systems, weak controls, or simply insufficient understanding of complex risks have created a number of victims. The enthusiasm of some Japanese entrants to the market last year has noticeably abated, while the recent shock waves in the foreign currency markets also claimed some victims. But with attractive margins still to be earned, many senior managers feeling that they cannot afford to stay out of the market.</p>

Decent housing also includes increasing the supply of supportive housing, which combines structural features and services needed to enable persons with special needs to live with dignity and independence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A suitable living environment includes improving the safety and livability of neighborhoods; increasing access to quality public and private facilities and services; reducing the isolation of income groups within a community or geographical area through the spatial deconcentration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income and the revitalization of deteriorating or deteriorated neighborhoods; restoring and preserving properties of special historic, architectural, or aesthetic value; and conservation of energy resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Expanded economic opportunities includes the provision of jobs accessible to housing affordable to low income persons, including provision of jobs involved in carrying out activities under programs covered by this plan to low-income persons living in areas affected by those programs and activities; availability of mortgage financing for low income persons at reasonable rates using nondiscriminatory lending practices; access to capital and credit for development activities that promote the long-term economic and social viability of the community; and empowerment and self-sufficiency opportunities for low income persons to reduce generational poverty in federally assisted and public housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The consolidated submission described in this part 91 requires the jurisdiction to state in one document its plan to pursue these goals for all the community planning and development programs, as well as for housing programs. It is these goals against which the plan and the jurisdiction's performance under the plan will be evaluated by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Functions of plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The consolidated plan serves the following functions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A planning document for the jurisdiction, which builds on a participatory process at the lowest levels;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An application for federal funds under HUD's formula grant programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Czechs pick motorway bidders GERMAN, French and Italian companies have been shortlisted to bid for one of the first privately financed motorways in eastern Europe. Three consortiums have been chosen by the Czech Republic to bid for an 83km stretch of motorway from Rozvadov on the Czech-German border to Plzen, roughly halfway between the border and Prague. It is part of a planned motorway linking the Czech capital and Nuremburg in Germany. The road is expected to cost about Pounds 280m, including finance charges, according to Kleinwort Benson, the British merchant bank advising the Czech authorities. The republic plans to offer concessions for a further 400km of private toll motorway if the initial project succeeds. The three consortiums include construction companies and toll road operators. They are: Strabag International of Germany; Stavby of the Czech Republic and GTM International, Dumez International and Cofiroute of France. Philipp Holzmann of Germany; Cogefarimprsit of Italy and Nord Franc, Tranroute International, and Beugnet of France. Italstrade, Autostrade, Salini Construttori and Girola of Italy and Hochtief of Germany. The Czechs, who face heavy demands on their road systems because of rising levels of car ownership and growing east-west trade, have turned to private operators because they lack funds to build motorways themselves.</p>

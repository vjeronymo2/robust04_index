			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (AFP)--China said Wednesday [20  April] it hoped former US President Richard Nixon, whose  historic 1972 visit here paved the way for the restoration of  Sino-US ties, would recover soon from a severe stroke. "Nixon  is an old friend of the Chinese people. He has made positive  contributions to the development of Sino-US relations," a  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. "We hope Mr. Nixon will  recover soon," she said.    The 81-year-old former president was rushed back into  intensive care in a New York hospital as his condition  deteriorated late Tuesday after suffering a stroke that left him  partially paralysed. "There are potentially poor outcomes. His  prognosis is guarded," Dr. Fred Plum told reporters at the  hospital.    Nixon's 1972 visit, during which he met with late chairman  Mao Zedong, opened the door to the establishment of full Sino-US  diplomatic relations seven years later. Washington had  previously refused to recognise the communist regime which came  to power here in 1949, instead maintaining ties with the  Nationalist government that had fled to Taiwan after losing the  civil war on the mainland. Nixon has since maintained close  contacts with China, visiting the country several times.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / S Korean candidates trade insults SOUTH Koreans vote today in presidential elections after a campaign in which allegations of vote-buying and state interference in the electoral process have overtaken discussion of key issues such as the ailing economy. Mr Kim Young-sam of the ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP) and Mr Kim Dae-jung of the main opposition Democratic party are virtually tied in private surveys - publication of opinion polls in banned. The outcome is likely to be determined by the performance of Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai business group, who is attracting votes mainly from the DLP. The campaign's last days have had the atmosphere of a thriller, with talk of secret corporate funds, North Korean spies, electronic eavesdropping and 'black' propaganda. In other respects, the election has shown that democracy is taking root five years after the downfall of military dictatorship. Gone are the tear gas attacks that marred rallies in the 1987 election. Political analysts believe mud-slinging was inevitable since personalities, rather than issues, dominate Korean politics. There is little to distinguish the centrist policies of the main contenders. Although turnout is expected to exceed 80 per cent of the 29m registered voters, crowds at election rallies are smaller than in 1987 when Koreans wanted to show support for their new political freedoms. The faltering economy and a lacklustre campaign threatened to erode the lead of Mr Kim Young-sam, who has been the frontrunner all year long. When opinion surveys showed his support to be weakening, he went on the offensive accusing Mr Chung of trying to 'buy' the election by illegally employing the financial resources and manpower of the Hyundai industrial empire, Korea's largest. This coincided with a police investigation of Hyundai's role in the election. Mr Kim Young-sam has focused on the weaknesses of his opponents. Although Koreans admire Mr Chung for building up Hyundai many also fear that the chaebol, the country's family-run conglomerates such as Hyundai, will come to dominate politics as the military once did. Public distrust of Mr Kim Dae-jung is based on his long association with the trade union and dissident movements and his geographical origins. He comes from the south-western Cholla region, the most underdeveloped and rebellious part of the country. Mr Kim Young-sam may find his tactics could backfire. His own weakness lies in the public perception that he is a political opportunist after he left the opposition and joined the ruling party in 1990, with the promise that he would become its presidential candidate. The DLP candidate's attacks against Mr Chung and Hyundai have been alleged to be part of a biased government effort to focus attention on illegal election practices of the opposition candidates. Mr Kim Young-sam was thrown on the defensive this week when Mr Chung's party revealed it had a tape recording of a secret meeting among local government officials in Pusan discussing means to help the DLP candidate. The meeting in Pusan appeared to prove that the government was interfering in the election on his behalf. The disclosure led to the forced resignation of the Pusan mayor and other officials and may represent a serious setback for Mr Kim Young-sam.</p>

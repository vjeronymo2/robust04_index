			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>   [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 21 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The Mongolian  Democratic Union and a number of other opposition forces held a  rally here today demanding the government's resignation. In  their view, the cabinet's socioeconomic program is not in any  state to extricate the country from crisis. The opposition also  called on the law and order agencies to urgently start an  investigation into facts relating to accusations that  high-ranking officials are involved in corruption and abuse of  their official position.    The hunger strike on Ulaanbaatar's main square by activists  of the opposition forces has been going on for seven days now,  in spite of the fact that the president and parliament have  spoken in favor of this extreme political action being ended.  The hunger strike on Freedom Square, organized by supporters of  the government, has already been going on for five days now.  They have stated that they will only stop it after the  opposition does the same.    "Free microphones" have been set up in both squares which  anyone can use who wants to talk about the problems worrying him.    Today, according to a report from a source in parliament,  members of the Great Hural discussed the political situation in  the country. The draft decision on this issue was handed over to  the leaders of the political parties.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / B&amp;C court ruling may be worth 15p in Pounds to creditors BRITISH and Commonwealth yesterday won its marathon litigation against Quadrex Holdings of the US and Samuel Montagu, the merchant banking arm of Midland Bank, in a ruling that could be worth up to 15p in the pound to creditors of the failed financial services group. Administrators for B&amp;C argued that Quadrex's failure to complete an agreed purchase of the moneybrokers division of Mercantile House, which B&amp;C took over in 1987, had cost it Pounds 200m (Dollars 344m). However, yesterday's High Court ruling from Mr Justice Gatehouse that B&amp;C was entitled to damages is not the end of a legal battle which has become one of the largest civil actions ever fought in the UK courts. Hearings to assess the amount of damages will take place later this year and might still have to await the outcome of an appeal should one be launched. Mr Peter Phillips, a joint administrator of B&amp;C, called the outcome 'satisfactory' for creditors of the group that was once valued at Pounds 2.5bn but collapsed last year owing Pounds 1.2bn. The creditors are unlikely to see any payments from the Pounds 415m so far realised from asset sales before the end of 1991. The ruling will also allow B&amp;C to claim against Samuel Montagu, which acted as Quadrex's merchant banker during the negotiations between Mr Gary Klesch, of Quadrex, and Mr John Gunn, the then B&amp;C chairman. The judge described the frenzied atmosphere during the 1987 negotiations when the City was in its heyday of takeover activity and undertakings were made to clinch deals that could not be relied upon. Mr Justice Gatehouse said Mr Ian McIntosh, the head of corporate finance, twice told B&amp;C that funds were available to Quadrex for the Pounds 280m agreed purchase of the wholesale broking division when, in fact, they were not available. The judge said he did not believe Mr Gunn and Mr Peter Goldie, the then chief executive, had acted dishonestly in failing to correct statements made in the negotiations to the effect that B&amp;C had not been provided by Mercantile with any financial information about its subsidiaries that was not then publicly available. However, he did say that Quadrex was entitled to a reduction in the damages due to B&amp;C because the two men had not corrected their original statements when they became aware of further information later in the negotiations. That reduction should amount to Pounds 20m, the judge said. Neither B&amp;C nor Quadrex had full information on Mercantile's moneybroking operations. Mr Gunn was in the process of taking over Mercantile when it was negotiating with Mr Klesch. Mr Phillips said the damages could be recovered against either Samuel Montagu or Quadrex or both. However, once decided, they should be split evenly between the two defeated parties in the case.</p>

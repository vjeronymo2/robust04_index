			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Campaign to sell education abroad THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday set up a trade group to improve the UK's educational exports. The aim is to improve the marketing of British further and higher education to foreigners - which already contributes some Pounds 1.5bn annually to the UK economy - and to make improvements in the markets for providing government training schemes and scientific equipment. Baroness Perry, who recently retired as vice-chancellor of South Bank University, will lead the department's new education and training group. Her priority will be to improve British competitiveness in bidding for training contracts in developing countries which are funded by the World Bank and usually awarded by national governments. She says the UK lags behind Germany and the US. The group will aim to re-establish links with Thailand and establish a hold on other 'emerging markets', such as South Korea and Taiwan. Baroness Perry claimed that Britain's hold on some of its traditional markets had been weakened because universities and colleges had competed against each other. She contrasted this with the closely co-ordinated marketing effort by independent schools.</p>

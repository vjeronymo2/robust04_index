			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] Hajj is the meeting point of a large gathering  of Muslim ummah from all parts of the world in a place of  worship, full of devotion, and to secure the true identity and  sublime human and divine position. Hajj pilgrimage means being  liberated from oneself and joining good. Stepping over whims  and desires, climbing the summit, the knowledge, and cleansing  the soul from all pollution and adorning it with all kinds of  beauties [passage omitted]    Alongside religious and worship proportions, hajj rituals  also seek to explore and examine the problems and difficulties  of the Islamic community in various political and social areas  and to talk out plans to counter the enemies of Islam. Those  involved in the administration of the Islamic communities, along  with religious scholars and leaders, come together with all  parts of the world in hajj rituals. While renewing their pledge  of Islamic brotherhood, they embark upon deliberation and  discussion to find appropriate and comprehensive solutions to  the problems of the Islamic community, thus boosting  international Islamic relations and levelling the ground for  ever greater unity and solidarity in the world of Islam.    Meanwhile, the important point is the gathering of the world  Muslims in the ceremonies of deliverance from infidels, which  enjoys special status and importance in hajj rituals.  Deliverance from infidels is a divine tradition, whose  performance is rated as one of the important obligations of hajj  pilgrims. During these ceremonies, the Muslims come together  and publicly voice their detestation towards the polytheists and  the oppressors throughout the world.    The fear of the anti-Islamic statesmen encountering this  Islamic tradition lies in the fact that this act is considered  as the political spirit of hajj rituals; and it is indeed so.  The world hegemonist powers always seek to encourage the  Muslims to center their attention merely on the religious and  individual aspects of the religion of Islam and constantly  attempt to reject the political dimension of Islam as null and  void. However, as it is inferred and understood from the  Islamic knowledge and also from the history of advent of Islam,  the religion of Islam is intertwined with politics, and those  Muslims who fail to take into consideration various aspects and  dimensions of their faith are not proper Muslims from the  Islamic point of view. Hence, the real and concrete hajj is the  hajj all of whose rituals, including declaration of deliverance  from infidels, are fulfilled properly.</p>

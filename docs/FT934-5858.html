			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Japan Underlying the 17 per cent fall in the Nikkei over the past month is the fear that economic recovery might be receding to the end of next year and beyond. There is no consensus on when the upturn might happen or on how strong it will be - just a deepening general depression about the continuing stream of poor economic and corporate results, including those in the past few days from the banks. Two things are necessary to revive the market. One is a large economic stimulus from the government, with cuts in both corporate and income taxes. The other is evidence that Japanese industry is prepared to cut costs far more than up till now. Otherwise it will be hard pushed to improve earnings when the outlook for sales is so poor. Both developments are politically difficult, but if they do not come about, the index could easily drift down below 16,000 points. At that point the market's weakness would start to threaten banks' capital ratios, putting another restraint on recovery.</p>

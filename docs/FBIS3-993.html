			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Editor Mathatha Tsedu] </F>   [Text] The Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania goes  into this election fully confident that the oppressed masses  will see through the fraud of the Kempton Park agreements and  remember that the PAC opposed the deals. But even more, said  president Clarence Mlamli Makwetu, the PAC hoped that Africans  would vote for it because of the policies it espouses.    Policies such as a "caring economy", land repossession, its  stand on violence, housing provision, health and on  privatisation. Plagued by internal dissent over its  participation in the negotiations, Makwetu says the decision was  right and the PAC has many gains to show for its participation.    The chairing of the deliberations by judges had "given the  regime an advantage as the judges are not neutral but State  appointees. We said they should go, and they went", he said.  To accusations that the PAC was "an also ran", a party that  went into the talks but fails to get any of its points across,  he said:    "We opposed the division of the country into regions. We  were against the entire package. We want the return of the land  and opposed property rights given to settlers. We did what we  did but they were refused. But we got vote for the African  people. We fought for it and we got it and that is important,"  Makweti said.    While the interim constitution provides for semi autonomous  regions that are getting more powers through trilateral talks  with the rightwing, the ANC [African National Congress] and the  Government, the PAC wanted a centralised country and was asking  for a mandate to change the interim constitution and bring a  more people-oriented system.    "We rate our chances as very good. Opinion polls are not a  factor, they do not worry us when they say we have very little  support because they are never accurate. In Britain they said  the Labour Party would win the last election and it did not  happen. In Zimbabwe they said the same thing about ZANU  [Zimbabwe African National Union] and Mugabe. In Lesotho  recently, the BNP [Basotho National Party] was given a big lead,  only for the BCP [Basotho Congress Party] to win all seats. We  rely on the grassroots and our chances are good.    "We do not have money. We are not a rich organisation and we  shall cut our suit according to our cloth. We are not going to  rely as much on the media advertisements as other rich parties  but we will do the canvassing ourselves. And it is in these  campaigns that we see the support. When the PAC was formed in  1960, we had only six branches on the Cape Peninsula, and a few  in Soweto, Natal and Pretoria. But today for example, out of  the 28 districts in Transkei, we have over 40 branches. We have  branches all over the Orange Free State, Transvaal and the Cape.  Our strength is there," he said.    Makwetu could not explain in detail what the caring economy  promised by the PAC was. The PAC was opposed to capitalism and  favoured socialism as a broad concept. "We want an economy that  takes care of its people. Socialism itself as a word is  meaningless and we believe that socialisation of economy,  through the participation of workers in the process of ownership  of industry will ensure that workers' interests are protected.  Workers should be involved in decision making and also carry  some of the responsibility that goes with that. Those who argue  that socialism would fail, and that investors would flee should  look at what is happening in China, where the entire Western  world is flocking now," Makwetu said.    The PAC rejects the cut-off point of 1913 for land claims as  contained in the interim constitution. "We say 1652 is the  start of the land dispossession and should be the cut-off point.  We will not pay for land that was stolen from us when we take  it back. Compensation will only be considered for improvements  made to the land," he added.    The repossession of the land will however not mean that each  and every African will be given a piece of land. "Africans will  have to make up their minds whether they want to be workers or  farmers. And in the case of the latter, proof of an ability to  farm will be needed before land is allocated for farming. We  will also give each squatter a piece of a plot to live on.  There is enough land in our country to do that and there is no  need for the congestion that we see in every town."    The PAC does not have all the answers to the housing  problem,  he said. It foresaw a co-operation between the State -- which  would provide land and infrastructure -- and the private sector.  The PAC saw the ongoing violence as a state orchestrated  phenomenon and rejected the idea that it was black on black.  The PAC would curb ownership of guns and change laws so that no  one could own 27 weapons as presently allowed by the law.    The violence had nothing to do with the armed struggle as  the  revolutionary forces were directing their energies against the  regime, he said. His organisation cannot be specific about its  health policy, except to say that one health care system will be  in place. Whether the service will be free he could not yet  say, he added.    The same applied to privatised national state concerns such  as Iscor [South African Iron and Steel Corporation], Telkom and  the Railways. Nationalisation usually benefited the new elite  and not the people. The PAC however supported affirmative  action but this would have to be done in a way that did not  result in the lowering of standards.    Doors had to be opened and opportunities created for the  development of entrepreneurs so that "Africans are not just a  nation of workers and shop stewards." The playing field was  presently unequal for political campaigning despite talks of  this being done. "The international community and big business  are supporting one party and I am afraid that I may not be able  to convince my colleagues in the event of losing that the  process had been free and fair," he said.    The PAC was however committed to the process and will honour  and accept the outcome of the elections as it was convinced that  despite all the hurdles, the African community would see through  the process and vote for a party that will truly give them  freedom and justice.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Egypt has voiced concern over the repeated  noncompliance with a cease-fire in Yemen, warning that a  cease-fire should take priority over any other consideration.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Counselor Nazi al-Khudayr made a  statement to our radio correspondent commenting on the  unsuccessful attempts to maintain a cease-fire in Yemen. He  said: Egypt backs any efforts to resolve the disputes among the  brothers in Yemen in a peaceful manner that will preserve the  country's remaining resources and the mutual trust among its  sons.</p>

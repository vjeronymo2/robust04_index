			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / US details Cuba refugee plan The US yesterday announced long-awaited details of its plan to issue visas to 20,000 Cubans, promised as part of an agreement with the Castro regime last month. A State Department spokeswoman said the government would expand the criteria for refugee status, review previously denied refugee cases and make visas immediately available to unmarried children of Cubans already issued immigrant visas or granted refugee status. The government would operate a lottery that 'will substantially broaden avenues of legal migration for all Cubans, including those without direct family ties to the US'. The new visa programmes would be available to Cubans now in Cuba. Those in safe havens at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in Panama would be told about the programmes but must return home in order to participate.</p>

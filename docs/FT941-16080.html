			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Brief Description of the Clauses and Schedules of The Finance Bill The Treasury has issued background notes describing briefly the clauses and schedules of the Finance Bill, which was published yesterday. PART I CUSTOMS AND EXCISE GENERAL Rates of Duty Clause 1 and Schedule 1 introduce new rates of duty for wine and cider from January 1 1994. The duty rates are increased by 1.9 per cent except for the duty on wine exceeding 15 per cent but not exceeding 22 per cent alcohol by volume which is reduced by 5.9 per cent. Clause 2 increases the rates of specific duty on tobacco products by 7.3 per cent with effect from 6pm on November 30 1993. Clause 3 increases the rates of duty on hydrocarbon oils with effect from 6pm on November 30 1993. The duty on leaded petrol is increased by 8.6 per cent, on unleaded petrol by 9.9 per cent and on diesel by 10.2 per cent. There are similar increases for other oil products. Clause 4 raises the minimum VED rate where 6 monthly licensing is allowed from Pounds 35 to Pounds 50; taxes old motorcycles in Northern Ireland the same as in the UK; ensures that hackney carriages in Northern Ireland are taxed the same as in the UK; sets new rates of duty for articulated lorries used in combined transport; amends the concessionary rates of duty for certain farmers and showmen's goods vehicles; and raises the rate of duty on cars, light goods vehicles and taxis from Pounds 125 to Pounds 130. Other provisions Clause 5 and Schedule 2 cover amendments to the Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971, not contained in clause 4, which are required to facilitate the consolidation planned for later this year. Clause 6 and Schedule 3 restructure the administrative arrangements for the issue of gaming machine licences. The changes deregulate licensing periods and the application procedure; abolish special licences; define the seasonal licence concession and revise the amendment and surrender provisions. APPEALS AND PENALTIES VAT and duties tribunal Clause 7 changes the name of the existing VAT Tribunals to become VAT and Duties Tribunals, and extends their jurisdiction to excise and customs matters referred to in later clauses. It also provides for rules to be made so that costs awarded against an appellant may be recovered as if they were duty. Civil penalties Clause 8 introduces an alternative means of penalising any person engaged in evasion, or attempted evasion, of excise duty. Instead of prosecuting in the criminal courts the Commissioners of Customs and Excise will be able to impose a civil penalty of an amount equal to the excise duty evaded or sought to be evaded. The penalty may be mitigated to a lesser amount by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise or, on appeal, by the VAT and Duties Tribunals. Clause 9 and Schedule 4 provide for civil penalties to be imposed on any person breaching excise law. These penalties will be Pounds 250 for most offences. Some penalties (for example those for failure to pay duty) will be calculated by reference to the amount of the duty. In such cases the penalties will be Pounds 250 or 5 per cent of the duty, whichever is greater. In addition, daily penalties of Pounds 20 per day will be chargeable for specified continuing offences. Schedule 4 lists all excise offences which have been decriminalised under this clause. Clause 10 ensures that a penalty provided for under clause 9 will not be imposed where there is a reasonable excuse for the conduct giving rise to the penalty. Inability to pay a penalty, reliance on a third party, or conduct by third parties, are not acceptable as reasonable excuses. Clause 11 provides that where any person, without reasonable excuse, breaches an agreement not to remove goods distrained on in lieu of excise duty or penalties, he shall be liable to a penalty equal to 50 per cent of the duty or the penalties in question. This clause does not have effect in Scotland. Assessments to excise duty or to penalties Clause 12 provides for the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to assess duty underpaid, not paid, or overclaimed. Such assessments must be made within one year of facts sufficient to make an assessment coming to the knowledge of the Commissioners and, except in cases of fraud or dishonesty, within six years of the taxpayer becoming liable to pay the duty. In cases of fraud or dishonesty the six-year limit will be extended to 20 years. Clause 13 provides for civil penalties to be assessed and for penalty amounts to be recoverable as duty. Where assessments are for both duty and civil penalties, both must be identified separately. Customs and excise reviews and appeals Clause 14 and Schedule 5 require the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to review certain decisions if given notice in writing, and describe reviewable decisions. In addition the clause prescribes the time limit for requesting a review and the conditions for any further review. It requires the Commissioners to give decisions in writing if so requested, and empowers them to add to the list of reviewable decisions by statutory instrument. Clause 15 sets out the review procedures. On review a decision may be confirmed, withdrawn, or varied. Only penalties issued under clause 8 (civil evasion of excise duty) may be mitigated. If the Commissioners fail to notify the outcome of a review within 45 days it will be assumed that they have confirmed their original decision. Clause 16 provides for appeals to the VAT and Duties Tribunals. The Tribunal may not hear an appeal unless the appellant is the same person who required the Commissioners to conduct a review and the Commissioners are content that any relevant revenue is secure. The Tribunal may, in some matters, overturn the decision in dispute, quashing or varying it, substituting their own decisions in its place. In other matters their role is more limited. Schedule 5 lists the other matters. Supplemental provisions Clause 17 defines terms used in clauses 7 - 19 and schedules 4 and 5. Clause 18 details amendments of other legislation as a consequence of the clauses 7 to 19 and schedules 4 and 5. Clause 19 makes provision for the introduction of the provisions set out in clauses 7 to 19 and schedules 4 and 5. The Commissioners of Customs and Excise may bring into effect, by order, the provisions and they may appoint different days for different provisions or purposes (including different duties). CUSTOMS: ENFORCEMENT POWERS Clause 20 sets out the scope of information-gathering powers in the customs area, which are being amended to fit in with the increasing use of inland, audit-based controls instead of frontier checks. The powers are modelled on those already existing for excise and VAT and apply to any person whose business activities involve goods which are subject to any customs duty or a European Community agricultural levy. Clause 21 enables the Commissioners to make regulations requiring any person to whom the powers apply to keep records of their business activity and to preserve such records for up to four years. Such regulations may also require a person concerned in some other capacity with the importation or exportation of customs goods (such as a manufacturer of components of customs goods) similarly to keep and preserve records for up to four years. Clause 22 allows copies of documents to be admissible as evidence to the same extent as the records themselves. This is also the case for certain documents generated by a computer. Clause 23 enables Customs officers to require persons involved with customs goods to furnish information or produce documents about their business, or to require any other person who has possession of those documents to produce them. It enables officers to take copies of, make extracts from, or, if necessary, remove any document. Clause 24 gives officers the authority to enter and inspect business premises that may be used in connection with customs goods, and to inspect any goods found on them. Clause 25 permits a justice, on application by an officer, to order the production of documents or information potentially required as evidence. Clause 26 outlines the procedures which are to be followed by an officer who has removed documents under an order made under clause 25. On request, an officer is required to provide access to or copies of the documents, unless to do so would prejudice an investigation or possible criminal proceedings. Clause 27 provides safeguards to ensure that the appropriate judicial authority may order an officer to comply with the procedures set out in clause 26. AIR PASSENGER DUTY The duty Clause 28 introduces a new air passenger duty on flights beginning in the UK. The duty will apply to a chargeable passenger who travels on a chargeable aircraft and will be accounted for by the operator of the aircraft. Clause 29 provides for the definitions of chargeable and non-chargeable aircraft. Aircraft of under 10 tonnes maximum take-off weight or seating fewer than 20 passengers will not be chargeable. Clause 30 sets the rates of the duty. It provides that where the flight ends in the UK or elsewhere in the European Community, the rate of duty will be Pounds 5; for other destinations the rate will be Pounds 10. Clause 31 provides for a passenger with a return ticket to a final destination within the UK to be charged the appropriate rate of duty on the outward leg of the journey only. The clause also provides that passengers on transfer and transit flights, which will be defined in secondary legislation, are not liable for duty for the flight immediately following their transfer or transit, and that children under two who are not allocated a separate seat before entering the aircraft are excluded from the duty. Clause 32 provides that where circumstances beyond a passenger's control cause a change in flight plans shown on his ticket, this will not lead to an increase in the amount of duty due. Persons liable for the duty Clause 33 provides for the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to keep a register of aircraft operators. It also requires the operator of a chargeable aircraft to register with Customs and Excise within a prescribed time, and provides for a penalty for failure to notify liability to register. Clause 34 provides for an operator who does not have any business or other fixed establishment in the UK to appoint a fiscal representative who will account for the duty on their behalf. The clause also provides for the fiscal representative to be jointly and severally liable for the duty. Clause 35 provides a power to make regulations concerning the appointment of fiscal representatives and provides for an operator who does not appoint a fiscal representative within the specified time to be liable to a penalty. Clause 36 permits the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, where appropriate, to require a registered operator or fiscal representative to provide security for payment of any duty that is due or may become due. It also provides for a penalty for failure to provide security. Clause 37 provides that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise may notify the operator's handling agent that they will be jointly and severally liable for any future duty if the operator fails to pay within 90 days any duty due, or fails to appoint a fiscal representative when required to do so. Clause 38 provides for regulations specifying accounts which operators shall keep, and procedures for making returns and paying duty due. It also provides for penalties for failure to comply. Administration and enforcement Clause 39 and Schedule 6 provide that air passenger duty will be a duty of excise and accordingly shall be under the care and management of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. Schedule 6 sets out provisions relating to administration and enforcement of the duty. Clause 40 creates offences for fraudulent evasion of air passenger duty and false declarations. Supplementary Clause 41 provides for regulations and orders to be made by statutory instrument. Clause 42 contains definitions and provides that where not otherwise specified, terms have the same meaning as in the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. Clause 43 provides that duty will be due in respect of any carriage of passengers by air after 30 September 1994. PART II VALUE ADDED TAX Clause 44 provides for an increase in the minimum amount of repayment supplement which Customs and Excise are required to pay in the event of there having been undue delay in the repayment of VAT claims. The amount is increased from Pounds 30 to Pounds 50. The clause also withdraws the provision whereby VAT claims may be received up to one month late and still qualify for repayment supplement. In future late claims will not qualify for repayment supplement. Clause 45 excludes all insolvent VAT registered businesses from the provisions of section 21 of the Finance Act 1988. This will make it easier for insolvent businesses to survive, as VAT credits accruing after the insolvency will not be used to pay VAT debts from before the insolvency. PART III INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX The basic provisions Clause 46 provides for a new tax, insurance premium tax, to be administered by Customs and Excise. Clause 47 provides that the tax will be charged on premiums (for taxable insurance contracts) received by insurers on or after October 1 1994 (but see also clause 66). Clause 48 provides that premiums received will be deemed to include tax (but clause 67 restricts this where the contract is for both taxable and exempt insurance). Clause 49 sets the rate of tax at 3 per cent. Clause 50 places the liability to pay the tax on the insurer, except where regulations make the insured person liable (see clause 65). Administration Clause 51 stipulates that insurers providing taxable insurance must be registered (until they cease to provide such insurance and have paid all tax due) and must notify Customs and Excise of this liability. The clause provides for regulations to establish the detailed provisions and requirements for registration. Clause 52 permits regulations to be made to specify the form and manner of tax returns and how tax is to be paid. Clause 53 deals with cases where any part of a premium for taxable insurance is repaid to a policyholder and allows regulations to provide for credit of tax to insurers in such cases, and how such credit may be claimed. Clause 54 allows the Commissioners to make assessments of tax due from a person, which are then recoverable as if they were tax. It contains provisions specifying, for example, the circumstances both in which assessments may be made and in which they must be withdrawn, the basis on which assessments are to be made, and when two or more assessments may be combined into one. Tax representatives Clause 55 provides for insurers with no establishment in the UK, and who are registered (or liable to be registered) for the tax, to appoint a tax representative approved by the Commissioners. It provides that their tax representative will, if no one else is appointed, be taken to be the person who is their general representative for the purposes of EC regulatory requirements. In extreme cases where no suitable representative has been appointed, the clause also allows the Commissioners to direct any agent of the insurer to be the tax representative. Clause 56 imposes various rights and obligations jointly and severally on the tax representative and the insurer, but provides that only the insurer is liable to register, and restricts the liability of a tax representative for an offence committed by the insurer to cases where both are at fault. Review and appeal Clause 57 grants the right to those affected to require the Commissioners to review certain decisions, such as an assessment for tax or whether a person is liable to be registered. The clause includes restrictions on the time allowed both to lodge a request for review and for the review to be carried out. Clause 58 allows appeals to an independent tribunal against decisions which have been reviewed by the Commissioners. For some cases, the clause requires the appellant to have made all returns and paid all tax due, and usually any amount in dispute, before an appeal can be heard. It also provides, following an appeal, where appropriate, for payment of interest by the Commissioners to the appellant or vice versa. Clause 59 provides for the introduction of the review and appeals procedure on a date specified by an order made by the Commissioners. Miscellaneous Clause 60 allows regulations to determine who is to fulfil the tax obligations of insurers which are partnerships or other unincorporated bodies, and to make various provisions relating to bankrupt insurers and insurance businesses transferred from one person to another as a going concern. Clause 61 and Schedule 7 make various provisions relating to records insurers and others are required to keep, powers of Customs and Excise officers, recovery of tax, offences and penalties, interest, and other matters. Clause 62 gives the Commissioners the power to make insured persons jointly and severally liable for tax on their premiums when the insurer has neither a UK establishment nor an approved tax representative. It provides that the insured person can only be liable for tax incurred after receipt of a notice from the Commissioners, and that any tax paid by the insured person is liable to be refunded by the insurer. The clause allows regulations to be made relating to the collection of tax from the insured and prevents the same tax from being recovered more than once from people who are jointly and severally liable for it. Clause 63 allows the Commissioners, where the premium is artificially low, to direct that tax be accounted for on the open market value of the insurance cover to which the premium relates. Clause 64 provides anti-forestalling measures under which certain premiums paid between Budget day and October 1 1994 are deemed to be received on October 1 1994 (and therefore taxable if they relate to taxable insurance). Clause 65 provides that, where a contract is for both taxable and exempt insurance, tax is only to be charged on the portion of the premium which relates to the taxable insurance. Thus, for example, tax will not apply to any portion of a premium which relates to risks outside the UK. Supplementary Clause 66 defines taxable insurance contracts and thus the scope of the tax, listing those types of insurance which are exempt from the tax. Clause 67 allows the list of exemptions from the tax to be amended by Treasury Order. Clause 68 defines the premium for taxation purposes, treating separate payments as separate premiums, and stipulates that non-monetary payment should be taken at its open market value. It also states that a premium will be treated as received by the insurer as soon as it is received by someone (such as an intermediary) on the insurer's behalf. Clause 69 defines various terms and provides that the rules used to determine whether a risk is located in the UK should be those set out in the Insurance Companies Act 1982. Clause 70 sets out how orders and regulations are to be made. PART IV INCOME TAX, CORPORATION TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS TAX Income tax: charge rates and reliefs Clause 71 reimposes income tax for 1994-95 with the same rates as in 1993-94. The threshold for higher rate tax is unchanged, at Pounds 23,700 of taxable income (though the effective threshold for some taxpayers is affected by the change to the married couple's allowance and related allowances and reliefs in clause 73), and the lower rate band is increased by Pounds 500, to Pounds 3,000 of taxable income. Clause 72 sets the personal allowance for 1994-95, and the income limit above which the age-related amounts of the allowance are progressively withdrawn , at the same levels as for 1993-94. Clause 73 and Schedule 8 reduce the rate of relief for the married couple's allowance to 20 per cent for 1994-95 and to 15 per cent from 1995-96. The same change is made to the additional personal allowance (mainly for single parents') and the widow's bereavement allowance. The clause also sets the levels of the allowances for 1994-95 and 1995-96. The married couple's allowance for people aged under 65, and the allowances linked to it, are set at the same level as in 1993-94 in both years. The amounts of the married couple's allowances for couples with one or both partners aged 65 or over are increased by Pounds 200 in 1994-95, and by a further Pounds 330 in 1995-96. An assessment of the compliance costs affecting businesses can be obtained by writing to Danny Connor, Inland Revenue, Deregulation Unit, Rm F7, West Wing, Somerset House, London WC2R lLB. Clause 74 sets the income limit, above which the age-related amounts of married couple's allowance are progressively withdrawn, at the same level for 1994-95 as for 1993-94. Clause 75 restricts tax relief on the first Pounds 1,720 of maintenance payments to 20 per cent for 1994-95 and 15 per cent for 1995-96, in line with similar restrictions in the married couple's allowance. The clause also withdraws relief on payments made to or for children when they reach the age of 21 in the limited number of cases where relief would currently continue beyond that age. Clause 76 sets the limit on loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief for 1994-95 and 1995-96 at Pounds 30,000 (the same as for 1993- 94). The clause will have effect from 6 April 1994. Clause 77 and Schedule 9 reduce the amount of mortgage interest relief to 20 per cent for 1994-95, and to 15 per cent from 1995-96. They also change the way that relief is given where loans are not in the Miras (mortgage interest relief at source) scheme. For home-purchase loans, and for loans taken out by elderly people to buy life annuities, interest paid will no longer be a deduction from income. Instead, interest relief will be by means of an 'income tax reduction', whereby borrowers' income tax liability will be reduced by the 'applicable percentage' of the interest they pay. Where a loan is in the Miras scheme, the amount that borrowers may deduct from interest payments to their lenders will be similarly reduced. The applicable percentage for annuity-purchase loans will be the basic rate of tax. In relation to most interest payments the clause will have effect from April 6 1994. Clause 78 increases the blind person's allowance from Pounds 1,080 in 1993-94 to Pounds 1,200 in 1994-95 and subsequent years. Clause 79 and schedule 10 make a number of changes to the tax relief on private medical insurance for the over 60s. First, they limit relief on premiums to the basic rate of income tax and change the way of giving relief so that premiums do not reduce the payer's income for other tax purposes. Second, they allow a widow or widower aged under 60 to receive relief for the remainder of a contract following the death of an elder spouse. Third, they remove the requirement for the Inland Revenue to certify a contract before relief can be given. And fourth, they allow benefits costing up to Pounds 30 to be provided without disqualifying a contract from relief; and ensure that incentives costing more than Pounds 30 will disqualify it. The first and second changes will have effect from April 6 1994, and the third and fourth from July 1 1994. Clause 80 extends tax relief for vocational training to National Vocational Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications at level 5 from January 1 1994. It also excludes from tax relief from the same date children under 16, 16-to-18-year-olds in full-time education at a school, and training undertaken for recreational purposes or as a leisure activity. Corporation tax charge and rate Clause 81 sets the main rate of corporation tax for the financial 1994 at the unchanged rate of 33 per cent. Clause 82 sets the small companies' rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1994 at the unchanged rate of 25 per cent. It sets the fraction used in calculating the marginal rate (unchanged at 35 per cent) for companies with profits between the lower and upper profit limits at the unchanged level of one fiftieth. It increases the lower profits limit, below which tax is charged at the small companies' rate, from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000, and the upper profits limit, above which tax is charged at the main rate, from Pounds l25m to Pounds 1.5m. Benefits in kind Clause 83 sets for 1994-95 the scale charges for assessing the benefit of fuel provided by employers for private use of company cars. Clause 84 changes the tax treatment of cheap and interest-free loans provided by employers. Employees will be taxed as if they had been given the equivalent amount of cash instead of a cheap or interest-free loan and given tax relief as appropriate for the interest they would have paid. The exemption for small benefits from loans is replaced by a new exemption for loans totalling up to Pounds 5,000. Loans which employers provide to employees on the same terms as loans they make to the public will be exempt from tax as a benefit in kind. The Treasury will be able to set a lower 'official rate' of interest for loans in a foreign currency where interest rates are significantly lower than in the UK. Clause 85 makes technical amendments to the way vouchers and credit-tokens are taxed, to make sure they are valued for tax purposes according to the expense to the person or persons at whose cost they are provided. This is linked to the measures to counter avoidance of PAYE (clause 116-122 below). Chargeable gains Clause 86 freezes the annual amount of gains which can be made before capital gains tax becomes payable at Pounds 5,800 for 1994-95. Clause 87 and Schedule 11 extend the re-investment rollover relief on gains which are reinvested in shares in a qualifying unquoted trading company. Gains arising on all disposals made on or after November 30 1993 by individuals and by most trustees will be eligible for the relief and there will no longer be any requirement for the investor to take a minimum 5 per cent holding in the company. Clause 88 increases the amount of gains eligible for retirement relief when part or all of a business is disposed of. For disposals on or after November 30 1993 the first Pounds 250,000 of gain will be wholly exempt and half of any gain between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1m. Clause 89 restricts indexation allowance for losses made on the disposal of an asset. For disposals on or after November 30 1993 indexation will be able to reduce or extinguish a gain, but not to create or increase a loss. Clause 90 sets out specific capital gains tax rules for taxing and giving relief for payments under commodity and financial futures contracts which are settled in cash. It provides that relief for expenditure can be given in full and is not to be reduced under the wasting asset rules. It applies to contracts entered into on or after November 30 1993. Clause 91 amends the capital gain tax rules applying when an option is exercised and results in a cash payment. It specifically ensures that such a payment can be relieved as allowable expenditure for the payer as well as be treated as disposal proceeds for the recipient. It applies to options granted on or after November 30 1993. Clause 92 clarifies the circumstances in which information must be provided about certain transactions involving trusts with a foreign element. In outline, these transactions concern the setting up of a non-resident trust, the transfer of property (other than on arm's length terms) to a non-resident trust which was set up before March 19 1991, and a trust ceasing to be resident for tax purposes in the UK. The clause ensures that the obligation to provide this information applies in all cases - and is not restricted, as it is at present, to cases where the settlor, at some time in the year, has an interest in the trust. Profit-related pay Clause 93 changes the rules for calculating the upper limit on the profits which must be brought into the reckoning in calculating PRP for a particular profit period. First, it provides that if pay in the profit period is less than pay in the previous period or base year the minimum upper limit is to be 160 per cent of the earlier year's profits, plus an additional percentage found by expressing the pay reduction as a percentage of the earlier year's profit. Second, for the purposes of calculating the upper limit, PRP and NICs are to be treated on the same accountancy basis in both the current profit period and the previous period or base year. The clause applies to PRP schemes registered on or after December 1 1993. Clause 94 imposes a new condition which will have to be satisfied by a PRP 'special scheme'. The condition is the special scheme's fixed percentage (if it is a Method A scheme) or notional/distributable pool (if it is a Method B scheme) should not exceed a limit calculated by reference to the ratio of total pay to PRP in the other scheme (or schemes) registered for the business in question. This ratio will be calculated by reference to the figures for pay and PRP paid in respect of a specified earlier period. The clause applies to schemes registered on or after December 1 1993. Profit sharing schemes Clause 95 provides that a man who, after reaching retirement age, becomes chargeable to income tax in respect of shares allocated to him under a profit-sharing scheme approved before July 25 1991, will not be chargeable on a greater amount than a woman of the same age. The clause takes effect from November 30 1993. Clause 96 enables the trustees of an approved profit-sharing scheme to retain in the scheme trust qualifying corporate bonds which they receive when the company whose shares they hold is reconstructed or taken over; and to distribute the bonds in due course tax-free to scheme participants. Retirement benefits schemes Clauses 97 to 100 concern arrangements for monitoring the tax affairs of retirement benefits schemes to make sure that the conditions on which tax reliefs are given continue to be met. Clause 97 introduces new rules for identifying the administrator of a retirement benefits scheme. This is the person responsible for its tax affairs. In general, the trustees will be responsible (or the scheme sponsors, where the scheme is not set up under trust), but they may appoint some other person to act as administrator in their place. Clause 98 amends the present arrangements for dealing with situations where the duties of the administrator are not carried out. Under this clause responsibility for the tax affairs of a retirement benefits scheme passes from an appointed administrator to the scheme trustees (or sponsors) or, as the last resort, to the employer. Clause 99 provides for regulations to be made which specify what information must be produced about the tax affairs of a retirement benefits scheme, either automatically or on request, and for how long records should be kept. The clause also provides authority for those records to be inspected. Clause 100 introduces a penalty (of up to Pounds 3,000) covering the making of false statements in order to obtain tax approval of a retirement benefits scheme or of an alteration to such a scheme. The penalty will also apply where a false statement results in relief from, or repayment of, tax being obtained. Clause 101 amends one of the conditions for granting tax approval of retirement benefits schemes. It removes a requirement that certain annuity contracts taken out by schemes should be approved by the Inland Revenue. In place of that requirement the scheme managers will be expected to satisfy themselves that the benefits under the annuity contracts are of a type and amount that an approved scheme could pay. This change to the tax approval rules reflects the coming into force of the European Communities third life insurance directive from July 1 1994. Clause 102 changes the tax rules to ensure that tax is charged on a benefit received from a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (FURBS) which has not itself been taxed in the UK. The legislation also applies where FURBS are marketed by insurance companies. The clause will have effect for all benefits received under arrangements made or varied on or after December 1 1993. Annuities Clause 103 will, from April 6 1995, bring personal pension annuities within the PAYE system. This will put the tax treatment of personal pension annuities on the same footing as annuities paid under approved retirement benefits schemes with the correct amount of tax being deducted from each payment. Clause 104 confirms the existing practice that where members of approved retirement benefits schemes choose to have an annuity purchased from an insurance company, instead of receiving a pension from a scheme, the annuity remains taxable under the PAYE system. Authorised unit trusts Clause 105 changes the rate of corporation tax for authorised unit trusts to the same rate as the basic rate of income tax. Clause 106 and Schedule 12 set out new rules for the taxation of authorised unit trusts and of unit holders for distribution periods beginning on or after April 1 1994. These rules allow authorised unit trusts to pay a new kind of distribution which will be treated as interest for tax purposes. Non-resident investors will be able to register to receive these distributions without deduction of tax where they derive from eligible assets. Exchange gains and losses Clause 107 makes some amendments to the rules which determine when a company becomes or ceases to be entitled to an asset, or subject to a liability, for the purpose of applying the provisions on foreign exchange gains and losses in Chapter II of the Finance Act 1993. The amendments make it clear that exchange differences on a debt are to be computed from the date when the obligation to pay arises, rather than the later date when payment is due. In addition, where assets acquired or disposed of by transfer are accounted for under normal accountancy practice by reference to the date of delivery rather than the contract date, it is to be possible to follow this in computing exchange gains and losses. Clause 108 extends the scope of the rules for computing exchange gains and losses on currency contracts to cover contracts which provide for net payments rather than an actual exchange of amounts of principal. Clause 109 enables regulations to provide for non-monetary assets to be matched with currency contracts in determining when exchange differences on the contracts are to be taken into account for tax purposes. Capital allowances Clause 110 introduces new rules which provide that buildings and structures cannot qualify as plant for capital allowances purposes (though the broad aim is that expenditure on buildings and structures which already qualifies will continue to do so). The clause will have effect from November 30 1993. Clause 111 introduces new time limits for giving notification of qualifying expenditure on machinery and plant for which a capital allowances claim is to be made. For expenditure incurred on or after November 30 1993 the limit will be two years from the end of the chargeable period in which the expenditure was incurred. (A different time limit will apply for self-employed taxpayers dealt with under the new system of self-assessment.) For expenditure incurred before November 30 1993 the same two-year time limit will apply in all cases except where the expenditure was notified to the Inspector before November 30 1993. Clause 112 amends the capital allowance provisions for connected persons to include transfers of qualifying hotels and enterprise zone commercial buildings prior to March 16 1993. A measure in the March Budget made similar provisions for such transfers after that date. Securities Clause 113 provides for price adjustments made in lieu of 'manufactured payments' under agreements for the sale and repurchase of securities to be treated for tax purposes in the same way as actual manufactured payments. ('Manufactured payments' are payments which compensate the recipient for not receiving dividends or interest on securities). The clause will have effect from a day to be appointed in Treasury regulations. Clause 114 prevents charges arising under the Accrued Income Scheme legislation (sections 710 to 728 of the Taxes Act 1988) in certain circumstances where the tax rules on manufactured payments apply, and clarifies the tax rules for payments passing through the hands of intermediaries. The Clause will have effect from November 30 1993. Clause 115 enables regulations to be made to confirm that tax relief will not be available in respect of tax credits on overseas dividends received when the tax credits have been offset against tax due on manufactured overseas dividends paid, or when the overseas dividends have been effectively paid on to someone resident outside the United Kingdom. PAYE: extension of scope Clauses 116 to 122 extend the scope of PAD to prevent employers avoiding their PAYE obligations by paying their staff in assets (such as gold) or through third parties (such as offshore trusts). Clause 116 treats a payment of Schedule E income made by an intermediary of an employer as paid by the employer for the purposes of PAYE. An intermediary is defined as someone acting on behalf of the employer, or a trust. Clause 117 treats the provision of Schedule E income in the form of a tradeable asset as a payment by the employer for the purposes of PAYE. A tradeable asset is defined as one capable of being sold on certain markets, or in respect of which trading arrangements exist. Clause 118 treats the receipt by employees of non-cash vouchers which are either exchangeable for tradeable assets or are themselves tradeable assets as a payment by the employer for the purposes of PAYE. Clause 119 treats the use by an employee of a credit-token provided by reason of his employment to obtain money or tradeable assets as a payment by the employer for the purposes of PAYE. Clause 120 treats the receipt by employees of cash vouchers as a payment by the employer for the purposes of PAYE. Clause 121 includes supplementary provisions for payments treated as made under Clauses 116 to 120. These cover interpretation, including a definition of trading arrangements, and provide powers to make PAYE regulations governing how employers are to account for PAYE tax on certain notional payments. Clause 122 provides that where an employer is treated as having made a payment under clauses 116 to 120, and the employee receives that payment free of tax, then there shall be an additional Schedule E emolument equal to the amount of the tax concerned. Miscellaneous provisions about companies Clause 123 amends the provisions which impose additional tax on companies that control foreign companies (CFCs) in low-tax areas overseas. It revises the level of dividends which a non-trading CFC must pay to the UK residents to prevent the additional charge from arising to 90 per cent of its taxable profits less capital gains and tax suffered. The changes apply to accounting periods ending on or after November 30 1993. Clause 124 allows the Board of Inland Revenue to collect unpaid corporation tax from the previous owners of a company or from other companies previously under the same ownership, when the company is sold in circumstances intended to ensure that its corporation tax liabilities arising prior to the sale are unable to be collected. The clause applies in relation to contracts for sale entered into on or after November 30 1993. Clause 125 enables regulations to permit oil companies which account for their oil and gas extraction activities in different currencies to compute their taxable trading profits (before capital allowances) by reference to those currencies. Miscellaneous Clause 126 and Schedule 13 introduces the Enterprise Investment Scheme. This replaces the Business Expansion Scheme and provides a range of income tax and capital gains tax reliefs to encourage outside equity investment in unquoted trading companies. There are special new rules for 'business angels' who want to provide expertise as well as finance by becoming paid directors. Clause 127 and Schedule 14 introduce the Foreign Income Dividend scheme, including special rules for international headquarters companies. Under the scheme a company can opt from July 1 1994 to pay a foreign income dividend which will carry no tax credit, but which will allow the company to recover surplus advance corporation tax if the dividend can be switched with foreign income profits. Clause 128 brings into tax the new incapacity benefit which will replace invalidity benefit from April 1995. Only new recipients of the benefit paid after April 5 1995 will be subject to tax. Benefit paid in the first 28 weeks of any period of incapacity (when sickness benefit would be paid under the current rules) will not be taxable. Clause 129 provides that non-residents carrying on business in the UK will not be able to claim relief for losses incurred as a result of the exemption of royalty income under a double taxation convention. This restriction, with a similar restriction in existing legislation concerning losses incurred as a result of the exemption under a double taxation convention of dividends and interest received by non-residents carrying on certain types of business, is to apply irrespective of the nature of the business company's first accounting period to begin on or after a day to be appointed by order by the Treasury. Qualifying contracts Clause 136 defines a qualifying contract as an interest rate contract or option or currency contract or option entered into or acquired after that day, a currency contract or option held on that day and an interest rate contract or option held on commencement day if that day falls more than twelve months after the appointed day. Clause 137 provides for a qualifying company to elect for the new rules on the taxation of financial instruments to apply to all the interest rate contracts and options it holds on its commencement day where that day falls within 12 months of the appointed day. Interest rate and currency contracts and options Clause 138 defines an interest rate contract and an interest rate option. Clause 139 defines a currency contract and a currency option. Clause 140 identifies provisions which may be included in interest rate or currency contracts or options. Clause 141 ensures that provisions which are of minor significance in a contract or option do not prevent that contract or option falling within the new rules on the taxation of financial instruments. Other basic definitions Clause 142 defines qualifying payments. Clause 143 identifies the companies ('qualifying companies') to which the new rules on the taxation of financial instruments will apply. Accrual of profits and losses Clause 144 sets out how profits and losses are to be calculated on qualifying contracts. Clause 145 sets out the bases of accounting to be used in computing the profit or loss on a qualifying contract. Clause 146 sets out rules on the basis that has to be adopted for tax purposes in computing the profit or loss on market linked currency options. Clause 147 sets out rules adjusting the profit or loss on a qualifying contract when the basis of accounting changes. Treatment of profits and losses Clause 148 provides for profits and losses on qualifying contracts held for trading purposes to be taken into account as income and expenses of that trade. Clause 149 provides rules for dealing with non-trading profits and losses on qualifying contracts. Non-trading profits and losses are amalgamated with non-trading exchange gains and losses and the overall profit is taxed or the overall loss relieved. Special cases Clause 150 deals with the situation where a qualifying company terminates, disposes of or varies a qualifying contract. Clause 151 prevents double counting of profits or losses on currency contracts accounted for in a particular way whose values already reflect movements in exchange rates on the underlying currencies. Clause 152 allows companies to provide for bad or doubtful debts and provides rules to deal with recoveries of bad debts. Clause 153 brings to account debts which are released. Anti-avoidance and related provisions Clause 154 provides for an adjustment to the profit or loss on a qualifying contracts where there is a transfer of value under the contact from a qualifying company to an associated company or an associated third party. Clause 155 provides for a compensating adjustment to the profit or loss on a qualifying contract held by an associated company which is also a qualifying company and which receives a transfer of value under clause 154. Clause 156 provides for adjustments to the profit or loss on a qualifying contract which a qualifying company enters into on other than arm's length terms. Clause 157 treats qualifying contracts between qualifying companies and certain non-residents as contracts which would have not been entered into at all by parties dealing at arm's length, thus invoking the adjustments under clause 156. Miscellaneous Clause 158 and Schedule 16 deal with the application of the general rules for the taxation of financial instruments to insurance companies and mutual trading companies. Clause 159 ensures that the non-trading profits on interest rate contracts and options held by investment trusts are treated as income derived from shares or securities for the purposes of approval as investment trusts. Clause 160 applies the principle that charities are exempt from tax on income which is applied for charitable purposes to profits and losses from qualifying instruments. Clause 161 deals with application of general rules for partnerships including qualifying companies. Supplemental Clause 162 provides rules to ensure that these provisions override existing legislation and thus prevent double charging or double relief of profits or losses. Clause 163 provides that a qualifying company is not required to deduct income tax from qualifying payments or account for income tax on receipt of a qualifying payment. Clause 164 contains transitional rules for currency contracts held before a qualifying company's commencement day. Clause 165 makes minor amendments to the Taxes Acts to accommodate the effects of the new provisions on the taxation of financial instruments. Clause 166 contains various interpretation provisions for the purposes of Chapter II and enables the Treasury to make regulations amending clauses 138 to 142 with any corresponding amendments to the provisions in Finance Act 1993 dealing with exchange gains and losses. MANAGEMENT: SELF ASSESSMENT ETC. Clauses 167 to 188 and Schedule 17 provide the rules for the introduction of a system of self-assessment of income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax. Unless otherwise stated, the rules will come into effect for income tax and capital gains tax for the tax year 1996/97 and subsequent years, and for corporation tax for accounting periods ending after an appointed date, which will be not earlier than March 31 1996. Income tax and capital gains tax Clause 167 amends the time limits for returns of income and gains from individuals and trustees to January 31 following the tax year of the return, or, if later, three months after the issue of the return. It also provides for the share of any partnership income, loss or charge to be included in the return. Clause 168 provides that a taxpayer's return should include a self-assessment and provides for the possibility of the Revenue calculating the tax due and correcting obvious errors or mistakes, and the circumstances in which the taxpayer can amend the self-assessment. Clause 169 introduces powers for the Inland Revenue to make inquiries into tax returns of individuals and trustees, requires formal notice of the inquiries to be given to the taxpayer and sets the time limits within which such inquiries can be commenced. Corporation tax Clause 170 requires a company that carries on a trade or business in partnership to make a return on its total income from the partnership in accordance with partnership statements made under clause 174. Clause 171 provides that a company's return should include a self-assessment and provides for the possibility of the Inland Revenue correcting obvious errors or mistakes and the circumstances in which the company can amend the self-assessment. Clause 172 introduces powers for the Inland Revenue to make inquiries into company's returns of profits, requires formal notice of the inquiries to be given to the company and sets the time limits within which such inquiries can be commenced. Partnerships Clause 173 introduces rules for returns of the profits of partnerships and the allocation between partners of those profits. It identifies the partner to whom the return should be issued, the information that may be required with the return and the time limit for delivering the return to the Revenue, the later of January 31 after the year of assessment or three months from the issue of the return. Clause 174 specifies that a partnership return should include a partnership statement. It provides for the amendment of the statement by the Revenue and the partnership. Clause 175 introduces powers for the Inland Revenue to inquire into partnership returns. It requires formal notice of the inquiries to be given and sets the time limits within which such inquiries can be commenced. Inquiries: procedure Clause 176 introduces specific powers for the Inland Revenue to call for documents for the purposes of certain inquiries into returns. It specifies the circumstances in which an officer of the Board may require information, the types of information, the form in which it is to be provided and the formal procedure for enforcing production of the information including the right to appeal against a notice. Clause 177 enables amendments to be made to a person's self-assessment once the Inland Revenue has commenced its inquiries into the return on which it is based and sets out the procedure for bringing those inquiries to a conclusion. Clause 178 enables amendments to be made to a partnership statement once the Inland Revenue has commenced inquiries into the return on which it is based and sets out the procedure for bringing those inquiries to a conclusion. Determinations and assessments to protect revenue Clause 179 introduces a power for the Inland Revenue to make a determination of tax due where no return has been delivered by the taxpayer. The determination may be superseded by a self-assessment. Clause 180 amends the rules for the Inland Revenue raising assessments under Section 29 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 which will in future deal only with assessments made where a loss of tax or grant of excessive relief has been discovered. Payment of tax Clause 181 introduces rules for payments on account of income tax normally on January 31 during and July 31 after the end of the year of assessment. Clause 182 introduces rules for the final balancing payment of income tax and capital gains tax liability for each year of assessment, normally due by January 31 following the year of assessment. Clause 183 provides rules for surcharges on unpaid income tax and capital gains tax, the dates and amounts on which it is due and rights of appeal against the imposition of the surcharge. Clause 184 moves the rules for the payment of corporation tax from the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to the Taxes Management Act 1970. Miscellaneous and supplemental Clause 185 and Schedule 17 provide amendments to the Taxes Management Act 1970 in connection with the introduction of self-assessment; in particular to amend the rules for notification of liability to income tax and capital gains tax; to apply the new rules for partnerships to European Economic Interest Groupings; to introduce a provision requiring taxpayers to keep records for the purposes of making a tax return; to amend the rules for recovering overpayments of tax and for assessments to tax; for amendment of the partnership statement where a loss of tax is discovered; to amend rights of appeal, and the provisions for correcting errors or mistakes in returns and partnership statements; to amend time limits for assessments; to amend the provisions for making claims; to amend arrangements for postponing payment of tax and for collection and recovery of tax; to amend the provisions for interest on overdue tax; to amend the penalties for failure to make a return for income tax and capital gains tax and a partnership return and penalties for making an incorrect partnership return; new penalties for failure to produce documents under Clause 176; and powers to inquire into claims and amendments to claims. Clause 186 gives the rules for constructing certain references in the legislation. Clause 187 provides rules for calculation of the amount of tax payable on the relevant due dates with regards to 1996-97. Clause 188 gives the general starting date for the changes under Clauses 168-185 inclusive, for income tax and capital gains tax as respects the year 1996/97 and later years and for corporation tax for accounting periods ending not earlier than 1 April 1996. CHANGES FOR FACILITATING SELF-ASSESSMENT Note Clauses 189 to 207 and Schedule 18 provide the rules for computation of income assessable under Schedule D on a current-year basis, and for the transition from the existing preceding-year basis to the new rules. Unless otherwise stated, the new rules in practice apply to the tax year 1997/98, and 1996/97 is the transitional year. Where a new source of income or a business commences after April 5 1994 the new rules apply immediately to those sources. Assessment under Cases I and II of Schedule D Clause 189 introduces a new current-year basis of assessment for Schedule D Cases I and II. Income tax will be charged on the profits made in the tax year itself. The profit shown by accounts drawn up each year to a date other than April 5 as adjusted for tax purposes will be taken as those of the year to April 5. Clause 190 amends the basis of assessment for Schedule D Cases I and II for the first year and in some circumstances the second year of assessment of new businesses. The assessable profits for the year of assessment in which a businesses commences are those which arise in the fiscal year. The second year profits are normally determined by the rule introduced by Clause 189 but in certain circumstances it is the profits of the 12 months from the date of commencement of the business. Clause 191 provides rules for the basis of assessment under Schedule D Cases I and II where a business changes its accounting date. Except for changes which take place in the early years of the business certain qualifying conditions (set out in clause 192) have to be met if the basis periods are to change. Clause 192 introduces the conditions which must be met if a change of accounting date is to result in a change in the basis period under clause 191 other than where the change takes place in the early years of the business. The change must not be achieved by means of an account which exceeds 18 months; the taxpayer must give notice that he wishes his basis period to change; and either there must have been no other change of accounting date for that business in the previous five years or the change must have been made for bona fide commercial reasons. Clause 193 introduces a new basis of-assessment under Schedule D Cases I and II for the tax year in which the business ceases or is treated for tax purposes as ceasing. The basis period for the year of cessation is the period of trading in that year plus the part of the preceding year (if any) which did not fall in the basis period for that year. Clause 194 introduces a new provision to ensure that over the lifetime of a business no more than the actual profits made are taxed. Where the basis of assessment under Clauses 189-191 causes the same profits to be taxed in two successive years ('overlap profits') the new provision deducts the amount of the overlap profits in assessments for later years either where more than 12 months' profits are taxed in one year or on cessation. Assessment under Cases III to VI of Schedule 9 Clause 195 introduces a new current-year basis of assessment for Schedule D Case III. Income tax will be charged by reference to income arising in the current year of assessment. Clause 196 introduces a new current-year basis of assessment for Schedule D Cases IV and income tax will be charged by reference to income arising in the current year of assessment. Clause 197 provides for the basis of assessment for income under Schedule D Case VI to be only on a current-year basis. Loss relief Clause 198 makes several changes to the loss-relief provisions in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It provides for sideways loss relief under Section 380 to be given against the income of either the year of loss or the preceding year. It ensures that loss reliefs are computed by reference to the same periods of account as income from the same source would be. It simplifies the procedure for making claims under Section 385 for relief for losses by carry-forward against future income from the same source. It removes an anomaly whereby relief for terminal losses could not be given against any profits which arose in the year of assessment in which the source ceased. Clause 199 provides that relief under Section 574 ICTA 1988 for losses on unquoted shares will be available for set-off against income of the current or preceding years. Capital allowances Clause 200 determines the manner of making capital allowances and balancing charges which fall to be made in taxing a trade, profession or vocation. Capital allowances will be treated as trading expenses and balancing charges as trading receipts. Clause 201 provides a new definition of the expression 'chargeable period' in the Capital Allowances Act 1990. The chargeable period is to be a period of account instead of a year of assessment as currently. Clause 202 makes a number of amendments to the Capital Allowances Act 1990 which are consequential upon the changes introduced by clauses 200 and 201. Clause 203 makes a number of amendments to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 which are consequential upon the changes introduced by clauses 200 and 201. Miscellaneous and supplemental Clause 204 provides that where a trade or profession is carried on by two or more persons in partnership each partner is assessed on their share of the income from the partnership. Clause 205 provides that where there is a change in the ownership of the trade, profession or vocation and one person is engaged in that activity both before and after the change, the activity shall not be regarded as discontinued for the purposes of basis periods for Cases I and II of Schedule D unless there is an actual cessation of the activity. Clause 206 provides rules for allocating double taxation relief in respect of overlap profits under Section 804 ICTA 1988. Clause 207 provides the rules for the new provisions coming into effect. It also gives effect to Schedule 18 providing for transitional provisions for businesses and other sources of income arising before April 6 1994 in respect of calculation of profits for the year 1996/97 and other relevant years, transitional provisions for capital allowances and double taxation relief. LLOYD'S UNDERWRITERS; CORPORATIONS ETC. Clauses 208 to 219 provisions to charge to corporation tax the profits arising from corporate membership of Lloyd's. The provisions operate for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1 1994. (Inland Revenue Press Release October 14 1993 and January 11 1994) Main provisions Clause 208 provides that the profits of a corporate member's underwriting business at Lloyd's are to be computed as trading income, except for non-syndicate related profits that are otherwise chargeable to tax. Clause 209 sets out the general rules to decide for which accounting period the profits and losses arising from the corporate member's syndicates and from funds in which its premiums received are invested (premiums trust funds) are to be treated as arising. Clause 210 provides for the assessing and collecting of tax on the profits and losses arising from a corporate member's syndicates and from premium trust funds by importing and suitably modifying the provisions in Finance Act 1993 for assessing and collecting that apply to individual members. Trust funds Clause 211 ensures that the corporate member and not the trustees is treated as owner of the assets in its premiums trust fund for corporation tax purposes and treats the assets in premiums trust funds as acquired and disposed of each year. Clause 212 ensures that the corporate member and not the trustees is treated as owner of the assets in ancillary trust funds at Lloyd's - that is funds other than premiums trust funds - for corporation tax purposes. Other special cases Clause 213 provides that relief for payments (reinsurance to close premiums) which the members of one syndicate make to the members of the successor syndicate to take over their outstanding liabilities is available to corporate members of syndicates in the same way as it is available to individual members (that is to the extent that the payments are fair and reasonable with respect of the liabilities transferred). Clause 214 provides rules giving relief for payments and charging receipts in respect of stop loss insurance taken out by corporate members. It also provides relief for payments made to transfer to someone else a corporate member's rights and liabilities in respect of business it has underwritten. Miscellaneous Clause 215 disapplies provisions relating to the currency to be used in computing a corporate member's profits from its underwriting business. It also excludes assets and liabilities in certain trust funds of corporate members from the application of provisions dealing with exchange gains and losses, interest rate and currency contracts and options. Clause 216 provides that the final underwriting year for a corporate member is generally that in which its deposit at Lloyd's is repaid, subject to other rules that the Board of Inland Revenue may make by regulations. Clause 217 and Schedule 19 introduce changes to the scheme set out in Finance Act 1993 for the taxation of individual members of Lloyd's (as announced in an Inland Revenue Press Release 14 October 1993) generally effective from 1994/95 but subject to different start dates in some instances. The clause also removes two provisions (which are no longer necessary) for members of Lloyd's to make modified elections relating to retirement annuity relief and personal pension contributions, effect for 1997/98 onwards. The schedule makes changes consequent on the move to a distribution year basis for individual member's acceptance of corporate members at Lloyd's and clarifies some aspects of the Finance Act 1993 scheme for the taxation of individual members of Lloyd's. These provisions are effective from different dates. Supplemental Clause 218 enables the Board of Inland Revenue to make regulations on specified matters concerning the taxation of corporate members. Clause 219 defines various terms used in the legislation. PART V OIL TAXATION Clause 220 provides for the proceeds chargeable to petroleum revenue tax (PRT) from the arm's length sale of landed North Sea crude oil for a price which includes subsequent delivery costs to be reduced by those additional costs. The clause also reduces by 24 hours the time available to North Sea producers to nominate sales of oil for the purpose of establishing the tax value of own crude production. The clause will have effect from January 1 1994. Clause 221 and Schedule 20 amend the PRT rules for determining the market value of gas not sold on the open market. The new rules will enable market value to be determined on an arm's length basis taking account of all the circumstances relevant to the particular disposal. The clause will have effect from January 1 1994. Clause 222 clarifies the conditions for relief of abortive exploration expenditure incurred before March 16 1983, following the changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax enacted in the 1993 Finance Act. Clause 223 imposes a disposal receipts charge to Petroleum Revenue Tax on the market value of assets transferred between affiliates where those assets are used to earn tariffs. Previously the receipts charged would have been limited to an amount equal to the vendor's acquisition costs. PART VI STAMP DUTY Clause 224 makes it clear that for stamp duty purposes deeds will not generally be regarded as executed until they have been delivered as well as signed. The stamp duty charge on a document is generally fixed by reference to its date of execution. The clause removes doubts about the meaning of execution for stamp duty in Scotland. It is not regarded as changing the law in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The clause has effect for instruments executed on or after December 8 1993. Clause 225 relaxes the stamp duty penalty provisions on agreements for lease. This will enable an agreement for a lease to be submitted for stamping at the same time as the lease itself without incurring undue penalty. Clause 226 provides that all exchanges of one interest in land for another will be treated as sales for stamp duty. Currently many property exchanges attract only a fixed 50 pence charge. The clause also provides that on a sale or lease of land the nature of the property received in payment does not matter for stamp duty purposes. The clause applies to instruments executed on or after December 8 1993, unless the instrument was executed in pursuance of a contract made before November 30 1993. Clause 227 provides that if the price payable for an interest in land cannot be ascertained at the time the transfer document is executed (and could not be ascertained by reference to a possible future event specified in the document) stamp duty will be payable on the open market value of the property (or on the market premium and/or the market recent in the case of a new lease). Currently the stamp duty payable in such cases is a fixed charge of either 50 pence or Pounds 2. The clause applies to instruments executed on or after 8 December 1993. Clause 228 provides that where a lease is surrendered otherwise than by deed, stamp duty will be chargeable on the price paid in return for any agreement for the surrender. The clause applies to agreements made on or after December 8 1993. Clause 229 provides that purchasers or lessees of land and buildings in Northern Ireland are required to produce to the Inland Revenue with the convincing document a form (the so-called Particulars Delivered form) summarising such details of the transaction as shall be prescribed by regulations. This will bring Northern Ireland into line with England, Scotland and Wales in this respect. Currently purchasers in Northern Ireland can leave it to the Stamp Office to complete the Particulars Delivered form. These forms provide essential information to the Valuation Office and are used for statistical purposes. The clause takes effect from a day to be appointed by Treasury Order. Clause 230 provides powers to make regulations exempting certain classes of instrument from the requirements of clause 229. The intention is to make regulations enabling documents recording transactions below the stamp duty threshold to by-pass the Stamp Office and to go direct to the appropriate Northern Ireland Registrar. Parallel arrangements are already in place in England, Scotland and Wales. This clause will also be brought into effect by Treasury Order. PART VII INHERITANCE TAX Clause 231 sets the inheritance tax threshold for 1994/95 at Pounds 150,000. Clause 232 extends from 12 months to three years (or such extended period as the Board of Inland Revenue may allow) the period for a donee, who receives and then sells property eligible for business or agricultural property relief, to acquire a qualifying replacement property and retain relief on the gift. The clause will apply to deaths and other chargeable events on or after November 30 1993. Clause 233 ensures that assets forming part of a corporate member's premiums trust fund or ancillary trust funds are excluded from the definition of relevant property for the purposes of inheritance tax settlement provisions (see clauses 208 to 219 above). PART VIII MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL Companies treated as non-resident Clause 234 amends the rules on company residence for certain dual-resident companies, that is companies which are regarded as resident for tax purposes by both the UK and another country. It provides that where a dual-resident company is regarded as not resident in the UK for the purposes of the double taxation agreement between the two countries, it shall be treated as not resident in the UK for all tax purposes. The change applies for periods beginning on or after November 30 1993. Clause 235 relaxes certain provisions which would otherwise apply where a dual resident company ceased to be resident on November 30 1993 as a result of the new rule in clause 234 coming into force. The company will not be required to notify the Inland Revenue of its change of residence status and its resulting liability to tax on certain capital gains will be removed or deferred. Clause 236 repeals a number of anti-avoidance provisions which are no longer needed as a result of the new rule in clause 234 coming into force. Privatisations Clause 237 and Schedule 21 make provisions for the reorganisation and privatisation of the railways. In common with many earlier privatisations, a package of tax measures will ensure that the statutory reorganisation of BR's business will take place on a broadly tax-neutral basis for BR, its successor companies and employees. In order to achieve that result, the provisions will apply with effect from November 51993 (when the Railways Act received Royal Assent) or January 11 1994. Clause 238 and Schedule 22 deal with the tax treatment of the pre-privatisation reorganisation of Northern Ireland Airports Ltd (NIAL) under the provisions of the Airports (Northern Ireland) Order 1994 (the order). Their main effects are to prevent capital gains or losses arising on the reorganisation and to enable a successor company to inherit NIAL's tax position in relation to the activities transferred. The provisions apply to transfers under the order which are due to take place on April 1 1994. Management Clause 239 extends the powers given to the Lord Chancellor to make procedural rules for the General and Special Commissioners to allow the Commissioners to obtain relevant information from any party to an appeal, and not just from the taxpayer as at present. Clause 240 amends Section 20 of the Taxes Management Act, the Inland Revenue's general power to obtain information from taxpayers and third parties, to provide new safeguards for taxpayers who are subject to information notices. Clause 241 allows the Inland Revenue to obtain the papers of an accountant where are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she has assisted the making of a tax offence, subject to the consent of a Special Commissioner.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Walesa may veto deal on coalition PRESIDENT Lech Walesa yesterday indicated that he would not accept a cabinet agreed at the weekend by eight parliamentary political parties - in a move likely to prolong the government's five-week-long crisis. Buoyed by praise from President George Bush, who visited Warsaw for five hours on Sunday, Mr Walesa was yesterday preparing to by-pass the coalition agreement. The parties had decided to propose Ms Hanna Suchocka, a 46-year-old lawyer from the liberal, pro-market Democratic Union as the candidate for prime minister. They also agreed most of the names for the various government posts. Ms Suchocka's candidacy marks agreement between nationalist right-wing parties, the Christian Democrat centre, and free-market liberals who have Solidarity roots and who, until recently, have all been in conflict with each other. Despite the fact that Ms Suchocka would be able to secure a parliamentary majority, unlike her predecessor Mr Waldemar Pawlak - who offered to resign as prime minister last week because he was unable to seek a working majority  -Mr Walesa yesterstart appointing 'interim' ministers. Mr Pawlak, the 32-year-old leader of the PSL, or farmers' party, has been in power for less than five weeks. Mr Walesa's moves suggest that the president fears that any stable, strong parliament could erode his powers. Indeed, attempts by this broad coalition of eight parliamentary parties to elect Ms Suchocka would have meant that a government could have been formed without presidential approval. However, any prime minister has to be formally nominated by the president. A government based on this coalition, and with a majority in parliament, would have made it more independent of Mr Walesa. Until now, Mr Walesa has exploited feuds among the Solidarity-based parties to maintain the political initiative and work to dominate the executive arm of government, leaving parliament a secondary role. Consumer prices in Poland rose by 1.3 per cent last month compared with May. Prices are set to stabilise this month as inflation stays within the predicted 40 per cent growth figure for this year - half of last year's cost of living increase.</p>

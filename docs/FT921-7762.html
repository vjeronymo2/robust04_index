			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Greenspan sees early US recovery: Federal Reserve chairman forecasts a return to lowest inflation level for a generation MR Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday gave his most upbeat congressional testimony since the summer, predicting an early economic recovery and a fall in inflation to the lowest level for a generation. He said spending seemed to be rising in some sectors, and the decline in industrial production in January did not appear to have carried over into this month. He acknowledged that the outlook was 'particularly uncertain' and warned that recovery could 'peter out' as happened last year. However, he based his prediction of a revival in business activity on structural changes under way for the past two years. Households and companies had made progress in repairing strained balance sheets, he said. Banks and other lenders had begun to rebuild depleted capital positions. Money supply was growing faster after a long period of stagnation. Mr Greenspan said the core rate of inflation was also falling rapidly, forecasting that 'within the foreseeable future we will have attained the lowest rates of inflation in a generation'. Economic data released yesterday broadly supported his optimism. The annual rate of consumer price inflation fell to 2.6 per cent in January. The monthly increase in prices was only 0.1 per cent - less than financial markets expected. A separate report showed a 5.5 per cent jump in housing starts last month, bigger than expected. The gain, however, was concentrated in only one region  -the Midwest - and in the volatile apartment buildings sector. Mr Greenspan was delivering testimony in support of the Fed's semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins monetary report to Congress. The report contains unchanged target ranges for monetary growth. The target for M2, the main measure of broad money, is 2.5 to 6.5 per cent. In recent years M2 growth has fallen well below the mid-range of the Fed's targets, partly because of the restructuring of banks and other financial institutions. The report also predicts economic growth of 1 3/4 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent during this year, roughly in line with the Bush administration's forecast of 2.2 per cent. It predicts inflation of 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1992, with further progress in future years. Mr Greenspan provided no clear signal on interest rates. However, his bullish remarks about the economy may be interpreted as further evidence that the Fed is not contemplating a further easing of monetary policy in the near future. He confirmed that the reduction in reserve requirements for commercial banks announced on Tuesday was intended to boost bank profitability and ease the credit crunch rather than as an easing of monetary policy.

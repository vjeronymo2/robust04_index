			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhichao (3769 3112 6389), Investigation </F> Statistics Department, Chinese People's Bank Head Office:  "Analysis of the 1993 International Balance of Payments  Situation, and Forecast for 1994"]    [Text] The national economy saw sustained growth during  1993 as a follow-on to 1992. Vigorous domestic demand produced a  situation in which the domestic economy was able to absorb more  than it could supply. This produced a rise in prices that became  the main reason for limiting exports and the encouraging  imports. A substantial adverse balance between imports and  exports occurred during 1993. China's international balance of  payments took a pounding, but high speed economic growth  produced an in-flow of foreign capital that made up the deficit  in current accounts. Foreign exchange reserves increased  slightly, the central bank's foreign exchange holdings remaining  basically stable.  <H5>  1. Changes in the International Balance of Payments </H5>   Customs statistics show maintenance of a fairly rapid growth  momentum in China's foreign trade between January and November  1993, imports and exports totaling $164.2 billion, up 16.5  percent from the same period in 1992. Export growth slowed to  $78.25 billion while imports increased greatly to $85.95 billion  in a respective 6.2 and 27.8 percent increase over the same  period in 1993. The growth rate difference between the two was  21.6 percentage points, and the adverse balance of trade was  $7.7 billion. However, in 1992 China had a favorable balance of  trade. This and other favorable balance of payments made up for  the 1993 adverse balance. By October 1993 the national foreign  exchange balance was $260 million more than at the end of 1992.    Inasmuch as total trade receipts account for more than 70  percent of China's international balance of payments in today's  outwardly oriented economy, an analysis of changes in trade  receipts will substantially reflect changes in the country's  international balance of payments today. An analysis of 1993  shows the following several characteristics:    1. Change from a favorable to an unfavorable balance between  imports and exports beginning at the end of 1992, the  unfavorable balance running to $2.021 billion. Except at the  beginning of the year, 1993 showed an unfavorable balance, the  unfavorable balance for the first three quarters of the year  amounting to $1.173, $2.321, and $3.007 billion respectively.  October and November showed an adverse balance of $586 million  and $613 million respectively.    2. The adverse balance of trade resulted from lackluster  exports and a dramatic increase in imports. Since August 1991,  imports have increased faster than exports. In 1991, exports  increased by 15.81 percent and imports increased by 19.57  percent, exports being 3.76 percentage points less than imports.  In 1992, exports increased 18.2 percent and imports increased  26.35 percent, exports being 8.15 percentage points less than  imports. During the first three quarters of 1993, exports were a  respective 17.94, 19.9, and 28.9 percentage points less than  imports, and during October and November, the difference was a  respective 16.63 and 21.7 percentage points.    3. During 1993, imports and exports were characterized as  follows: 1) Generally slow growth of trade; however,  compensation trade, trade from the processing of imported raw  materials, and foreign trader investment in enterprises, which  required investment in imported equipment and goods, and a  supply of imported materials and parts for processing into  products for sale within China, increased more rapidly. 2)  Imports and exports of primary products declined over the same  period in 1992, but imports and exports of industrial  manufactures increased. However imports were far greater than  exports. 3) In terms of different kinds of enterprises, a sharp  increase occurred in the imports and exports of the three kinds  of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, while the  exports of state-owned enterprises, which are China's main  exporters, showed negative increase. 4) Changes in the regional  make-up of foreign trade included a fairly rapid increase in  China's exports to neighboring countries and territories  stemming from the strong growth of the southeast Asian economy,  and a rapid increase in imports from developed countries.    4. Since July, China has inaugurated a series of  macroeconomic structural readjustments. The state intervened in  foreign exchange swap markets, the swap market price gradually  stabilizing at $1 to 8.80 yuan renminbi. This price was  extremely beneficial both in promoting the export trade and in  ensuring foreign exchange availability for key projects. This  eliminated the effect of the dual pressures that the foreign  trade sector faced from rising prices paid to goods suppliers  and foreign traders demanding a lower price on goods they  purchased, a situation that stemmed from large rises and falls  in swap market foreign exchange prices during the first half of  the year. Structural readjustments also lowered the temperature  of the hot real estate and development zone markets. Thus, the  amount of foreign exchange needed for construction materials  imports declined, and inventories of raw and processed materials  such as processed steel products rose. The increase in urban  resident and social group consumption also abated. Because of  the shortage of capital and structural readjustments, fixed  assets investment growth momentum gradually declined thereafter,  and all macroeconomic indicators gradually improved, creating a  relaxed environment for imports and exports. With improvement of  the macroeconomic situation, imports and exports will enter a  fairly stable growth stage after the beginning of the fourth  quarter; however, a basic reversal in the adverse balance  between imports and exports for the whole year will be very  difficult. For the year as a whole, a certain adverse balance  between imports and exports will remain, and a demand for  foreign exchange that is greater than the amount of foreign  exchange that exports generate will continue into 1994. However,  because of the acceleration of capital inflow in the short run,  plus the country's current foreign exchange holdings and the  Bank of China's foreign exchange supply, continuation of the  present adverse balance between imports and exports poses no  risks.  <H5>  2. Analysis of the Reasons for Changes in Current Accounts </H5>   The year 1993 was one of high speed growth for the national  economy. Thanks to the inertia provided by a 12.8 percent growth  in GDP during 1992, GDP for the first three quarters of 1993  increased 13.3 percent over the same period in the previous  year. Forecasts call for approximately 13 percent growth for the  year as a whole. Without doubt, the current adverse balance  between imports and exports is attributable to changes in the  operation of the economy in 1993. This is another way of saying  that strong domestic investment demand and consumption demand  pulled a rise in prices, which delivered an enormous pounding to  the balance of foreign trade, holding down exports and  increasing imports. Specifically, the following reasons apply:    1. A Cumulative and Easy Money Policy, and Too Large a  Supply  of Currency    The adverse effect of money on an economy is caused by too  great an amount of money becoming available within a short  period. Following the retrenchment between October 1988 and  October 1989, China pursued an easy money policy beginning in  1990. Between 1990 and 1992, the central bank increased the  basic money supply by 26.9, 29.1, and 17.4 percent each year.  This showed that total money supply in the broad sense,  M[.sub]2[/], also reached 27.9, 26.8, and 31.3 percent,  thereby basically exceeding the sum of both economic growth and  the rise in prices for the same year. One might assume that the  pessimistic forecasts of principal economic entities regarding  the overall operating environment caused a blockage of channels  for the transfer of currency to the economy. The currency supply  became a cumulative force waiting to be released.    In 1992, the economy began to liven up. It became quite  apparent at this time that the money supply was beginning to  move in the direction of highly fluid currency levels such as  M[.sub]0[/], and M[.sub]1[/]. This meant that during 1993,  M[.sub]2[/] fell from 31.3 percent at the end of the year to  30.3 percent at the end of March, 26.5 percent at the end of  June, 22.2 percent at the end of September, and 24.2 percent at  the end of November. Despite the month-by-month slide, it  remained high over the long run. Meanwhile, growth of money in  the narrow sense was fast at 19.2 percent in 1990, 24.2 percent  in 1991, and 35.8 percent in 1992. During 1993, it remained  substantially stable at a 35 percent increase for the first half  of the year, beginning to slow only during the last half of the  year. Beginning from 34.2 percent in June, it declined to 20.5  percent in September, and 20.9 percent in November. During the  same period, M[.sub]0[/] -- the amount of money in  circulation -- exceeded 40 percent for 8 months, going from 31.3  percent early in the year to 54.1 percent at its height in June  and returning to 38.2 and 35.3 percent respectively in October  and November.    As the government gradually relaxed trade restrictions and  China's economy became linked more and more to the world  economy, monetary policy played an increasingly stronger role on  the international balance of payments. This has been attested to  by the central bank's balance sheet in recent years. We know  that the basic money supply equals net assets abroad and  domestic credit. This is a simple identical equation used in  accounting. When the money demand constant remains stable,  meaning that the basic money supply remains stable, changes in  domestic credit will be made up by net assets abroad. The  cushioning effect of net assets abroad partially vitiates the  effect of central bank monetary policy, limiting the extent of  its effectiveness. Of course, in addition to considering the  amount of assets available at this time, one must also take into  account the following: the economic entities holding the assets,  ability to draw on them quickly, and the psychological effect of  the state's drawing on foreign exchange assets. Since 1992, the  basic amount of currency put into circulation has varied, e.g.,  it declined from 26.5 percent at the beginning of 1992 to 17.4  percent at the end of the year, and to 6.5 percent at the  beginning of 1993 after which it began to climb again. It went  from 19.8 percent in February to 20.8 percent in June, 23.2  percent in August, and 34.8 percent in October. This  corresponded to the amount of domestic credit for the most part,  which went from 18.3 percent at the end of 1992 to 33.9 percent  in October 1993. Since 1993, foreign exchange holdings have  remained basically unchanged. Foreign exchange savings increased  hardly at all between November and the beginning of 1993. One  can conclude that the effect of currency on the economy,  particularly in the foreign trade sector where transfers require  a certain amount of time, is gradually producing an effect on  the international balance of payments.    2. Speed of Investment in Fixed Assets Fairly High    This is one of the main features of the current economic  cycle. The pull of investment became the main force spurring  high speed operation of the entire economy. In 1992, investment  in fixed assets owned by the whole people reached 40.7 percent.  Since 1993, there has been no abatement in enthusiasm for  starting projects by all jurisdictions and all sectors because  of the returns that can be made, nor hast there been any marked  improvement in the kinds of projects in which investments are  being made. During the first half of the year, state-owned units  investment in fixed assets increased by more than 70 percent.  Despite a downturn following readjustment and control, the  cumulative 10 month increase was still 65.2 percent. The  domestic economy cannot stand an increase of investment in fixed  assets on such a scale; thus, expansion of imports was needed to  satisfy domestic demand.    3. Sustained Rise in Domestic Prices, Particularly in Large-  and Medium-Sized Cities    Pulled by overly high fixed assets investment demand and  stable yet rising consumption demand, nominal variates changed  in the face of shortages, the price level rising to check the  gap between supply and demand. Moreover, change in the price  level pulled imports and exports in turn, bringing about  changes. On the one hand, the rise in prices brought the  prospect of profits, which stimulated hot selling goods such as  building materials and electrical appliances. On the other hand,  the rise in prices caused a rise in the foreign exchange cost of  exports. A shortage of major export commodities occurred,  foreign trade corporations finding it more difficult to assemble  exports. In March 1993, retail prices of social commodities  broke the double digit mark to reach 10.2 percent after  increasing 5.4 percent in the previous year. By September,  prices rose a cumulative 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent for the  month. Meanwhile, the staff member and employee 14.8 percent  cost of living index reached 16.9 percent in September. As the  economy heated up, once again it became more profitable to see  commodities in the domestic market rather than export them.    4. Decline in Export Foreign Exchange Conversion Rate; Large  Outflow of State-owned Assets    Foreign exchange receivable from exports for the period  January through July 1993 totaled $36.798 billion, but only  $20.306 billion, or 55.18 percent, of foreign exchange was  converted. In addition to an increase in exports by three kinds  of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and an  increase in the percentage of exchange settlements not handled,  the main reason for the decline in the rate of foreign exchange  conversions was an increase in foreign accounts receivable,  which were retained abroad for investment. Furthermore,  insufficient attention was paid to follow-up work in verifying  and writing off exports after the fact, so where large amounts  of foreign exchange went was a mystery.    5. External Economy Unsatisfactory    Foreign trade corporations export difficulties increased as  a  result of the general economic slump and recession in Western  industrial countries, a rise in trade protectionism, current  trade frictions between China and the United States, and trouble  from constant anti-dumping investigations in the E.C.    The world economic situation has declined continuously since  the beginning of the 1990s. In 1992, world GNP increased only  0.7 percent, and the 1993 increase is forecast at 0.9 percent.  In 1994, the world economy may begin to revive. Forecasts call  for a 2.6 increase in world GNP then. In recent years,  international trade has been in a similar slump. Forecasts call  for a respective 4.3 and 6.2 percent increase in world trade  volume in 1993 and 1994.    Forecasts call for a 1 percent increase in the GNP of  developed market economy countries. This includes a 2.7 percent  increase in North America, and a 0.4 percent decline in the EC.  The main reason for the economic recession in developed  countries is insufficient domestic and foreign demand. In 1993,  developed countries' exports declined 0.1 percent and imports  increased 0.1 percent. In developing countries -- particularly  in southeast Asia -- economic growth is strong. In 1993, GNP  increased 5.3 percent in developing countries, and imports and  exports increased by 9.9 and 8.4 percent respectively. During  the next two years, an even more booming development trend will  continue. Since the economy of East Europe is in a period of  change of economic systems, all sorts of political and economic  conflicts are extremely glaring there. Its economy is in severe  recession, both production and exports declining.    The world economic recession has a direct effect on China's  foreign trade. First of all, domestic demand is insufficient in  numerous countries. This limits the increase in China's exports.  Second, owing to the insufficient domestic demand in countries  undergoing an economic recession, products must be exported in  order to be sold. Consequently, international market competition  is more intense, adding to China's export difficulties. Finally,  the intense export market competition makes it easier for China  to import.    In summary, the effect of the world economic slump on  China's  foreign sector is: bad for exports; good for imports.  <H5>  3. Capital Receipts and Expenditures </H5>   China's 1992 international balance of payments schedule,  which was drawn up in 1993, shows -$25 billion for capital. This  includes long term capital of $65.6 billion and short term  capital of -$90.6 billion. The long term capital is a positive  figure that reflects foreign investors' view of the China  market's development prospects. During the first half of 1993,  China approved 43,632 foreign trader investment projects calling  for the investment of $58.756 billion. The actual amount of  foreign capital used was $9.396 billion. This was a respective  234.3, 300.3, and 179.8 percent increase over the same period in  1992. In addition was other long-term capital obtained.  Long-term capital for January through August should also be a  positive figure.    The -$90.6 billion in short-term capital reflects not only  an  increase during 1993 in the amount of short-term foreign loan  capital and interest that China paid, but foreign capital's use  of the China market for speculation should also evoke serious  attention. The net inflow of China's foreign borrowing has  decreased relatively in recent years, and the foreign debt  balance has slowly increased. By comparison with the initial  period of foreign borrowing, the debt repayment burden will  increase. In view of the present import-export situation and the  country's foreign exchange reserves, we must strictly control  the flow of short-term capital in order to prevent a situation  that is detrimental to the internal economy.    Capital has always been closely related to the use of  foreign  capital, but China is guilty of seriously abnormal behavior in  its current use of foreign capital. According to a Shandong  branch bank survey, the main problems are in the following  regards:    1. Rather blatant issuance of IOUs by the foreign party in  concerns in which foreign traders have invested. This show up  strongly in the low percentage of investment funds that the  foreign trader provides. According to Qingdao Port Business  Department survey statistics on concerns in which Chinese and  foreign traders have invested, foreign traders provide only 46  percent of funds, a 23 percent decline from the same period in  the previous year.    2. High debt businesses in which foreign traders shift risks  to China. In enterprises in which foreign traders have invested,  Chinese banks provide the registered capital of both parties,  with the result that the foreign party's actual capital  investment is a very small percentage of the total capital  invested in the enterprise -- approximately 10 percent. In order  to do business on a proper scale, enterprises in which foreign  traders invest obtain large amounts of capital from inside  China, incurring a lot of debt. This creates a situation in  which foreign capital makes use of domestic capital.    3. Existence of phony joint ventures. Not only are their  phony joint venture enterprises that have no foreign investment,  but there are also joint venture enterprises in which the  Chinese party invests nothing or very little. Five of the nine  joint venture enterprises founded since 1992 in Qihe County,  Shandong are phony joint enterprises. This is 56 percent of all  enterprises and 58 percent of all foreign-invested enterprises.    4. Some foreign-invested enterprises borrow back foreign  debt  under the guise of a joint venture. The method used is as  follows: Although both parties to the joint venture have signed  a joint venture agreement, this is simply a formality for the  foreign party. Both parties also secretly sign an additional  agreement that provides that no matter whether the enterprises  shows a profit or a loss, the Chinese party must return to the  foreign trader the foreign trader's investment with interest.    5. Imbalance between foreign exchange receipts and  expenditures in concerns in which foreign traders invest  becoming increasingly serious. Even though concerns in which  foreign traders have invested take more foreign exchange foreign  exchange swap markets than they put in, a substantial portion of  what they take out is investment money and not foreign exchange  earnings from exports. Therefore, as the number of enterprises  in which foreign traders invest increases, the pressure they  exert on the swap markets will become greater, causing  instability in swap prices.  <H5>  4. Changes in Foreign Exchange Reserves, and Changes in Swap </H5> Market Prices    Inasmuch as Chinese trading system is not an entirely open  market economy system, and since the exchange rate system is not  a freely floating exchange rate system, changes in China's  international balance of payments are ultimately expressed in  changes in the quantity and price of foreign exchange.  Adjustments in quantity and price bring balance to the  international balance of payments.    China's definition of foreign exchange reserves has changed  since 1993. Prior to this time, foreign exchange reserves  included both the national foreign exchange balance and the  banks foreign exchange supply In a planned economy, such a  definition is doubtlessly a correct one; however, since China's  specialized banks do some foreign exchange import-export  settlement business, and with the founding of a socialist market  economy system, naturally a new definition of foreign exchange  reserves is needed. The International Monetary Fund definition  is that a country's foreign exchange reserves are foreign  exchange than can be taken without compensation and used freely.  Therefore, China's current definition of foreign exchange  includes the state's foreign exchange balance.    China's foreign exchange reserves have changed but little  since 1993. Starting at $19.443 billion at the beginning of the  year, they stabilized at about $19 billion in October. Within a  short period, foreign exchange reserves exhibited a declining  trend, but in July the central bank conducted open market  trading for the first time. It began to intervene in the foreign  exchange market to hold down too greatly fluctuating price  changes. Since the quantity of foreign exchange changed but  little, foreign exchange swap market prices changed greatly. As  imports increased sharply and exports weakened, the effective  supply of foreign exchange decreased and the shortfall between  supply and demand increased. Exchange prices fluctuated  substantially, thereby creating a bad effect on imports and  exports. Because the government acted to limit trading at the  end of February, swap markets did no business for a time. Some  major players took the opportunity to hoard foreign exchange in  anticipation of steady profits from rises in swap price quotes.  Following price deregulation on 1 June, foreign exchange trading  volume steadily rose. However, it was during this period that  the rise in foreign exchange swap prices was also greatest. In  the principal foreign exchange swap markets throughout the  country, the weighted average price of $1 reached a maximum of  10.90 yuan renminbi. In Hainan Province, the price reached 11.20  yuan per $1.00. After the government intervened directly in the  market in July, the exchange price stabilized very quickly at  8.80 yuan per $1, and this price has remained until the present.  <H5>  5. Assessment of the Current Overall International Balance </H5> of Payments Situation and 1994 Situation Forecast    Currently, import and export fluctuations are still within  the normal economic range. Since domestic demand is greater than  current supply capabilities, imports must be expanded in order  to raise the standard of living and welfare of the citizenry as  a whole, and fluctuations in imports and exports per se also  show that the domestic economy is growing at full tilt, and that  the economy has entered a new round of expansion.    Nevertheless, the long-term trend of changes in imports and  exports suggests no cause for optimism about future prospects.  Historically, once the domestic economy shows signs of  overheating, the possibility is very slight that macroeconomic  regulation and control measures can fine tune the economy.  Should this adverse balance between imports and exports last for  a fairly long time, foreign exchange reserves dwindling as a  result and making it necessary to slam down on the economic  brakes, great ups and downs will occur in the operation of the  economy. Looked at from this angle, the main problem that  imports and exports face today remains dependence for survival  on good operation of the domestic economy and normal operation  of the microeconomy. Only when all latent factors leading to  large ups and downs in imports and exports are brought under  control will imports and exports attain the goal of serving  development of the domestic economy to the maximum extent.    A look at the world economic situation: The world economy  may  gradually get out of its predicament in 1994. Prospects are that  the economy of all countries will enter a slow growth stage.  Forecasts call for a 2.5 percent growth of world GNP in 1994,  the average annual GNP growth rate for developed countries  reaching 4 percent, and economic growth of developing countries  being markedly faster than that of developed countries. A 5  percent GNP growth rate is forecast for developing countries in  1994. In 1994, the economy of the former Soviet and East  European countries will begin a weak revival in 1994, and  gradually exhibit a fine growth momentum. Their 1994 GNP will  increase 1.5 percent. As the world economy revives and gradually  enters a normal development stage, prospects are that the entire  world trade situation will rapidly improve. Estimates call for  an approximately 6.9 percent increase in world exports in 1994.  The world economic situation is moving in a direction that is  favorable to China's foreign trade balance.    A look at the domestic supply and demand situation: As a  result of the macroeconomic regulation and control measures  instituted in July 1993, the high speed economic growth express  train will slow don in 1994. Inasmuch as this is a one-time  rather than a continuing readjustment of the economic structure,  the economy will continue to operate in high gear during 1994.  This will provide conditions to easing bottlenecks (including  finance bottlenecks and resources bottlenecks). Total supply  may be more than the domestic market can absorb in 1994;  therefore, foreign demand will gradually play an important role.    At look at the international balance of payments situation:  Because of the substantial adverse balance of foreign trade in  1993, China's foreign exchange balance will decline. Therefore,  the use of foreign exchange for imports will decline in 1994,  holding down an increase in imports. Weakening of growth  momentum in domestic investment demand will also restrict the  importation of means of production making the speed of increase  in commodity imports less during 1994 than in 1993. Moreover,  because of an upswing in international market demand and a  slowing of domestic demand, forecasts call for exports to  increase more in 1994 than in 1993. However, since the base  figure for 1993 exports was small, and since the base figure for  1993 imports was large, China may still show a trade deficit in  its foreign trade balance for 1994.</p>

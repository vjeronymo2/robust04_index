On the basis of the amnesty decision adopted by the State  Duma (lower house of parliament), the court ruled to drop  criminal processings against former top Soviet officials who  were involved in the August 19, 1991 event, which has been  called an "abortive Soviet coup" by Russian authorities.    The amnesty covers the organizers of the August 19 event of  1991 and the May Day demonstration of 1993, and opposition  leaders arrested in the tank attack on the parliament building  in Moscow last October.    Among the freed were former Russian parliament speaker  Ruslan  Khasbulatov and former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy.</p>

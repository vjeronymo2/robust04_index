			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Justinian: Cloud over the legal system The lurid life and times of Ms Jani Allan, as portrayed at the Royal Courts of Justice during her unsuccessful libel action against Channel 4, may have been a piece of pure theatre, thanks in part to some colourful jury advocacy from fashionable Queen's Counsel. The case undoubtedly titillated the public palate, if the tabloid coverage is anything to go by. However, it possessed little of legal or public interest, as opposed to its interest to the newspaper reading public. The case will slip into the record books purely as a rare contemporary success by the media defending their right to inform the public of the private antics of public figures. Yet, even though the case provides welcome relief to the media, which has been wailing consistently at being mulcted with every award of heavy damages for libel, it has done nothing to dispel the pervading cloud of costly libel litigation. Reports that Miss Allan now faces a bill for legal costs of Pounds 300,000, whatever else, will not astonish the cognoscenti of the libel world. Those few cases of libel which survive the process of writ-serving and negotiations for settlements inevitably bring the high cost of legal assistance and representation. The Lord Chief Justice is on record recently as saying that 'legal fees in the private sector have gone too high' and that those who brief barristers should insist on moderating the fees paid. But even if the fees of the lawyers in the Jani Allan case appeared inordinately rapacious, there is not much prospect of cutting the costs of libel actions significantly. In any event, should there be a cheaper service, both for those defamed and for those who publish defamatory matter, in pursuing and resisting legal action? Is this form of legal service really necessary at all? Those who feel the need to redeem their unjustly tarnished reputation by a claim to damages are invited, but not actively encouraged, by the legal system. The system demonstrates the uniqueness of libel actions by declining to apply the legal aid scheme. Thus only the well-to-do can sensibly afford to take on the might of wealthy newspapers. It is the public figure mainly who is the object of media attention with potential for defamatory treatment. Often public figures actually use and enjoy media coverage for their activities, but squeal the moment the publicity turns nasty. In general terms, might it be that they should take the rough with the smooth, and desist from going to law on the one occasion? If the damages awardable by juries were to be severely reduced by the factor of ongoing and otherwise favourable publicity, that might temper the temptation to sue. And if there is a genuine desire to restore publicly one's proper reputation, should not the Press Complaints Commission proclaim much more vigorously its availability to adjudicate on libel cases, with an obligation on the part of publishers to publish prominently any adverse rulings as an alternative to expensive litigation? However, so long as society desires to compensate the defamed for loss of reputation - not easily measurable in money terms - there will remain the opportunity for juries to use the occasion for punishing the worst defamers, even if the juries are constrained by judicial pleas for moderation. There are numerous examples of libel damages being awarded as a deterrent - when a newspaper has behaved intentionally and inexcusably, abused its journalistic powers, distorted information or published material scandalously. In the past, courts have not curbed jury awards of exemplary damages, although there are some welcome signs of the courts putting a brake on jury awards. The not so well-to-do and the poor are palpably discriminated against by the legal system. They simply cannot afford to do more than threaten proceedings, in the hope that a modest payment coupled with an apology may be forthcoming. The prospect of the day in court is daunting, to say the least. The absence of legal aid for libel actions is, on the face of it, socially unjust. For 30 years successive committees, both official and unofficial, have urged the government to remedy the apparent unfairness. The Royal Commission on Legal Services, under the chairmanship of Lord Benson, was in 1979 the latest voice raised in support of applying legal aid to libel. Yet the Treasury has stoutly resisted all blandishments, for fear of burdening the public purse. If there were methods for guaranteeing the grant of a legal aid certificate only to those cases in which the plaintiff was almost bound to succeed - something more than a reasonable cause of action - there would be less worry over the public expense. The legal aid fund would almost invariably be reimbursed out of recovered damages. A limited form of legal aid in libel would redress the balance of unequal treatment among those defamed. It could also lead to a tighter control over the costs of those few cases that were fully litigated.</p>

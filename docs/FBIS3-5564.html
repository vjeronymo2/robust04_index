The agreement was signed in Bucharest last Friday (local  time) between Ex-Im Bank president Kim Yong-pin and Dumitru  Anghelescu, president of the communications corporation Rom  Telecom R.A.    The EDCF loan carries an annual interest of 4.2 percent and  has to be paid back over the next 20 years with five years'  deferment of repayments of the principal.    The state-run telecommunications company will use the loan  for modernizing communications equipment in the Romanian state  of Prahova.    Signed prior to the state visit of Romanian President Ion  Iliescu today, the agreement is expected to boost bilateral  economic cooperation and to help Korean companies export  machinery and equipment to East European countries, the  spokesman said.</p>

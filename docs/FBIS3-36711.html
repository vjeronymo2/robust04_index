He  pointed out that the two countries' central banks, finance and  external economic relations ministries had already signed the  corresponding agreements.    The first deputy prime minister also told the journalists of  the results of the working meeting of experts of the  Russian-Belarusian interstate commission on the unification of  the two countries' monetary systems which ended in Minsk  recently.    Myasnikovich said the experts agreed that, firstly, it is  necessary to equalize prices to ensure the two countries'  successful trade. In particular, the prices of fuel sold to  Belarus must be equal to Russia's internal prices. In addition,  it is necessary to lift all customs duties in bilateral trade.    Secondly, the two countries will not merge their budget  systems since they agreed that the shares of deficit in their  GDP must be proportional. (In 1993, Russia's budget deficit was  10.5% of GDP, while it was 6% in Belarus - Interfax's note.)    Thirdly, Myasnikovich said that cash Belarusian rubles will  be exchanged for Russian ones at the rate of 1:1. Belarus needs  to put in its circulation about 700 billion Russian rubles,  while the republic's aggregate money supply at the moment is 2.1  trillion rubles, according to Myasnikovich. The rate for  non-cash exchange will be set according to statistical data on  the purchasing strength of the two countries' monetary units at  the moment of unification.    Judged by this parameter, the Russian ruble was stronger  than  the Belarusian one by 2.19 times on January 1, 1994, according  to the Russian and Belarussian statistics committees. Experts  of the International Monetary Fund say the ratio will be 1:2.5  by March 1.    Fourthly, Belarusian wages should be roughly equal to  Russian  wages. At present, the gap between them is by about 3 times,  that is why the experts agreed that the salaries of employees of  state bodies will be re-calculated within three months of the  beginning of the unification.    Finally, the two countries' correspondent accounts with the  counterpart central bank will play a passive role as they will  only keep the payments register.    Myasnikovich said the experts were finalizing disputable  issues related to the unification in Moscow.</p>

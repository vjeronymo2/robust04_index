			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIVING INTO THE MEAT AND POTATOES;  </P> <P> MOCA'S PERMANENT COLLECTION PROVIDES A LOOK AT THE ATTEMPT TO BUILD A  POSTMODERN MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART;  </P> <P> COMMENTARY  </P> <P> Last summer, the Greek-born artist Jannis Kounellis had an abrupt change of  heart and withdrew from an exhibition planned for late November at the Museum  of Contemporary Art.  </P> <P> Into the suddenly gaping hole in its schedule, the museum slotted a potentially  snore-inducing exhibition, dubbed "Constructing a History: A Focus on the  Permanent Collection." But what began as filler unexpectedly emerged as a  fascinating excursion into art of the recent past -- a voyage that raises  provocative questions for museums everywhere.  </P> <P> The Museum of Contemporary Art began to form its collection nearly a decade  ago. Along the way, special exhibitions have been mounted of major bequests and  acquisitions, including the celebrated Panza, Barry Lowen, and Rita and Taft  Schreiber collections. But never has the museum had a substantive portion of  its holdings (today numbering about 1,000 pieces) on regular view. The absence  of a relatively stable array of galleries devoted day-in, day-out to the  meat-and-potatoes stuff of a museum -- a truly permanent permanent-collection,  so to speak -- has always been a serious weakness.  </P> <P> The suspicion has been that MOCA's collection simply wasn't strong enough to  hold its own. Certainly there are big gaps, but "Constructing a History" shows  there's more than one curatorial way to skin a cat. The scheduling disaster has  turned out to be a boon.  </P> <P> Organized by curator Ann Goldstein, "Constructing a History" shuffles the  historical deck in eye-opening ways. Chronology is abandoned, groupings are  arbitrarily made. One gallery might have paintings and sculptures from the  1950s, the next an arrangement with works that span nearly 50 years. A room may  be filled with chiefly monochromatic works, offering a surprising range via  minimal means, or with images that chronicle the visceral, social and symbolic  uses of landscape.  </P> <P> Mediums get mixed. Juxtapositions jostle. (In the most dramatic, small  photographs by Edward Weston and Brassai hang next to Jackson Pollock's  magisterial 1949 drip-painting, "Number 1." All three suddenly reveal a poetic  intimacy.) Throughout, works by internationally acclaimed modern masters are  installed side by side with those by artists of much younger, less established  reputation.  </P> <P> There's even an insightful pause in the action. Smack in the middle of the  show, a second exhibition has been mounted. These "Selections From the  Collection of Philip and Beatrice Gersh," a Beverly Hills couple who are  well-known collectors nationally, italicize an important point: The stories  institutions tell about the history of art are fundamentally shaped by the  smaller narratives of individual private collectors. Indeed, the labels show  that several important works from the Gersh collection, including David Smith's  1961 sculpture of brushed aluminum, "Cubi III," are promised gifts to the  museum.  </P> <P> Obviously, a lot is going on in this exhibition. And somehow, it works.  </P> <P> At least, most of it does. Many of the 150 paintings, sculptures,  installations, photographs and prints are first-rate, but a good number are  not. Certain galleries feel cramped, others seem haphazard. Confusing signage  leaves you unclear as to where the Gersh collection ends and the museum  collection begins. (Maybe that's the clever point? Nah.)  </P> <P> Whatever the complaints, they're soon pushed aside. For this is an exhibition  that gets pulled off through sheer, self-evident curiosity about works of art,  and about how they mean what they mean. In subtle and insightful ways, it  invites you into its own process of discovery.  </P> <P> With just five works, the very first gallery sets the stage. Julian Schnabel's  chunky "Corinne Near Armenia" (1984), a lumbering classical figure painted  across a field of rubble, and Anselm Kiefer's "Wege I" (1977), a smoky-black  miasma of printed heads of great German thinkers of the past, announce that  history itself will be the subject of the show. Very different mixed-media  works by Louise Lawler and Allen Ruppersberg pointedly suggest that a museum is  a very particular, and specifically modern, frame of reference through which  history gets visually written. (The murderous imagery of Ruppersberg's 1982  diptych, "Still Life," sardonically casts the museum as mausoleum.)  </P> <P> These twin poles -- history and museum -- tend to be invisibly merged in most  installations. Stephen Prina's "Aristotle-Plato-Socrates" brilliantly opens  them up to scrutiny. Using recorded sound, graphics, bookplates and  reproductions of famous paintings, Prina threads the founding philosophers of  ancient Western culture through two of modern culture's founding fathers --  Rembrandt van Rijn and Jacques-Louis David -- then subjects them to the present  world of science and technology. It makes for a compelling rumination on  freedom and its illusions.  </P> <P> In the space of a few minutes, this first gallery makes something plain: We are  not about to see a show in which the course of art since 1945 is thought to  have been all sewn up. We won't enter a collection that follows a prearranged  narrative, into which the young museum will try to fill the slots with  acquisitions. Doubtless there are major works by pivotal artists that MOCA  would love to have. If this show is a reliable guide, however, the aim will not  be merely to fill in the blanks.  </P> <P> What will the aim be? It's risky to presume too much. This show is only  temporary, decidedly tentative and not fully worked through. But, as far as I  know, this presentation of the permanent collection represents something  virtually unprecedented among American museums: It's the first, full-scale  attempt at organizing what could be called a Postmodern Museum of Contemporary  Art. And at this late date, that's a distinction rather startling to realize.  </P> <P> It isn't news that we've been living through an extraordinary boom in new  construction of American museums. Nor should the presses be stopped to headline  an announcement that there's been a phenomenal rise of the cultural doctrine  called postmodernism. These are simply two of the developments indispensable to  any reckoning of where we've been in the decade that ends today, as well as to  any hazy speculation about where we might be headed in the one that blasts off,  ready or not, come Monday morning.  </P> <P> You would not be witless if you assumed that new museums and new art might have  something to do with one another. You certainly would be forgiven, however, if  you couldn't say just what that relationship might be. Why? Well, I know this  will be hard to believe, but museums, which solemnly boast of the decisive  importance of their educational mission in all things artistic, aren't doing  very much to help.  </P> <P> In fact, to look at art museums across the land, whether old and stately or new  and aggressive (or some other combination thereof), you would likely never know  that something called postmodernism had ever happened. At least, you would  never know it was anything more than a stylistic comet that had come and gone  in the cultural cosmos, leaving behind a modest shower of dazzling lights and  an annoyingly large cloud of murky dust.  </P> <P> Part of the problem in any discussion of postmodernism is the slipperiness of  the term, which can mean different things to different people (not to mention  the headache-inducing locutions of cheery, related activities such as  hermeneutics and deconstructionism). The field is an intricate tangle.  </P> <P> Not long ago, UC Irvine professor of history John Patrick Higgins came to the  rescue, describing postmodernism in as succinct a manner as any I've seen. So,  in an effort to make sure we're all on the same track, and in a thoroughly  postmodern spirit of appropriation, I've stolen his definition for my own:  "Postmodernism is the Paris-inspired, Nietzsche-influenced school of thought  that claims there is no objective knowledge but simply interpretations and  rhetorical persuasions."  </P> <P> To be sure, numerous museums have been acquiring art that fits this tidy  description, and some have been acquiring it at a relatively furious pace.  Typically, their holdings are organized according to a chronological history of  styles. Those with large collections tend to insert postmodernism as a recent  link in the long and venerable chain.  </P> <P> Postmodernism, however, is not a pictorial style. It is a way of thinking. And  one of its principal thoughts has been that it is time to sever the very chain  of stylistic history that museums have helped to forge, a chain that has become  as much a confining shackle as a stabilizing anchor.  </P> <P> I suppose we shouldn't be surprised that institutions haven't rushed to  embrace, promote and put into practice a principle that would seem to require a  thorough overhaul of everything they've long held dear. But here's a dilemma:  How can museums, which in increasing numbers are rushing to embrace  contemporary art, effectively deal with a school of artistic thought that is  essentially contradictory to their own established patterns?  </P> <P> Inadvertently or not, the Museum of Contemporary Art is tackling the conundrum.  The experience of going there is individualized, made refreshingly surprising.  "Constructing a History" manages to break the cookie-cutter mold, whereby  museum collections everywhere are looking more and more alike.  </P> <P> For me, the biggest surprise of all, and the one that persuades me the museum  is onto something, is that I was actually engaged by the inclusion of Jules  Olitski's monumental 1967 canvas, "Tender Boogus." Inch for inch -- and there  are a lot of them in this 21-foot-long painting -- this is probably the  silliest, most vapid work around. So what's the deal?  </P> <P> Olitski's position in the 1960s is fixed. As the avatar of color-field  painting, proposed by the influential critic Clement Greenberg to be the most  important art at a moment when Pop and Minimalism were disrupting the flow of  aesthetic traffic, Olitski was set up as a historical inevitability -- as next  in line to be acclaimed a master. It didn't happen. A minor distraction,  color-field painting got run over.  </P> <P> The episode, still being sorted out today, is a pivotal one, and certainly ripe  for any serious understanding of recent history. But how to acknowledge it in a  museum?  </P> <P> If organized according to the history of styles, a collection featuring Olitski  would appear to regard him as a genius. One that banished him from the kingdom  would leave an embarrassing hole, conspicuously suggesting he's a colossal flop  and rendering the historical moment unspeakable. Either way, culture gets  played as a gross cartoon.  </P> <P> At the Museum of Contemporary Art, however, you've been primed. Rather than  links in a chain, history is offered as a matter of discussion, argument and  persuasion, spoken through the language of art. No longer a fixed polemic,  "Tender Boogus" is restored to being simply a painting. Not a very good one, in  my far from lonely estimation, but that's the point: Critically poised, you  find yourself looking at a work of art and asking, How did history happen?  </P> <P> In the permanent collection of a museum, who could ask for more?  </P></p>

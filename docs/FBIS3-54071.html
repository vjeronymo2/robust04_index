			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar al-Kuhali by </F> Salih al-Qallab in Aden on 21 January]    [Text] [Al-Qallab] Views differ on the possibility of  implementing the agreement of understanding reached a few days  ago. As a responsible member of the government, the follow-up  committee, and Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], what are the actual  prospects for implementing this agreement?    [Al-Kuhali] It is difficult to be absolutely certain if this  agreement will be implemented or not, but I earnestly hope that  at least part of it will be implemented. However, even if this  agreement is not implemented fully or partially, I believe that  this agreement, which is actually a social contract, will remain  a bright spot in Yemeni history.    If we cannot implement this document now, I am perfectly  convinced that future Yemeni generations will produce leaders  capable of implementing it because this document has created and  will continue to create a new awareness of the need to establish  a nation on the level of advanced nations based on institutions.    In short, I believe that this document is fit to be the  national program of this generation. It is enough that our  present generation is able to implement it or some of it at  least.    [Al-Qallab] The follow-up committee, which was formed to  implement this agreement and of which you are a member, is  supposed to have taken some measures over the past three days.  What has happened so far?    [Al-Kuhali] Yesterday we called for a meeting of the  follow-up committee in Sanaa but I could not go because I was on  a mission abroad. I found out that before attending such a  meeting, I had to attend the YSP Central Committee and Political  Bureau meetings, which will give the YSP views on this document.    Here, I would like to say that the YSP, represented by its  Central Committee, Political Bureau, and other leaders, is  committed to the very letter of this agreement and to  implementing it and that the party will launch a large-scale  campaign to muster popular support for what has been agreed on  in the document of understanding.    [Al-Qallab] We heard two days ago that Shaykh 'Abdallah  al-Ahmar, the speaker of the House of Representatives, raised  certain objections to this document. Is this true or are these  mere rumors?    [Al-Kuhali] I heard that Shaykh 'Abdallah raised certain  objections to this agreement but I also heard that these  objections have been withdrawn. I am happy to hear that.    [Al-Qallab] We also heard that the president insists that  'Ali Salim al-Bid must return to Sanaa before the document is  signed, that the agreement should be signed after al-Bid has  resumed his normal official duties. Is this true?    [Al-Kuhali] This is another issue that will be discussed by  the follow-up committee entrusted with preparations for the  meeting between the president and the vice president and the  meeting of the secretary generals of the parties.    [Al-Qallab] Obviously, you are attaching great importance to  security matters in the agreement. Has there been any progress  in this regard over the past few days?    [Al-Kuhali] No, nothing has been achieved so far, but even  before reaching the agreement, the Interior Ministry tried to  deal with the issue of the terrorists who were responsible for  the assassinations and explosions that claimed the lives of so  many people. Nothing has been achieved in this regard because  those in control did not cooperate with the ministry. We hope  such cooperation will materialize after the recent agreement.    [Al-Qallab] Yesterday, some of your newspapers said that a  military plane from the south bombed military border positions  in the north. How true is this report and why was it published?    [Al-Kuhali] First of all this report is absolutely untrue.  The YSP is aware of what war means, what it means to have a  warplane bomb military positions. For a plane to mount combat  missions means that war is actually going on. This is not a  joke and therefore, the report is baseless and fabricated. As  to why this lie was disseminated, I have no idea. You can ask  those who published it.    [Al-Qallab] It was decided to hold the reconciliation  meeting  between the president and his deputy in Hadramawt between 25 and  30 January. Do you think that this meeting will take place in  Hadramawt and within this timeframe?    [Al-Kuhali] As a member of the committee, I do not want to  say anything in this regard before the committee meets and  discusses this issue in detail and see what other options we  have.    [Al-Qallab] You have said that this document may be for  the future generations, what are the threats facing that  agreement and its basic elements?    [Al-Kuhali] The document may not please certain parties and  may pose a threat to the positions of certain centers of power.  But I think the most important issues are the local government,  removing military forces from cities, and arresting the  "terrorists."    In all cases, let us wait. I think that, in the short term,  some of those who feel they are the stronger party will seek to  abort this document. As for the longer term, I believe that the  Yemeni people will be the stronger party and will impose their  will on everybody and implement the document sooner or later.    We have to start implementing what can be implemented now,  and at the same time work on implementing this document in the  future, because it concerns the interest of all people and  because it is the document of all Yemeni political parties and  forces, and not the document of the YSP or the General People's  Congress. It does not mark the victory or the defeat of any  party. It marks a triumph for the homeland and a genuine  buttress for the state of unity.    [Al-Qallab] As a member of the follow-up committee, a  government minister, and a YSP leader, aren't you afraid that a  major security or military emergency will obstruct that  agreement?    [Al-Kuhali] In fact such a concern exists, and I am not  revealing any secrets by saying so. Yesterday I heard there was  some military tension in Yarim area. I immediately called  Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and told him that we must  work together and in quiet to prevent any surprises. I also  urged vigilance because there are many parties that would not  like to see that agreement implemented.    Frankly I share this concern, and I fear a major surprise in  the security and military field. But in general, I think we  should not worry so much about these concerns and work to  implement this agreement and sign the document. I believe we  are capable of confronting any emergency by combining resolve  and self-restraint.    [Al-Qallab] Are things quiet now on the former borders  between the two parts?    [Al-Kuhali] In fact troops are intermingled everywhere from  'Amran to Lawdar and there is no tension in the way described by  certain media. I stress that anyone who wagers on the split of  the country will lose.    [Al-Qallab] Certain Arab parties, particularly Jordan, have  exerted efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis. Has there been a  decision to invite some Arab leaders to attend the celebrations  marking the meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  the vice president?    [Al-Kuhali] We in the YSP welcome anyone who helped and  supported us to attend these expected celebrations. Here I wish  to underline the major role played by His Majesty King Husayn to  protect the Yemeni unity and close the ranks.    [Al-Qallab] The YSP and its leaders have been accused of  submitting to neighboring regional influences. What do you say?    [Al-Kuhali] One can understand that such things are said and  used in political conflicts. These accusation are based on the  fact that the other party has to defend itself against  accusations of being out of touch with the age and rejecting the  future. In all cases, these things have been said, but you know  that such accusations exist in our Arab and Yemeni heritage.  When we have a calamity we must attribute it to an enemy from  outside or resolve it through a friend from outside.    I say that if we want to address our problems, then we must  not take them to the outside. If the outside means the Gulf  states, then the YSP is calling, emphatically, for new relations  with these states on the basis of frankness, clarity, and common  interests. We call for an Arab Peninsula free from  confrontations or trenches. We do not wish to export ideology  or slogans. We have to accept each other and coexist on clear  basis and without subservience or submission.    [Al-Qallab] Is it true that the United States does not wish  to see Yemen partitioned again?    [Al-Kuhali] Yes. We appreciate all the efforts that have  been exerted to help us contain the crisis from the Arabs,  Europe, and the United States. We welcome such efforts and  roles.</p>

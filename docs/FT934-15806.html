			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: IRI sells SME division to FSVI for L307bn IRI, the Italian state holding, has completed the second stage in the privatisation of SME, its agro-industrial group, by selling its canned foods, milk and edible oils division, Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica (Cbd), for L307bn (Dollars 192m). The 62 per cent stake held by IRI has been bought by FSVI, an agro-industrial holding company with extensive interests in southern Italy where SME has been strongly rooted. FSVI is 60 per cent owned by co-operatives in the Basilicata region, a further 20 per cent by regional financial institutions led by the state-owned Banco di Napoli and the remainder split between private shareholders. IRI had hoped to sell this division in July in tandem with the disposal of Finitalgel, the frozen foods side of SME. However, the IRI board judged the offers insufficient. Since then there have been delicate negotiations brokered by US merchant bankers Wasserstein Perella. The Cbd sale brings earnings from disposal of the two SME divisions to L475bn. The FSVI bid values Cbd shares at L1,102 each against a stock market quotation of L1,146 and an initial estimate of L1,370. In adjudicating the division to FSVI, IRI had to balance the strong pressure in the Naples area and southern Italy for Cbd to be in local hands against the claims of larger Italian and multinational groups. Canned fruit, milk and tomatoes produced on co-operatives in Basilicata, Calabria, Campana and Puglia are important to the regional economies in terms of jobs and income.</p>

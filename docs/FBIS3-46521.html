			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Farm Policies Should Support </F> Independence-Oriented Farmers"]    [Text] Japan has finally accepted partial liberalization  of the rice market and tariffication of all other farm products  at the GATT multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round).  Following this, the government established the "Headquarters  for Emergency Farm Policies." The headquarters is headed by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and other seats are filled by  all cabinet ministers except the justice and defense ministers.  We hope the all-star team steadily promotes farm policy reform  without losing its direction.    Under the current farm policy, rice farmers cannot freely  seek expansion of their businesses due to the government's rice  paddy reduction and food control policies. They have to cope  with imported rice under such handicaps. Even without this  disadvantage, rice farming is often said to be the least  attractive job for young people. The government is probably  planning new subsidies to rice farmers, but they would never  take effect unless these restrictions are removed.    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]  compiled a policy report in 1992: "New Direction of Food and  Farm Policies (or the so-called New Policies)." The report says  that, in the year 2000, 80 percent of the nation's rice output  should be produced by 50,000 large-scale rice farmers who  cultivate rice paddies of 10 to 20 hectares, 100,000 part-time  farmers who cultivate five to 10 hectares, and 20,000 organized  farmers. This seems to be a very drastic objective since the  average size of rice paddies owned by individual farmers is only  0.7 hectare right now.    To achieve the objective, the speed of farm transactions  should be accelerated by 250 percent compared to the present  level. This means great numbers of farmers scale down or quit  their farming business to concentrate on the nation's farmlands  to large-scale farmers. Now that a considerable percentage of  farmers is becoming old or doing farming as its side business,  the opportunity is going to be ripe for a drastic farmland  reform. The New Policies report predicts a drastic increase of  "nonfarmer landowners."  <H5>  Farmlands Should Be Given to Motivated Farmers </H5>   Even if a number of landowners give up farming, this would  not immediately result in an increase of large-scale farmers.  Also, productivity would not improve when farmers have to work  on undeveloped and scattered rice paddies. Of late, many  farmlands are offered for rent, but most of them are left  deserted with no tenants. Concentration of farmlands to  motivated farmers is becoming the biggest issue of Japan's farm  administration.    The limitation of compulsory rice production control was  highlighted this year by a drastic decrease in the rice crop.  Japan cannot abandon the rice paddy cut policy until it accepts  the rice tariffication because the "existence of effective  production control measures" is a prerequisite of GATT's special  treatment for Japan's rice. Even under the GATT restriction,  however, it is still possible to give farmers a "freedom of  choice" whether or not they accept rice paddy reduction. The  government can offer compensation to those who accept the  government policy, but those who do not want to cut their  production should be allowed to deal with the market at their  own risk.    Rice farmers are extremely frustrated with the production  control policy. While the government intends to relax the  policy for a while to cope with the rice shortfall, imports of  foreign-grown rice will certainly bring about oversupply of rice  again. Under such circumstances, none of the Japanese rice  farmers can be a motivated farmer.    To back implementation of the New Policies, the government  has enacted the Farm Management Reinforcement Law. Under the  law, each local government body is allowed to designate the  region's leading farmers as "approved farmers" for public  support. As a tentative measure, the freedom of choice should  be given at least to these approved farmers.    While agricultural cooperatives have been enforcing the rice  paddy cut policy in a tie-up with the government, some of them  are beginning to break up with the government to protest its  decision on the rice market liberalization. This is a chance to  correct questioned ties between agricultural cooperative and the  administrative branch.    The New Policies report does not touch on the revision of  the Food Control Law since the report was compiled in the midst  of the Uruguay Round negotiations. However, reform of the food  control system is an indispensable condition for further  development of Japanese agriculture. The food control system  started immediately after World War II to protect consumers  suffering from a food shortage. However, it has already been  changed into a tool to protect producers. Yet, the system  presently restricts producers' business activities, too.    The rice farmers' weak point is that they have no say in the  price of their own products. Distribution of farm products is  usually concentrated to agricultural cooperatives, but, except  for rice, farmers are allowed to sell their own products  directly to consumers. However, the law prohibits rice farmers  from selling or deciding prices of their own product except for  one exception called the special purpose rice.    A town in Nagano Prefecture has a farmers' production group  which is designated by the government as a model of independent  farming bodies. The group has its own rice retail shop.  However, the law requires the farmers to sell their own rice  after repurchasing from local agricultural cooperatives -- at  least on the invoice. The procedure pushes up the price of rice  sold there. Even in the model group, farmers cannot freely sell  their own rice. Under such circumstances, can the food control  system really protect interests of consumers?  <H5>  Food Control Law Must Be Drastically Revised </H5>   The MAFF reportedly intends to seek the minimum revision of  the Food Control Law. But this would not motivate farmers. We  urge the MAFF to drastically revise the law to create rice  farming for the 21st Century.    To secure a younger farming population, it is necessary to  encourage young people's entrance into the farming business  regardless of whether they are from a farmer's family or not.  The government has to prove that farming is a business they can  be proud of. At the same time, the government is supposed to  consider financial support for highly educated but landless  farmers, following a successful subsidy system in France.    Also, the government must take appropriate measures to  promote farming in mountain villages, where farmers have  regional disadvantages, for improving their productivity. In  line with the New Policies report, the government enacted a  special law in September to support farming in 1,700 local  government bodies, whose productivity is relatively low. Yet,  farm subsidies would not be enough. A new farm policy to  vitalize these regions should be discussed as a combination of  all existing regional development policies, as well as new  measures. The government is expected to drastically review all  policies for these regions, and to hammer out new comprehensive  measures overcoming bureaucratic sectionalism.    In that case, the government is supposed to attach  importance  to the creativity of local communities. This is because  communities must have authority and financial resources to carve  their way to the future at their own risk. The government  should reconsider why local government bodies welcomed the  former Takeshita administration's decision to allot 100 million  yen to each local government with no restriction on purposes for  expenditure.</p>

Traffic flow improvements could include signal system timing/optimization, addition of turning lanes, restrictions of single occupant vehicles (to enhance HOV operations and attract users), fringe park and ride lots, and pedestrian/non-motorized improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Local road improvements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Local improvements include anything that expands capacity on the basic existing traffic network, for example, improving traffic flow across the Taylor's Falls Bridge. While some TDM/TSM measures could also be listed under this category, other local improvements could involve adding additional lanes, overpasses, mini-bypasses, or other structural changes. Since the EIS does not focus on this issue very much, EPA would appreciate comments on needed improvements to the existing traffic network.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Mitigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current mitigation plan consists of avoiding, minimizing and compensating for environmental losses. DOT has endeavored to minimize impacts by proposing: 1. two bridges and five box culverts at some of the stream locations; 2. closed drainage systems to divert and treat runoff in order to minimize impacts to drinking water resources; 3. 26 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; median widths at wetland locations; 4. 2:1 side slopes to minimize impacts; and 5. two retaining walls to reduce impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compensatory mitigation portions of the plan consist of the following: 1. attempted creation or restoration of 44 acres of wetlands mainly at the former Benson's Wild Animal Farm; 2. bringing Merrill Brook above ground at Benson's; 3. constructing water detention basins adjacent to the roadway; 4. preserving an additional 100 acres at Benson's and 135 acres along an old alignment that DOT owns in the southern portion of the site; and 5. protecting water supply by capturing part of the runoff from the existing F.E. Everett Turnpike.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, DOT has proposed a substantial mitigation plan, especially to minimize impacts. However, EPA believes that the environmental benefits, especially for wildlife, of the proposed compensation plan fall well short of the impacts the NHCH would cause. While creation and restoration may be beneficial to the aquatic environment, especially when applied at a low value site in a relatively undisturbed landscape setting, wetland creation suffers from both theoretical limitations and practical problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the poor track record associated with wetland creation suggests that it would be unwise to rely on this mitigation to provide all of the intended benefits. Some wetland functions, such as flood storage, can normally be replicated successfully. Attempts to mitigate wildlife habitat losses have met with mixed success, and benefit only a few select species. There has been little or no demonstrated ability to recreate other wetland values such as groundwater discharge and recharge or the complex interactions of water, soil and plants involved in the uptake and transformation of nutrients and pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

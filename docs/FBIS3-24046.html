			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Laimonas Tapinas, General Director of Lithuanian </F> Radio and Television: "If There Is Dissatisfaction With  Television, Let's Talk About Money"]    [Text] At one evening party, after all topics of  conversation had been exhausted, someone suggested in jest: "And  now, let's talk about television...". And indeed, conversation  revived right away, because everyone had something to say on  this issue.    A similar situation, it seems, exists in the public at  large.  It is annoying, though, that the scolding we receive is  sometimes simply invalid, or that sometimes the most absurd  accusations are levelled against us.    Some maintain that nothing has changed at Lithuanian Radio  and Television, that the "Landsbergisites" are in charge and  running things, just as before. Others, on the contrary, are  angry that the LDDP is running things as if it owned the place,  while opposition politicians are not even allowed in through the  door... I admit that I react to all this shedding of tears much  more playfully: if both sides are dissatisfied, well then,  that's not bad, we are probably succeeding in maintaining a  balance and in trying to achieve the goal we have set for  ourselves--above all else, to provide information that is  objective and free of any partisan politics.    With respect to political broadcasts, we intend to seek a  balance and to do our best to ensure that the representatives of  all political forces are able to express their opinion on  Lithuanian Radio and Television. We want to structure our  broadcasts so that that there is dialog instead of accusations  made in the absence of one's opponent. And let the viewers  decide who is right.    But maybe these are just our wishes? How are things in  reality? Let's look at the numbers.    Last year, 247 LDDP representatives, 218 members of the  right  opposition, and 175 members of parties with a centrist  orientation spoke on Lithuanian radio. The proportion on  television worked out to be pretty much the same: LDDP - 93, the  right - 98, the center (social democrats, Center Union,  liberals, etc.) -64. Among individual politicians, those talking  most frequently on the radio were C. Jursenas (46 times), V.  Landsbergis and G. Vagnorius (34 times each), G. Kirkilas (30),  J. Karosas (25), A. Kubilius (18), V. Jarmolenka (17). On  television, the viewers most frequently saw V. Landsbergis (8  times), R. Ozolas and G. Pavirzis (7 times each), J. Bernatonis  and S. Peceliunas (6 times each), etc. This statistical  compilation does not include those politicians who spoke briefly  in our informational broadcasts, nor does it include President  A. Brazauskas or Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, who spoke not as  representatives of a political force, but as the highest  officials in Lithuania.    How might one assess these numbers? Keeping them in mind, it  is difficult to understand the short-tempered statements made  both here and abroad by the National Harmony-Conservatives of  Lithuania party to the effect that it is not able to make use of  the national radio and television. I could more readily say--in  self-criticism--that it is not normal that a group which lost  the elections in devastating fashion spoke on television even  more frequently than the representatives of the ruling party.  Simply giving in to noisy protest campaigns--and in the name of  peace--our producers apparently invited the conservatives to  appear on radio and television more frequently than ought to  have been done on the basis of their political weight in the  Seimas.    This is even more valid with respect to the people from the  small moderate political parties, who had the opportunity to use  the airwaves not very much less than the two large parties.    A few words should also be said about the relationship  between the national government and Lithuanian Radio and  Television. I could characterize it as normal. Neither the  government leadership nor the Seimas meddled in our affairs or  tried to direct us, palm off their opinions on us, or call us  "on the carpet", something which was entirely customary two or  three years ago. And still, the fact that our relations are  businesslike and normal today does not yet mean that they will  remain that way tomorrow, nor that at some time after a change  in government, the new leaders of Lithuania will not want to  take advantage of the charter for state radio and television.  This is why I am uneasy.    And even if the government does not make any big demands  directly, the constant danger of this happening will always  remain, because the financing of radio and television will  depend on the governing structures, and even on the views of a  single high official, who might say: "You criticized the  government and didn't do what it wanted, and we're cutting  several million litas from your budget..." In other words,  state radio and television and their programs will depend on the  government whether they want to or not.    Avoiding this kind of dependence, our colleagues in western  Europe changed to a public status for radio and television a  good 10 years ago. That is also the direction in which all of  the post-communist countries of Central Europe are headed, and  some (e.g., Poland), have even already gone through the legal  steps to make this status official.    And what is this public radio and television? First and  foremost, it is an entity independent of government structures,  and this independence is guaranteed by law. The government  neither approves nor dismisses the administrative leadership  running radio and television. This leadership tries to work in a  way that satisfies the public interest and it is accountable to  a collective body composed of representatives from all segments  of society and various political forces, representatives who are  elected in accordance with the law and without any interference  by the government.    But most important is the fact that public radio and  television is nowhere financed out of a government's budget. In  most European countries, the funds are accumulated from  subscriber fees and advertising. I doubt that this method of  financing would be acceptable for Lithuania, given its difficult  economic situation. Supplemental taxes (20-25 litas per month  for a family) would be difficult to bear for our people, which  is why we are suggesting that we take advantage of the  experience of Turkey, Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, and other countries  whose economies were quite unstable just a short time ago. In  those countries, the budget of the national public radio and  television is composed of direct and legally defined deductions  from revenues received for electrical energy. An individual  family scarcely notices such taxes, and the radio and television  have a stable budget that is independent of inflation and allows  them to plan at least a few years in advance without worrying  about the whims of this government or that.    In its "Signs of the Times" column on 2 January 1993,  LIETUVOS RYTAS asks whether public status "would help improve  the quality of broadcasts on Lithuanian television?" I am not so  naive that I would immediately rush to respond: "yes!" With the  Lithuanian cinema and theater dying, in view of the fact that  literature, music, and art are going through a crisis, and with  envy, anger, and intolerance having spread out into society, it  is hard to imagine that the day after its change in status,  radio and television would begin to shine with sublime,  inspired, and interesting broadcasts... That's not the way  things are, that's not the way things can be. Our radio and  television are as we ourselves are. And still, in preparing a  program, if we wouldn't have to keep one eye out for the  government, if we would have enough technical equipment, if we  could afford to pay the actor or the writer who was invited to  be on the broadcast a decent fee, and not a miserable 3-4 litas,  then it would be possible to demand a different quality of  broadcast. In this regard, a public status for Lithuanian radio  and television could really help quite a bit.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades Sanwa Bank ratings MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded long-term debt ratings of Sanwa Bank, a leading Japanese bank, to Aa3 from Aa1. The ratings of Sanwa's subsidiaries were also lowered to Aa3. The agency attributed the downgrade to the bank's asset quality and contingent risks associated with affiliates, especially non-bank financial institutions. The move follows other recent downgrades of Japanese banks by rating agencies. Currently, there are no banks with Aaa ratings, three banks with Aa1, two with Aa2, and six with Aa3. Japanese banks, which expanded rapidly under easy monetary conditions of the late 1980s, now face deteriorating loans and increasing bankruptcies due to the fall in land prices and the stock market slump. Most Japanese banks were hurt by last year's spate of financial scandals, caused by loose credit controls and reckless lending.</p>

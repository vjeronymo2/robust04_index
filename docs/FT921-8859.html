			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: McCaw Cellular cuts deficit McCAW CELLULAR, the leading US company in the fast-growing US cellular telephone market and owner of a 52 per cent stake in LIN Broadcasting, yesterday turned in a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 125.3m, or 71 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 148.8m, or 86 cents, in the same period of the previous year. Although the company posted income from operations in both years, the cost of servicing its extraordinarily high debt has kept McCaw firmly mired in the red. Analysts do not expect McCaw to post profits before 1994. In the 1991 quarter, McCaw had income from operations of Dollars 35.5m, while its interest expense was Dollars 132.8m. A year earlier, income from operations stood at Dollars 17.5m, while interest expense was Dollars 155.7m. Revenues in the quarter attributed to McCaw's proportionate interest in cellular operations increased 33 per cent to Dollars 266.2m from Dollars 200.1m. The company said its proportionate cash-flow increased 46 per cent to Dollars 104m, while proportionate subscribes grew by 94,000. For the year, McCaw had a net loss of Dollars 351.1m, or Dollars 2.04, against income of Dollars 562.3m, or Dollars 2.97 a share. The 1990 results included a gain of Dollars 1.17bn from the sale of assets. There was a one-time gain of about Dollars 243m in 1991. Revenues rose to Dollars 1.37bn in the year from Dollars 1.04bn. The company had operating income of Dollars 116m in 1991 against Dollars 48.4m previously. Interest costs rose to Dollars 578m from Dollars 496.6m. On Wall Street, shares in McCaw fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 34. Shares in LIN dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 76. LIN, which holds interest in the cellular systems in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, turned in a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 37.4m, or 73 cents, against a loss of Dollars 54.4m, or Dollars 1.06, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 133.5m from Dollars 106m. LIN had a full-year net loss of Dollars 170.2m, or Dollars 3.31, on revenues of Dollars 468.1m, against a deficit of Dollars 222.8m, or Dollars 4.33, on revenues of Dollars 378.1m in 1990. McCaw said the number of cellular subscribers in McCaw and LIN's markets increased 42 per cent to 1.64m.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Andreotti inquiry told of link with Mafia killings MR Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy, yesterday began what could be the toughest battle of his long political career as hearings began into lifting his parliamentary immunity. The Senate hearings opened amid explosive new allegations of collusion by Mr Andreotti, now a Christian Democrat life senator, with the Mafia. Implicit in the allegations is that he was involved in two political assassinations. New testimony from Mafia informants, revealed by the Senate yesterday, includes details of three alleged meetings between Mr Andreotti and senior Mafia figures in the 1970s. The informants also allege that two assassinations attributed to the Mafia were carried out on political instructions from Mr Andreotti. The murder in 1979 of Mr Mino Pecorelli, a right-wing journalist with links to the secret services, and that of General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa in 1982, the senior Mafia-fighter sent to Palermo, allegedly took place because both were privy to sensitive information regarding the earlier kidnap and assassination of former prime minister Aldo Moro. The request to lift the immunity of Mr Andreotti was made last month by Palermo magistrates investigating organised crime. This week the magistrates supplied additional information to support their request after new interrogations of Mr Tommaso Buscetta and Mr Francesco Marino Mannoia, the two Mafia informants now under protection in the US. The two collaborators, who had until recently refused to talk about links between politicians and crime, also claimed that Mr Salvatore Lima, the senior Christian Democrat politician in Sicily and member of the European parliament, liaised with the Mafia on behalf of the Christian Democrats. Mr Lima, murdered in March 1992, was a close friend of Mr Andreotti and his main aide in Sicily. It has long been rumoured that his assassination was to show the Mafia's displeasure with the growing unwillingness of senior politicians in Rome to comply with its wishes. Mr Giovanni Pellegrino, chairman of the Senate committee, reacted cautiously to reports that the new testimony could require the re-opening of investigations into the assassinations. The new material could be 'an advance warning of other requests for immunity to be lifted on the part of other magistrates,' he said. Unconfirmed press reports yesterday said details of the new testimony, collected by Mr Giancarlo Caselli, the chief public prosecutor in Palermo, had been sent to Rome magistrates responsible for investigating the Moro assassination and the murder of Mr Pecorelli. Mr Andreotti has presented the 23-man Senate committee with a 66-page document defending his position. The document casts doubt on the points raised in the magistrates' allegations. It accuses the magistrates of persecution, attacks their stand on procedural grounds and casts doubt on the motives of the Mafia informants. The former prime minister has faced down 26 previous attempts to have his parliamentary immunity lifted on a variety of grounds. Rome magistrates investigating allegations of corruption in aid to developing countries issued a cautionary warrant against Mr Ferdinando Mach di Palmstein, a financier associated with the Socialist party. It alleges he was involved in extortion in connection with aid to Senegal, Argentina and unspecified other countries. Separately, Mr Vito Bonsignore, a Christian Democrat junior minister in the budget ministry, has said he will resign next week. Mr Bonsignore has been told by magistrates he is under investigation.</p>

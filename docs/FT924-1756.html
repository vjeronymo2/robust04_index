			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Time to use force in Bosnia AS MINISTERS gather again in Geneva to discuss the former Yugoslavia, the pressure for stronger external intervention is growing. Today's meeting is technically not a new conference but a meeting at ministerial level of the steering committee of the existing international conference, which met in London last August. That meeting was proclaimed a success, because a number of agreements were reached. But those agreements have not been honoured. The war in Bosnia has continued. So has the odious process of 'ethnic cleansing'. British and other European forces have been deployed in a humanitarian role, and have had some success in getting supplies to the more remote Moslem towns and villages which are still holding out. But as the carnage continues, the inadequacy of these operations is more and more painfully apparent to those involved in them, and to the world in general. The airlifts and convoys are constantly obstructed and sporadically fired on, usually by Bosnian Serb forces. The supplies which do get through, of food, fuel and especially medical equipment, fall far short of what the population needs to survive the winter. Above all, the shelling of Sarajevo and other populated areas continues remorselessly. The humanitarian operations are, at best, saving people from cold and starvation so that they can be killed by mortar fire. That being so, today's meeting will be a waste of time if it contents itself with obtaining yet more Serb signatures to yet more meaningless agreements. It must be used, by those who genuinely wish to help Bosnia, as the occasion for drawing up a plan of action; and it is no longer any use pretending that action will be effective without any military component. The proposal to enforce the no-fly zone is welcome insofar as it at least attempts to restore some credibility to UN Security Council resolutions. But it will achieve little if it used simply to punish the Serbs, without clear political and military objectives. The ultimate political objective must remain the restoration of peace throughout the republic, with the right of all its citizens to return to their homes in safety, and the obligation of those who have destroyed property to rebuild it. But that objective cannot be secured purely by military means. The military objective, rather, must be to secure enough territory to form a 'safe haven' for those Bosnians, Moslem and otherwise, who recognise the authority of the elected government and reject that of Mr Radovan Karadzic's ill-disciplined militia - thus enabling them to enter negotiations on a stronger footing than is possible at present. The UN's next task should be to delineate such an area, and issue an ultimatum to Serb forces to withdraw from it. If the danger of reprisal against existing UN forces is held to inhibit such action, as British ministers have been arguing in recent days, then those forces should be reinforced and/or withdrawn to more defensible positions.</p>

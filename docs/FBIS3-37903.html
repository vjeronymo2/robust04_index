			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 23 February -- The decision of the State  Duma on granting amnesty to the members of the SCSE [State  Committee for the State of Emergency] and those involved in the  October 1993 events is a challenge to Russian democracy. The  feelings of the millions of Russians who defended democracy in  August 1991 and in October 1993 have been trampled on. In  initiating the adoption of this decision the Communists and  supporters of Zhirinovskiy displayed a total unity of aims of  getting into power by a destabilization of the situation. This  is said in a statement issued by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the  Russian president's press secretary.    There is no doubt that this decision will harm cooperation  between the branches of power and the very idea of law and order  because it elevates a resolution of the issue of the guilt of  those involved in both coups from the legal to the political  sphere. This decision is of a purely political nature -- it was  adopted hastily, without taking the account of public opinion  and without a preliminary research into the legal foundations  for adopting and implementing such serious decisions.    At the time when the Russian president is taking decisive  steps to reaffirm Russia's prestige and dignity in the world,  the State Duma is making decisions which will lead to  destabilization, and consequently, to the weakening of Russia.  This path is dangerous and it goes against national interests.  All the responsibility for the consequences of the adopted  decision lies with the State Duma, and with those who initiated  and carried out this action, the statement of the Russian  president's press secretary says.</p>

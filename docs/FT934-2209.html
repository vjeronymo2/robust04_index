			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Terror reinsurer collects Pounds 100m Pool Re, the specialist terrorist damage reinsurer set up after commercial insurers withdrew from the market, has collected more than Pounds 100m in premiums, it emerged yesterday. More than 159 insurers have been admitted to the scheme and a further 75 applications could be accepted by the end of the year, the company said. The apparent success of the new arrangement comes after earlier threats by insurers that they would refuse to support it. It also suggests that the government's contribution as a backstop on claims for terrorist damage that Pool Re cannot support will be minimal. Insurers expressed concerns in the summer about the structure of Pool Re, and over a lack of consultation with the sector by the DTI. Mr Keith Loney, company secretary, said that Pool Re now had Pounds 100m invested. Substantial additional amounts would be provided by insurers by early in the new year. He said Pool Re had so far paid out only Pounds 29m on claims relating to the Bishopsgate bomb in April. He estimated the total could be Pounds 300m. Pool Re also expects claims from the Bournemouth bombing in August of about Pounds 2m. The first set of accounts for the company will not be published until spring, but Mr Loney said its annual administrative costs were less than Pounds 1m. Pool Re last increased its premiums - which are passed on at the same rate by the insurers to policyholders - in July. Mr Loney said Commercial insurers would absorb the first Pounds 100,000 in claims before Pool Re paid out. The NatWest Tower in the City of London, damaged by an IRA bomb in April this year, is to be refurbished next year.</p>

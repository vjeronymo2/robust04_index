			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMPHITHEATER FACES MORE SOUND TESTS  </P> <P> Recordings suggest that the April 7 Alabama concert at the Pacific Amphitheatre  may have exceeded some recommended noise levels, but officials stressed that  more tests will be needed to see whether the new sound system installed there  to help reduce noise can indeed help solve a prolonged dispute.  </P> <P> With that in mind, Superior Court Judge Richard J. Beacom Friday ordered that  the county continue to monitor the sound levels at the Costa Mesa arena at  least through June 30, when attorneys for all sides in the dispute are to  report back to him with more data.  </P> <P> "It's really just too early to tell what kinds of sound levels we're talking  about. These things take time," said Ellwyn Brickson, a noise control  specialist with the county Environmental Health Division, after the session  with Beacom and the lawyers.  </P> <P> Last weekend's concert by the country-rock band Alabama was the first time the  new digital sound system at the arena, provided through arena operators and  intended to do a better job of confining noise, was used. However, the band  used some of its own audio equipment as well, according to Richard L. Spix, an  attorney for a group of Costa Mesa residents who have been trying for 6 years  to have the noise from concerts at the arena reduced.  </P> <P> Preliminary readings indicate that the effect was mixed, county officials said.  In a letter to Beacom dated April 12, county environmental health chief Robert  E. Merryman said that for most of the 2-hour concert, the noise levels recorded  exceeded recommended limits as measured at the berm within the amphitheater.  Merryman said noise from a nearby motorcycle race on the night of the concert  made obtaining an accurate sound reading difficult.  </P></p>

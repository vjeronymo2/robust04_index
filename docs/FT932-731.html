			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Fashion: Let's hear it for hats - Jane Mulvagh shuns shades SUNGLASSES are a sure sign that the temperature and human alienation are soaring. Armies of eyeless aliens hidden behind shatter-proof, glare-proof and people-proof glass suddenly hit the city streets. Do you feel cut off from human response when struggling to communicate with someone whose eyes, the window to the soul, are curtained from you? Have they noticed you? Are they listening? Are you boring them? Have they lost their heart to you? Have they a heart at all? Sunglasses simply strike me as bad manners. So, why not headwear instead? After all, England is the home of the hat. You might argue that sunglasses are practical and glamorous. Well, not entirely. How many pairs have you lost? And is it really so glamorous to look like everyone else, a pale imitation of a Hollywood star feigning privacy behind such an attention-seeking fashion statement? Let's bring a human face back to fashion and top it with a titfer. Trimmed or untrimmed, the bigger the hat, the better. But you have to be shy to wear one. Shy? Let Philip Treacy, a fashionable London milliner, explain: 'Lots of my customers wear a hat if they are going to a big event and they feel nervous. Yet nobody would know they were shy as they have this aesthetically pleasing thing attached to them.' A hat can not only counter shyness but can do wonders for a poor complexion. We have all suffered days when even a trowel's worth of make-up fails to cover a bad skin. Try a shading and disguising hat instead and if things are really bad, a polka dot veil should do the trick] A hat can replace an umbrella and you are far less likely to leave it behind. The Archbishop of Canterbury found his hat a useful storage spot when crowning George IV in 1821. When the monarch staggered up the aisle weighed down by his heavily-emdroidered mantle on that steaming June day, he had used more than 20 silk handkerchiefs to mop his royal brow. He handed the sodden mass to the Archbishop who promptly popped them under his mitre. Hats can be economical. One smart dress or suit can be transformed by using a variety of hats. The hat has had a hard time ever since the majority of children stopped wearing them to school. The 1960s generation dropped them in favour of hair-dos. Now, in typical defiance of their parents, today's young love hats. In America they are the rage. Saks on Fifth Avenue, New York, has recorded a 300 per cent increase in millinery sales during the past year.</p>

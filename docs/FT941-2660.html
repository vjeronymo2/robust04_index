			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysian affair - insensitivity and mistaken beliefs (3) Sir, Your leader, 'Malaysian moves' (March 18), accuses that country's government of attempting to rein in the freedom of the British press. There is a mistaken belief nurtured by the western media that any reporting against the government of the day of former colonies goes down well with the natives. Alas, were it so simple. While welcoming any freedom of expression, the public of such countries also recalls the disdain which was shown by the same western media during their freedom struggle and their cynicism is only heightened by actions such as Star TV's desire to abandon the BBC World Service television news to China in its higher commercial interest ('Murdoch plans to axe BBC news from China satellite service', March 18). On top of the British media tolerating such double standards, your suggestion to invoke an appeal to the EU and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to teach Malaysia a lesson belittles the traditions of a once great trading nation. For it is about trade is it not? Sikander Latif, 72 Kingston House South, Ennismore Garden, London SW7 1NG</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Results could give share prices a boost - New York The second-quarter corporate results season opens in earnest this week and investors await news of company earnings with the usual mixture of hope and trepidation. Judging by recent buying patterns, however, some investors believe good earnings are around the corner. If they are right, share prices will receive a much-needed boost at a time when the Federal Reserve could be poised to sanction another demand-sapping increase in interest rates. The highest hopes for strong second-quarter earnings have focused on the big industrial companies whose profits are tied closely to the movements of the economic cycle. Because of recent evidence (including last week's June employment report) pointing to a more expansionary second-quarter economy than expected, investors have been buying up cyclical stocks in the past few days. Motor vehicle manufacturers have been especially buoyant lately, cheered by forecasts from analysts of quarterly earnings that could be double those seen a year ago. Wall Street is bullish on the sector because it believes improved North American sales and a sustained focus on cost-cutting will have combined to produce significantly improved profits. Two other sectors likely to have benefited from the strong pace of economic growth are long-distance telecommunications and rail transportation. Analysts predict that at the major phone companies, overall calling volumes will have grown about 9 per cent in the quarter. The big railroad companies have also been reaping the benefits of a healthy economy, with rising freight-rail traffic boosting revenue growth. The news is unlikely to be so positive in the financial sector, primarily because in an environment of rising interest rates, the earnings of banks and securities brokerages almost always suffer. Securities firms, in particular, are likely to be reporting sharply lower second-quarter earnings than a year ago, when the lowest interest rates in 30 years were fuelling an unprecedented boom in Wall Street profits. In the commercial banking industry, earnings growth, which has been on a steadily upward path for the past two years, is unlikely to show as sharp a retraction as in the securities industry. However, some sort of slowdown is expected, particularly at the big money-centre banks which are also active traders in the financial markets. Overall, the outlook for corporate profits remains bright. The only question this week is whether investors will be able to focus on earnings with the threat of another interest rate increase hanging over their heads.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Union Carbide and Mitsubishi sell joint venture for Dollars 1.1bn Union Carbide of the US and Mitsubishi of Japan are to sell UCAR, their jointly-owned graphite electrodes business, to the New York investment group Blackstone in a deal valuing it at Dollars 1.1bn. Union Carbide will retain a 25 per cent holding. UCAR is the world's biggest maker of graphite and carbon electrodes, used in steelmaking. Sales last year were Dollars 770m. The deal values UCAR's equity at Dollars 820m, and Blackstone will also assume debt of around Dollars 190m. This replaces the planned flotation of around 44 per cent of UCAR announced last month. Union Carbide will receive Dollars 347m, resulting in a significant capital gain, the company said. Mitsubishi, which bought a half share in UCAR in 1991, will receive Dollars 406m for its entire holding. Mitsubishi said this would result in a profit of Y17.6bn (Pounds 113m) over book value. Union Carbide said the sale effectively completed a programme of disposals begun in 1991, designed to return the group to its core activities in chemicals and plastics. At the time, the group said it aimed to realise Dollars 500m from the sale of non-strategic assets. The target was reached last year with the Dollars 300m disposal of its organosilicon business, OSI Specialties. The company has also spun off its industrial gases subsidiary. It is understood that the flotation plan was shelved because Blackstone offered a higher price. It is also believed that Mitsubishi decided to sell out because it was reluctant to hold a minority position. The company was not available for comment. Mr Stephen Schwarzman, president and chief executive of Blackstone, said the equity investment in the buy-out would be Dollars 250m, with 75 per cent supplied by his firm and 25 per cent by Union Carbide. A particular attraction of the deal, he said, was that UCAR's products are used particularly in the fast-growing mini-mill sector of the steel industry, which is little affected by recession. The total cost of the transaction, including fees and overseas taxes, would be approximately Dollars 1.2bn, Mr Schwarzman said. Of that, Dollars 950m would be funded by debt and Dollars 250m by equity. Close to Dollars 200m of the equity would be put in by Blackstone with the remainder coming from Union Carbide. In addition, he said, two-thirds of UCAR's sales are outside the US. 'We think that as Europe comes out of recession, we'll get the benefit of exposure there', he said. Mr Schwarzman added that UCAR could be floated publicly within the next year or two.</p>

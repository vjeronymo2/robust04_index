			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Rosehaugh The chances of a Rosehaugh/Stanhope merger were always limited, given the complexity of their corporate structures and the difficulty of getting two sets of shareholders and three groups of bankers to agree on anything. Even so, last night's announcement that the talks have finally been called off creates a rather unnerving vacuum. One must assume that the trouble in the negotiations lay principally in persuading Stanhope's bankers to take on the Rosehaugh rump, consisting of its assets minus the 50 per cent stake in the RSD joint venture. Conspiracy theory says that Stanhope would be happy for Rosehaugh to be put into liquidation, thereby allowing it to achieve full control of RSD by the back door. Such an idea hardly seems plausible. Stanhope's balance sheet and profit and loss account could not stand the pressure, while a capital-raising exercise would be out of all proportion to the size of the company. The theory also assumes the banks will pull the plug on Rosehaugh when the standstill agreement expires at the end of next week. Whatever yesterday's news may have done for sentiment, such a solution would serve little purpose. An orderly liquidation of Rosehaugh assets is effectively under way. Formalising the procedure would only precipitate bigger write-downs for the banks and further destabilise a still fragile property market.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / The week ahead Results due LUCAS Industries, the UK-based engineering group, should produce a trading profit of Pounds 20m when it announces preliminary profits today before an exceptional gain of Pounds 90m from its pension fund refund. The group is, however, expected to announce exceptional restructuring provisions of Pounds 60m. The group should maintain its dividend. Body Shop International will try tomorrow to repair some of the damage done to its share price by last month's profits warning. Bringing to an abrupt halt a record of unbroken profits growth, the cosmetics retailer said interim pre-tax profits would be not less than Pounds 8m (Pounds 9.1m) and the 0.68p dividend would be maintained. The shares fell 108p to 158p on the news and so far have only recovered to 170p. Investors will be anxious to hear how UK sales are going. Body Shop said last month that some store sales were down between 3 and 5 per cent over the past three months. Who will end up as owner of Mirror Group Newspapers remains unresolved nearly a year after the death of Robert Maxwell but the business is still performing well. Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 18m for the half year. When the results are announced tomorrow all the signs are that the actual performance will be at the upper end of the range. Highland Distilleries, maker of The Famous Grouse, the second best-selling Scotch whisky in the UK, is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits today virtually unchanged from last year's Pounds 28m. Famous Grouse, which suffered from the 12 per cent decline in the UK market in the first half, may have benefited since then from price increases and a gain in market share. Export growth is likely to have been modest, however, and sales of new whisky fillings have been hit by lower demand and softer prices. Lloyds Chemists, the second-largest chain of retail chemists after Boots, is expected to report on Thursday pre-tax profits for the year to June of about Pounds 35m. The rise from Pounds 20.8m a year earlier reflects in large part the group's ambitious acquisitions programme. Attwoods, the international waste management company, is likely to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 41m on Friday, a sharp drop in earnings after last October's heavily discounted rights issue. Business is slow in its south-eastern US market. DIVIDEND &amp; INTEREST PAYMENTS TODAY Border TV 1.6p Bradford &amp; Bingley Bldg. Soc. Fltg. Rate Nts. 1997 Pounds 260.49 Britannia Bldg. Soc. Fltg.

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA TO LOOK AT 'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS' FOR ARTS-GRANT VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa City Council has asked the City Attorney's Office to determine  whether the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse has violated terms of its city arts  grant with a staging of Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It  All for You."  </P> <P> The action is the first test of controversial arts-grant guidelines forbidding  use of city funds for obscenity or "religious or political activity," adopted  in July.  </P> <P> Local residents, led by John and Ernie Feeney, have branded the play  "anti-religious bigotry" and charge that it violates restrictions against  religious activity. Ernie Feeney has said she hoped to see the play canceled,  but the matter will not come before the city council until Oct. 1, one day  after the play is scheduled to end its run.  </P> <P> The Feeneys' previous objections about a pro-NEA flyer issued by South Coast  Repertory in Costa Mesa led to the adoption of the restrictions attached to all  city arts grants.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the playhouse board of directors issued a defense of the production.  "Satire is not a crime and free speech is not a felony," the statement reads in  part. "It is not our duty to tread so lightly as to avoid offending everyone,  and we are not sorry we selected (the play)."  </P> <P> David Sharp, co-producer of the play and a playhouse board member, said  Wednesday that "the phone is ringing off the hook" with ticket requests, but  there is little chance the run will be extended.

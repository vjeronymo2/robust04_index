			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Every Government Unit Needed To </F> Battle AIDS"]    [Excerpt] Dr. Wichai Chaichitwanitkun, an MP  from Udon Thani of the New Aspiration Party spoke to reporters  as Vice-chairman of the Public Health Commission. He said that  at the meeting of those involved with AIDS from the Ministry of  Public Health, the National Committee for AIDS Prevention, the  National Assembly, and experts in AIDS it was learned that the  actual figure for those with the AIDS virus throughout the  country was about 600,000 people. Areas with a high incidence  were the North and Bangkok. Little was found in the Northeast,  the South and the East. If one person in 100 had AIDS, it would  be considered very serious.    Dr. Wichai also said that in 5 to 6 years there would be  300,000 people with the complete AIDS symptoms. At present the  Ministry of Public Health and private institutions had 90,000  beds for patients. How would these patients be cared for? The  Ministry of Public Health would have to find new ways to care  for both AIDS patients and ordinary patients. How could they  both be dealt with? What he was worried about was how to get the  Thai people throughout the country to refrain from spreading the  disease, especially in regard to the use of prostitutes.  Prostitutes were the most serious cause of the spread of AIDS,  accounting for 90 percent of the cases. Children contracting the  virus from their mothers accounted for 5 percent of the cases.  The rest involved drug addiction and hypodermic needles, but the  percentage was small. [passage omitted]    He said that the statistics for those dying from AIDS now  was  one and one-half per day. The situation was considered to be  very serious especially in some provinces of the North such as  Chiang Mai Province, Chiang Rai Province and Lampang Province  where one person per day was dying. He wanted those who did not  have the AIDS virus to see people suffering from AIDS. Then they  would know how bad it was for these patients just to lay down  and wait to die, and how much the patients suffered in the 3 to  4 years it took to die. Government units in every ministry,  bureau, department; University students; secondary students; and  primary students would have to help in the battle to make the  people realize the danger of AIDS and stop thinking that it was  not important.</p>

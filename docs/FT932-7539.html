			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Fashion: Under cover, the Mac factor - Raincoats add character to a wardrobe. So where do you shop if you want to put something away for a rainy day? OF ALL the clothes in a man's wardrobe it is perhaps the old raincoat that has the most character, loved like a friend, there when needed to protect from the vicissitudes of the English weather. Even when it is too old to be worn in polite society it can be relegated to the hallstand - raincoats are rarely thrown away - ready to offer itself to anyone needing to venture out when grey clouds threaten and dogs need to be walked or roses pruned. The pockets usually hide some old treasure - a sweet paper, a foreign coin, last year's withered conker. Raincoats are the ultimate 'investment clothing', but wearing one in town was once considered ungentlemanly - a gentleman had no need of a raincoat as there was always an obliging manservant to hold an umbrella as he walked from club or home to cab or carriage. When the time comes to send your raincoat to the jumble sale, where do you go to find a new one and what do you look for? Obviously it should be at least showerproof, perhaps even fully waterproof, and lightweight  - remember that temperatures often rise during rain. Choose one that covers the knees for, although knee-length raincoats have a certain style, damp knees do not. Most raincoats are cut with a Raglan sleeve making them easy to put on over a suit. A Raglan sleeve is one that goes over the shoulder in one piece joining the coat at the collar seam. There is no lack of choice and if you want to be overwhelmed by variety (and choice) then visit Harrods, where you will find both the classics and the fashionable, including some in unusual colours by Hugo Boss: viridian, red, bright blue and a dullish lime green. If you want to choose from a narrower range head straight for the classics and visit either Burberry or Aquascutum. They both produce quality coats, retaining the best of the old but introducing new styles, colours and fabrics. Aquascutum's Nelson raincoat, available in beige, navy and light brown, is near perfection. The only flaw is the collar, which I would prefer slightly smaller. Another classic is the Felton Broc at Pounds 575. If your budget does not run to that then visit Marks &amp; Spencer for a reasonably priced alternative, which lacks none of the style or detailing of more expensive clothes. There is no reason why fashionable raincoats should be any less showerproof than their classic counterpart and if you are given any lame excuses such as: 'It's a fashion item' then my advice is to put your credit card back in its wallet and leave the store] Emporio Armani's grey proof raincoat seems more than capable of withstanding any sudden downpour and Issey Miyake's at Pounds 365 (available at Issey Miyake and Liberty) makes a perfect coat to travel with as it is so lightweight. Dries Van Noten, a Belgian designer, is one of the chosen at Joseph, his linen-coated off-white raincoat, though perhaps not entirely practical for commuting, will certainly make you the most stylish man in a spring shower. No gentleman should be without an umbrella, although I am always suspicious of the owners of collapsible ones, who self-righteously produce them from a brief case during an unexpected shower while you get drenched. You can buy an umbrella almost anywhere but why bother when you could buy from James Smith, one of the most glorious shops in London. It was founded in the 1830s and is still family-owned. It has preserved the past yet it serves the present. There seem to be scores of umbrellas to choose from and the charming staff are only too willing to help you find the umbrella to suit your needs.</p>

Oreb: "Zagreb News Conference by Croatian </F> Electric Power Industry: Dalmatia Without Electric Woes"]    [Text] Work on completing the 110-kilovolt "island  link" through Melina-Krk-Rab-Pag to Zadar is progressing  according to plan, and completion of the so-called zero phase is  expected in July; construction of the thermoelectric power plant  in Dujmovaca, near Split, is also on schedule, and the first  generator, with 26 megawatts of power, will be synchronized to  the network on the 17th of this month.    Zagreb--Extensive work is expected in Dalmatia and Istria on  reviving and reconstructing the electric power network, which is  both in ruins and in disrepair. This was noted at a press  conference by the Croatian Electric Power Industry [HEP], at  which a new program for revitalizing electric power  installations in the coastal region of Croatia was presented.  The "Plan to Develop the Electric Power Network of Underwater  Cables of the Adriatic Islands" provides for an investment of  126,234,875 German marks [DM] over the coming six-month period  to replace damaged electric power links among the Adriatic  islands, and to lay new ones. On the list of priorities are  35-kilovolt cables between Peljesac and Korcula, Peljesac and  Mljet, Korcula and Lastovo, Vis and Hvar, Brac and Solta, Zadar  and Dugi Otok, and Losinj and Silba, together with a  35/10-kilovolt Losinj 2 transformer station; there are also  plans to overhaul the electric supply system in the part of  Split-Dalmatia Zupanija that is the farthest behind in  development (Vis, Solta, and Drvenik Veliki). Discussing the  work of the electric power system in Dalmatia, which is still  part of the "island regime," HEP general director Eng. Damir  Begovic emphasized that electric power links in the south of the  country are in extremely poor condition due to poor maintenance  and inadequate investment, and that the presented reconstruction  program is the basis for developing the tourist economy. Eng.  Begovic informed the journalists that negotiations are under way  on acquiring the first equipment necessary to begin revitalizing  the medium-voltage network on the islands, in which DM14 million  will be invested. It is expected that a contract with the German  suppliers, under the "sponsorship" of the HERMES underwriter,  will be signed in April of this year.    Discussing the current electric power situation in the  country, Eng. Begovic said that despite the division in the  electric power systems of southern and northern Croatia, there  will be no major problems in supplying electric power. A  reliable supply of electricity in Dalmatia is guaranteed by the  120 megawatts of installed output at diesel and gas plants set  up as intervention measures. Work on completing the 110-kilovolt  "island link" through Melina-Krk-Rab-Pag to Zadar is progressing  according to plan, and completion of the so-called zero phase is  expected in July of this year. Construction of the  thermoelectric power plant in Dujmovaca, near Split, is also on  schedule, and the first generator, with 26 megawatts of power,  will be synchronized to the network on the 17th of this month.    Because of the war and the shortage of investment resources,  the electric power situation in the rest of Croatia, especially  in Slavonia, also requires intervention. Electric power  installations are in disrepair, so that the HEP is missing out  on 200 megawatts of output because there is no money for maximum  utilization of the existing systems. The HEP has indicated that  it will be forced to continually import electric power from  Western European countries until it is possible to invest in  repairs to the "Rijeka" and "Plomin I" thermoelectric plants and  to other important electric power installations. Moreover, the  financial situation at HEP is burdened by old debts "worth"  DM200 million. On the other hand, demand by debtors, especially  industries that are unable to pay existing debts for the supply  of electric power, are continually on the rise and currently  amount to around DM170 million. Of that amount, DM20 million is  owed by health care institutions, waterworks, and other  protected consumers. The worst situation is in Dalmatia, which  because of its isolation in terms of trade and energy is in a  very difficult position, so that problems with recovering debts  are also great.    The journalists were also informed of the beginning of the  HEP transformation process, which will take place gradually and  is expected to take five years. It is expected that the HEP will  be privatized based on the "Ina" [Petroleum Refining and Sales  Enterprise] model, while it is expected that this public  enterprise will be listed as a joint-stock company in June of  this year. One of the principles for restructuring the HEP,  which is being conducted by the Office of the Government of the  Republic of Croatia for the Economy and the Restructuring of  Public Enterprises, is consideration for the zupanija structure.</p>

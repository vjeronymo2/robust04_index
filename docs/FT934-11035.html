			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Arbitrageur barred after Pounds 1.7m loss at Kleinwort A DEALER at Kleinwort Benson who had incurred heavy personal losses at a financial bookmaker and subsequently lost Pounds 1.7m of his firm's money has been banned indefinitely from the securities business by the City's investment watchdog. This is the first time the self-regulatory Securities and Futures Authority has taken such action. The SFA refused to disclose the name of the firm, but merchant bank Kleinwort last night confirmed it had employed the dealer and suffered the loss. The arbitrage dealer, Mr Kevin Reed Morgan, had repeatedly taken on far more risk than he was allowed when employed by two separate investment banks between July 1991 and March 1993, the SFA said. Arbitrage dealers try to exploit the differences between different markets and financial instruments. Mr Morgan began increasing his risk after incurring heavy losses in 1990 on his personal account at a firm of financial bookmakers. Financial bookmakers allow individuals to bet on a stock market index, such as the FT-SE 100, or on a bond contract in the same way that bets are laid on sporting events. According to the SFA, in July 1991, Mr Morgan, who had worked successfully as a derivatives arbitrageur in a large City investment bank, joined a new firm. In the 10 days he was employed there, he heavily exceeded his position limits, three times causing small losses to the bank. The last occasion came after he had received a written warning. He was dismissed and the incident reported to the SFA. After being asked to resign, the SFA said, Mr Morgan sought to pay off the debt to the financial bookmaker but some of his cheques bounced. He was served with a bankruptcy petition in November 1992 and was ad-judged bankrupt with debts of over Pounds 300,000 in April 1993 - two months after joining another City firm, which had been told of his earlier dismissal. Mr Morgan, the SFA said, did not tell this firm of his financial position. In a three-hour period one day in March 1993 he exposed his firm to Dollars 400m of risk in US government bond interest rate futures though he had agreed to have no more than Dollars 5m of risk at one time. Mr Morgan misjudged the direction of US interest rates, costing his employer Pounds 1.7m. The SFA said Mr Morgan had not been permanently barred from the industry but 'in the medium term there's no hope of him obtaining authorisation'. 'The SFA takes a particularly serious view of Mr Morgan's conduct in view of the risk to which he exposed his firm and has reminded SFA members that they should be aware of any personal account dealing that their employees undertake with other brokers,' the SFA said. Last night Kleinwort said it had reviewed its procedures following the incident.</p>

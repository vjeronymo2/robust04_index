			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Money Markets: 6 percent forever CHEAPER day-to-day funds in the sterling interbank market continued to force slight reductions in short-dated interest rates yesterday, writes James Blitz. However, dealers in both the cash and futures markets ended the week in the same frame of mind as they had been at the start of it: deeply uncertain whether base rates are going up or down. With both the June and September short sterling contracts closing at 94.00 last night, the market was effectively saying that 6 per cent base rates are here until late autumn. That view matched the position in the cash market, where 3-month money closed at 5 15/16 per cent, helped by the speedy removal of a Pounds 1.7bn shortage. Base rates could be reduced again before the year is out. There have been net reductions in the number of people out of work in the last two months, but there is some uncertainty over whether these figures reflect an underlying trend. Moreover, if sterling continues to strengthen on the foreign exchanges, the government might come under pressure to reduce rates to help export growth and stimulate the recovery. But the prospect of a rise in rates is also being discussed across the market. The government may be able to keep inflation just about within its 1-4 per cent target band this year, but the chances of it getting back to the bottom half of the target band by the end of this parliament are not good. The awful truth for dealers may be that 6 per cent base rates are unchanged for a long time. Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist of Goldman Sachs, has published a chart predicting that 3 month LIBOR will be unchanged between now and the middle of 1994. Mr Davies believes that base rates could rise if there were any depreciation in sterling because of adverse trade figures. But he also thinks that a tightening of monetary policy would increase the savings ratio, something that could critically hamper the recovery. In his view, real personal disposable income will remain quite sluggish for some time because of house price falls and the threat of tax rises. A drop in the savings ratio is therefore a critical element in the country's emergence from recession.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / S African all-race poll date proposed SOUTH AFRICAN politicians yesterday recommended a date next April for the first all-race elections, but said the date must be confirmed in multi-party talks later this month. They named April 27, 1994, as the date for elections to a constituent assembly and interim legislature - the first time a specific date has been mentioned - but attached so many conditions to it that the date remains largely symbolic. The 26-party negotiating forum was unable to reach full agreement even on a conditional resolution setting a date, with four delegations rejecting the resolution. They were the KwaZulu government, speaking on behalf of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, along with the ultra-right Conservative Party, the moderate-right Afrikaner Volksunie and the black homeland of Ciskei. But Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the African National Congress, claimed a strategic victory nonetheless: 'Setting the 27th of April as an election date will reverberate throughout the country. Even those opposed to confirming it will find it impossible to move the masses of our people away from this date,' he told reporters after a 10-hour negotiating session. Mr Ramaphosa and his ANC colleague, Mr Joe Slovo, who represents the South African Communist Party in the talks, were obviously keen to set a date, however provisional, before next week's meeting of the ANC national executive. Yesterday's announcement of a provisional date could have major psychological implications. The negotiators' resolution said it would 'send a ray of hope and optimism' to South Africans, desperate for any sign of a political solution which could restore stability. Even if the date is agreed, no elections can be held until the parties agree on an interim constitution.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Books: Modern day fairytale hits stormy weather - Fiction INDIGO by Marina Warner Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 402 pages AS YEATS said, works of art beget works of art. All literature builds on what has gone before, but a specifically and self-consciously derivative tradition has yielded in recent years some of our most original drama and fiction. There would be no Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead without Hamlet, no West Side Story without Romeo and Juliet. Jean Rhys's extraordinary Wide Sargasso Sea is based on Jane Eyre, David Lodge's Nice Work on the Victorian condition-of-England novel, and now Marina Warner's Indigo offers two interlocking plots, both replays of The Tempest. In London from the 1940s to the 1980s, Miranda and her younger aunt-sister, Xanthe, grow up in the colonial Everard family, whose ancestor, Kit, settled a Caribbean island in the 17th century. Their story is told as a contemporary folk tale. Xanthe at her christening receives the gift of heartlessness from a fairy godmother, while Miranda is plagued by guilt and obsession with her Creole inheritance. Their lives are a parable on the benefits of heartlessness v feeling, being loved v loving, ignorant content v self-aware torment. What is happiness? Love? A good childhood? Hundreds of novels ask these questions, and Marina Warner gives her own answers as well as many. From Miranda's concerns comes the subplot, the first Kit Everard's exploitative relationship with the islander-characters remodelled from The Tempest. The witch, Sycorax, is a benign magician; a feminist Prospero; Ariel, her daughter, becomes pregnant by Kit; Caliban, renamed Dule, is a heroic resister to colonial expansion. Anti-colonialist productions of The Tempest have been fashionable for years, so Warner's approach is not new here. More innovative is her attempt to rework the play in the context of other fairy tales, mostly about women's roles, expectations, oppressions, position as icons. The novel is thus of interest as a continuation of her work as cultural historian in books such as Alone of All Her Sex, about the Virgin Mary cult, and Monuments and Maidens. Join the rich, artistic and magical transformations of The Tempest with this intellectual background, and the result should also be a heady literary brew. I wanted to enjoy it, but I stuttered over every cliche-ridden and symbol-drenched page. Indigo is a trite family romance dressed up in a breathtakingly pretentious mythical outfit and so overladen with academic baggage that it barely moves or develops as fiction. Inevitably, the density of multiple stories urges Warner towards theory and schematic writing. Links and parallels are far too obvious - Miranda has a child by a Caribbean actor playing Caliban, so matching Ariel and Kit; 1980s island freedom fighters recall 1600s native insurgence. Tempest images are gauchely plundered: 'He has already learnt to curse' (Caliban-Dule); 'I join the air, the sky, the water, the heat' (Ariel); 'She wasn't living inside one of Shakespeare's . . . late plays with their magical reconciliations,' just before Miranda is reconciled with a lover. In trying to recreate the play's magical strangeness, Warner overstates her case, mixing schoolgirl lushness ('her cinnamon tawniness,' 'shining black eyes like licorice'), travelogue lyricism and anthropological invention. But an account of the island's linguistic history (ten words for the wind in the palms) and Indigo-making traditions dotted with Shakespearian, even Chaucerian, words like 'swive' does not impose an alternative fictional reality. Warner simply does not have the imaginative vision to create an incandescent other-world that makes you ache to be there, like, say, the Egypt in the exotic subplot of Penelope Lively's Moon Tiger. Only where she tries less hard - descriptions of smoggy, deprived 1940s London; the Knokke convent where the lapsed Mrs Everard goes to regain her soul - does the novel convince. But even in the contemporary fable Warner can't resist drumming the message home. 'It was Xanthe rather who was to be pitied: she did not know highs and lows or heat and cold but only the tepid no man's land in between': the emphasis, the odds, are so weighted towards Miranda, naughty little rich girl typical of the 'liberated' heroine of recent fiction, that it is tempting to be drawn instead to unfashionably repressed Xanthe. The dogmatism is fatal. Myths and fairytales last and work because they answer deep, timeless needs and desires; the same tales can provide a range of consolations and inspirations for different people. The stories and island myths which Marina Warner invents here have only contemporary resonance; their intellectual intention is too strident for her readers' own imaginations ever to take flight.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Tokyo unveils Pounds 37bn spending programme: Consumers to reap rewards of yen's strength JAPAN'S new government yesterday announced Y6,150bn (Pounds 37.7bn) of government spending, deregulation and measures to pass on the rewards of the yen's strength to consumers. The measures, the government's first big economic initiative, are designed to help pull the country back from the edge of recession. To widespread disappointment they fell short of proposing income tax cuts. Business groups have urged tax reductions, but the seven-party coalition is divided on fiscal policy and the ministry of finance is unwilling to lose revenue. That brings to Y18,350bn the amount set aside so far this year to stimulate the flagging economy, after a Y13,200bn plan by the previous government in April. Most of that has yet to be spent. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, admitted that yesterday's measures were insufficient to revive the economy, but did not exclude further action. The yen rose against the dollar, while Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. The Nikkei average closed 445.64 points lower at 20,502.15. The plans received a lukewarm reception from economic analysts. However, they received a surprisingly cordial response from the US, which has been urging Japan to stimulate the economy to restrict its record trade surplus. Mr Laurence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary, who is visiting Tokyo, said he was pleased to see Mr Hosokawa introduce such measures so soon after taking office. In London, British Treasury officials welcomed the measures to boost the economy and open markets, as well as recent reductions in market interest rates. They cautioned, though, that it was not clear that the measures would produce recovery. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, begins a visit to Tokyo at the weekend. Among yesterday's proposals are reductions or removal of state controls on 94 areas of economic activity. Among the most important are a review of Japan's anti-monopoly law to discourage cartels; simpler standards and certification procedures for imports; recognition of international standards on building materials; and more flexible rules on the types of bonds companies may issue in Japan. Plans to pass on the benefits of the stronger yen to consumers include temporary energy tariff cuts, cheaper domestic air fares and lower international phone bills. The yen's increase has started to feed through to a fall in import prices, according to a government report yesterday. It said prices of 24 out of 35 imported goods surveyed, including whisky, cars, and beef, declined over the first six months of the year. Economic package fails to excite, Page 6</p>

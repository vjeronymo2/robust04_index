			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Cir to cut dividend as net profits plunge PARENT company net profits at Cir, the main industrial holding group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, crashed to just L19.5bn (Dollars 15m) last year from L144.9bn in 1989. The company, which is the main shareholder in the Olivetti computers and office equipment group, is slashing its dividend. Payouts for ordinary, savings and non-convertible savings shares will be cut from L130, L150 and L170 to L50, L70 and L90 respectively. The downturn in earnings is broadly in line with the forecast made last February, when Cerus, Mr De Benedetti's main French holding company, finally sold its remaining 9.9 per cent stake in Societe Generale de Belgique at a FFr1.2bn (Dollars 203.3m) loss. The profits fall follows Cir's decision to absorb the full effect of the La Generale sale on its 1990 accounts, it said yesterday. The company said that net earnings at group level, which have not yet been officially revealed, would be around L70bn. This is in line with the L60-80bn forecast made in February. Group net profits were L181.4bn in 1989 while consolidated group debt rose to L970bn last year from L778bn in 1989. However, Cir said that the sale of its remaining La Generale stake had resulted in a subsequent decrease in debt to L250bn.</p>

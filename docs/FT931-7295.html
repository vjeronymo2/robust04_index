			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Alarm over Heseltine's move THE DECISION by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, not to refer the proposed acquisition by Airtours of the Owners Abroad Group to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has alarmed and surprised specialists in competition law. It is the second time in two weeks that Mr Heseltine has overridden a recommendation from Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, to refer a merger to the commission. Earlier this month he rejected advice to refer a merger of the infra-red defence components businesses of GEC and Philips Electronics. Until this year the director-general's advice to refer a merger to the commission had been overridden on only 11 occasions since the arrangements for such referrals were put in place in 1973. Mr Heseltine appears more willing than many of his predecessors to second-guess the director-general, who is the competition regulator. More puzzling to observers, however, are the grounds on which Mr Heseltine is believed to have made his decision. It appears he felt that the case for referral on competition grounds was 'finely balanced', based on these factors: The large number of competitors in the package tour business. The ease of entry for companies wishing to enter the market. The rapidity with which a company's market share can change in the industry. In taking these reasons into account Mr Heseltine has challenged Sir Bryan's judgment that the merger would reduce competition in the package tours market. Sir Bryan will have reached his recommendation only after taking evidence from interested parties and detailed analysis of the package tour market. Mr Stephen Locke, director of the Policy Unit at the Consumers' Association, described the decision as 'baffling'. He said: 'The substantive issues may have been finely balanced, but the case for referring the merger to the MMC to review them was not.' Mr Heseltine gave similar reasons earlier in the month when he rejected referral of the merger of the GEC and Philips Electronics businesses. He felt the competition issues were not sufficient to justify a reference. For Mr Thomas Sharpe, a barrister specialising in competition law, this shows a worrying tendency to overrule the advice of the competition watchdog. Mr Sharpe accepts it might be appropriate for the trade secretary to refer a case to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission even when the director-general has not recommended referral. This has happened on six occasions in the past. In three of these Mr Peter Lilley, when trade and industry secretary, referred take-overs of private companies in the UK by state-owned foreign companies because he was concerned that they had an unfair advantage from their status as nationalised industries. Mr Sharpe said: 'Section 84 of the 1973 Fair Trading Act makes it clear that referral can be on several public interest grounds of which competition is just one. 'But when the competition watchdog says that a merger raises competition issues and recommends referral to the MMC, the Department of Trade and Industry should not second-guess them and say that they know better.' There are also fears that a more interventionist approach by the DTI will encourage companies to lobby politicians over mergers. One advantage of leaving it to an independent Office of Fair Trading is that campaigns on behalf of particular mergers on the grounds they are in the national interest or will save jobs are less likely to succeed. Mr Locke of the Consumers' Association, however, said the decision threw into question the government's commitment to tighten competition policy. He said: 'What is the point of issuing a green paper on new legislation to strengthen competition policy when the government appears to hold the subject in such low regard?'

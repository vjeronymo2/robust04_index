			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Private View: The taming of a lion of literature - Stephen Spender, a living monument of English letters, is 85 next week. He describes how his idealism has made a compromise with life The 1930s - Berlin, Spain, socialism and homosexual love - defined him. The 1990s have enshrined him, a relic of his age, the surviving limb of the poetic quadruped that Roy Campbell called MacSpaunday - MacNeice, Spender, Auden and Day-Lewis. What happened in between? Stephen Spender, 85-years-old on Monday and with a rare volume of new poems to mark the event, says that somewhere around the middle of his life he became domesticated. 'I think I got so much involved in things largely to do with earning money and supporting my family,' he said. 'I can't look back on my last 40 years as a kind of legendary, private, personal thing.' Do you mean you've been too successful for a poet? Too suburban? 'Yes, very bourgeois. Too much so, I think. And I regret that, very much. I wasn't when I was young, because I went to Spain during the civil war and lived with a friend of mine, a working-class friend.' (He means the youth he called Jimmy Younger in his 1951 autobiography). 'And I don't go to pubs. I often think my life would be much richer if anyhow I'd gone to pubs all the time.' Why do you say that? 'Because I think this a very limited existence and a limited view of existence. One has to realise that self-interest is a very high priority: one's standard of living becomes a very high priority, you see. But that is all to do with family . . . Then friends have been very important.' The young idealist who used to talk of 'going over to the proletariat' has lived in a rented villa in fashionable St John's Wood, London, since 1945. The house is painted blue, inside and out. There he lives with his second wife (his first marriage was brief), Natasha Litvin, a Russian pianist. They have a son who paints and a daughter who writes: she is married to the female impersonator Barry Humphries, which makes Spender Dame Edna Everage's father-in-law. I asked him if the bourgeois life had been bad for his writing. 'My writing would probably be different. I don't think it's really bad for my writing. I mean, I think in a way my poetry is all one long poem. And I think - I hope - that it's moved outwards from being about myself, discovering my own identity, partly into discovering other people's and partly about the historic period we've lived in. That's extremely important, isn't it? 'There's something very unreal about middle-class life today. You can sit eating a lamb cutlet and you have television on and you see a child in Asia somewhere starving to death in front of one's eyes, or people being murdered. 'What do you do? Do you stop eating the lamb chop, do you turn off the television?' He laughed, tickled by the dilemma. 'I think you somehow have to go on . . . facing the lamb chop and thinking, well, this is my life.' He has written about the dreadful events of his century, but thinks a writer cannot enter in too far. 'I mean, the real experience today is the 10 seconds before someone is murdered, in the concentration camps or something like that. The reality of our time is of consciousness participating in its own extinction, being destroyed, you see, in some terrible way.' Poets, he said, had always been aware of moments in which poetry disappeared into 'a terrible reality beyond itself.' It was what King Lear was about, and why Dr Johnson couldn't read it. 'Johnson wanted to stay this side where there is literature. I'm very conscious of doing that.' Spender shows signs of the classic complex of the too-comfortable, silver-spoon socialist. But he has not been entirely passive. Not only did he go to Spain, he instigated Index on Censorship in response to a plea from the Russian dissident Pavel Litvinov. You have a CBE, I said accusingly, and a knighthood. 'My son was very upset when I accepted. I said all my friends have been made knights - Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, though not Francis Bacon who refused everything. 'What I'd really like is to be known to have refused a knighthood. I'd like there to be an honours list with in the left-hand column the honours and the right-hand column those who refused.' He giggled, and I saw the cheeky Oxford undergraduate behind the old-ladyish face. 'It's just vanity, absolute vanity.' Are you going to tell me the best thing about a knighthood is being able to get a table in a restaurant? 'That's exactly what was on my lips.' He laughed delightedly. Spender seems gentle, naive and vulnerable. He is a lot tougher than he looks. I mentioned his string of appointments, especially in the US, and asked: Have you helped create your own worldly success? 'No I'm sure I haven't. No, I've never sought out anything. I really haven't' But later, only half-jokingly, he said: 'There's a sort of danger if you don't see your name in the newspaper you think you no longer exist.' How do you react to being lionised? 'I suppose one does in a way. The answer is one quite likes to make an entry, you see. On the other hand I am very glad that in England so little is made of all that.' Is it one of the recompenses of the writer's life that people come up to you? 'I like that. I always wanted that. When I was a child I always longed to be famous. Yes, I did really.' He described a recent 'scraggy meeting of poets' adding: 'All the younger poets received me very sort of politely, nicely and affectionately. I think that's fun, in old age, if one gets a little affection and people are at all grateful and respect you. You don't feel you've altogether deserved it, but you think 'Thank God I've managed to escape universal contempt.' Don't you think?' As a poet, Spender has not been prolific - he has written essays, reviews, journals, autobiography and fiction - and some critics say he has written only a handful of great poems. His ambition from the age of 10 was to get one piece into the Oxford Book of English Verse. He hopes he will be included in 100 years' time - but for something other than his much-anthologised 'The Truly Great.' Have you ever thought about your obituary? 'No, I dread all that. People are beginning to write my obituaries now.' He laughed uneasily. 'It's all about your sex life and things like that. 'It seems rather terrible that one can't write a poem without not only one's own life being subject to biography but the lives of unfortunate people who have been concerned with one suddenly dragged into the light. 'Biography can become a form of pornography in fact.' Last week Spender won an injunction to suppress the British publication of While England Sleeps, a novel by a homosexual American writer which fictionalised the 'Jimmy Younger' episode in Spender's own life. And his riposte to a recent, unauthorised biography was to lodge a 40-page catalogue of 'mistakes' in the British Library. I said: You've written yourself about your ambivalent sex life. Did you marry and have children in order to get away from the homosexual ghetto and the misery you thought you might have to endure? 'Well, perhaps,' he said cautiously. 'I think that every vocation requires some kind of gift, doesn't it? What's rather marvellous today is that there are homosexuals who are sort of gifted for being homosexuals.' Auden, he said, was an example of a homosexual who had no gift for it: he really wanted to be married and would have been a wonderful father. 'I am not really happy living with another man. I just find it a strain.' Of course in the 1930s it was sort of fashionable? 'Yes it was. It was a sort of club. And if you forsook the club they were very annoyed. They felt very let down, especially as it was a club of people who were taking high risks . . . Well, not high risks like Mount Everest - more Mount Skiddaw or something.' He laughed. Is living in the 1990s interesting for you, or a struggle? 'I think it's still interesting. Anyhow to be a survivor is to mean that you carry something with you which is of your generation. I feel I do carry something with me which is of my generation and of my friends.' This sense of being part of a continuum is described in Dolphins, the new book of poems, where Spender reflects on Samuel Pepys' diaries, and writes: No, when I read Pepys now, he and his cronies Burn from their days and through my veins - Their acts and passions one with those Moving through mine] Is writing, I asked him, an attempt to make sense of life or a prop for life? 'No, it's a way of trying to make sense of life, and trying to do so as clearly as possible. I've always tried to be as clear as I possibly could. It's also a record of experience.' Spender recently started keeping a diary again, not only in order to keep a grip on names and events but to recapture, as he put it, 'the feel of things and the sensation of people, the characters.' Even at this stage of life? 'Yes, even at this stage of life. And also I do know rather interesting people.' So you explain life to yourself by writing about it? 'Yes, I do.' And you give yourself a purpose for living as well? 'Well, my purpose for living would be just to do that, I think.' It sounds circular, I said. 'I suppose. But why not?' And it goes on until you drop off the perch? 'I hope so, yes. I think so. It becomes all one's life, so if one stopped one would drop off the perch.' Do you still suffer from youthful idealism? 'Yes, I think so, yes.' But idealism is about the future. At 85 what kind of idealism can one have? 'At 85,' he said immediately, 'I think one should express no public opinions because they may involve something such as you'd be prepared to die for - and you're going to die for some other reason. You can't put your life on the line any more, can you? 'I'm quite clear about that. I don't think I should express any opinions about anything, publicly. Just try to go on writing my work, my thoughts, my diaries.' Aren't you supposed to be the village elder now? To sit in the sun with your hands over the stick and provide a free consultation service for the middle-aged who are trying to run the show? 'Yes, I know. That would be possible in the city state, like Athens, but I don't think old people are in that position now, are they?' What's the fun of being 85 if you can't hand down wise words? There was a long pause. Spender was obviously working up a joke. Then he began giggling: 'I think the fun of 85,' he said, spluttering with mirth, 'is that one won't have to live into the next century.'</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rally short-lived THE DOLLAR yesterday regained some of the ground it had lost against the D-Mark in recent days, rising to a peak of DM1.6250, but the rally proved to be short-lived, writes James Blitz. Last week's poorer than expected non-farm payroll figure helped to push the dollar down to a close of DM1.6120 on Monday night. Yesterday morning in Europe the US currency regained some lost ground as dealers took profits in the wake of the hefty move downwards in recent days. But the dollar was later unsettled after the Bundesbank announced that it was setting a fixed rate repo in its money market operations at 6.80 per cent, unchanged from the previous week. The Bundesbank's move suggested that monetary policy will remain tight at its council meeting this week, and the dollar closed at DM1.6105, down 15 basis points on the day. In New York, however, the US currency improved to finish at DM1.6137. Dealers have not given up all hope that the Bundesbank will reduce the discount rate at its council meeting tomorrow, but such a move has barely been discounted by dealers. One factor which may have pushed the Bundesbank council in the direction of 'no change' in the discount rate were better than expected figures for German GDP. This rose a real, seasonally and calendar adjusted, 0.5 per cent in the second quarter from the first quarter for a year-on-year decline of 1.9 per cent. Economists had predicted that the year-on-year fall would be in the order of 2.6 per cent. However, Mr Richard Segal, international bond market analyst at Technical Data in London, said: 'Closer examination of the figures shows that, by sector, most categories of final demand declined. This suggests that the economy is poorly placed to grow in the future.' In spite of the Bundesbank's move, European currencies performed a little more strongly against the D-Mark. The French franc closed at FFr3.519 from a previous FFr3.523 and the Belgian franc was almost unchanged at BFr21.63. Sterling also performed strongly against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4850 from a previous DM2.4625. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.5425 from a previous Dollars 1.5270. In the last two weeks the pound has come under consistent pressure against the D-Mark and the dollar. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, said this is surprising, bearing in mind that the fundamental reasons for sterling strength are in place: equity markets are strong, recent economic data have been better than expected and the money markets are not discounting an imminent cut in interest rates. He believes that one of the main causes of sterling weakness may have been that central banks have been selling pounds to buy D-Marks in order to repay the Bundesbank for recent intervention.</p>

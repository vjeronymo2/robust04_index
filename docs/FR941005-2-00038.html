The conference also is to examine whether revisions need to be made to the Commission's certificate procedures related to new construction, such as its at-risk construction policies, to provide greater guidance on rate design and construction approvals for individual projects. On July 28, 1994, the Commission issued a notice raising issues to be considered at the conference. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The Commission also invited comments on these issues to be filed by September 26, 1994, and numerous comments have been received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 39553 (Aug. 3, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Members of the Commission intend to participate in the public conference and will reserve time for questions and answers.

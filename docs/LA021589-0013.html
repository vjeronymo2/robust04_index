			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER TERESA  </P> <P> In a world where heroes and heroines are few, the article "Mother Teresa Brings  a Message of Hope to Homeless Latino Youths in Los Angeles" (Metro, Feb. 1)  gave your readers a chance to hope again. Mother Teresa's visit to those  homeless youngsters definitely showed a "message of love."  </P> <P> As a teen-ager I know that it is important for adolescents to have role models.  Mother Teresa gives everyone a special message. Love is vital to human life.  This woman has shown us how to reach out to others with care and concern.  </P> <P> She challenges us to do the same -- to give without expecting something in  return. Is this not a possible solution for those who fill their lives with  drugs, harmful relationships, and overemphasis upon material possessions? We  must give of our love to those in need.  </P> <P> REBECCA GIRARD  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

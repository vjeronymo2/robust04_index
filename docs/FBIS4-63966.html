			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- UNIAN has already  reported that Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy is  continuing his official visit to the NATO headquarters in  Brussels. Ukraine's Defense Ministry press service has announced  that Vitaliy Radetskyy spoke at a conference of North Atlantic  Council member countries' defense ministers today. The  Ukrainian defense minister emphasized, in particular, that  "overcoming artificial isolation from Europe and returning  Ukraine to the range of leading European states" was one of the  most important tasks in Ukraine's military political course.    Vitaliy Radetskyy also said that Ukraine was in favor of  creating a versatile all-European system of security on the  basis of existing international institutions. Ukraine's  immediate membership in these structures will provide the  necessary external guarantees of its national security. The  Ukrainian defense minister pointed out that Ukraine did not see  any reasons why CIS countries could not join the "Partnership  for Peace" program. "It would also be desirable if Russia were  among the partnership members. The footing, however, should  undoubtedly be equal for all," said the Ukrainian defense  minister.    The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry reported  that  Vitaliy Radetskyy met U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and  David Collenette, Canadian national defense minister, and  discussed issues of military cooperation and developments in  Crimea with them. The Defense Ministry's press service added  that both William Perry and David Collenette expressed concern  at the escalation of tension in Crimea, highly commended  Ukraine's balanced and constructive position on normalizing the  situation, and confirmed respect for the territorial integrity  of Ukraine.    Also today, the Ukrainian defense minister met George  Joulwan, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.</p>

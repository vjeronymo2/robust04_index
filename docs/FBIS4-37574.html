			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Prime Minister brother Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-  'Attar at noon today received (Robert Jejacques), member of the  French Senate, and Mr. (Audois), secretary general of the  Arab-French Friendship Society, who arrived in our country to  express solidarity with the Yemeni people in facing the current  circumstances.    During the meeting, they reviewed the current developments  in  Yemen and the efforts the institutions of legitimacy are making  to preserve Yemeni unity. The French delegation voiced support  for Yemeni unity as a basic factor in the region. The  delegation members also voiced appreciation for the achievements  the Yemeni people realized in the field of democracy by holding  free elections on 27 April [1993].    The French delegation gave Dr. al-'Attar a copy of the  statement issued by the French-Yemeni friendship group at the  French Senate on the Yemeni situation. The statement stressed  the group's support for Yemeni unity and democracy and  emphasized the need to preserve it.    Brother Dr. al-'Attar briefed the French delegation on  overall Yemeni developments and the true situation in our  country as a result of the war imposed by [Yemeni] Socialist  Party elements who rebelled against legitimacy with the aim of  undermining both Yemeni unity and the gains achieved by the  Yemeni people, including the democratic achievements that the  rebellious elements are trying to abort. Al-'Attar asserted  that the war that the various groups of the Yemeni people are  waging against these elements basically aims to preserve unity  and democracy.    Dr. al-'Attar expressed our country's gratitude and  appreciation for the position of both the French-Yemeni  Friendship Society and the friendly French people on Yemeni  unity and democracy. He pointed out that the Yemeni people and  their leadership appreciate this principled position which  expresses the true relations of friendship and cooperation as  well as the historic ties between both friendly countries.  French Ambassador in Sanaa (Marcel Lupin) attended the meeting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning, the Serbian aggressor again started  shelling Srebrenica. The regions of (?Lihtari) and Vranik were  shelled from the direction of Bratunac, while the residential  areas of the town were shelled from Krvavac. One civilian was  killed and 11 seriously wounded. This was announced by the War  Presidency of the Srebrenica commune.    At about 1230, the aggressor shelled the Suceska area from  the direction of Milici. After the shelling of all (?lines),  the aggressor fired with anti-aircraft machine guns, guns, and  other infantry weapons. Members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] in our town can confirm this attack. It has been proven  once again that Srebrenica is not protected according to the  provisions of the Security Council Resolutions 819 and 824.  This was stated in a communique issued by the Srebrenica War  Presidency.    Because of this, the Srebrenica War Presidency appeals once  again to the Presidency and the Government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the General Staff of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and UNPROFOR to require the aggressor  strictly to observe the provisions of the agreement on the  demilitarization of Srebrenica.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses improve as Moscow hardliners give up BOURSES seemed relatively unperturbed by the overnight strife in Moscow but, nevertheless, they showed signs of improvement in the afternoon as Russian hardliners began surrendering and leaving the White House, writes Our Markets Staff. At Goldman Sachs, Mr Sushil Wadhwani and Mr Mushtaq Shah said that it made sense partially to inoculate portfolios against 'Russian risk', recommending a 3.5 per cent weighting in commodities, and retaining one of 9 per cent in cash. FRANKFURT, clearly, wanted to go up all day. Over the offical session, the DAX index rose 11.63 to 1,923.72 as German stock market turnover improved from DM4.4bn to DM5.25bn, and in the afternoon the Ibis-indicated DAX climbed another 11.51 to 1,935.23. Commentators put the morning gains down, not to any wave of investment buying, but to traders covering short positions as share price held firm; there was more business later but traders, rather than investors, still held sway. Interest in Daimler remained high, the shares climbing DM9 to DM746 ahead of today's listing in New York. Lufthansa rose another DM3.50 to DM163.50. It confirmed the United Airlines pact, and forecast that its restructuring programme would to enable it to halve its losses in 1993, and make a return to profits possible in 1994. Metallgesellschaft jumped DM10 to DM364. It said yesterday that it was selling a stake of around four percent in Metall Mining Corp to Minorco, and that the deal would help promote the joint development of mining projects. MILAN's Comit index dipped 3.79 to 590.52 in volume depressed by a two hour halt to screen-based trading during the morning as a result of technical problems. Fiat surprised some analysts with a further L290, or 5 per cent gain to L6,080 in the wake of last week's record capital call and amid continued speculation about possible alliances. Rinascente, the retailer, and Ifil, the Agnelli family holding company, were relisted after further details emerged about Fiat's complex plan to sell its 58 per cent share in Rinascente to its own shareholders and a public buy offer by Ifil. Rinascente added L270 or 2.8 per cent to L9,886 after a day's high of L10,278, amid speculation that a higher tender bid for Rinascente might be launched. Ifil shed L484 or 7.8 per cent to L5,758, ahead of a post-bourse presentation to analysts: it was suspended temporarily, shortly after the opening, as the price slumped by more than 12 per cent. PARIS saw the BNP privatisation price set at FFr240 per share, regarded as cheap and no threat to overall sentiment, as afternoon short covering took the CAC 40 index to a close 11.94 higher at 2,128.66. Rhone-Poulenc was easier, however, falling FFr6.50 to FFr153. Some analysts reckoned that if the BNP price was on the low side, Rhone could be floated at a discount to the market. Peugeot rose FFr8 to FFr665 after underperforming the market in recent weeks, and in spite of a 18 per cent fall in September car sales. Turnover was estimated at about FFr3bn, the same as last Friday's level. ZURICH trading was restrained as the SMI index rose 8.7 to 2,490.3. Swiss Re registered rose SFr45 to SFr3,340 on last Friday's results, and Winterthur registered advanced SFr13 to SFr664. Swissair added SFr15 to SFr690 amid unconfirmed reports that the airline was considering paying a special dividend to lower the company's valuation ahead of the Alcazar alliance. However, analysts noted that such a move was only one of the options available to the group. SMH, watchmaker, shed SFr7 to SFr205 amid heavy US selling on worries about the profits outlook. James Capel in London, downgrading the stock to 'hold', said it was revising down expectations for sales growth to 8 per cent and its 1993 net profit forecast was being trimmed from SFr485m to SFr460m. Ascom, the telecommunications group, surged 6.4 per cent at one stage after domestic newspapers reported that the Swiss army was considering purchasing a SFr800m telecommunications system by 1995m. But the shares settled back to finish SFr20 higher at SFr1,120 as the company said that while it had a good chance of winning the contract, it was at present only heading a research project for the army. AMSTERDAM overcame an unsteady start to finish firmer with the CBS Tendency index adding 0.5 to 125.7. Royal Dutch rose 40 cents to Fl 188.60 after the European Commission said it had cleared the sale of Shell's crop protection business to American Cyanamid. STOCKHOLM recovered on government proposals to halve capital gains tax on share sales, and cut taxes on didivends and corporate profits. The Affarsvarlden General index closed just 0.2 down at 1,299.0, although Trelleborg B, volatile on the prospect of a Russian effect on metal prices, rose by SKr5, or 13 per cent to SKr42.50. OSLO took to the Russian news and the all share index rose 8.23 to 555.87; HELSINKI went along, the Hex index closing 14.01 higher at 1,421.91. TEL AVIV, in addition to hopes of a Russian solution, talked of a technical correction after three days of profit taking as the Mishtanim index gained 4.22, or 1.9 per cent to 229.16.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- October 4                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open       11.30       12.00      13.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1294.13     1294.91     1294.33    1295.46 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1369.83     1370.66     1370.94    1371.58  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               14.00       15.00       16.00      Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1296.25     1297.25     1298.93    1299.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1372.35     1375.56     1377.09    1377.73  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Oct 1    Sep 30    Sep 29    Sep 28    Sep 27  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1293.99   1293.02   1288.31   1288.96   1290.59 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1368.19   1362.51   1356.79   1364.11   1361.41  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1299.72; 200 - 1378.23 Low/day: 100 - 1293.71 200 - 1369.44  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

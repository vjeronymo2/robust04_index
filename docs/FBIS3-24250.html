			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Press Center of the Social Democratic Party of </F> Georgia: "Who We Are and What We Want. Meet the Social  Democrats"]    [Text]    What is Social Democracy?    Social Democracy originated on the basis of a merger of the  ideas of liberalism and the reformist current of the workers'  socialist movement. Its ideological roots are Christian ethics,  enlightenment, humanist philosophy, and the experience of the  people's and national liberation movement and the struggle for  women's emancipation. The basic values of Social Democracy are  freedom, justice, and solidarity.    Social Democracy was not immune to mistakes in the past. In  fact, considerable harm was done to it by failure to appreciate  the nationality factor and by enthusiasm for Marx's utopia, but  in time Social Democracy has overcome these mistakes and taken  firm positions of pragmatism.    What is the content of Social Democracy's basic values  (freedom, justice, solidarity)?    The Social Democrats' credo is that every human being is  born  free, every human being has the right to be free of political  dictatorship and violence. Freedom also means freedom for the  dissident. No one should be oppressed by fear or material want.  The other person's freedom defines the boundaries that  constitute the condition for every individual person's freedom.    Social Democrats believe that justice means equal rights and  opportunities and the elimination of any national or social  oppression of human beings. It means social protection for the  individual, and equality of men and women. A condition of  justice is every person's independence from proprietors and  politicians.    Freedom and justice are impossible without solidarity. It is  the practical reflection of compassion manifested toward the  victims of injustice. Every human being needs the support of  other human beings. Every human being who is destitute or in  trouble must be able to count on society's solidarity. Neither  submissive collectivism nor selfish individualism can create the  prerequisites for the individual's self-determination. It is  possible only through the joint actions of free human beings.    What is your attitude toward democracy and  politics?    Democracy is incompatible with totalitarianism and anarchy.  It means self-government by the people. But it does not mean mob  rule. Democracy is a reflection of the will of the people based  on inviolability of the law. It is genuine only when government  can be changed by peaceful means. Democracy must guarantee the  rights of the minority. By its nature it can only be pluralistic.    The Social Democrats do not believe that politics is the art  of immorality (although politics and morality are not synonyms).  What the Social Democrats strive for is to bring more moral  motives into politics, to make it more humane and just. This  means, in particular, that the people must be told the truth,  however bitter it may be.    Are the Social Democrats materialists or idealists?    The Social Democrats take the position of a pluralism of  world views. Hence, they include materialists and idealists.    Do you believe in God?    People of various creeds have rallied around the Social  Democrats, people whose attitudes toward religion vary. Our  ranks include believers and atheists.    In our view, the state cannot be either atheistic or  theistic. At the same time, we do deem it possible to have the  best cadres of religious circles take active part in state and  social affairs. The leadership of Georgia's Social Democratic  Party [SDP], for example, includes clergymen.    What does your symbol, the rose, mean?    The rose is the acknowledged symbol of all Social Democrats.  It is the symbol of harmony, nobility, beauty, and compassion.    What is your attitude toward socialism?    While communists view socialism as a social formation, the  Social Democrats use the word to mean constant, moral movement  toward an increasingly humane, just, and democratic society.    We are not trying to impose some new way of life on people.  All we are trying to create is the political, legal, and  economic conditions necessary for people themselves to change  their way of life. This should take place through reform rather  than by revolution.    How else do you differ from the communists?    Communists deny political and world-view pluralism, the  multi-party system, the market economy, and belief in God. They  view justice as a state in which everyone is equalized. What we  believe is that justice is reflected in equality of opportunity.  The communists fight against wealth; the Social Democrats fight  against poverty.    How do the Social Democrats differ from the right-wing  parties?    The Social Democrats represent a left-of-center people's  party. We differ from the right-wing parties (liberals,  conservatives, Christian democrats) in that we try to use state  regulation of chaotic market conditions to redistribute material  goods to all members of society, so that every person's freedom  is materially guaranteed. The Social Democrats strive to broaden  democracy not only in the political but also the economic and  social spheres of life.    Whom do you categorize as "working people"?    Both hired workers and proprietors. Both strata do labor  that  is useful to society. Therefore, the Social Democrats try to  harmonize their interests through social partnership. This is  accomplished through trilateral contracts of mutual obligations  between hired workers (the trade unions), proprietors  (entrepreneurs' associations) and the state (government).    What is your attitude toward capitalism?    Capitalism in the classical sense does not exist in any  country today. As a result of structural reforms brought about  through the efforts of the workers' movement, the trade unions'  active struggle, and the social democratic parties, corporate  capitalism has taken shape in the Western countries, which is  based on group and joint-stock ownership of the means of  production. This has radically improved the material wellbeing  of the working man and made his life better, although many  social problems remain unsolved.    What is your attitude toward private property?    We favor a variety of forms of property ownership--private,  state, group, and mixed ownership. However, we do prefer group,  joint-stock ownership, which makes it possible to realize our  motto "Every Working Man Should Become a Proprietor, Every  Proprietor Should Become a Working Man." Experience has shown  that no one form of property ownership by itself guarantees  freedom and justice. The important thing is who has the right to  manage the property. Our main concern, therefore, is to see to  it that the immediate producer of things is involved in  exercising that right.    What is your attitude toward social insurance?    In our opinion, social insurance needs to be personified.  The  total amount of insurance contributions accumulated during every  person's working career should be returned to him in the form of  a pension. The same thing is true of health care. In the case of  a worker's untimely death, the remaining insurance ought to be  turned over to his family. People who do not work (for various  reasons) should be provided aid and medical assistance by the  state.    How do you see the transition from the post-communist  society to the market economy?    The world has no experience of a transition from a  post-communist society to a market economy. We cannot accomplish  the task if we go by the methodology of the transition from  feudalism to capitalism. There's still no way to make an egg out  of an omelet. Making the transition from a post-communist  society to a market economy by way of revolutionary-extremist,  so-called "shock therapy" has shattered economies and  impoverished the people. Georgia provides a clear example of  this.    The Social Democrats offer society a conception for  establishing a socially just and ecologically safe market  economy. It calls for a phased transition to market relations.  At the same time, state regulation of the process is vitally  important. It is the state that must create market institutions  and legislative foundations, carry out financial-credit reform,  implement a selective protectionist policy, train a corps of  managers, harmonize private and social interests, and provide  for the people's social and ecological protection.    How do you view privatization?    The Social Democrats make a distinction between the  privatization of management and property. They believe, at the  same time, that privatization of state property ought to be  preceded by the privatization of state management of the economy.    Factories and plants now owned by the state ought to be  transferred to the relevant collectives, to group, joint-stock  ownership. As for the private production sector, it should  basically be formed by having individuals pool their money to  create new private enterprises.    Retail and consumer service establishments should be sold to  individual persons or groups of persons.    Individual farm operations should be established in the  countryside. Kolkhozes should be converted into individual  farmers' cooperatives; state farms should be turned into  joint-stock operations.    The state sector of the economy, which, as in the Western  countries, is not subject to privatization, should be converted  to a commercial footing.    What ought to be done about mass unemployment?    First, new jobs need to be created. Public works need to be  organized, professional retraining centers need to be  established, and work time needs to be reduced through the  adoption of modern technologies.    We Social Democrats believe we ought to adopt a free year:  once every five years every worker should have the right to take  up to one year off to take care of personal business while  retaining minimum salary, his job, and his time in service.    What is your attitude toward trade unions?    Unfortunately, we do not have genuine free trade unions in  Georgia. Members of existing trade unions include both  proprietors and hired workers, which makes the trade unions an  adjunct to state administration and powerless to fight. Trade  unions ought to include only hired workers as members; factory  and plant executives ought to join entrepreneurs' associations.  It is time for Parliament to pass a law on trade unions which  will ensure their independence from management.    In your opinion, how can we solve the problem of  interethnic relations?    The Georgian SDP denounces chauvinism, national nihilism,  national arrogance, and isolationism, and calls on all ethnic  groups to work together for mutual benefit. The party's ranks  include representatives of various nationalities who live in  Georgia and respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.    It is a matter of the Georgian people's honor to foster the  free development of national minorities living in Georgia.    One of our special concerns is the protection of the  interests of the Abkhazian people and Georgians living in  Abkhazia, and ensuring the full autonomy of Abkhazia within  Georgia. Systematic democracy alone can achieve interethnic  harmony.    Georgian Social Democrats believe that national minorities  living in Georgia whose ethnic territory lies outside of Georgia  ought to be given cultural-national autonomy. This means giving  them the opportunity to create national societies which operate  on self-governing principles and engage in creating their own  schools, cultural centers, publishing houses, and so on.    What importance do you attribute to the factor of  Russia in regard to consolidating Georgia's independence?    The Georgian SDP has repeatedly stated in public that our  homeland is of strategic concern to Russia; we must take account  of this concern and satisfy it, of course, in consideration of  modern realities. At the same time, Russia must also take  account of and satisfy the Georgian nation's national interests.  Only in this way can we create a civilized system of  Georgian-Russian relations.    Trying to talk tough to the Russians and threaten them with  the UN and NATO is just Quixotic and, naturally, does not bring  good results. Abkhazia and Samachablo [South Ossetia] are clear  proof of that. Anyone who tries to make confrontation points  against Russia is undermining Georgia's independence.    What is your assessment of Georgia's joining the  CIS?    The only sad thing is that the decision to do so came so  late. Isolationism did much harm to Georgia's national  interests. Our economy was destroyed and ruined, our people were  impoverished and made destitute, cultural development halted,  senseless conflicts sacrificed the lives of thousands of young  people, and the tragedy of Abkhazia turned countless numbers of  people into refugees. We could have avoided all of this with a  more conciliatory policy toward Russia.    In the form that the CIS has now it does not properly  reflect  the level of actual integration of the states that used to be  part of the Soviet Union. In this regard, Georgia can have its  own say regarding the gradual transformation of the CIS into a  Eurasian Home which will have common work-coordination bodies  and a multi-national secretariat headed by a General Secretary.    Some political parties are in favor of a federal system  for Georgia. How about you?    We are categorically against it. Dividing Georgia up into  Kartli, Guria, Mingrelia, Kakhetia, and other provinces, with  their own governments, will foment parochialism and split the  country. Therefore, Georgia must remain a unitary state; at the  same time, the autonomies should be granted broad rights of  self-government.    Is your party a member of the Socialist  International?    Georgia's SDP is a part of international Social Democracy.  In  more than 20 countries today (Austria, Norway, Spain, Holland,  Greece, Australia, and others) the government is headed by  Social Democrats. Outstanding leaders of international Social  Democracy include F. Mitterand (the President of France), F.  Gonzales (the Prime Minister of Spain), F. Vranitzky (the  Chancellor of Austria), and others.    International Social Democracy is a powerful anti-communist  movement, and for this reason it has been the target of constant  pro-communist attacks both here and abroad.    International Social Democracy is coordinated by the  Socialist International, which was revived in 1951. Its members  include ruling and opposition socialist, social-democratic, and  labor parties in over 100 countries, parties adhering to the  same principles. From 1976 to 1992, the Socialist International  was headed by former German Chancellor Willy Brandt; its  chairman now is former French Prime Minister Pierre Maurois.    Last year, Georgia's SDP became a member of the Socialist  International with the status of permanent guest.    When was Georgia's SDP created?    Our party was created in November 1918. It was founded by  Noe  Zhordania, Noe Ramishvili, Silibistro Dzhibladze, and others.  Both then and now, the party's basic program calls for freedom  of the nation and the individual and material wellbeing as the  cornerstone of human life.    Are you the heirs of the mensheviks?    The mensheviks represented the reform wing of Russia's  Social  Democratic Workers' Party. They opposed bolshevism, that is,  Leninism. Under Noe Zhordania's leadership, Georgian Social  Democrats also opposed Russia's mensheviks. It would be wrong,  therefore, to call Georgian Social Democrats mensheviks, because  at the time they were the majority in Georgia while the  bolsheviks were in the minority.    Then and now, Georgian Social Democrats have taken the  position of Europe's Social Democrats.    Who killed Ilia Chavchavadze?    The man who actually killed the Great Ilia was Gigola  Berbichashvili, a representative of the bolshevik wing of  Russia's Social Democratic Workers' Party who was later a state  official in Communist Georgia. Blaming this shocking  assassination on Georgia's SDP is just a treacherous trick of  the communists. Ilia Chavchavadze was murdered in 1907; our  party, on the other hand, was formed 11 years afterward, in  1918. Despite the ideological differences between Ilia  Chavchavadze and Noe Zhordania, both became victims of  bolshevism. As Mikhako Tsereteli wrote, "Being sacrificed for  the nation and oppressed by the same enemy raised both these  personages to the heights."    The SDP led independent Georgia from 1918 to 1921. What  accomplishments did it achieve?    That was Georgia's little Golden Age. The Georgian Social  Democrats created history's first Social Democratic republic and  laid the foundation for the kind of model of social development  that has now come to be known as the Swedish model.    Georgia's Social Democrats established a social market  economy, political pluralism, municipal self-government, the  institution of trial by jury, a democratic constitution, and  national armed forces; they restored the autocephaly of the  Church, opened the first Georgian university, and so on. It is  no wonder, therefore, that Noe Zhordania's government was  accorded high praise by England's Prime Minister Ramsey  MacDonald, who wrote: "I have studied its constitution and its  social and economic reconstruction, and what I saw there is the  kind of life I would like to see in our country."    The Georgian experience at that time served to enrich  international Social Democracy.    What was the cause of the downfall of the Georgian  Social Democratic republic in 1921?    After Azerbaijan and Armenia were seized by Bolshevik  Russia,  the 200,000-man Red Army invaded Georgia and took it over. For a  month and a half, Georgia's Social Democratic government and the  Georgian army put up staunch resistance against the aggressor.  The war cost the lives of 30,000 Georgians, and the Georgian  government, under Noe Zhordania's leadership, was forced to  emigrate abroad, where they worked actively to expose the act of  aggression. The whole world learned the truth that communist  rule was established in Georgia not by a people's uprising but  as a result of Bolshevik Russia's intervention.    What happened to your party after Georgia was taken  over?    Georgia's SDP went underground. Despite communist  repressions  which cost the lives of about 80,000 party members, the Georgian  Social Democrats never stopped fighting to restore Georgia's  independence. The SDP led the uprising in 1924. The party held  its Third (illegal) Congress in 1925 and its Fourth (illegal)  Congress in 1930. The party had an illegal, functioning Central  Committee in Georgia until the start of the 1950s. After its  members were arrested and shot, the Central Committee's  functions went over to the party's foreign bureau that had been  operating in France since 1923.    How did the Georgian SDP come to be restored, and  when?    An initiative group was formed in the 1980s, in Tbilisi, to  restore the party. In February 1990, on the instructions and  with the encouragement of the party's foreign bureau, the  Georgian SDP's Fifth Congress was held in Tbilisi; the Congress  adopted the party's new program and charters and restored its  leadership bodies. Many people probably don't know that the  rebirth of the Social Democratic movement in Georgia had Merab  Kostava as one of its leaders.    Does the party have its own press organs?    The Georgia SDP publishes a journal called CHVENI DROSHA  [Our  Banner] abroad, specifically in Paris; in Georgia it publishes  the newspaper ERTOBA [Unity] and a journal, SOTSIAL-DEMOKRATI.    What was your party's attitude toward the "Rounds?"    At first, the Roundtable put together a seemingly reasonable  program which called for achieving Georgian state independence  by stages. Later on, unfortunately, it renounced the program; as  the saying goes, temptation got the better of it and it resorted  to revolutionary-extremist methods, resulting in confrontation  with Russia, a standoff with the intelligentsia, the  resurrection of authoritarianism, splitting of the nation, and  finally the political collapse of the "Rounds" and the  ex-President. To be totally truthful, however, overthrowing the  "Rounds" by force of arms was an unconstitutional act, and, as  in the case of all other armed coups, this one also resulted in  Georgia's grave predicament that persists to this day.    What is your attitude toward the present  government?    Despite our deep respect for Eduard Shevardnadze, we have to  say that he lacked sufficient principle to resist the pressure  of extremist and nationalist forces, which has resulted in an  unrealistic policy toward Russia and fetishization of the  Western aid factor. This has cost us all dearly, and now we are  reaping the fruits of those mistakes.    Does your party have an armed force?    Our principles and ideas are our weapons. We have no other  arms. Any political organization that has them ought to be  banned by law.    Who is the chairman of your party?    Guram Muchaidze is the Chairman of the SDP of Georgia. He  was  born in October 1948, in a worker's family. He graduated with  honors from Tbilisi Secondary School No 3 and from the History  Faculty of Tbilisi State University. He was awarded the  candidate of science degree for his diploma work. At the age of  30 he defended his doctoral dissertation and was given the rank  of professor. He worked as head of the Political Science  Department. He has written over 100 scholarly works. He is  married and has two children.    How many deputies do you have in Parliament?    Only two, unfortunately.    What is the structure of the party's leadership  bodies?    The party's highest leadership body is the Congress; between  congresses it is the Central Committee, which convenes once  every six months. Between meetings of the Central Committee the  party's affairs are handled by its Political Council. The  party's foreign bureau is accountable to its Political Council.    What regions are your party's local organizations  operating in?    Almost all major regions. The party organization's  activities  are presently paralyzed in Abkhazia and Samachablo.    Do you have permanent staffers?    We do. The apparatus of the Political Council numbers twelve  staffers.    How many members does your party have?    The Georgian SDP's members number over 5,000.    How is your party funded?    Our financial sources are: membership dues and registration  fees, contributions from its foreign bureau and from members and  sympathizers, and income from publishing activities.    Do you have an account where contributions can be  made?    Here are the particulars: Georgian SDP, MPO 520096, Account  000700302, Aragvi-Biznes Bank, Tbilisi.    Where is your headquarters and how can you be  contacted?    The Georgian SDP is located in Tbilisi, at No 2 on 9 April  Street. Our phones are 99-95-22 and 99-95-50.    We're hoping to meet you!</p>

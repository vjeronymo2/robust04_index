			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 24 TASS--The hardline National  Salvation Front does not intend to sign the memorandum on civic  peace and accord, according to speakers at today's report-back  election session of the Front's national council. Participants  in the session demanded that President Boris Yeltsin step down,  early presidential election be urgently held and the country's  current political and economic course be changed.    The progress report, which was delivered by the Front's  leader Ilya Konstantinov, said "the National Salvation Front  lost its mainstay following last October's collapse of soviets  which were the backbone of opposition forces".    According to Konstantinov, "unless steps are taken to put an  end to the amorphous coalition of various political forces,  which is exactly what the National Salvation Front is now, the  movement will be doomed to leave Russia's political arena". He  believes that opposition can be rallied into one force only if  it nominated a single candidate for the Russian presidency. The  Front leader declared struggle for early presidential election  the main goal of the movement.    The following debates over the report revealed that the  National Salvation Front had no allies among Russia's major  political forces. Nor does it have enough funds to carry out  propaganda and organizational work or leaders enjoying  nationwide support.    Konstantinov declined to take part in a meeting with  presidential aide Georgiy Satarov scheduled for April 26. The  session elected a group of three activists to represent the  front at the meeting.    The Front's council addressed the Federation of Russia's  Independent Trade-Unions, calling "for joint actions to protect  the social and economic interests of the population".</p>

Cuban Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez made the above  statement during a conference of Higher Education Ministry  officials, who have been meeting since last Monday with  government and Cuban Communist Party officials.    Different economic mechanisms based on new laws are being  applied, which, in addition to the changes made to the domestic  economy such as the increase in self-employment (with nearly  145,000 people participating since Decree 141 was passed last  September), are a solution to the decreasing number of jobs,  Rodriguez said.    Rodriguez explained that the changes (including the  suspension of penalties for possessing dollars, opening to  foreign capital, and other changes) could lead to a better year  for Cuba from an economic viewpoint, especially a halt to the  violent fall experienced between 1989 and 1993.    Rodriguez pointed out that the strongest of the measures  adopted by the government in this stage is the introduction of  agricultural cooperatives.    He explained that the exploitation of extensive areas of  land  using a large amount of imported fertilizers could not be  continued following the collapse of the socialist bloc and the  disappearance of the USSR (the nation's leading trading  partners).    We had to make a political decision. We had to link man  directly with his work by creating basic cooperative productive  units, which are socialist formulas that allow peasants to feel  like co-owners of the land.    We have reached the conclusion that certain unproductive  factories cannot continue to operate, that we must review the  payrolls, and that we must make a series of decisions to see  that economic mechanisms are successful and that the country's  financial situation improves.    The minister said all the monetary-fiscal reforms that have  been applied and that are being studied are aimed at achieving a  stimulating [estimulante] relationship between work and salary  now that the country is facing the dual problem of an excess of  national currency and foreign exchange.    Nevertheless, he predicted that with a change in economic  mentality, a halt of the current crisis if not progress in the  solution thereof should be observed in the second half of the  year.    He based his optimism on the possibility of having a  superior  sugar harvest (or a less costly one), the increase in the price  of sugar and nickel (and a recovery in the production of this  mineral, which is in high international demand), the  substitution of imports, and a significant increase in  agriculture.    In this regard, he also mentioned oil exploration, restoring  electricity to previous levels, revising storage methods for  agricultural products, and labor reforms, which are essential to  control a relative or absolute labor force surplus.    He said that Cuba has not abandoned its full employment  policy, but to avoid identifying it with labor idleness,  alternatives for state, cooperative, or self-employment work  have been opened, accompanied by strict order and discipline.    Rodriguez said Cuba's degree of economic opening to the  outside will always be high, with tourism as the basic program,  followed by the export of nontraditional products, the export of  established products like sugar, nickel, and tobacco, and with  expeditious changes to reincorporate the country into the world  economy.    Rodriguez said the country will remain open to foreign  capital and stated that 129 associations with this type of  financing are currently operating in Cuba.    He said that the most serious obstacle in the way of this  program is the embargo that the United States has been applying  to the country for more than three decades. To this must be  added the country's foreign debt, which equals approximately $7  billion.    There are solutions, but they are extremely complex,  Rodriguez concluded.</p>

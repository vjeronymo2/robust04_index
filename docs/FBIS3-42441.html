Yakubchik] </F>   [Text] The KFZ-1 high-explosive shaped charge is designed  for accelerated demolition of roads, airfield runways, and  emplaced objects, and working frozen ground by the explosive  method.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Composition of KFZ-1                                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Stowage box--launching equipment      |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ID-120 rocket motor                   |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Z-23 high-explosive charge            |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |VZ-ZOM firing mechanism               |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KZ-5 shaped charge                    |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Accessories                           |1 set                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The KFZ-1 charge is assembled and set up at the place of use  by a two-man crew. The charge is actuated electronically using a  communication control line 100 meters long. The electric pulse  transmitted over the control line actuates the pyrotechnic  cartridge of the rocket motor. The rocket motor is started from  the pyrotechnic cartridge. After the motor achieves the required  reaction force, the KZ-5 shaped charge is detonated. The  shaped-charge jet of molten material thus formed creates a  borehole in the ground, which the high-explosive charge enters  under the action of the motor's reaction force. The  high-explosive charge detonates at a depth of 1.5-2 meters and  leads to the destruction of the buried object and formation of a  crater.    Depending on the task to be carried out, the KFZ-1 charge  can  be used alone or as part of a group of charges. The number of  charges in the group is limited only by the capabilities of the  current source.

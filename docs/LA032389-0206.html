			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HOLLY FARMS REJECTS TAKEOVER BID  </P> <P> Holly Farms Corp., the chicken processor embroiled in a five-month takeover  battle, said today that its board has rejected a sweetened $1.15-billion bid by  its rival Tyson Foods Inc.  </P> <P> Holly shares soon jumped 75 cents to $62.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Traders said the board's rejection may prompt Conagra Inc. -- Holly's "white  knight" in the chicken war -- to raise its own $1.06-billion offer for the  company.  </P> <P> Conagra, a giant food products concern, agreed to a $59.25-a-share stock swap  with Holly in December to rescue the company from Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson.  Tyson, the nation's top chicken producer, had been offering $63.50 a share for  Holly, which ranks fifth in the field.  </P></p>

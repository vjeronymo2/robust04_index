			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Tuskar agrees Colombian deal with Coplex Tuskar Resources, the Dublin-based exploration company, yesterday announced an agreement with Coplex which gives the Australian exploration company a 54 per cent interest in Tuskar's Rubiales and Piriri licences in Colombia, writes Tim Coone. In return Tuskar will receive up to 10m Coplex ordinary shares. Last week Coplex announced a surprise IPounds 4.67m (Pounds 4.36m) share-exchange bid for Tuskar which is expected to go ahead. Tuskar said that the purpose of the agreement was to secure drilling licences in the two fields which are due to expire in June. Last February Mr Neil O'Donoghue, chairman, announced that Tuskar was unable to raise the finance necessary to complete its drilling programme. Under the new deal, Coplex will fund the obligatory drilling programme in the two fields to meet the requirements specified by Ecopetrol, the Colombian state petroleum company, which will require some IPounds 3m and will secure the licences until June 1994.</p>

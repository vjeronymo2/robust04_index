			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Setback for Dutch hopes on organic fertiliser DUTCH LIVESTOCK farmers, facing calls for a forced reduction in their herds to cut back on manure-based pollution, have heard this week that manure-processing plants will probably not turn out to be the long-awaited solution to their dung surplus problem. But there was also good news for one of the most successful sectors in Dutch agriculture: the dung 'mountain' may not prove to be as big as once feared. In a provisional and confidential report, the country's applied science research body TNO and Heidemij, a consultancy group, said the combined capacity of the Netherlands' manure-processing plants will not exceed 1m tonnes a year by the end of 1994, well below the government's target of 6m tonnes a year. At the same time, the draft report, which was prepared for the government ahead of a definitive version due later this year, noted that processing manure into pellets for export was expensive, suggesting that the operations will be uneconomical. Until now, supporters of manure processing had said that the factories for converting surplus manure into exportable fertiliser would, at best, break even. However, leaked extracts from the report also show that the manure surplus, which is defined as the amount of extra dung which cannot safely be absorbed by farmland, will be closer to 2m at end-1994 rather than the projected 6m. Dutch farming organisations are pursuing a number of methods to reduce the manure surplus by making it less harmful. Among these are special equipment to inject manure into the soil rather than spreading it on top, reducing the amount of ammonia taken up into the air. Also specially-designed animal sheds that cut down on ammonia seepage are coming on to the market and Dutch farmers are experimenting with the composition of animal feed so that fewer undigested minerals and heavy metals remain in the manure.</p>

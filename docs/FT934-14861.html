			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: N Brown ahead 21% following growth in sales LOWER INTEREST costs and a healthy sales gain helped N Brown, the Manchester-based direct mail order group which specialises in clothing for older women, report a 21 per cent increase in first half profits. The pre-tax line increased to Pounds 9.02m (Pounds 7.44m) in the 26 weeks to August 28 on turnover ahead 8.3 per cent to Pounds 86.2m (Pounds 79.6m). Operating profits increased to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 9.4m). Interest costs fell by Pounds 647,000 to Pounds 1.16m with Pounds 400,000 of the decline attributable to lower rates and the balance reflecting an improved stock turn. This also helped reduce gearing, which fell to 33 per cent from 49 per cent a year earlier. Earnings per share increased from 6.84p to 8.29p and the interim dividend is raised from 1.95p to 2.25p. Turnover in the core home shopping division increased by 8.6 per cent and operating profits expanded 8.1 per cent to Pounds 10.4m. Mr Jim Martin, chief executive, said the increase in turnover mainly reflected customers ordering more items, and ordering more often. The group's established catalogues - J D Williams, Ambrose Wilson, Oxendales and the slightly more up-market Heather Valley - continued to grow and still account for the bulk of turnover and operating profits. These catalogues all cater for more mature customers and offer a much wider range of sizes and fittings than would be found in the High Street. Fashion World and Candid, the newer titles which were launched in 1991 and are designed for slightly younger customers, continued to increase their share of turnover and profit. They now account for 9 per cent of turnover. The group's small property and financial division made an operating profit of Pounds 48,000, against a comparable loss of Pounds 33,000, and a Pounds 240,000 deficit in last year's second half. Sir David Alliance, chairman, said all the autumn/winter catalogues had started well, with encouraging gains in average order values and some early indications that new customer recruitment is stronger than in the past few seasons.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Researchers unlock secret of locust swarms SCIENTISTS IN Kenya have identified behaviour-modifying chemicals in desert locusts that could be used to prevent them from swarming and devastating crops in Africa and Asia. Professor Thomas Odhiambo, director of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi, told a meeting at the House of Commons in London yesterday that research into preventing locust plagues was 'moving in the right direction'. His team has isolated chemicals which make many locusts reach sexual maturity and lay their eggs within a very short time of each other. This brings large numbers together and leads to swarming and migration to crop-growing regions. Prof Odhiambo said the research, which is costing Dollars 1.2m a year, could end the need for mass spraying of locust breeding grounds in semi-arid savannah where the insects serve an important role in recycling nutrients such as nitrogen. 'When you spray as you have been doing for years at the beginning of each outbreak, it's in very fragile environments. You're not asking permission from the pastoral communities and the insecticides end up in the camel milk which these people drink,' he said. If the research was successful, it could also overcome problems that arise from the misplaced generosity of international donors, he said. Donated pesticide left over from previous locust plagues was now lying leaking in dumps in Morocco and Somalia. 'These countries don't know how to deal with expired insecticides,' he said. 'There's no incinerator anywhere in Africa.' Prof Odhiambo said it was too early to specify how the chemicals would be used to prevent swarming and keep the locusts in their isolated, grasshopper state. 'In normal breeding grounds there are probably less than half a dozen locusts per hectare,' he said. 'From next year our concentration has to be in the field to understand how these chemicals are responsible for managing this behaviour. We think we've identified a small population in Namibia which has never swarmed and we need to understand why.' They also wanted to discover what made swarms of locusts break up and return to their isolated state. The research is being funded by the United Nations Development Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the German and Swedish governments. The initial four-year programme ends in December next year and Prof Odhiambo thinks at least 10 years of fieldwork will be needed.</p>

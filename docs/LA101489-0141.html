			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> CONSERVATION CORPS TO WORK ON PARKS  </P> <P> City parks will get $50,000 in fire safety improvements and environmental  planting, courtesy of the California Conservation Corps, city and corps  officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> "This is great for us, since it will pay for some work we have already started  at Wilderness Glen Park," said Wayne A. Lowery, the city's parks and recreation  director. "It's also working out well for the corps. It gives them an  opportunity to help teach their people about the environment."  </P> <P> Lowery, who said the corps notified him last week of its intention to donate  the work to the city, added that the same project may pay for improvements at  Oso Viejo Park.  </P> <P> The Wilderness Glen Park has already received help from the corps, but that  work, valued at $10,000, was paid for by the city. The additional improvements  will come out of the corps' public service budget.  </P> <P> Walter Hughes, district director for the Pomona Service District, said the  corps had chosen the project because it met all three criteria used to guide  corps work: The project serves a public benefit, is related to conservation and  provides valuable education for corps members, he said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- A top Chinese official  said here today that the five principles of peaceful  co-existence are of guiding significance in establishing a new  international political and economic order even 40 years after  first being advocated.    Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress (NPC), told an NPC forum marking the  40th birthday anniversary of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence that they "conform to the spirit of the United  Nations charter and illustrate the fundamental characteristics  of a new-type international relations."    The five principles of peaceful co-existence, namely the  mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,  non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence,  were first formulated by China and later advocated by China and  its neighboring countries of India and Myanmar (the former  Burma) in 1954.    At that time, Tian said, these principles represented the  common aspirations of the newly independent nations and their  peoples. Over the past 40 years, the five principles have been  accepted by more and more countries and "have played an  important role in maintaining world peace."    Tian said China is not only an advocate but also a faithful  follower of the principles. The country has established  diplomatic ties with 158 countries and developed economic,  trade, scientific and cultural exchanges and cooperation with  more than 200 countries and regions in the world.    The NPC also pursues active exchanges with foreign  counterparts on the basis of the five principles, establishing  friendly ties with 130 foreign parliaments and international  parliamentary organizations, he added.    Tian stressed that China will continue to adhere to the five  principles and will constitute no threat to any state or region,  even after it becomes stronger economically.    "China will forever be a stable factor for peace in the  Asia-Pacific region and the whole world," Tian said, adding  "China has never sought for hegemony, nor will it begin to seek  it."    Vice-chairpersons of the NPC Standing Committee Fei  Xiaotong,  Lei Jieqiong, Qin Jiwei and Li Peiyao attended the forum.  Leaders of non-communist parties and the foreign ministry made  speeches on the birth and development of the five principles,  and on the ever-growing role the principles play in the  international political and economic arena.    The forum was sponsored by the Foreign Affairs Committee of  the NPC.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: US puts commodities index at centre-stage - Plans for stabilising currencies IF at first you don't succeed, try, try again. That at any rate seems to be the motto of Mr James Baker, President George Bush's chief of staff and sometime US Treasury secretary. Mr Baker is deemed to be the man behind President Bush's proposal that countries use a basket of commodities, including gold, as a means of co-ordinating exchange rate movements. The president put the idea to finance ministers assembled in Washington for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in a speech on Sunday. The US put forward a similar idea at an IMF annual meeting five years ago when Mr Baker was in charge of the Treasury. But what is the basket of commodities supposed to do, and how could it help stabilise currencies? In spite of the tantalising reference to gold, the US suggestion does not amount to a proposal to restore the gold standard for currencies of pre-first world war days. Instead, the US idea is a development of the process, which exists at present in a low-key form, by which the leading industrial countries are supposed to co-ordinate their economic policies with reference to an agreed batch of economic indicators. An index of commodity prices, including gold, already exists. The US wants countries to monitor this index as a 'reference point' in the exchange rate system. Too sharp a change in the index in any given currency could indicate whether an economy was moving out of line with other industrialised economies. The basket could, in this way, stimulate or even trigger corrective action. The US idea is to create a new element of discipline in international monetary relations that is not as rigid as the fixed or semi-fixed exchange rate regime of the European Monetary System. The commodity basket with gold would, however, be more effective than simple peer group pressure exercised in meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The present divergences of economic policy among the Group of Seven are a poor advertisement for peer group activities. There is a thirst for new ideas on how to manage the world economy. Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the IMF, has urged member countries to come up with proposals. Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, in his speech to the IMF's policy-making interim committee, underlined that countries 'need to improve co-operation and redouble efforts at policy co-ordination' on a worldwide basis. Last week's crisis in the European Monetary System has shown the dangers of a fixed or semi-fixed rate regime when economic fundamentals get out of kilter with exchange rates. But is a commodity index the right approach? America's trading partners tend to be sceptical. Commodity prices can be very volatile, making such an index an unreliable guide to economic conditions. There is also a suspicion that the US as a leading producer of primary commodities and gold would benefit from the scheme more than other industrial countries. Other nations are uncertain how far the US, or any other country, would be bound to act by any movements in the index. There is also a puzzle over the economic rationale behind the proposal. When the US first advanced the idea in 1987, its interest rates were in double digits and it was seen as a way of possibly justifying lower borrowing costs. Now short-term US interest rates are at their lowest level since 1963. The rebirth of the idea probably owes far more to electoral politics. The hint of a new gold standard could appeal to the right wing of the Republican party and probably win President Bush some approving editorial coverage in the Wall Street Journal. The president's intervention also has given the impression that the US has a constructive role to play in the present uncertain international monetary climate, at little cost to the US Treasury.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 27 SAPA -- The KwaZulu government  paramilitary training camp outside Ulundi was allegedly raided  by the South African Police [SAP] on Tuesday [26 April] night, a  move which drew condemnation on Wednesday from the KwaZulu  Police [KZP].    KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During slammed the late night  raid as "highly suspect, provocative and unacceptable", adding  that it had jeopardised KZP/SAP relations.    SAP spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said on Wednesday morning he  was not aware of any raid, but promised to investigate the claim.    Gen During said the move was initiated by Mac Maharaj,  senior  African National Congress representative on the Transitional  Executive Council and lawyer Howard Varney who is investigating  alleged KZP hit squads.    Gen During said the SAP had told him the raid was executed  because training at the Mlaba camp was in contravention of the  state of emergency, declared in Natal/KwaZulu almost a month ago.    The SAP was also apparently seeking suspected members of  alleged hit squads who were supposed to have been harboured at  the camp, Gen During said.    Several arms, ammunition, a "large number" of manuals and  documents were seized in the raid, he added. But, "no evidence  of unlawful military or paramilitary training was found and  neither was there any trace of the so-called hit squad  suspects", Gen During said.    The general criticised the timing of the raid, saying it was  bound to affect goodwill which existed between the KZP and SAP.  "In many quarters this incident will no doubt be regarded as an  invasion and an aggression against the KwaZulu government and  people," he added.    The Mlaba camp has trained thousands of recruits to form  "self-protection units" throughout Natal and in the Transvaal,  but the ANC alleges its graduates have been involved in  fomenting violence.</p>

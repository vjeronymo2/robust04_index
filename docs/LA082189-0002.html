			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SMOKING IS LOSING, CLAIMS LEADER IN WAR ON OLD HABIT  </P> <P> America is winning its battle to eradicate smoking, according to David Burns,  an associate clinical professor of medicine at UC San Diego's Medical Center.  </P> <P> Progress toward a smoke-free society has been "stunning . . . and astounding .  . . given how long it takes for social change with a problem of this  magnitude," Burns said. "It's very similar to what's occurred with Mothers  Against Drunk Drivers."  </P> <P> Smoking has long been approached as an individual problem, but it's now seen as  a larger social issue, Burns said.  </P> <P> Burns no longer debates tobacco company representatives over the health effects  of smoking, "because it's no longer open to debate. . . . This agent causes  cancer." The debates he now takes part in focus on other issues -- such as  where and when smoking should be allowed.  </P> <P> Burns applauded San Diego's health, civic and school leaders for taking steps  to limit where and when smokers can light up. He is also buoyed by the passage  of Proposition 99 last November, which authorized the state to use a tobacco  tax to fund research into programs that will keep nonsmokers from starting to  smoke as well as to help smokers quit.  </P> <P> Proposition 99's passage signaled the public's growing belief that smokers and  tobacco companies should foot the bill for research, he said.  </P> <P> Nationally, Burns is encouraged that the National Cancer Institute, which  traditionally has funded research into curing cancer, now funds research that  will help smokers quit -- as well as preventing others from starting.  </P> <P> "NCI is looking at what will work in schools, the doctor's office, with women,  blacks and Hispanics," he said. They are testing to find out what works in  various segments of the community, he said. GREG JOHNSON  </P></p>

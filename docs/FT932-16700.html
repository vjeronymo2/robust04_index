			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A quiet one to watch - Investment Trusts FOR A TRUST with half a billion pounds in assets, Anglo &amp; Overseas gets surprisingly little attention. Indeed, one symptom of this low profile is the near-20 per cent discount at which the shares trade. These remain largely in the hands of institutional investors, perhaps because of the trust's lowish yield and the fact that its international portfolio makes it ineligible for full Pep status. But it could be argued that its aims - to invest in world-wide companies with greater emphasis on capital appreciation than income - are designed better for private investors than for institutions, which these days can manage international exposure for themselves. The trust was founded in 1890 as Anglo-American Debenture Corporation in order to buy bonds and other securities in the US, Canada and elsewhere. The 'debenture' tag was dropped as the portfolio became concentrated in equities, but the trust was known as Anglo-American Securities until 1987 when its name was changed to avoid confusion with the South African conglomerate. Morgan Grenfell took over management of the trust from Robert Fleming in 1981. The lead manager, James Fox, has been a fund manager since 1968. He joined Morgan Grenfell in 1985 after spells at Hill Samuel and Warburg Investment Management. As well as making the overall asset allocation decisions, he also looks after the continental European element of the portfolio. The rest of the team is Adrian Frost (UK), Kazuichi Mihara (Far East) and Alan Nesbit (the Americas). The trust is more international than most of its competitors - the UK weighting (39.9 per cent at the end of 1992) is designed to generate income. The rest of the portfolio at end 1992 was split: the Americas (19.8 per cent); Japan (19 per cent); other Far East (6 per cent); and Europe (15.3 per cent). Since then, the American portion has been reduced and the Japanese and European elements increased. Over the past few years, Anglo &amp; Overseas has had quite a high weighting in Japan relative to its competitors. This damaged its performance in 1990 when the Tokyo market fell out of bed, but has been of benefit in the opening quarter of 1993. Fox says the trust tries to take a contrarian approach, as shown by its increased exposure to Japan in the teeth of conventional wisdom. He cites, as another example, the trust's Pounds 15m direct investment into UK property over the past two years. 'We have bought five buildings outside London, on an average yield of around 10 per cent and with good tenants,' he says. Anglo-Overseas also believes it is the first trust to issue commercial paper (a form of short-term debt). It is using the paper to play the yield curve, borrowing short in dollars at 3.2 per cent and investing in dollar Eurobonds at 6.4 per cent. The 10 biggest investments in the portfolio reflect the international flavour. They are: Foxhurst (the property subsidiary); Generale des Eaux; BTR; BAT; GUS; Sandoz; Robert Fleming; Export-Import Bank of Japan (Eurobond); UBS; and Export Development Corporation (Eurobond). The trust's performance has been respectable, rather than inspiring. In terms of net asset value total return, it was 6th out of 14 trusts in the international capital growth sector over the year to March 1 with a rise of 25.1 per cent (according to the Association of Investment Trust Companies). Anglo &amp; Overseas was eighth (out of 12) in the sector over a five year period and fifth (out of 10) over a 10-year period. Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says: 'It is one of those trusts which has chugged away without doing anything special. 'Because of its size, it tends to be a core holding of institutional investment trust portfolios, but it has not really succeeded in attracting the private investor.' Hamish Buchan, of NatWest Securities, adds: 'It is a classic flexible international trust. It will never be a high yielder, but it has good revenue reserves and there is the prospect of steady dividend growth. It does not have the track record of Foreign &amp; Colonial, which explains why the discount is so wide.' But the discount does increase the attractions of the trust for those who want overseas exposure and who believe, like Morgan Grenfell, that the Japanese market is due for further recovery. Key facts Gross assets are around Pounds 525m and net assets were Pounds 469m. On April 1, this translated into net assets per share of 408.8p, according to NatWest Securities. This put the shares, then at 332p, on a discount of 18.8 per cent. The yield was 2.8 per cent. Morgan Grenfell's management expenses were 0.3 per cent of assets. Board The chairman is Lord Wakehurst, who has been on the board since 1968. Other directors are John Boyer, a former deputy chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Michael Dobson, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell; Peter Ogden, chairman of Computacenter; and James Fox. Lord Catto is about to retire. Savings scheme and Pep details The minimum monthly investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 30, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. The only charges are commission of 0.2 per cent and government stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. Because of its high overseas weighting, Anglo &amp; Overseas does not qualify for full Pep status. But as a non-qualifying trust, self-select Pep investors could put Pounds 1,500 a year into it.</p>

There will be no  surprises.    The admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak  Republics to NATO would not only not strengthen European  security but could, on the contrary, exacerbate the internal  political situation in Russia and complicate relations between  the Western capitals and Moscow. That is Paris' position, which  is supported on the whole by its allies.    "The entry of East European countries to the North Atlantic  Alliance would be premature today. It would fundamentally alter  the very nature of the North Atlantic Alliance, which agreement  envisages security guarantees in the event of a bloc member's  coming under attack," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe stated  in conversation with your correspondent.    "However, I do have a positive attitude to the strengthening  of relations between NATO and the states of East Europe and  between NATO and Russia," the minister went on to stress in  response to a question from IZVESTIYA; "therefore we have  supported in principle the American Partnership for Peace  initiative. Moreover, France and Germany intend to go further  and to propose that East European countries become associate  members of the Western European Union."    Partnership for Peace, the minister went on to explain, will  not become a cordon sanitaire between Europe and Russia. On the  contrary, this initiative is addressed to Moscow, whose  participation will be only welcome. Premature membership of  NATO for Poland, Hungary, and other countries would, on the  contrary, play the role of a kind of cordon sanitaire. Given  such conditions, Paris favors a more flexible form of  cooperation with them.    Europe has not been a peaceful and stable continent in  recent  years, the minister also said. Alongside the instability in  Russia -- our great partner --crises continue in other parts of  Europe. Therefore it is essential that we engage first and  foremost in preventive activity. To that end France is calling  a conference on stability in Europe, which will take place in  Paris in April and to which Russia and the United States have  been invited.</p>

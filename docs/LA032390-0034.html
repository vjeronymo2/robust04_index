			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> EASTVIEW LITTLE LEAGUE NEEDS MORE THAN $1 MILLION TO COMPLETE FACILITY  </P> <P> San Pedro Baseball Inc., which needs $1.6 million to build a new home for the  Eastview Little League, is still more than $1 million short of its goal despite  breaking ground for the new facility recently. President Gary Miley said San  Pedro Baseball has raised slightly more than $320,000 so far, most of it in a  lump sum of $300,000 from Unocal. Miley indicated, however, that the group  expects to receive several other grants soon. In addition, he said, local  businesses have agreed to donate labor and supplies at cost to build the  facility. The 15-acre site at Gaffey Street and Capitol Drive is being prepared  for grading. It is expected to hold five fields, including four with lights,  and seating for 500 people. Opening is slated for spring, 1991. Miley is  accepting donations at 1931 N. Gaffey St., Suite F, San Pedro 90731. Or call  (213)-5-FIELDS.  </P> <P> San Pedro resident Herbert Bobo, who has an eight handicap, still remembers the  day two years ago when he recorded the only hole in one of his golfing career.  Bobo, now 78, put his tee shot in the middle of the cup on the 120-yard seventh  hole at the Palos Verdes Shores Mobile Estates Ltd. nine-hole course on April  12, 1988. Bobo, a resident of the Estates, began playing the game when he was 8  years old and still gets out twice a week.  </P> <P> The Division 4 boys all-star team from Redondo Beach Region 34 of the American  Youth Soccer Organization recently advanced to the first round of the Southern  California Sectionals before being eliminated. Coached by Gemma Scharfenberger  and Steve Smith, the team consisted of R. J. Smith, Brant Boston, Joseph  Cartlidge, Matthew Hammer, John Lockhart, Jason Funes, Nicholas Plancich, Nicky  De Crescenzo, Matthew Miles, Aron Kogan, Jason Linley, James Zelenay, Jeff  Gayhart and goalie Adam Echavarria.  </P></p>

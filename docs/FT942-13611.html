			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Fashion icons Icons may seem an unlikely subject for the attention of fashionable collectors, made as they originally were for purely devotional reasons. But fashionable they have become. The Greek word Eikona means an image, and the word has come to be used to embrace all those devotional portraits that were first made in the early days of Christianity. As Christianity spread so did the impetus to create religious images. It is an entirely traditional art form, with all the spare beauty of early Italian primitive paintings. Even these days, the modern icons emerging from the monasteries and small family ateliers in eastern Europe usually follow the traditions strictly. As they are largely unsigned, no cult has developed around any 'name' and they are therefore judged almost exclusively on their intrinsic artistic merits and spiritual qualities. In eastern Europe persuading gullible tourists to buy 'genuine old' icons seems to be a new street-spiv sport but for those who love them and like collecting them, London is now the centre of icon-dealing in the west. For those who want to be sure of the provenance, Maria Andipa's gallery in Walton Street has one of the largest collections in the world, ranging in price from Pounds 140 to more than Pounds 100,000. All are painted in the traditional way - tempera on a wooden panel, Pounds 140 would buy a very small (3-4 ins square) late 19th century version or it would buy one of the many small travelling icons made in cast-brass and that were such a potent source of first world war miracle mythology (they were the ones that worn in the breast pocket stopped the bullet). On the other hand, Pounds 100,000 would buy a fine museum-quality large piece, dating from the 15th or 16th century and from a very exquisite 'school'. For those interested in the subject, the gallery will be bringing out a brochure on the subject towards the end of next month and Maria Andipa herself has a learned article on the subject in the current issue of Debrett's magazine. The gallery is small but has great charm - a small portion is designed as an old Greek church crypt. Fair Trade Links was founded by a group of people who, while working in Romania, decided that setting up a proper trading relationship with Romania and bringing its wares to the west was the best way to help it recover from the traumas of the Ceausescu regime. For those for whom antiquity is not essential (although for me a certain history is part of their charm) these are excellent value. All the icons it has to offer are modern - they are the output of monasteries, families, church restorers and painters working today. Though contemporary they are all painted within the strict tradition handed down from generation to generation. Icon painting was highly dangerous in the Ceausescu years but several of the artists went on painting as an act of devotion and gave the icons away so as not to make a profit. In particular the diptych, which could be shut like a book, was often carried by the devout, being much less conspicuous than a crucifix. Some artists in the remote monasteries who find it difficult to get hold of materials now use oil paints but those from Bucharest are painted with tempera and gold-leaf. Prices of the modern versions range from Pounds 80 to Pounds 200 and some can be found at Manchester Cathedral and at the Barley Hall shop in York. The biggest selection of all is at Fair Trade Links headquarters in St Albans. Maria Andipa &amp; Son Icon Gallery, 162 Walton Street, London SW3. Tel: 071-589-2371.

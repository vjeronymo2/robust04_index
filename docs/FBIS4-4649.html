			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- Seoul is planning wider  market opening to American automobiles and planning to start  negotiations with the United States, trade officials said  Saturday. The measure comes as Washington showed readiness to  launch a full-scale drive into the South Korean market with a  warning of invoking 301 trade provision against Seoul. The U.S.  National Trade Estimate (NTE) made available Friday criticized  Seoul's formal and informal barriers that have "virtually closed  Korea's 1.1 million-unit passenger car market to U.S.-built  motor vehicle exports."    Initial plans include gradually lowering the import tariff  from the current 10 percent to around 7.5 percent, the officials  said. An inter-ministerial meeting led by vice trade, industry  and resources minister is planned on Monday to set the details.    The government will start first with improving non-tariff  barriers, such as active public message that the government will  not impose disadvantages to those buying foreign cars, allowing  more and larger show rooms and giving air time for  advertisements during prime time slots. These issues are likely  to be tabled formally at a meeting between South Korean Trade  Minister Kim Chol-su and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  this month during the signing period of the Uruguay Round [UR]  agreement in Morocco, the officials said on condition of  anonymity.    The Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry has been the main  opposer but very recently agreed to consider the auto market  opening more positively, according to the officials.    Seoul and Washington had agreed to address the issue at the  minister level during last December's bilateral UR negotiations.  This agreement is included in their record of understanding.  U.S. requests include import tariff reduction schedule, revision  to the current local tax system where taxes are levied according  to engine size, consequently working against larger American  models. Washington officials suggest levying taxes according to  the level of fuel efficiency instead of engine size.    The NTE points out that imported cars in South Korea  accounted for only 0.2 percent of Korea's market in 1933. The  blatant anti-import campaign of the mid-1980s has waned but  similar signals still continue, the report said.    "Korea's duty of 10 percent compares highly unfavorably to  the 2.5 percent duty assessed Korean automobiles entering the  United States," it said. "The U.S. objective is to ensure that  U.S. motor vehicles have the same access to the Korean market as  Korean motor vehicles have to the U.S. market," it said.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Japan's banks 'face tougher environment' FINANCIAL de-regulation has forced Japanese banks to increase efficiency, but the results of liberalisation have been partly obscured by 'excessive' expansion during the speculative era of the late 1980s, according to a Bank of Japan report which was released yesterday. A central bank study found that commercial banks have generally reduced operating costs since the early 1980s, and that there is no 'clear sign' that higher interest charges were used to compensate for increases in interest payments to customers. However, the bank concluded that Japanese banks are 'likely (to) face a more severe environment' in the future, partly because cost savings accompanying the introduction of new technology have been realised, and because 'excessive expansion by some banks in the late 1980s increased their credit risks'. Since the late 1970s, and under pressure from the US government, Tokyo has gradually liberalised financial markets, with the Foreign Exchange Law amended in 1980 and discussion continuing over the role of banks in the securities industry. The de-regulation of interest rates on virtually all time and ordinary deposits is scheduled to be completed by 1994. The issue of de-regulation has become entangled in the troubled trade relationship between the US and Japan. However, the central bank emphasised the virtues of change: 'It should be noted that the de-regulation process stimulates market competition, urging banks to achieve further efficiency and ultimately enhancing the economic welfare of a nation.' Bank of Japan researchers found that the quality of services provided to depositors has 'significantly improved' in recent years through the expansion of automatic payment systems and automated teller machines. However, the report suggests that the banks' desire to broaden their customer base has increased their exposure to credit risk, while the expansion of the corporate bond market will limit the banks' ability to offset increased funding costs by marking up lending rates. 'Banks will inescapably face a more competitive environment in the future,' the report said. 'In addition, the credit risks of some financial institutions seem to have increased owing to imprudent expansionary activities during the monetary ease of the late 1980s.' The central bank insisted that the increase in credit risk does not mean that deregulation was a mistake, but shows that 'some banks were not fully prepared for financial de-regulation in terms of credit risk management'.</p>

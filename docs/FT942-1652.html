			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Arts: Storey's 'Home' revived - Theatre You should have seen it with Gielgud and Richardson: the people who said that two years ago about David Leveaux's staging of Pinter's 1976 No Man's Land can say it again now about his staging of David Storey's 1970 Home. They are, of course, right - yet they miss the point. Home, like No Man's Land, is less substantial without its great original double-act, but it still holds together remarkably well. Its new cast, led by the well-known double-act of Paul Eddington and Richard Briers, completely holds the attention, shifting between comedy and poignance with consummate ease. This is the more impressive, since nothing happens in Home more eventful than a minor character lifting furniture and removing it from the stage. The 'home' of the title, the play gradually allows us to realise, is an institution for the mentally disturbed. A large part of the play's comic entertainment consists of wandering small talk between the two men, and a large part of its painful impact lies in what they leave unsaid - with the anguish they can never bring themselves to address in words. Harry and Jack are educated and clubbable upper-middle-class types, so sensitive that, if someone else so much as suggests that a spade might be a spade, they hasten to discuss the weather. The play's most striking irony lies in their conversations with the dissimilar Marjorie and Kathleen, who are lower-class, outspoken, quite prepared to air sexual, lavatorial, and psychological issues - and thereby expose the pathetic evasiveness of the two men. It was Gielgud, as Harry, whose performance left the most indelible and affecting impression on me when in my teens I saw a TV broadcast of the original cast. Yet Paul Eddington's account of the same role is so fully alive to the larger mental issues that dwell amid the details of the play, that Gielgud's ghost never haunts the stage: an exorcism even more successful than his account of the Gielgud role in No Man's Land. Eddington's Harry is a ravaged shell. It helps that he now looks far more haggard than two years ago; more vital, however, is the beautiful weight of sorrow he conveys. It is there before he speaks a word, simply as he closes his eyes on first sitting down alone. And it is there at the end in the hush in which he says 'The sun has set'. His mastery of comedy surfaces to marvellous effect in tiny crises of uncertainty, as when Jack asserts that a friend of his 'was introduced to George VI at Waterloo'. With utter tact, yet also with appalled bewilderment, Eddington simply echoes 'Waterloo?' 'The station', Jack explains, and relief returns. Every device in Richard Briers's armoury works to characterise Jack to fine effect: light charm, merry chuckle, mouth hanging open in pleasant stupidity, ingratiating cuteness, spiffing delivery of ordinary banter. Briers does nothing wrong, but his way of tackling the role's inner misery is flyweight. Richardson brought to the role, among other things, gravitas; and my ear kept telling me how he surely delivered the lines. Briers's mental pain remains hidden from us, as Eddington's does not. Nor is anything in Briers's performance a surprise. The roles of Marjorie and Kathleen are harder to achieve with complete success. Storey gives them a kind of verbal shorthand, with few pronouns or verbs, that seems mannered now. This apart, both Brenda Bruce and Rowena Cooper catch the contradictions that make each role interesting. Bruce's Marjorie is hard, sceptical, only occasionally revealing the tenderness that has made her sometimes wail for days; Cooper's Kathleen hardly ever lets a radiant grin leave her face, even as she talks of her several suicide attempts. In terms of the larger history of modern theatre, Home is not a momentous play. It has clear echoes of Beckett (Waiting For Godot, Happy Days), and its treatment of mental disturbance is scarcely radical. But so what? It is written with such skill that the attention never flags, and its ambiguity of tone is compelling. I have a few minor cavils about Leveaux's staging. (Some pauses should have been weightier; the women are sometimes too close to caricature; the role of Alfred is miscast; and one change of lighting says too obviously 'The mood darkens'.) But everything about this 24-year-old play is alive; the ensemble playing is exemplary; and Eddington gives one of the finest performances now before the London public. At Wyndham's Theatre</p>

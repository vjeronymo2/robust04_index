			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katsumi Hoshino, professor of Tama University: </F> "The Potential for New Industries Based on the Anticipated  Consumer Culture"]    [Text] Automobiles, televisions, and refrigerators,  products which have constituted the focus of 20th century  industry, have reached consumption saturation. It is said that  industry enters a period of change from the new to the old in  increments of 100 years, but how will new industries linked to  the 21st century differ? Twelve trends are examined.    Today, at the end of the 20th century, the root causes of  the  extended major business slump are the structural changes in both  lifestyle and sense of value on the part the members and  consumers living in our high-powered consumer society.  Materialistic consumption in the subsistence areas of "clothing,  food, and shelter," which was the 20th century lifestyle focus,  has reached saturation and, therefore, a limit. Industry of the  20th century, which is based on this, is therefore directly  confronted by growth limits and will be forced into retooling  and long-term structural adjustments into the next century.  Industry is in an "end-of-century structural slump," marking a  period of fundamental shift from the old to the new.    By contrast, 21st century lifestyles and industry are now  budding. With the sure spread of a lifestyle that takes  non-materialistic living seriously, where are the possibilities  for new businesses to be found? Permit me to try and predict  these new business trends into the 21st century, resulting from  a multifaceted gathering of information and analysis.  <H5>  The Changing View of Clothing, Food, and Shelter </H5>   First, in terms of the "clothing" aspect of the basic  necessities of clothing, food, and shelter, we are led to  consider "consumer fashions." Although up to now "designer  fashions" done by eminent designers have occupied the fashion  mainstream, the consumer herself will now be able to select from  the growing flood of fashion selections to emphasize her own  individuality, using her own fashion ability. Consumers will  suddenly be made aware that they themselves can coordinate the  flow of fashion products. It is not the designer controlling  sensibility and fashion, but the consumer through her own  lifestyle who will be able to manage her own fashion life. The  fashion business will be transformed in the future.    In 1992, Onward made a hit in commercializing consumer  fashions with a product line called, "Suite." It is a commercial  development made on the premise that the consumer herself will  combine individual pieces. We can now see the same trend in such  products as Renown's "AAR" and World's "OZOC." One is not led to  conclude that the fashion industry has reached the saturation  limit; rather, new business possibilities are arising through  wrestling with consumer fashion principles.    The second area is "food." We speak of a gluttonous society  and we also see in children incidents of diabetes and even  geriatric diseases. Thus, it is natural that healthy and natural  foods should draw our attention. Chinese medicine is again being  reviewed at the Toyo Medical School, and with health rules based  afresh on natural principles, Chinese traditional nutrition and  the art of meritorious chi are in the limelight.    In contrast to the art of meritorious chi, which introduces  universal natural energy into the mind and body, Chinese  traditional nutrition involves eating just as they are those  foods which contain the life force, energy, and nutrients of  universal nature. Although it is said that nutrition has a more  than 5,000 year history, attempts are now underway to study it  scientifically.    For example, it was announced at an academic conference that  a component of catechin found in tannin in tea has efficacy in  suppressing cancer. Foods containing green tea itself are under  development and Chinese and Japanese teas have become highly  popular. Beta carotene is another nutrient that has gained  attention for its cancer suppressing ability. Furthermore,  research continues on chitosan found in the shells of crabs and  shrimp which is effective in lowering blood pressure and on the  utility of food fibers and rice bran sugar which activate colon  bacteria. We are led to consider trends toward converting these  sorts of things into food.    Furthermore, there is said to be a booming market of nearly  50 billion yen for natural water and it is now being added to  tofu base, pickles, beer, diluted whiskey, and Japanese sake.  There is potential for natural water and products using natural  water to grow in the future. One can conceive of scientific  development and production of ultra-pure water of perhaps the  same quality as natural water. There is the artificially  produced [sekomu] mineral water called "[Sekomu] Safe Water,"  which is close to "scientific water."    Third is the issue of housing. A housing environment will be  sought which I call "five and sixth sense housing," which can  fully satisfy the five human senses as well as our sixth sense.  Urban civilization and culture have been thought to run counter  to nature, but now people want to incorporate nature into their  living space. Currently a hit are plants, pets, and home  aquariums which combine environmental technology with the use of  water. These can be seen as fresh "amenity conditioners" that  combine natural breezes and natural light with the beauty of  shade which are hallmarks of Japanese residential culture.  Devices which direct sunlight to underground rooms and rooms  with a northern exposure are on the market. The point is how to  present an agreeable environment close to nature using current  technology.    If we look back on history, the Phoenix Hall of the Uji  Byodoin Temple and Taian Hermitage of Rikyu constitute a world  of virtual reality of Buddhist paradise and perhaps now we can  manifest the spiritual world of Zen nothingness. In Japanese  residential culture, there is much know-how regarding this kind  of interface and interaction with nature. It would seem  necessary in modern housing to incorporate this kind of thing,  of taking lessons from the past.  <H5>  The Potential for a "Spiritual" Industry </H5>   Although the concept of "from the material to the spiritual"  has been discussed for ages, Japan's consumer society truly has  an excess of "things," such as household appliances, furniture,  and automobiles, which have been the focus of the basic  necessities of clothing, food and shelter. I have been calling  the "spiritual" aspect of this "HEALCI" (healthy), which  embodies this concern. "H" stands for health, "E" for education,  "A" for amusement, "L" for leisure, "C" for culture, and "I" for  intelligence or information. We are led to believe that people  have an interest in this area and will make it an important part  of consumption.    Then, the fourth area is health, which comes first. In the  area of health in the narrow sense will be growth in home  medicine, family medicine, and family checkups. Health  instruments one can use for self-examinations at home are  already on the market, for example, instruments to check for  diabetes by testing urine, wristwatches that check blood  pressure, and pregnancy test kits. The trend toward  self-management of health will be a new business area brought on  by cooperation among the leading industrial nations.    Fifth is leisure. There was at one time an explosive boom in  resort development, but speaking of resorts, the conspicuous  ease of tennis courts and golf courses with their problem of  spontaneous deterioration caused them to reach a limit.    An age of "leisure time farming" will come in the future. We  may find resorts offering agriculture, fisheries, and animal  husbandry businesses on a leisure time basis, allowing families  and friends to do farming. The point is that they will be able  to commune with nature and themselves. Autocamps were perhaps  forerunners of this.    In England, travel to see cattle-raising has become an  industry. In New Zealand, one travel product in the agricultural  industry is a "farm stay" where one visits with a farm family  and shears sheep. Also, in Japan, urban agricultural parks in  Setagaya and Narima-ku are filled to capacity. As the nobility  was familiar with the agricultural and fisheries industries, for  today's city dwellers, leisure agriculture resorts will in the  future also be a major interest. Even so, facilities will not be  lacking, such as showers in order to tide the visitor over  comfortably.    Sixth is the much talked about area of multimedia, which is  developing into a major industry. Although the attention of the  business world has been focused on games, a truly diverse  industry involving culture, the arts, and education, and carried  on multimedia, is a possibility.    For example, in the area of the arts, we are led to consider  ultra art reproduction. Art will lack canvas and frames; that  is, it will be stored on CD-ROM's, and people will be able to  call it up for display at any time. One will not need to leave  the house nor will the art become subject to speculation,  linking this to democratization of the arts. As for education,  it will be important to generate curricula and texts which will  invigorate the diverse potential of multimedia. Culture will be  produced scientifically and it is a certainty that multimedia  culture, which will incorporate "cultural science," which in  turn will combine the sensitivities of the artist, will become a  colossal business in the coming century. It is said it will be a  500 trillion yen business worldwide.    The next, or seventh area, stemming from the information  superhighway, is the concept of "electronic retailing." Although  CATV [cable television] is now used exclusively, ultimately  shopless marketing will be carried on the B-ISDN [broadband  integrated services digital networks] network. Movies, video,  music, and educational programs will simply be brought up on  home terminal displays. The same will be true for games. Today,  already, Sega Enterprises is delivering 100 to 150 different  games on an experimental basis on the Tokyo CATV Network.    The leading U.S. telecommunications company and Sumitomo  Shoji will conduct experiments on Suginami CATV in a cooperative  investment. When this begins, consumers will be able to order  directly from their homes by referring to electronic media  catalogs and detailed product information while simultaneously  drawing on funds in their bank accounts in order to make  payment. In the United States, the concept of an information  superhighway, the B-ISBN, has been announced and will be in  place by the year 2000.    Although I have discussed leisure some already, eighth is  the  possibility of "cyber amusement," which will combine the human  senses with mechanical apparatuses. For example, when we attempt  to measure the brain waves of children absorbed in the family  computer, we find Zen-like alpha waves. Children also achieve  Zen-like satori while playing games. Although there is talk that  the Formula I race car driver Ayrton Senna saw God in the middle  of a race, it may be that he was experiencing the same sort of  thing. Importantly, in studying the ultra "giddiness boundaries"  and making free use of high tech, electronics, and mechatronics,  we will develop a leisure of the brain and senses. Body  sensation games come close to this.  <H5>  The Age of the "Brain Industry" </H5>   As a ninth area, industry of the future will probably  surpass  the information industry and achieve importance as a "brain  industry." People who are in the lead in the industrial world  are not white collar but "platinum collar," that is, a "brain  tribe" who do brain work, for whom it will be necessary to  cultivate "brain tools," which will give rise to  high-value-added "brain products." Called cyber devices, they  are the product of advances in computer technology. Today  computers continue shrinking in size such that we now have  palm-sized "palmtops." Apple's "Newton" and Sharp's "GEOS" are  on the market.    With computers becoming endlessly smaller and with  handwriting recognition, data communications, and telephonic  capabilities, they become an extension of our brains. Every  individual will have a cyber device as a surrogate for his  brain. The way these high-powered information knowledge products  achieve this may be as "brain tools."    The 10th area is the era of a "brain industry," with offices  becoming brain offices and cities where research centers are  sited called "brain cities." Developing these brain cities may  become a new business area.    Large factories and office buildings will be unnecessary in  the cities of the future. Because shops will also be unnecessary  with the information superhighway, one is led to believe that  large buildings will also become unnecessary in large cities. If  this happens, it will be natural that these become the biggest  casualties of urban culture.    The 11th trend will be the appearance of the ecological  city,  which will incorporate nature. In the "Biosphere," which was  built in the United States in the state of Arizona, a space  colony-like situation was created in a capsule with seven to  eight scientists now living in it experimentally. It is a city  which exists as a living body by incorporating nature.    Prototypes of nature incorporated in the city produced and  managed with scientific technology have been the realization in  Funabashi City in Chiba Prefecture of an indoor ski slope called  SSAWS, the "Shiigaya" indoor seaside pool in Miyazaki  Prefecture, and an artificial wave pool at "Wild Blue Yokohama"  in Yokohama. With lighting technology imitating the sun in the  Tokyo Dome, there is also the possibility of neighborhood  industries involving the atmosphere of cities.    The "brain city" and the "nature city" will be the  mainstream  cities in the future.    Finally, I offer as the 12th area "electronic brain  religion." Although earlier I introduced alpha waves of children  using the family computer, research into brain functions  connecting science to human emotion is progressing with the  development of the computer. Integrating the results, it will  probably be possible to reproduce something akin to a  religious-like experience with electronic technology. For  example, a company in northern Kyushu called Sunray, using  virtual reality, expects to open a theme park in 1995 that will  give visitors experience with facing death. As a  pseudo-religious theme park, it is an original idea for a  business.    This type of electronic brain religion, in contrast to the  life worth living, can create an "industry of death worth  dying." It will be an industry to fulfill the desire to live  life fully up to the moment of death, as with hospices today and  decisions on the scattering of ashes. In the United States, the  Tibetan Book of the Dead is being used in  psychological treatment to prepare AIDS patients to meet death.  <H5>  Human "Mental Abilities," the Ultimate Resource </H5>   The above introduces 12 future business possibilities,  although new marketing approaches will be extremely important  for 21s-century style new businesses. Companies first will find  it necessary to build systems that foster integrated intellect,  knowledge, and information, that is, a "corporate brain."  Furthermore, with major change today saturating 20th century  industry, the ability to anticipate and foresee the future will  be indispensable.    Moreover, we could say, without judging culture emotionally  or intuitively, that an era has arrived which will develop  scientifically. In order to foster the development of  multimedia, "cultural science" must be tackled. Consumers, as  urbanites, are human beings. If "human research" is neglected,  one cannot achieve ultimate customer satisfaction.    New business marketing in a high-powered era will be the  knowledge industry, which will be the embodiment of  post-capitalism. Automation and product quality management will  be necessary with advances in brain work productivity. The  "mental ability" of people is the ultimate resource. In terms of  insight, genius, intuition, and inspiration, humans possess  enormous latent "mental abilities" and in activating them  through scientific analysis, "filiation science strategies" and  "filiation science marketing" based on filiation science, which  is the science of human thought, will be needed.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Gilts: Tremors over cornucopia of issues IN A quiet week for the gilt market, the focus switched to what is in store for investors in the financial year beginning in April. There will be a cornucopia of new bond issues to pay for the looming deficit on UK public spending - a fact that is starting to send tremors around the market. The nervousness about the effects of a big supply of gilts restrained the general downward pressure on bond yields. Sharply higher bond issues to finance the estimated Pounds 24bn public-sector borrowing requirement in 1992-1993 are likely to lead to an over-supply of the instruments, depressing prices and raising yields. Last week, gilt yields edged down slightly, with short-dated instruments performing better than those above 10 years. On Friday night the yield of the benchmark Treasury 9 per cent bond maturing in 2008 was quoted at 9.23 per cent, while the shorter-dated Treasury 10 per cent stock maturing in 1994 was 9.53 per cent. Yields for short-dated securities showed a relatively large fall of up to 20 basis points on the week. This was due to theories that the firmer pound might prompt a cut in base rates, now at 10.5 per cent. The pressures on funding will be underlined this Wednesday, when the Bank of England is to auction Pounds 1.8bn of 9 3/4 per cent Treasury stock, maturing in 2002. The Bank's announcement last week about the volume of stock surprised some market participants, and caused some easing in prices across the yield curve. The largest issue in a run of five similar events in 1991 was restricted to Pounds 1.5bn. On Friday the Bank said it would issue a tranche of index-linked gilts worth Pounds 300m. The instruments are in two separate issues, each worth Pounds 150m, with the bonds concerned being the 2 1/2 per cent stocks due 2001 and 2009. Issue prices will be certified later by the government broker. Assuming the auction and the sales of index-linked gilts go smoothly, it appears that the Bank will have issued virtually all the stock it requires to finance the 1991-1992 PSBR, which many economists believe will be about Pounds 13bn. There may even be a small amount of over-funding - money that can be held over to the next financial year. This could be extremely useful for the Bank and the Treasury, for in 1992-1993 funding pressures are likely to be even greater. The deficit is likely to soar due to higher spending on unemployment and other aspects of social security linked to the recession. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, may also be tempted, in the March Budget, to push up levels of government spending in discretionary areas such as transport, while at the same time government tax income is falling below estimates. All this may mean total gilt funding - allowing for repayments on maturing debts - approaches Pounds 30bn for 1992-1993, roughly twice the level in 1991-1992. Coming so soon after a period of minimal gilt issues - the government ran a small public spending surplus in 1990-1991 - the large issues are giving market managers at the Bank a few headaches. They will have to arrange a programme of funding that is flexible enough to meet the needs of gilt investors, at the same time as maximising the potential for selling the bonds at high prices. The Bank may settle for a programme of auctions roughly every two months - at which Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn of the securities are on sale each time - supplemented by a tranche of smaller debt issues periodically. All the signs are that the funding programme ahead will restrain any gilt price rise generally good economic conditions for bonds. The subdued state of UK inflationary pressures, a factor helpful for bond prices, was underlined last week with news of a 1.2 per cent fall in manufacturing output in the three months to November compared with the previous three-month period. This pointed towards flat or negative output for the UK as a whole - excluding North Sea oil and gas production - for the final quarter of 1991. If this turns out to be the case, the recession will have lasted for six quarters, making it the longest UK recession since the Second World War. With little sign of a recovery, inflation will be one of the few aspects of the UK economy that policymakers will not need to worry about during the next few months.</p>

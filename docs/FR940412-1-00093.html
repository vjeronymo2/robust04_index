The total ventilation must be at least five air changes per hour, based on the empty hold. Ventilation must be such that no escaping gas can reach accommodation or work spaces, on or under deck.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) An unmanned barge which is provided with natural ventilation need not comply with paragraph (d) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Each space adjacent to a hold containing material described in paragraph (a) of this section must be well ventilated with mechanical fans. No person may enter that space unless it has been tested to ensure that it is free from phosphine and arsine gases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Scuttles and windows in accommodation and work spaces adjacent to holds containing material described in paragraph (a) of this section must be kept closed while this material is being loaded and unloaded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Each cargo hold bulkhead containing material described in paragraph (a) of this section adjacent to accommodation and work spaces must be gas tight and adequately protected against damage from any unloading equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) When a hold containing material described in paragraph (a) of this section is equipped with atmosphere sampling type smoke detectors with lines that terminate in accommodation or work spaces, those lines must be blanked off gas-tight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) If a hold containing material described in paragraph (a) of this section must be entered at any time, the hatches must be open for two hours prior to entry to dissipate any accumulated gases. The atmosphere in the hold must be tested to ensure that there is no phosphine or arsine gas present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) After unloading material described in paragraph (a) of this section, each cargo hold must be thoroughly cleaned and must be tested to ensure that no phosphine or arsine gas remains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;148.260  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Ferrous metal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (a) This part does not apply to the stowage and transportation in bulk of stainless steel borings, shavings, turnings, or cuttings; nor does this part apply to an unmanned barge on a voyage entirely on the navigable waters of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Ferrous metal may not be stowed or transported in bulk unless the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All wooden sweat battens, dunnage and debris must be removed from the hold before the ferrous metal is loaded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) During loading and transporting, the bilge of each hold in which ferrous metal is stowed or will be stowed must be kept as dry as practical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) During loading, the ferrous metal must be compacted in the hold as frequently as practicable with a bulldozer or other means that provides equivalent surface compaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) No other material may be loaded in a hold containing ferrous metal unless_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The material to be loaded in the same hold with the ferrous metal is not a material listed in table 148.10 of this part or a readily combustible material;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The loading of the ferrous metal is completed first; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The temperature of the ferrous metal in the hold is below 55 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (131 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) or has not increased in eight hours prior to the loading of the other material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) During loading, the temperature of the ferrous metal in the pile being loaded must be below 55 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (131 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Upon completion of loading the vessel may not leave the port unless_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

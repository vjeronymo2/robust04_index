			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A Birmingham, Ala., judge who issued an arrest warrant for Siran Stacy said the  Alabama tailback will be given extra time to pay off his fine for speeding and  driving with a suspended license.  </P> <P> North Courtland traffic court Judge Rod Alexander said he talked with Stacy  Wednesday, a day after issuing the warrant for his arrest when he didn't  complete payment on a $192 fine. He said Stacy misunderstood the instructions  on the ticket.  </P> <P> Stacy was ticketed earlier this fall for speeding and driving with a suspended  license. He pleaded guilty to the charges at an Oct. 17 hearing and made  partial payment on the fine, with instructions to pay the balance by Tuesday's  court date.  </P> <P> When payment was not received and Stacy did not appear in court, Alexander  routinely issued the arrest warrant.  </P></p>

[passage omitted]    He said the rectors and principals of the universities,  colleges, and institutes play an important role in making the  education policy effective and helping the peaceful pursuit of  education. To further the peaceful pursuit of education and to  maintain discipline in students, he added, the teachers from  colleges and universities were given refresher courses at the  Institute of Public Service in Phaunggyi. He told the rectors  and principals to oversee and implement the pragmatic use of  experience and knowledge which the teachers had gained at the  refresher courses. He also said that destructive elements were  waiting in the wings, eyeing any weakness in the administration  and management in order to disrupt the peaceful pursuit of  education. That is why responsible personnel need to plan and  to make arrangements on how it should be prevented. If a  problem occurs, either big or small, the respective parties have  to coordinate and present the matter to the higher authorities  and resolve the problem at the same time. He added that  teachers will achieve their goal if they always review the  procedures of maintaining discipline for the peaceful pursuit of  education and work under the management and supervision of the  rectors and principals. He said students needed to be guided  and progressively organized so that there would be better  maintenance of discipline in the schools. The student youths as  citizens also have a responsibility to respect the country's  laws, regulations, and by-laws, which are respected by the  public. [passage omitted]</p>

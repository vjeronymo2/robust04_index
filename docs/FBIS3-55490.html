			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] For several days the Georgians have been  preoccupied with two sensational news stories: first is the  death of Gamsakhurdia, and the second, even more powerful, is  that, according to rumors, 25,000 Russian troops have been  brought into Georgia and are stationed in Tbilisi, near the  Vaziani military airfield. To be honest, the people are more  interested in Gamsakhurdia's suicide. [passage omitted]    As for the introduction of 25,000 Russian soldiers, the best  informed person -- Georgia's Security Minister Igor Georgadze --  has given us an answer to this question:    [Georgadze] As for 25,000 Russian soldiers being stationed  on  Georgian territory, I can tell you with full responsibility that  this does not correspond to reality.    [Correspondent] Georgia's Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze  was simply shocked by this question. He said the following:    [Shevardnadze] Rumors are being circulated abroad that order  is being poorly maintained in Tbilisi, and so why don't we call  in the Russians and get them to organize a normal life for us?  I think this is simply farcical. [Video shows correspondent  reporting from Tbilisi, officials being interviewed]</p>

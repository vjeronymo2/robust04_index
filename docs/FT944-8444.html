			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Chapter and worse - Fishing Whether consumers like anthologies as much as publishers, I rather doubt. I suspect they either get bought by people who know nothing much about whatever subject is being anthologised as presents for those who do; or they don't get bought at all. From the point of view of the enthusiast, virtually all anthologies suffer from the same incurable defect. It lies in the combination of diversity and insubstantiality. A collection drawn from 50 or more writers, representing different ages and traditions, covering a hotchpotch of themes within the overall subject, is hard-pressed to establish an identity of its own. It becomes something to be dipped into; which, as often as not, means it is relegated to the lavatory along with the Book of Lists and Edith Sitwell's English Eccentrics. To grapple with the anthology is like being invited to a feast and finding it consists of a vast array of bonnes bouches. One picks and picks, and longs for red meat. No pastime has stimulated better writing than fishing, and many are the hands which have sought to scoop off the cream. There is one anthology alone which triumphantly dodged pitfalls and, in doing so, became a classic in its own right. It is BB's The Fisherman's Bedside Book, which was first published in 1945. Although BB did exploit the published legacy available to him - the work of great men such as Sheringham, Skues, Farson and others - he did much more. For one thing, he used a good deal of his own writing, which had not been published and remains among the best there is. He also went to great lengths to seek out the memories of anglers who had never dreamed of putting pen to paper - such as J L Webb of Reading and Albert Buckley. A variation on BB's approach is the collection of specially commissioned pieces. A fine example is A Book Of Fishing Stories, edited by F G Aflalo, which was printed in 1913 on gorgeous, thick, paper, and which has a splendid Edwardian smack to it. John Haslette Vahey's The Humane Angler, which came out in the 1930s, was an early example of the cream-skimming genre, which has swelled to the point of excess in recent times. Each of these anthologies - with titles such as The Angler's Bedside Book, The Angler's Weekend Book, The Angler's Companion - contains its gems. But they all suffer from the fatal flaw, prompting a hankering for beef and two veg, with apple crumble and custard to follow. The latest to enter this overly congested ring is Jeremy Paxman, whose Fish, Fishing And The Meaning Of Life has just been published by Michael Joseph at Pounds 16.99. Let me say at once that, in my view, it is flawed in the same way as most of its predecessors. In addition, the illustrations are poor, the habit of identifying authors after the extracts is maddening, there are too many chunks which are too short and too few substantial ones, and there is too much mediocre verse. The greatest virtue is that the editor's taste and my own are in general accord (which, in view of the fact that I lent him a good portion of my library, is not very surprising). He has avoided the mistake of being too literary and including far too much boring stuff from olden days. Paxman's own introduction is graceful and rather touching, and the first of the mighty succession of titbits is a fine fragment of wisdom from the American, Robert Traver, and an absolute cracker on winter chubbing by the great Trent Otter, J W Martin. Overall, the verdict is that you non-fishing present-givers may buy this. But, please, publishers: let there now be a moratorium on fishing anthologies.</p>

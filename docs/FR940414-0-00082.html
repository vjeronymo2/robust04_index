The cost of a permit for a 90-foot (27.4 m) catcher boat may represent an additional 50&hyph;100 percent of the existing capitalization of the operation. The amount a factory trawler would have to pay is likely to represent a far smaller percentage of the total amount that has been invested. In this regard, it may be easier for a factory trawler to increase its debt load to cover the cost of necessary permits. It should be noted, however, that factory trawlers were built primarily for the Alaska pollock fisheries, not the Pacific whiting fishery. Factory trawlers also have the ability to derive profit from processing fish, as well as catching them. This tends to give them a larger relative whiting income stream with which to repay the permit cost. On the other hand, those smaller catcher vessels with hold capacity also possess opportunities to offset permit costs with additional landings of other groundfish species during portions of the year when the whiting season is closed. Another consideration is that the vast majority of catcher boats that will be participating in this fishery in all likelihood initially qualified for limited entry permits and will not have to pay anything for the right to continue fishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the cost of permits will fluctuate based on supply and demand, permit cost does not appear to be a reasonable basis for estimating harvest capacity in the groundfish fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter provided an alternative analysis of the capacity differences between trawl vessels of different lengths, based on calculations of the area and volume of water capable of being swept by the trawl net per hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  While there may be a strong correlation between area swept and the catch of vessels of given sizes, it is not clear what that functional relationship is between the two variables. Whatever this relationship, it is almost certainly characterized by diminishing catches per area swept at some point, just as the increase in highline production values per increment of vessel length diminished in the NMFS analysis. Knowing only the ratio of the areas swept per hour by vessels of different lengths without knowing the functional relationship between the two variables is not helpful in identifying catching capacity. For example, if the ratios reflect a linear increase in capacity over a 46-fold increase in area swept, then the capacity of a 90-foot (27.4 m) and a 300-foot (91.4 m) vessel, relative to a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel, would be 4.7:1 and 44.5:1, respectively, as noted in the comment. If, on the other hand, catch equals area swept to an exponential value, 0.75 for example, then the capacity ratios that result are 3.2:1 and 17.2:1, respectively, for the 90- and 300-foot (27.4 and 91.4 m) vessels; these values are not substantially different from those in the NMFS preferred approach. Without considerable additional quantitative analysis, there appears to be no basis for presuming that one of these assumptions is any better than the other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS also evaluated the commenter's suggestion taking into account the target species in the fishery. NMFS agrees that the commenter's method might be appropriate when harvesting spawning Alaska pollock where the pollock are distributed in large dense aggregations that are as much as 50 to 100 meters thick. In that case, it might be appropriate to calculate the ratios on a volume-swept basis. Whiting stock assessment surveys have found that the typical dense schools of whiting in the summer are scattered in a relatively thin layer that may be only 5 to 10 meters thick. In this case it appears more appropriate to calculate the ratios for whiting on an area-swept (two dimensional) basis rather than on a volume-swept basis. This method also is independent of any limits induced by the market, processing capacity, or vessel hold capacity, all of which typically reduce vessel capacity by some unknown amount. Based on an analysis of the capacity ratios using an area-swept method, it appears that this rule offers reasonable certainty that the permit combining schedule does not allow the overall harvesting capacity of the groundfish trawl fleet to increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter complained that, in the proposed rule, NMFS did not adequately explain why it deviated from its initial proposal to flatten the 2.5 exponential curve at a vessel length of 90 ft (27.4 m), and instead proposed to flatten the curve at a length of 150 ft (45.7 m).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After evaluation of production values for the top 25 percent of the Alaska Freezer longline fleet (vessels up to 150 ft (45.7 m) in length), NMFS concluded that the actual production potential for longline vessels in the Pacific groundfish fishery also could be fairly represented by the 2.5 exponential curve initially used to describe harvest capacity and production for vessels 90 ft (27.4 m) in length and below. Consequently, NMFS revised its initial proposal (Initial Alternative I) to extend the 2.5 exponential curve describing harvest capacity from 90 ft (27.4 m) to 150 ft (45.7 m) (NMFS preferred approach).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 8: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters representing factory trawlers recommended that NMFS allow permits to be combined temporarily (leased) then broken again into individual permits at the end of the lease period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Henry Boot bucks trend with advance to Pounds 2.2m HENRY BOOT &amp; Sons, the Sheffield-based construction and property group, continued to buck the sector trend with a 7 per cent increase in interim profits despite lower turnover and squeezed margins. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.07m) in the six months to June 30 on turnover down 14 per cent to Pounds 51.1m (Pounds 59.2m). Mr David Boot, chairman, said construction activities had benefited from latent claim settlements but were continuing to feel combined effects of reduced enquiry levels and exceptionally competitive margins. Difficult trading conditions also extended to the plant hire side which experienced 'an unparalleled number of bad debts, reduced utilisation and fiercely competitive hire rates.' However, housebuilding operations 'continued to hold their own in the first six months,' despite high interest and mortgage rates and unemployment uncertainties. Mr Boot said property investment and development activities have 'of necessity had to be curtailed,' although the group 'continued to make some further progress' in planning consents, rental growth and in its joint venture activities in Kirklees, Bridlington and Hull. Earnings per share rose from 5.1p to 5.7p and the interim dividend is increased to 1.6p (1.5p).</p>

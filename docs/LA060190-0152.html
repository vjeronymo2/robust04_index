			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 4-A SOFTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> SHE'S MAKING HER PITCH FOR A TITLE  </P> <P> There's little doubt that Garden Grove High School pitcher Stephanie Smith  knows how to win. Just ask her opponents, who are hitting .077 against her.  </P> <P> Or you can ask Garden Grove Coach Paula Cervantes, who says Smith is the best  all-around athlete she has coached.  </P> <P> Or ask her future college coach, who will be among those in attendance when  Garden Grove plays Charter Oak in the Southern Section 4-A championship game at  8 Friday night at Mayfair Park in Lakewood.  </P> <P> "She has good velocity and excellent movement but most importantly she's a  winner," said Ken Johnson, softball coach at the University of New Mexico,  where Smith will play next season. "The bigger the ballgame, the less pressure  she has on her shoulders, the more excited she gets and the more confidence she  has in herself. She knows how to win.  </P> <P> "We plan on her coming in and pitching for us right away," Johnson said. "We  were ranked 18th in the nation this year. We played one of the toughest  schedules around and we think she is ready to come in and pitch for us right  away. We think she's ready to handle that kind of situation."  </P> <P> If her statistics are any indication, Smith is at least ready to handle a more  difficult situation than she had this season. With Smith figuring in every  decision, the Argonauts racked up a 25-4-1 record on their way to the division  final.  </P> <P> "She's probably the best all-around athlete I've coached," Cervantes said.  </P> <P> Smith has received the most recognition for one statistic in particular. She  leads Orange County in strikeouts with 314.  </P> <P> Said Cervantes: "She has a good collection of pitches. She moves the ball  around."  </P> <P> That collection includes a fastball, changeup, rise-ball, drop-ball, and a  curve. Smith says she has no best pitch and uses all of her arsenal equally  well.  </P> <P> On five occasions this season, she moved the ball around well enough to come  away with no-hitters, two of which were perfect games.  </P> <P> But the strikeout pitcher may have a tougher time against Charter Oak. The  Chargers' Kathi Evans will go into the final with a .700 on-base percentage and  Charter Oak power-hitter Kelly Hunt has struck out only four times in four  years of varsity softball.  </P> <P> Smith said she's not worried.  </P> <P> "Everybody can be struck out once," she said. "And if not, I'll get them to pop  up or ground out."  </P> <P> Smith is even less concerned about the pressure of having her future college  coaches on hand.  </P> <P> "I'm excited because they're coming out," Smith said. "I know they're confident  in me because they signed me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 4-A SOFTBALL STARTING LINEUPS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:1.89IN:2.77IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Garden Grove  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Pos  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Charter Oak  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Stephanie Smith  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> P  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Christy Tucker  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Becky Eggers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> C  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Shari Shultz  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Celleste Gordon  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1B  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jamie Elkins  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kelly White  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2B  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Julie Kuluk  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Brandie Noback  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3B  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kelly Hunt  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Michelle Cash  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> SS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Raylene Tomasso  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nakia Houston  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> LF  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Laurie Grey  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Briana Corona  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> CF  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kathi Evans  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cari White  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> RF  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Shannon Redhead  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Carol Blakeman  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> DH  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Becky Champlin  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 25-4-1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Records  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 21-4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

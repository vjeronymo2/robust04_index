			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SdRP Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski by Ewa </F> Kaszuba; place and date not given: "Political Ornaments" --  questions published in boldface]    [Text] [Kaszuba] Will the new political debate which has  been initiated within the Social Democracy of the Polish  Republic [SdRP], the aim of which is to define the party's new  goals -- will it make the left wing continue the political  reforms initiated by "Solidarity?"    [Kwasniewski] After four years, we have found ourselves in a  completely new political situation, so posing some fundamental  questions is very appropriate now. The main elements of change  in Poland are permanent, and we cannot make just a step back  from them, but even a step sideways. I mean democracy, free  market, ownership transformations which increase economic  efficiency and the economy's openness to the world, I also mean  the country's sovereignty and its inclusion in a European  security system. Still, the question remains of how we intend  to go about strengthening those main elements while at the same  time implementing our program. I regard a third element as a  personal task of mine -- the Polish political scene must  stabilize itself, and once it has acquired a definite shape,  there must be room in it for a strong social-democratic party.  Such a party will be in power at times, and in the opposition  at other times, but it will never be condemned to have any  to-be-or-not-to-be doubts.    [Kaszuba] But if the left-wing government survives for four  years, then it will finish what "Solidarity" has started.    [Kwasniewski] No, it will not finish but rather continue  what "Solidarity" started. We are against constant revolutions  taking place -- it would be a very bad thing if Poland was to  adopt the kind of development model which is similar to the  movement of a pendulum: From one wall to the other, and back  again. Development is about strengthening achievements that  have already been made and about introducing changes which would  be in accordance with people's expectations. One can then live  in a country which is better organized, with a higher standard  of living and equal opportunities. In that sense, it is a  continuation, and I am not afraid of using that word. The  essence of the transformations -- which by the way were  initiated earlier, since even though these were slogans  proclaimed by "Solidarity" many of them were also declared  during the "Roundtable" talks -- is to transform Poland into a  democratic, well-organized, economically efficient, significant  in global terms, and normal kind of country.    [Kaszuba] And also a capitalist one, with a constitution of  a  bourgeois democratic state.    [Kwasniewski] That ideology's significance around the world  has been getting smaller and smaller.    [Kaszuba] Fine, but is it not your perception that we have  an historical paradox here? Or maybe on the contrary -- maybe  it is a natural course of events?    [Kwasniewski] I would lean toward the latter. Social  democrats the world over have managed to make their contribution  to free-market and democratic systems. But there is a debate  going on about whether it is capitalism, socialism, or social  democracy, and about what all these are supposed to be about.  If we want to get something useful done in Poland, then we must  immediately abandon such obsolete labels. If capitalism is a  system of free markets with different ownership forms and based  on democracy, then we are after capitalism. But should  capitalism be described as exploitation of man and supremacy of  the class of owners, then we should not be building capitalism.  But for me it is a completely useless debate. The point is  about having a vision of the country -- we may call it what we  want, even though I tend to prefer calling it a  social-democratic system -- in which there would be a free  market, different ownership forms, an effective economy, a  democracy, and with people having equal opportunities and power  to influence official decisions.    [Kaszuba] For some time now, the fate of the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] as an election alliance has been trembling in the  balance. For many different reasons, the groups forming the  alliance have been embarking on their own roads, while SdRP  wants to take upon itself the task of leading SLD. Is SdRP  already strong enough for that?    [Kwasniewski] SdRP is in a situation of absolute necessity  -- it is the main pillar of SLD, and it is the only force to  have nationwide political structures which are capable of  implementing political tasks which are about getting ready for  elections, explaining the government's measures, and looking for  social support for these measures. In my view, the solution to  the issue is in the hands of trade unionists, not SdRP. It is  the trade unionists who found themselves in the most difficult  situation. It is natural for them to be in the opposition --  they are critical of the government and they make demands  while at the same time avoiding any responsibility. Right now  they are part of the governing coalition and so they must change  their line of reasoning -- from contesting and making claims, to  a more pragmatic and efficient solving of problems facing  employees. But the weak side of that concept is that the trade  unions' role is not very spectacular, and that it will be hard  to try to argue with the shouters and it will be even harder to  win battles with them. The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement  [OPZZ] is not the first trade union to have found itself in this  kind of situation. We are familiar with what "Solidarity" went  through -- the union has never decided to back the government  completely, it led to the government's collapse and today it is  absent from the parliament. That is an important factor in  debates. OPZZ is not the first trade union to participate in  political structures, either -- it was the same case in Sweden,  Spain, and Greece for years.    [Kaszuba] What other source of SdRP's radicalization in  personnel issues could there be aside from its feeling of  strength?    [Kwasniewski] It is not a radicalization at all. Does  election victory in a democratic country mean that a government  is formed and the winning party makes no appointments apart from  ministerial posts, with the president's policies being  implemented in presidential ministries, and the predecessors'  policies being implemented in the other ministries so as to gain  support from the mass media? Does that also mean that there are  no changes at the level of voivodships [administrative  districts], even though some voivodes [local government  officials] do not have any great willingness to cooperate with  representatives of the new government? That would not mean being  in power but enjoying being in power at the supreme levels. We  think that every government should have necessary instruments  and procedures at its disposal. This is also the essence of the  dispute about participation in presidential ministries'  leaderships. They are included in the government's structure so  the prime minister and the whole coalition bear responsibility  for measures undertaken also by those ministries. So we would  like to have some influence over them. The whole issue would  never have even come to surface if it was not for some  deficiencies in the process of agreeing on certain issues. We  came to the conclusion that direct influence is insufficient.  So for the sake of those ministries, and for the sake of  integrating measures undertaken by the government with those  undertaken by the president, a system must be created in which  the flow of information and consultations would be complete.    [Kaszuba] But the sudden interest expressed in the  ministries tends to create the impression of the coalition  having come to a conclusion that it can afford to get involved  in a conflict with the president at this stage.    [Kwasniewski] The president is someone who undertakes  different measures and makes different value judgments at  different points in time. Our proposals -- these were jointly  agreed upon by SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] -- are  neither a result of a willingness to be begging for conflicts,  nor of a contention that the president is now weak, so one can  launch an attack on him. Rather, the proposals are the result of  a conviction that the ministries' activities cannot be out of  the government's control since that would mean that first, we  would create an unconstitutional situation. Secondly, a joint  creation of concepts by the ministers, the president, and the  governing coalition, will better serve the cause of ruling the  country.    [Kaszuba] And the coalition hopes that the president will  continue to swallow the bitter pills without uttering a word?    [Kwasniewski] What bitter pills? I am sure the president  will understand that it is in his best interests. After all,  you just cannot think this way: This is my backyard and  everybody else can keep their noses out of it. There are no  constitutional provisions to justify such a view. If foreign,  internal, and defense policy is to be implemented exclusively by  the president, then government members should not implement it  but rather high-ranking officials in the President's Office.  The Constitution provides -- and we adhere to this -- that the  president is the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, that he  participates in shaping both foreign and domestic policy, and  that he has influence over filling those posts. The ministers  were appointed in accordance with his wishes, and now the  coalition would like to have the possibility of participating in  decisionmaking within the ministries. Foreign policy, internal  policy, and defense issues -- these are the main parts of any  government's business and that is the case around the world.    [Kaszuba] Two months ago, SLD used to say it does not plan  on replacing voivodes. Right now the party -- along with PSL --  announces widespread purges.    [Kwasniewski] The fact that up to now there have been very  few changes proves that there is no purge going on whatsoever.  I think we will always be between two extremes: On the one  hand there will be views expressed that the coalition fails to  influence an important part of the government's policy, but on  the other hand, following any kind of personnel measure there  will be talk of purges and retaliation. Both views are false.    [Kaszuba] But one does not change one's views on an issue as  important as this within a period of two months. Is it not the  case that by leaving voivodes alone the coalition was courting  the Democratic Union [UD], but once it found out there is no  chance for agreement -- at least for now -- then it decided to  come back to the issue?    [Kwasniewski] Our relationship with UD was predetermined by  recent statements made by its leaders. UD wants to remain a  definite opposition party and an alternative to the arrangement  now in power. Aleksander Smolar even wrote that it was a  mistake to vote for Oleksy, that it was a mistake to abstain  during votes in the Sejm Constitutional Commission, and that one  should have shown society with determination that UD was in  opposition. In that sense, the roles have been divided and I  can see no political possibilities -- even though one could find  some substantive ones -- to come into alliance. I cannot  imagine, either that following PSL's statements during the  debate on a vote of confidence for Suchocka's government, we  could see UD courting PSL again.    [Kaszuba] SLD abstained, so it can keep courting.    [Kwasniewski] We did not abstain from courting UD. There  was too much politics in the debate and not enough of sticking  to the letter of the law. Political decisions concerning the  previous governments had been made -- both of them were brought  down. To me, that was when political issues were done with.  The question put before the Sejm was: Was the budget adopted  by the previous Sejm ever implemented? If someone thinks it was  not implemented, then he should continue the trail and look for  the guilty party.    [Kaszuba] There was talk in SLD circles under the previous  Sejm that Ireneusz Sekula was a wasted seat in parliament. How  did this sudden reversal come about, I mean his appointment as  chief of the Main Customs Office?    [Kwasniewski] Sekula is a good organizer and manager, he is  experienced in working in large, state-owned institutions, and  he is also psychologically predisposed to carry through  difficult operations. He is just strong psychologically. Apart  from that, he also enjoys social support, he has been  politically active since 1990, he was elected Sejm deputy twice,  and had he not been elected, he would not have made the comeback  now.    [Kaszuba] But he has always aroused controversy, even among  his colleagues from his deputy club.    [Kwasniewski] Yes, and that is why he occupied position  number 16 on the electoral list but he still managed to win in  his electoral district, and that must be respected. Those  colleagues who had raised their objections and then lost to  Sekula, should bow before him.    [Kaszuba] Is the essence of the governing parties'  far-sightedness about that they will take up the most important  posts and the government's immediate base, followed by having  provisions on public civil service enacted which would be  apolitical and not subject to changes along with changes of  political teams? And this way, the supposedly apolitical posts  will be permanently occupied by people representing the left  wing?    [Kwasniewski] We need a law on civil employees of public  services but if it is enacted, then it will be possible to  withdraw political nominations. The point must be defined at  which public and irremovable service begins which would be based  on contracts, and then people must be found to fill those posts,  people whose political views will be irrelevant.    [Kaszuba] Can you say with absolute certainty that this will  be the order in which events will happen?    [Kwasniewski] That order simply must happen, if all this is  to make any sense at all. In any case, nobody will believe that  a politically appointed voivode can become a "civil servant"  overnight. We will deal with that when the right time comes.  Of course, once the law becomes effective, it will influence  the way personnel are appointed. It would be the same case if  UD was in power today. After all, the apolitical nature of  voivodes presented a diversified picture under the previous  cabinet. Not only were they not apolitical, but they were also  active in specific political parties, including PSL. SLD was  the only party which was totally absent from state  administration agencies.    [Kaszuba] And you insist that is not retaliation?    [Kwasniewski] One could comment on any kind of change by  saying it is retaliation. The word is being used much too  often; one could speak of retaliation if changes were introduced  everywhere after two months and if people from the old Polish  United Workers Party took up voivode posts. That would be a  case of retaliation, it would be a purely political act, and  also complete stupidity. An opinion on people performing public  posts cannot be political in its nature and nothing else. If we  have a case of a good voivode -- and I know a few of those  although I want to cite no names since I am not sure whether  that could harm them or be good for them -- who happens to be  from the right wing, he should remain at his post. But if there  is someone who is incompetent, then he must leave. The  coalition is not only responsible for who is in power, but also  for the entirety of issues in Poland. What about personnel  replacements? Of course they happen -- that is the case all  over the world when it comes to such posts.    [Kaszuba] It has been a month and a half since your apology  in the Sejm [for abuses under previous communist regimes]. Do  you feel you have been forgiven?    [Kwasniewski] I did not expect anybody to forgive me.    [Kaszuba] So why did you make the apology?    [Kwasniewski] To me, the "I'm sorry" was an important  political act. In the context of the whole speech it meant that  the past is a closed chapter and there is no going back. I am  aware that 20 percent of the people voted for us, but on the  other hand, many people fear going back to the old ways. And I  think that those people who can afford to speak frankly and do  not have to decorate their statements with different political  ornaments -- I think those people approved of my statement.  They became convinced that there is no going back to an era  which we are all fed up with.</p>

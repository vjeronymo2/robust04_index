			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: A fit of global gloom In a parochial sense, the 300-point fall in the London equity market since early May has a positively traditional feel to it. First the Tory election win, then the celebration, then the hangover. But yesterday's 52-point fall belonged in a wider context. One reason was Wall Street, hit by poor results from IBM and bad trade figures. But the other European markets were on average down in line with London. The common theme here is interest rates, and the Bundesbank in particular. The worry is not so much that Germany will tighten further - though that cannot be ruled out - as that it will retain its grip for the foreseeable future. In the UK, it did not help that the Cheltenham and Gloucester building society raised its rates yesterday or that the Bank of England reversed the timid suggestion of lower rates made at the start of the month. Having been remarkably slow to grasp the realities of the German situation, the markets are now having to reduce their expectations for economic growth accordingly. For the UK market, there is yet another worry in the background. With sterling at Dollars 1.95, the pressure on dollar earners is becoming material. It is not helpful to reflect that if sterling were back at its central rate against the D-Mark, it would also be over Dollars 2.00. As a result of all this, equities are in conventional terms cheap compared to gilts. The yield ratio has fallen to 1.8 times, which in normal times would be a clear buy signal. That may yet prove persuasive. But in one important respect the times are not normal. The market has discounted a huge amount of bad news by now. What it has not discounted is the possibility of a triple-dip recession being caused by a further rise in UK interest rates. As long as that possibility remains, however slight, it has to be priced as well.</p>

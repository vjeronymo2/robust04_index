			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Ministers' row delays 'green' measures A WHITEHALL power struggle over control of a new anti-pollution agency has forced the shelving of plans to include environmental legislation in the Queen's Speech tomorrow, Ivo Dawnay writes. Ministers had expected a 'green' bill to be among the measures, but disagreements between the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture have forced a further delay. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has insisted that a new agency should combine the powers of the National Rivers Authority, the Pollution Inspectorate and the waste-disposal functions of councils. But Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, is equally determined that land drainage, coastal defence and the activities of the rivers watchdog should fall to him. The dispute first surfaced last year in an unresolved clash between Mr Gummer and Mr Michael Heseltine, now trade and industry secretary. A 'green' bill is now likely to be tabled next year, possibly taking in factors from next month's United Nations environment conference in Brazil and the government's decision to reduce the timetable for cutting carbon emissions.</p>

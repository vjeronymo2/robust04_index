			<p>BFN     [Text] Citizens in the rest of the country say ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] and United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia [UNOMIL]  are responsible for the slow pace in the Liberian peace process.  In a survey conducted by LCN [Liberia Communications Network]  News in Gbarnga, the citizens said, although fighting is taking  place between the so-called Liberian Peace Council and the NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in the southeast of the  country, ECOMOG and UNOMIL have not moved in to stop the  fighting.</p>

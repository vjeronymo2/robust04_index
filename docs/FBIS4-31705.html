			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, parliamentary representative </F> and economic expert of the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Dr.  Gyorgy Varga; place and date not given]    [Text] [Varga] Laszlo Csaba's most important thesis is that  economic policy could again become subordinated to power issues,  and this could lead to a breakup, a fragmentation of economic  policy. Is this concern warranted?    [Bekesi] The concern is not unfounded, but it is avoidable.  I  dare assert this so plainly because we are after the first round  of elections, and two parties of the opposition won, both of  which are ready to free the economy from an  ideological-political domination.    If a government coalition composed of the Hungarian  Socialist  Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] wants to  complete its four-year term, in the present situation of the  country it cannot neglect focusing its attention and energy on  the economy. One cannot initiate new discussions about the coat  of arms and new gestures of retribution and compensation. The  crisis must be attended to, the prerequisites for economic  growth must be created, the deterioration of the balance must be  stopped, and the country must finally be put on a track of  modernization. Thus, a socialist-liberal government will be  under constraint. In the current situation there is simply no  alternative to a pragmatic, ideology-free economic policy. I  stress this because I largely agree with Laszlo Csaba that the  economic policy of the past year and a half was characterized by  distribution. This was an election-year economic policy. The new  government must concentrate on creating the prerequisites for  income production, and unfortunately, this presupposes a series  of decisions which are painful for the entire society.    [Varga] Is the establishment of a ministry for economic  affairs a necessary prerequisite for preventing the  fragmentation and atomization of economic policy?    [Bekesi] From the aspect of the issue under discussion I do  not consider it crucial. It is more important to create within  the government the personal and organizational framework of a  unified economic policy. This can happen through the  establishment of a ministry, but the coordination is also  possible through the person of a deputy prime minister with a  strong expertise and sufficient political support, or in the  form of an efficiently directed economic cabinet. Of course, a  prime minister who is an expert on economic policy can also  present a solution. In other words, the main issue is to prevent  having several centers of economic policy within the government.    [Varga] The country's economic situation would justify  having  an individual well versed in economic issues at the head of the  government.    [Bekesi] I agree, but this ought to be discussed during the  coalition talks.    [Varga] The next source of danger is that the management of  the crisis and the protection of jobs puts the protectionist  instinct of defense in the foreground. Is this trap unavoidable?    [Bekesi] I share Laszlo Csaba's fears, even though in the  course of the campaign only parties with extremist, populist  agendas were in favor of a protectionist economic policy aiming  at an exaggerated protection of the Hungarian market.    The MSZP and the SZDSZ excluded protectionist measures from  the arsenal of fostering the domestic market. Still, I must add  that with the current capability of the Hungarian economy to  compete on the international market, it would be suicidal to  allow complete freedom to market forces. Incidentally, it is not  done in that way anywhere in the world. The frameworks of  agreements with the European Union and GATT will provide  adequate protection for the Hungarian economy in the critical  segments of the market. Namely, the Hungarian Government is  entitled to institute measures for the protection of the market  up to 10 percent of the country's yearly imports. This  possibility must be utilized skillfully. This figure concerns  imports to the value of $1-1.2 billion, which is a considerable  sum. Thus, in this amount, one may utilize the possibilities  afforded by customs, contingents, quotas, and technical  specifications. It is a fact that up to now the government did  not fully utilize this 10-percent limit of market protection. A  new government must do this much and not more.    [Varga] In connection with the protection of the nation's  land and the peculiar implementation of consumer protection,  Laszlo Csaba mentions the dangers inherent in an exaggerated,  economically irrational, protection of agriculture.    [Bekesi] The strategic purpose of economic policy must be to  restore, and establish the competitiveness of, agriculture and  food industry. That is to say, the improvement of the position  of the agricultural-food industry complex is a stabilizing  factor for the economy and is one of the prerequisites for  economic growth. I am convinced that within a short time, with  relatively little investment, the greatest growth of  productivity might be achieved in this branch of the economy.    As far as the ownership of land is concerned, in the short  run it is unavoidable to exclude foreign capital, but in the  long run it would be a mistake. In other words, it is only  justified to forbid foreign ownership of land until a market for  land and realistic land prices are established. However, within  a foreseeable time period the land market will begin to grow,  because the estates which were formed are so small that they do  not allow competitive farming. In other words, under pressure,  we will soon witness the beginning of a concentration process.  As a result, realistic market prices for land will be  established. At that time, the prohibition of land ownership by  foreigners must be abolished.    As far as agrarian subsidies are concerned, the 30-40  percent  level which has been established in Europe is an unrealistic  goal for us. In Hungary the subsidy is currently 7-8 percent.  This also plays a role in the huge decline in production. It is  without precedent that in our exports we were unable to fulfill  the contingent allowed by the European Union. In my opinion, in  the course of four years the level of subsidy can be doubled,  i.e., it can be increased to 15 percent. This will mean 120  billion forints [Ft] a year, compared to the current Ft60-70  billion.    [Varga] Is this a straight subsidy?    [Bekesi] Not at all. I am thinking primarily of preferential  interest rates for agricultural investments, procurement  intervention by the state to restore a minimal level of  production security, procurement guarantees, and the  introduction of guaranteed procurement prices in the area of  basic produce. The latter would not be the market price, rather  a minimal price. Thus, one must anticipate the increase of  producers' prices. And in the case of some articles--when our  export interests require--we must provide subsidies. It is a  fact that these measures will create inflationary pressure.    [Varga] Laszlo Csaba wrote that a financial system was  created, the viability of which depended on the goodwill of the  central power and not on its effectiveness on the market. How  can this situation be changed?    [Bekesi] My answer in one sentence: by privatizing banks as  soon as possible, by concurrently increasing their capital.    [Varga] Can you already name some measures to be introduced  during the new government's "honeymoon"?    [Bekesi] The future coalition government should focus its  energies on the implementation of two goals: The first one is  the creation of the prerequisites for growth, and the second one  is an increase in employment. There are, however, two difficult  challenges before the realization of these two goals: One is the  balance, or rather, the lack of balance, between internal and  external finances, and the other one is the danger of  hyperinflation. In other words, the aforementioned goals must be  realized by maneuvering between these two challenges, while at  the same time preserving social harmony.    The most urgent task is to stop the dramatic deterioration  of  the external and internal economic balance. If this does not  take place, the country's financial security will be endangered  in 1995. Urgent measures must be taken to stop the decrease of  exports. To achieve this goal, the principle of neutrality must  be exercised in exchange rate policy, i.e., we must avoid  reacting too late to a revaluation of the forint; decided steps  must be taken to recapture eastern markets; export-oriented  projects must be supported within the framework of the tax  system. Overspending by the state must be restrained. The  increase of the budget deficit in relation to the GDP must be  stopped. It is important to have at least as much in domestic  savings to finance the debt in order to offset the consolidated  deficit. Today, the gap between domestic savings and the deficit  is approximately Ft100 billion. In 1995 this will be untenable.  If the GDP cannot be increased in 1995, the expenses of the  budget must be reduced. A "cut" of Ft50 billion must already be  made in the supplementary budget to be prepared in 1994.    [Varga] The situation would certainly be alleviated if the  privatization of large state-owned firms, such as the Hungarian  Telecommunications Enterprise [Matav] and the Hungarian Oil and  Natural Gas Corporation [Mol], continued in a more determined  fashion.    [Bekesi] I agree with you, but this continuation should take  place in the framework of a new privatization strategy, namely,  a privatization method involving the increase of capital must be  implemented.    [Varga] You stressed several times, and this time as well,  the importance of returning to the eastern markets. How  realistic is this return for us?    [Bekesi] As a strategy, based on the natural order of the  international division of labor, the return is unavoidable. This  is hardly disputed by now. What can be disputed is what can be  achieved and how, and whether today or tomorrow. On the markets  in question there is great demand, but their financial situation  is bad. In other words, beyond conventional trade methods we  must exploit the possibilities of barter, such as raw materials  for food. Furthermore, it is in our strategic interests to  participate in the privatization of these countries. We must  acquire property; considerable capacities and property can be  acquired very cheaply nowadays. For instance, in return for  export goods, for as yet not expended Hungarian credit balances,  or in the framework of joint ownership.    [Varga] Foreign capital was not pleased that the government  abolished the system of normative preferences and awarded state  preferences in connection with the investment of foreign capital  on the basis of individual agreements. Do you think change is  warranted?    [Bekesi] By all means. The MSZP is determined to restore the  system of normative preferences for foreign and Hungarian  investors. The retention of the right to make individual  decisions by the government would only maintain an atmosphere of  suspicion and the possibility of abuse.    [Varga] You said in a recent interview that genuine economic  measures can only take place in September. Is this acceptable in  the current economic situation?    [Bekesi] I uphold my opinion that genuine economic measures  can take place in September at the earliest. Namely, the new  government can be formed at the beginning of July. The  announcement of the government's program can occur at the  earliest at the end of July; in August, bills can be prepared  which the government can submit to parliament in September.    On the other hand, urgent decisions cannot be postponed  until  September. For instance, the Hungarian National Bank [MNB] can  make monetary decisions concerning the balance of payments.  Adjustments in the exchange rate can take place any time, based  on an authorization by the government. A huge amount of state  bonds are stored in the safes of the central bank which could  be, or should be, used as a means of restricting liquidity. If  it is advisable, the central bank can raise the prime rate.  Furthermore, after the end of June, the coalition partners can  ask the acting government to make justified and urgent economic  decisions. For instance, to freeze spending budget reserves,  suspend subsidies to decentralized funds beyond the prorated  amount, and stop injurious privatization measures, such as the  KRP [expansion unknown].    [Varga] Finally, I return to Laszlo Csaba, who pointed out  the dangers inherent in the trilateral arbitration mechanism.  However, both the MSZP and the SZDSZ intend to construct such a  social mechanism. Are you not afraid that this would slow down  economic decision-making and diminish the economy's ability to  adjust?    [Bekesi] In Hungary's current situation, in the given  political-economic situation, when crisis management is  necessary, when a series of unpopular measures must be  instituted, when a policy of savings and investment stimulation  must be conducted, and not a policy of distribution, an  argumentation of economic rationalism can hardly suffice to  convince society of the necessity of these measures. However,  social harmony is indispensable for the implementation of such a  program. If it cannot be protected, the Polish effect comes into  action. Here, under the current circumstances, the prerequisites  for preserving social harmony can only be established within the  framework of a system of arbitration. It is to be expected that  the three partners participating in the arbitration -- the  employees, the employers, and the state -- will not put an  emphasis on distribution, and will not fight about who should  receive a relatively larger slice of the shrinking cake, but  rather endeavor to make the cake as large as possible. The state  must lead the way in self-restraint, but the other two partners  can also be expected to exhibit similar behavior, especially in  the first period of the government cycle. Thus, the coalition  must from time to time persuade its two social partners.    I think in the beginning this will be very difficult,  because  it requires self-restraint from the participants. I don't deny  that I am expecting big discussions and fights, but I am  convinced that with a social-liberal coalition, there is a  chance for agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, REPUBLIKA -- H.M. Sanusi, who was jailed  for subversion, was released from the Cipinang Correction Center  in Jakarta on Friday. His release followed the earlier release  of A.M. Fatwa, Abdul Qadir Jaelani, Rahmat Basuki, and a number  of other political detainees. Sanusi was released in a very  simple and quiet ceremony at 1045 West Indonesian Standard Time  yesterday in contrast to the earlier release of a number of his  friends. "I am very happy," Sanusi told REPUBLIKA last night.    Present during the ceremony yesterday were Alamsyah Bur,  head  of the Jakarta Regional Office of the Department of Justice;  Suharto, head of the Cipinang Correction Center; his five sons  and six grandchildren, and his friends Dr. Anwar Harjono and  A.M. Fatwa. Sanusi himself learned of his imminent release on  Thursday morning. "I intentionally did not inform my friends  about it," he said.    Sanusi had undergone the resocialization process since  November 1993. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison by the  Central Jakarta District Court in 1985 for allegedly  masterminding the explosion of a number of Bank Central Asia  offices. He was later sentenced in the same year to 20 years  for alleged involvement in the explosion of the Borobudur  Temple. The second verdict was, however, annulled by the  Supreme Court. He was released conditionally on Friday after  serving two-thirds [as published] of his jail term.    Having been in prison for almost 10 years, the man, who was  born in Klaten on 28 November 1920, however, spoke  enthusiastically. He was even not reluctant to talk about his  life. "Let's talk about politics," said Sanusi when asked about  the technical aspects of his release. The former industry  minister of the Republic of Indonesia in the Ampera Cabinet from  1966 to 1968 said that he would again be involved in social and  mass activities after performing a hajj pilgrimage. "I have not  changed," he said enthusiastically.    Sanusi, who was an official of the Muhammadiyah [an Islamic  sociocultural and educational organization] Central Executive  Board from 1965 to 1985, said that he would strive to implement  three main programs. First, he will strive for the  democratization process in Indonesia. According to him,  conglomeration, corruption, and the like stem from the stalled  democratic development in Indonesia. In this regard, Sanusi  vowed to remain critical of government policies. "But, I remain  constructive," he continued. He claimed to have prepared a  number of concepts to cope with these problems.</p>

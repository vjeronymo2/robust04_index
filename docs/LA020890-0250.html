			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DOKES TO FIGHT RUDDOCK IN APRIL  </P> <P> Michael Dokes and Razor Ruddock couldn't get fights with heavyweight champion  Mike Tyson, so they'll fight each other.  </P> <P> Their April 4 meeting at Madison Square Garden was announced today in New York,  and it's being billed as "Fighting Mad" -- not at each other but at promoter  Don King for sidestepping them in the heavyweight championship chase.  </P> <P> "I don't know if Tyson's trying to avoid me, or whether King is manipulating  him," Dokes said at a midtown Manhattan luncheon. "But I would like to ask him  personally."  </P> <P> Last August, King reportedly turned down Dokes' asking price of $3 million to  fight Tyson and offered $1 million, which Dokes considers chump change.  </P> <P> Instead, King made a deal to co-promote a fight with Murad Muhammad between  Tyson and Ruddock. Tyson pulled out of that November bout with a minor illness,  then signed to fight Buster Douglas, whom he meets Sunday in Tokyo.  </P></p>

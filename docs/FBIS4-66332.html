			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tang Dongning [3282 2639 1337] and Yu Xiaohan </F> [0060 1420 2498]: ``Meeting the Second Information Revolution  Challenge to Battle''; cf. JPRS-CST-94-007, 3 May 94 p 19]    [Summary] Beijing, 11 Mar (KEJI RIBAO report) -- Should not  China seize the opportunity to formulate policies for yet  another ``information revolution''--that of the ``information  highways?'' To this end, KEJI RIBAO today convened an  Information Highway Expert Symposium; at this forum, the experts  unanimously agreed that our nation, faced with a rare  opportunity in world history, should quickly take action  appropriate to national conditions. These specialists also felt  that China, compared to advanced nations--especially the U.S.,  with its National Information Infrastructure (NII) program--lags  behind in economic power, but that China nonetheless should  accelerate its strategic in-depth planning and concentrate its  attention on this second information revolution that will  inevitably foster future economic and social development.  Specifically, the experts urged that domestic information  resources be disseminated throughout the society, be  market-oriented, and incorporate international developments--all  in step-by-step, gradually accelerated fashion.</p>

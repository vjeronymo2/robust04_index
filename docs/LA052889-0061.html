			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING BOOKS ON JOYCE  </P> <P> After finishing the first chapter of Ulysses and embarking on the rest of the  book, Karen Kenyon, author of "Joyce's Dublin" (May 7), will find that the  novel offers many interesting spots worth visiting in and around the Dublin  area. In fact, all of James Joyce's novels can be used as tour guides of  turn-of-the-century Dublin. City parks, universities, pubs, libraries and  government buildings discussed in the novels are still in existence, and  visiting them brings an interesting life to the masterpieces in which they are  featured. To discuss one building in one chapter in "Ulysses" hardly uncovers  the mystique of touring Joyce's Dublin. Yet Joyce's novels are not simply tour  guides of Dublin. His works are artistic masterpieces of style and form that  have reshaped modern literature.  </P> <P> DANIEL KAUFMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

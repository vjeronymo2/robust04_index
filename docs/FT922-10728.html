			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Mips Computer deal revalued SILICON Graphics, the US computer workstation maker which last month agreed to acquire Mips Computer Systems, said yesterday that the two companies had renegotiated the terms of the deal. The deal was originally valued at about Dollars 400m, based on a stock-swap formula in which each share of Mips would be exchanged for 0.61 shares of Silicon Graphics. Since then, Mips, a leading developer of Risc (reduced instruction set computing) microprocessors, has reported disappointing first-quarter earnings and its stock price has fallen sharply. Silicon Graphics' share price has also declined by almost 40 per cent since the announcement. On Monday, the companies said that Silicon Graphics would exchange 0.52 shares for each share of Mips, a 15 per cent reduction. This would reduce the value of the deal to about Dollars 200m at current share prices.</p>

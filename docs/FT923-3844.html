			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Dispute over EETPU re-entry eases FEARS of a damaging inter-union split over the re-admission of the EETPU electricians to the TUC appeared to be fading last night. The National Union of Journalists was considering whether to go ahead with a motion seeking to impose tough conditions on the reaffiliation talks. However, its failure to agree with other unions about the wording of a compromise means that few unions are likely to support its motion if it is debated today. The TUC's general council decided last night to oppose the motion if the NUJ tables it. The TUC's general council last night voted unanimously to ask the National Union of Journalists to withdraw its motion. If the journalists' union refuses, the general council will oppose the motion. TUC general secretary Norman Willis said: 'We have a very good general council statement which shows the way forward and we do not need this motion.' Some unions, including Nalgo, which had previously planned to support the NUJ, decided yesterday to vote against it. The EETPU was expelled from the TUC in 1988. The negotiations on its re-entry follow its merger with the AEU engineers earlier this year to form the AEEU. TUC leaders hope they will be readmitted next year.</p>

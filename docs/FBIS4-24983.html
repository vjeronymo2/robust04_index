			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 4 (XINHUA) -- With the rapid economic  growth along the Chang Jiang River, China's longest, the ports  along the river have attracted more and more foreign ships.    On May 7, 1983, a Panama-registered ship arrived at  Zhangjiagang, a port in the lower reach of the Yangtze, as the  first foreign ship ever entered the river since 1949 when the  People's Republic was founded. Over the past 11 years, about  50,000 ships from more than 50 countries and regions in the  world have docked at the 13 ports along the Chang Jiang River.    Foreign ships with displacement of up to 10,000 tons can  sail  to the ports from Shanghai to Nanjing in the lower reach of the  Chang Jiang River, and ones with displacement of up to 5,000  tons can get to the ports up to Wuhan from Nanjing in the medium  reach of the river.    In the first three months of this year, the ports along the  lower and middle reaches of the Chang Jiang have served more  than 3,000 foreign ships.    More than 50 ports along the Chang Jiang River in Jiangsu,  Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei Provinces have set business relations  with more than 50 countries and regions in the world.    The ports also opened up more than 30 international  transport  routes to foreign countries.    The export cargoes at Wuhan port, such as steel and  fertilizers, can be shipped to more than 20 countries.</p>

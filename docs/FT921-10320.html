			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Bank could not act earlier on BCCI fraud claims, MPs told THE BANK of England was powerless to intervene in the affairs of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International - before closing it down last year - because 'widespread pervasive fraud over a long period was not the impression we had been gathering', Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's director in charge of banking supervision, said yesterday. In answer to questions from a House of Commons committee, Mr Quinn said that, between 1983 and 1991, the Bank of England had been striving to get a proper international supervisory structure in place. 'As soon as we got evidence of fraud, we acted,' he said. When Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour MP on the Treasury and Civil Service committee, asked what action the Bank authorities had taken after he named BCCI as a possibly fraudulent operation in speeches in the Commons in 1985 and afterwards, Mr Quinn said allegations against banks were not uncommon. 'We don't simply look at them, smile, and pass on.' When he remarked there were clear procedures in the Bank of England for investigating allegations such as those contained in Mr Sedgemore's speeches, the MP replied: 'You didn't check with me, so there seems to have been no check at all.' Mr Sedgemore also pressed Mr Quinn on the role of ICIC, a foundation closely linked with BCCI, whose accounts were qualified by its auditors in October 1989 because the value of its shareholding in BCCI could not be known. Mr Roger Barnes, assistant director and head of banking supervision at the Bank of England, said he had not been aware that ICIC was part of the group. Mr Sedgemore had raised very complex matters which he would like notice to answer. Asked why the Bank, unlike the US authorities, had not blocked BCCI's entry into the UK in 1972, Mr Quinn said no legal powers had then existed which would have enabled it to do so. In 1973 it tried to slow down the growth of BCCI's branch network in the UK because the speed with which the bank was setting up branches raised questions about how closely it was controlling its operations. Mr Quinn said the 'nuclear threat' of putting the bank out of business could in any case not have been carried out in the mid-1980s because the UK would not have carried the rest of the international banking community with it.

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Time to clarify the obligations of auditors THE 1990s pose fundamental problems for UK accounting firms. In addition to increased commercial pressures, the profession faces a threat from public policy makers. There is increasing suspicion about the effectiveness of self-regulation. Who audits the auditor? And who should do so? The debate on auditor regulation and accounting firm competition is taking place across the EC. A patchwork of regulatory structures and accountancy cultures has generated a confusing array of calls for action. Many are addressed in a study commissioned by DG IV, the EC Directorate in charge of competition policy, from economic consultants NERA.* The root of the regulatory debate is the auditor's position between, on one hand, the managers of public companies, and, on the other, their owners and other groups such as employees, pension fund beneficiaries, creditors and government departments which rely on the accuracy of the audited accounts. The auditor is hired by the managers to protect the interests of this latter group of 'stakeholders'. There are obvious tensions when the interests of the two groups diverge  - perhaps because of suspected fraud or more typically because managers have an interest in the reported results being well received by investors and others. Economists analyse such divergences of interest between one party and the agent employed to work on its behalf as a 'principal/agent' problem. Traditional solutions of professional self-regulation backed up by legal redress as a last resort appear to be ripe for reform. Recent financial scandals have cast doubts on whether the threat of public disgrace is sufficient to safeguard audit standards. These doubts are confirmed by the experiences of investors who have sought redress for auditor malpractice in the courts. Almost all such cases are settled out of court without any clarification of the legal duties. The Caparo case, which clarified auditors' responsibilties, underlined the gulf between what users expect, and what the auditor is prepared to offer. The auditor's signature is treated by users of company accounts as an assurance of the quality of the information they contain - a kind of insurance policy against the risk that the company's true financial state is not what it appears. The leading audit firms, whose strong brand names command a substantial price premium, have an interest in sustaining this belief. Yet attempts to make a claim on this policy show that pay-out terms are unreliable and highly uncertain. The most common form of audit regulation proposed is to prevent auditors carrying out consultancy assignments for their audit clients - a feature of several EC markets. The NERA study showed that the major accounting firms rely heavily on audit clients for their non-audit business. But it also found the firms had managed to avoid the regulations in these countries. A second mechanism, favoured in Italy and Spain and suggested elsewhere, is to have periodic compulsory rotation of auditors, to prevent too cosy a relationship between the audit partner and the management of the firm. But this causes potentially high disruption costs and raises questions as to the quality of the audit scrutiny during the transition period. A third solution, favoured by some accounting firms, is to introduce measures to reduce the intensity of competition for the audit contract, removing the temptation to reduce audit quality as a means of cutting costs. Protection from competition might reduce the tendency of the client to question the value for money offered by the auditor. But the idea that protectionism guarantees higher standards holds no more water in this context than elsewhere. None of the models for reform suggested by the other EC states really addresses the principal/agent problem which underlies the need for reform. If the question of auditor independence is to be tackled, more fundamental issues need to be addressed. The crucial question in devising a more effective regulatory structure is how to ensure that the auditor's incentives are aligned with those whom the audit is designed to serve, and not with those who pay their fees. The first step in enforcing this alignment is to clarify the nature of the audit. What guarantees does the audit signature entail? And what class of user is entitled to make a claim on those guarantees? If we think of the audit as an insurance policy, the current 'expectations gap' means that many who believe they have insurance cover find they have none at all. The extent of cover against inaccuracy in the audited accounts is tied up with the meaning of the 'true and fair view' promise contained in each set of audited accounts. There is almost complete uncertainty as to the meaning of this phrase, and a desperate requirement for further clarification. There is also a pressing need for the identity of the policy-holders to be made clearer. A strong public policy argument exists for ensuring that the auditor has a clear duty of care towards all stakeholders in a company, including creditors, employees and pension fund beneficiaries as well as present and future equity investors. All these classes of consumer rely on the information which is certified as true and fair by the audit statement, and all feel cheated when financial scandals reveal that their confidence is misplaced and they have no adequate redress. Deepening the auditor's statutory obligation by imposing some concrete meaning on the true and fair view, and widening that obligation by extending the class of users to whom the auditor owes a duty of care, would imply an increase in audit costs. The current lack of transparency makes it impossible to judge the optimal mix in this public policy cost-benefit trade-off. In a sense, however, the exact nature of the rules which determine the auditor's obligation is less important than that the rules should be clear and transparent. If, for example, the auditor's duties were confirmed to be exceptionally shallow and only to apply to a narrow group of users, this would have two important effects. First, it would place a harsh focus on the prices charged for the audit signature. Why should such high sums be paid, and why should the 'Big 6' firms' audit signatures command such a high premium, if the value of the product is so limited? Second, it would better expose the gap in the market for financial guarantees. This would stimulate the development of a variety of non-statutory audit products which really met the demands of the users of financial information. The financial institutions would be able to develop meaningful financial guarantees backed by accounting firm signatures and connected to clear obligations as to the accuracy of the data being certified. This would open the way to real competition on price and quality. Audited accounts are of such importance to such a wide class of users that one would hope the statutory audit obligation will in practice settle some way above this minimum level. The statutory audit should offer real benefits to these users for which they would be prepared to pay. Policy reforms which fudge the issues, or which attempt to solve the principal/agent problem by marginal tinkering with the existing system, are unlikely to deliver the benefits which the financial system requires. *Competition in European Accounting, to be published in May by Lafferty Publications, the Tower, IDA Centre, Pearse, St Dublin 2, Pounds 545.

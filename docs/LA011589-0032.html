			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> KISS ME DEADLY: Can a rock video slander a building? That's what attorneys for  New York real estate baron William Kaufman contend. In fact, they've filed suit  in Manhattan Supreme Court for a temporary injunction to prevent MTV from  airing "Let's Put the X in Sex," a popular Kiss clip that features the band  performing in front of a 42-story office tower owned by Kaufman's Sage Realty.  "It's pretty obvious it's supposed to be a 42-story phallic symbol," Kaufman  attorney Bob Ward told the New York Post. "They are panning up and down,  shooting (Kiss bassist) Gene Simmons' crotch. It's not the kind of thing we  want our client associated with. It is a fancy building that seeks high rents  from tenants."  </P> <P> Ward also claimed that Kiss shot the video under false pretenses, saying it was  for a high-fashion video. Not so, says Kiss management, who said the realtor  was given a contract clearing stating the clip was intended as a rock video.  "I'll never look at the New York skyline the same way again," Kiss vocalist  Paul Stanley told Pop Eye. "But I think it's hysterical. It's especially funny  that they're the ones who are calling their own building a phallic symbol, not  us. The way I look at it, if they're building 42-story phallic symbols, they  should at least put a sleeve on them."  </P> <P> Stanley also disputed Ward's claim that Kiss' video pans up and down Gene  Simmons' crotch. "Just so none of our fans get the wrong idea," he said. "It's  my crotch."  </P></p>

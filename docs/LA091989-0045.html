			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush's impending summit conference on education is already a success  simply because it is taking place, two Republican governors -- speaking on  behalf of the National Governors Assn. -- said. No matter what happens next  week in the closed sessions, Govs. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa and Garrey E.  Carruthers of New Mexico told a Washington news conference, the spotlight will  be on the national crisis in education. The conference is to take place at the  University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Since 1986, the National Governors  Assn. has issued extensive reports on education in America. Branstad and  Carruthers called the news conference to issue this year's report, in which the  governors renewed their call for "national education goals" to guide the states  and local communities.  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Fashion: Why baggy shorts are down and out - John Morgan urges Englishmen to use more imagination when packing their holiday clothes It is always easy to spot the Englishman on holiday. He is the burnt one, whose clothes - an untantalising mixture of sagging swimwear and ill-chosen separates - set him apart so dismally from most other nationalities. Many men who dress appropriately for the office and attractively at weekends, often abandon any vestige of sartorial savoir faire at passport control. This is an unnecessary shame: a holiday wardrobe, like any other, requires only a little imaginative application and a modicum of self-knowledge. The first rule of holiday dressing (assuming a reasonably sophisticated destination that offers the usual mix of beach life, sight-seeing and night life) is to remember that the same body you live with throughout the year comes on holiday too and, thus, clothes that do not suit your shape at home will look even worse abroad. This may seem obvious, but I am constantly amazed by how many Englishmen dress like clowns when on holiday. The right clothes make economic as well as practical sense, as they will integrate happily into your general summer wardrobe when you return home. The second principle is to go easy on colour. The English complexion may look peerless when celebrated by Lely or Gainsborough, but does not stand up well to the harsh glare of the southern sun. Unclothed, I, like many of my compatriots, bear a striking, and seriously unappetising, resemblance to saumon en croute before it goes in the oven. Leave bright colours to others and, instead, look at soft cream, stone, ecru and white, with a few earth tones - such as terracotta and indigo for the more adventurous. A restricted colour palette will also help with the third prerequisite of the holiday wardrobe - interchangeability. So will sticking to clothes in plain rather than patterned fabrics. No one wants to travel with masses of luggage, yet most people pack far more than they need. Everything described here is designed to work together in different combinations, depending on weather conditions and dress codes. So we come to the components. The first necessity is a good lightweight jacket. It is both practical and versatile and its pockets mean you need not wear a money belt which, although undeniably useful, is grisly to look at. The jacket should be made of linen, which is the coolest and most breathable of cloths. Man-made fibres, no matter how advanced, should be left at home. Some of the nicest jackets comes from Dries van Noten at Joseph. Made from white linen, they are unstructured and cut fashionably long. Alternatively, plump for a more robust white cotton drill blazer bristling with antique brass buttons from Voyage, an excellent shop in London's Fulham Road selling clothes ideal for travelling. You also need to pack a couple of pairs of trousers. These could be the lightweight linens, matching the Dries van Noten jacket, a pair of more substantial cotton chinos from The Gap, in khaki, stone and salt, or, more fashionably, a pair of draw string, pyjama-style pants from Voyage. These would look much more up-to-the-minute than jeans and are also more comfortable in hot climates. When it comes to the vexed question of shorts, length is crucial. Too long and you will look like a superannuated boy scout; too short and you appear undressed. Opt for a beautifully-cut, mid-length pair in stone-coloured linen by Margaret Howell. They are flattering and versatile. Passable cheaper versions can be found at Thomas Burberry, Marks and Spencer and The Gap. Margaret Howell also scores well with her understated, relaxed shirts in cotton or linen. These are cut generously, are cool to wear and can be teamed with trousers, shorts and worn as a cover-up on the beach. Also include a selection of classic polo shirts in Sea Island cotton from John Smedley and plenty of white cotton T-shirts by the American manufacturer, Hanes. Should you need clothing for a black tie occasion, an exquisitely-made, knife-pleated evening shirt from Budd, in the coolest cotton voile, is the most elegant thing you can wear. A summer suit is also recommended. Ivory linen is always the most glamorous choice. It can be worn on any occasion when you have to dress up a little and its components can be worn separately with other items in your holiday wardrobe. Also, with the addition of the Budd evening shirt, a corded silk black bow tie and a pair of patent pumps, it will convert into an acceptable tropical dinner jacket. Designer Paul Smith has a three-button, single-breasted version that manages, in true Smith fashion, to look both classic and contemporary. More conventional tastes could invest in his khaki cotton version or an even more traditional model in olive, buff or navy from Hackett, although neither of these could be transformed into black tie. When it comes to beachwear, I am rather tired of seeing Englishmen lolloping about in baggy shorts. I feel that surfing jams look best on those for whom they were originally intended. Opt instead for a pair of well-designed classic swimming trunks. Speedo have good styles including a model made in a special sleek lightweight fabric developed for professional swimmers. Look out, too, for designs by the Los Angeles Sporting Club at branches of Sports Locker. Black or darkest navy blue, remain the smartest colour choice. Remember, white is for exhibitionists only as it becomes transparent when wet. The beach look is completed with a cotton singlet available in a selection of muted hues from Voyage. This year's most trendy holiday garment is a Kikoi from Kenya, which works as a wrap, towel, mat and, for some men, tropical night wear. When choosing footwear, espadrilles are de rigueur. Both Ralph Lauren and Dries van Noten have attractive designer versions, but you are probably best buying them on location. You should also include a couple of pairs of Superga Originali plimsolls, in navy, white or ecru, a washable deck shoe by Dexter, a pair of the lightest canvas desert boots from Fratelli Rossetti and a pair of formal light-brown lace-up shoes. I am particularly impressed with John Lobb Oxfords at Kurt Geiger, which are elegant and light. If you want to wear sandals, Paul Smith has a handsome classic design in brown or black leather. A cotton sweater is a must for cool evenings - and there is little to beat Marion Foale's classic, understated and beautifully-made knitwear. The look would be completed by a fold-up, wide-brimmed, panama from Herbert Johnson, a couple of silk ties from Turnbull &amp; Asser and sunglasses from the Paul Smith range. With these purchases you will have a holiday wardrobe that, although classic in inspiration, will be modern, practical and stylish. Bon voyage. John Morgan is associate editor of GQ Magazine.</p>

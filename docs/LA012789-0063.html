			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INTERACTION WITH AUDIENCE BECOMES A KEY INGREDIENT IN ARTIST'S WORKS  </P> <P> Beverly Naidus believes that she is a social activist as well an an artist. Her  work relentlessly reminds onlookers of the injustices in our society and the  world at large.  </P> <P> "If I have access to space, I have access to raising consciousness," she said.  </P> <P> So when an exhibit of her work opens Monday at the Main Gallery of Cal State  Northridge, Naidus hopes that her audience will find her work, at the very  least, provocative.  </P> <P> Three of her audience-participatory installations will be on display through  Feb. 24. Viewers are encouraged to share their reactions, and their feedback is  subsequently incorporated into Naidus' creations. Such interaction is her  trademark.  </P> <P> Two of the installations, "Please Take a Number" and "This Is Not a Test," have  been exhibited before. In the former, viewers, with their shoes removed,  actually walk on top of the art, which is a maze with a series of platforms on  which people can stand. As they proceed through the maze, participants are  faced with the juxtaposition of confronting the world's problems versus the  individual need and desire to escape through drugs, TV, shopping and the like.  </P> <P> In "This Is Not a Test," Naidus presents an eerie scenario of what the world  will be like in the event of a nuclear war. A bedroom in shambles sets the mood  for this work, as slides commemorating the beauty of nature flash in front of  the dreary backdrop. An audiotape expresses the thoughts common to many people  -- they never realized a nuclear holocaust could really happen.  </P> <P> Naidus' "The Nightmare Quilt" makes its debut in this show. Ninety-two painted  images reveal both the evils that plague society and the possible alternatives  that can bring about a better world.  </P> <P> In all three works, viewers are invited to write down their nightmares, hopes,  fears and dreams on slips of paper and then deposit them within the artwork.  "If I can make one or two people out of 100 feel less isolated, then it's all  worthwhile," Naidus said.  </P> <P> The practice of having audience members reveal their feelings began by accident  when Naidus exhibited "This Is Not a Test" at the New York Coliseum in  Manhattan. "People left me notes under the bed," she recalled. "People wanted  to talk about the issues. So, I thought, why not make the exhibits more of an  invitation for people to speak out?"  </P> <P> Also on exhibit at CSUN's gallery will be 12 drawings from Naidus' series  "Taking the Empire's New Clothes to the Laundry." In each drawing, she depicts  an environment and then proposes alternative behaviors -- for example, she has  drawn a health club but then suggests that viewers might not necessarily  benefit from the anxiety of working toward a perfect body. Once again, it is  social change that Naidus is striving for.  </P> <P> Originally from Glenrock, N.J. -- a town that she describes as conservative --  Naidus studied art at Carlton College in Minnesota before moving to New York  City in 1975. "I was interested in sociology, history, language, theater and  art, and saw this as the best way to synthesize everything," she said. She  received her master's degree from Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, where  she said it was safe to experiment in new artistic genres.  </P> <P> Naidus, 35, continues this tradition of exploring and encouraging the  development of new methods of expression in a class, titled "Art and Social  Issues/Mixed Media," that she teaches at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> "It proves a wonderful outlet for students," Naidus said. "Things they've  experienced and issues that matter to them -- suicide, apathy, racism -- they  can now include in their work."  </P> <P> Despite the somewhat depressing quality of her work, Naidus is interested in  focusing on the importance of change and choice. She sees the empowerment of  people as a viable alternative to apathy and hopelessness. In keeping with this  philosophy, from 1 to 4 p.m. Feb. 25, Naidus and social ecologist Bob Spivey  will offer a free workshop at the Mai Gallery that deals with the individual's  capacity for change and self-empowerment.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are aware of what is going on, but they become numb," she  said. "There are a lot of things wrong in society, but people can still have a  sense of hope. People need to know that we can have a future -- and not one of  endless war, crime and fear. It all starts with individuals doing little  things, getting involved. People need to hold on to their dreams for a better  future because if we lose our dreams, we lose everything."  </P></p>

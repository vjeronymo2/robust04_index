			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] EP [Peruvian Army] General Jaime Salinas Sedo,  retired, was absolved yesterday by the Military Court Supreme  Council on charges of slandering the Armed Forces. The Military  Court, nevertheless, sentenced him to 60 days imprisonment for  slandering his superior, Army Commander Nicolas Hermoza Rios.    Military Court Prosecutor Colonel Raul Talledo Valdiviezo  appealed the sentence after it was announced. He had requested a  four year prison term and a fine of 100,000 soles. [passage  omitted]</p>

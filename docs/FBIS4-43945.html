			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Admiral Jan Klenberg, commander in  chief of the defense forces, the implementation of disarmament  agreements between the superpowers is causing a military  build-up in northern Europe. Russia is transferring more troops  to areas near Finland because of the Conventional Forces in  Europe Treaty, and the implementation of Start II is making the  Northern Fleet the most important nuclear weapons center for  Russia.    Klenberg was explaining the military development of the  Calotte area in Rovaniemi today. Klenberg said that there are  no changes in the military situation in northern Europe despite  the upheavals in Central Europe.    Klenberg also reiterated the defense forces' negative stance  toward new road and railway connections to areas that are  important from the military point of view. However, the  Ministry of Communications is continuing to plan the Salla  [northeastern Finland] railway line. Experts evaluating the  profitability of the Salla railway line have recommended that  one-third of the financing come from share capital and long-term  transport agreements. The rest would be financed with loans  from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The  Ministry of Communications is to have talks on the project with  the Russians at a ministerial meeting planned for the autumn.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Devaluation of D-mark would alleviate strains on weaker European currencies Sir, The huge differential between the high German and low American interest rates gives a dramatic decline of the dollar rate and puts strong pressures on the weaker European currencies. In order to alleviate the strains and, possibly, even give way to interest rate reductions in the recession-mired European economies, there is an increasing number of economists who advocate a revaluation of the D-Mark. But is this policy advice really correct? Is not the opposite policy step more likely to give the desired result? There are at least two reasons why a devaluation of the D-Mark is the better policy option. The first reason is that the present uncertainty in the financial markets up till at least the French referendum is driven by psychological factors and the policy makers' credibility. A revaluation of the D-Mark would prove that all the speculators are right and that there is a difference between the D-Mark and the rest. It would also show that little has changed in terms of European integration and that the old credibility ranking is still relevant. Hence, a D-Mark revaluation is likely to postpone indefinitely prospects of reducing the interest rate spreads between Germany and the rest. A devaluation of the D-Mark would totally change the rules of the game. The speculators would be on the wrong side. Such an outcome has lasting effects on the general comprehension of the European currencies. It would show that much has happened in Europe over the last decade. A devaluation of the D-Mark might well reduce the interest rate spreads with Germany and could possibly totally wipe them out for some countries. The second reason is based on economic fundamentals. Take France. Any comparison between the present economic situation in France and Germany shows that France is in a far better position. One way to look at Germany after reunification is to acknowledge that the west German capital stock must now serve another 16m people from the east. Old East German capital stock is obsolete. Hence, capital is scarcer and labour more abundant. Thus, a new equilibrium requires that capital returns must increase and labour cost decline. So far, the opposite has happened. A revaluation of the D-Mark would prolong the movement in the wrong direction. German labour costs would increase on an international comparison, but the large German traded goods sector would have to reduce its prices. A revaluation of the D-Mark would give a profit squeeze. A devaluation would take the economy closer to a new equilibrium. German labour costs would decline on an international comparison. Prices might, and profits certainly would, increase. In summary, there are two important reasons why the D-Mark should not be revalued, but devalued. To convince the Bundesbank is another story.

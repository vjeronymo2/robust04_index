			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith set to spell out vote stance MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, is expected today to indicate the extent to which he still backs the principle of 'one-member-one-vote' when the party's National Executive Committee debates Labour's links with trade unions, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr Smith, who backed the principle during his campaign for the party leadership last summer, will respond to a review group's interim report on options for reducing Labour's trade union links. A proposal for 'associate membership' for trade union members has been opposed by Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour leader, who supports one-member-one-vote. Decisions are expected to be put forward by the NEC for approval at the party conference after consultations with party members. The review group has proposed an end to the union block vote at conference and the eventual introduction of one-member-one-vote for the selection of candidates and election of the party leader. But Mr Smith faces pressure from unions for a strong link.</p>

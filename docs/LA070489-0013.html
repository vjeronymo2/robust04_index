			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NOT-SO-GOOD-OLD FOURTH  </P> <P> President Bush says that growing up in the Constitution State of Connecticut,  the Fourth of July was the perfect holiday, with flags, parades and political  speeches -- introducing a small boy to the promise of America. But for millions  of other small boys back then and in intervening years, the Fourth offered most  an inalienable right to try to blow themselves up and set fire to random fields  and houses, if not entire towns.  </P> <P> In many states, it was legal not just to buy sparklers, Roman candles and  fountains of fire, but massive firecrackers that resembled small sticks of  dynamite. These red cylinders were about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, packed  with black powder and with a fuse -- always too short a fuse -- protruding from  the side. One favorite tactic was to light one under an empty tin can to see  how far in the air the can would go. There would be a "fuh-whump" sound and the  can would rocket perhaps 40 or 50 feet straight up. When it came down, all the  boys would run to see how much damage was done. A solid No. 2 tomato can would  wind up bulging like a mushroom. Impressive power for boys.  </P> <P> There were times, of course, when the fuse was lit, the can was placed on top  of the 'cracker, and nothing happened. Did it go out? Was it a dud? Or was the  fuse a particularly slow-burning one, still sputtering its way toward the black  powder? One of the bigger, and braver, boys would inch up to the can, front  foot ready to push off in fast retreat, and tentatively tip the can back to  see. Sad to say, there are many grown men today with only one eye or perhaps  missing a finger or two, who discovered that, alas, the fuse was still burning.  </P> <P> Another favorite practice was to light an entire string of 20 or so smaller  firecrackers and watch them go off in sporadic sequence, jumping about with the  force of the reports. It was not unusual for one to soar unnoticed into a dry  field nearby to smolder quietly and later erupt into fire. Silver-wrapped  cherry bombs in the hands of bullies were used to terrorize little girls and  dogs. These were the kind that were thrown on a sidewalk and exploded on  impact, scattering tinfoil shrapnel about. Big boys had fun conducting duels  with exploding Roman candles pointed at each other.  </P> <P> Such explosives are almost universally banned now. But even the so-called safe  and sane fireworks are dangerous in the wrong hands. How many small children  have suffered terrible burns by picking up the wrong end of a sparkler that has  just burned itself out? Perhaps it was one that an older child pitched into the  air to see the sparkles arc through the Fourth of July evening sky.  </P> <P> There is some irony in the fact that the regulation of commerce has abridged  the rights of American youth to celebrate Independence Day with such  pyrotechnic abandon. Ah, for the good old days. But millions of American  parents, physicians and firemen are grateful that is so. The good new days may  not be quite as exciting, but they are a good deal safer.  </P></p>

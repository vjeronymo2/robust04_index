			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FERGUSON BILL AIMED AT ADULT NEWS RACKS FAILS  </P> <P> Worried about a possible infringement on First Amendment guarantees of free  speech, a Senate committee on Tuesday moved to bury a bill sponsored by  Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) that would all but ban the sale of  sexually explicit tabloids from sidewalk news racks.  </P> <P> The intent of the measure was to keep graphic pornography out of the hands of  minors, whom Ferguson and others claimed have used their school lunch money to  buy the tabloids from the stands found near doughnut shops, post offices and  grocery stores in places such as Huntington Beach and Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> Backed by Los Angeles County and the state's PTA, Ferguson's bill would curtail  the sale of sex-related newspapers by requiring those showing sex acts or lewd  depictions of genitalia to post adult supervisors at the coin-operated stands  -- an economic burden designed to drive the publications out of business or  into private establishments such as adult bookstores.  </P> <P> The measure gained surprising support from some civil libertarians in the  Assembly and seemed to be gaining behind-the-scenes momentum on the Senate side  before Tuesday's hearing.  </P> <P> But the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 5-4 to stop the Ferguson bill by  holding onto it for interim study, a move that many acknowledged was the death  knell for the measure this year.  </P> <P> "At least it's gone for the time being," said Margaret Pena, legislative  director for the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposed the bill.  "You've seen the proponents on the bill. They'll be here next year and the year  after that."  </P> <P> In voting to hold onto the bill, Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) cited possible  First Amendment problems with the way it tried to restrict the sale of the  tabloids. Instead of concentrating on the "time, place and manner" of the news  rack sales, the measure instead dwelt on the contents of the publications, he  said.  </P> <P> "I'm sympathetic to families trying to inculcate values that they believe in  their children," said Lockyer. "I'm not sure that state intervention in  people's lives is the way to accomplish that."  </P> <P> "It probably means that a family has already failed when it hasn't taught the  kid before: 'This is junk. You're not interested in that,' " he said. "And if  they (minors) have an interest in it, they're going to find a way to get it."  </P> <P> Ferguson, however, said his measure was aimed at relocating the sale of the  explicit magazines, not regulating their contents. He said state laws already  ban the sale of such sex-related tabloids near schools and parks.  </P> <P> "It might be more obvious to them if there's a loophole in the law that allowed  liquor, whiskey, to be sold from a vending machine from which they (minors) had  access," Ferguson said. "They would quickly see that that's a loophole and they  would do away with it."  </P> <P> Ferguson also said Tuesday's vote was a "shocking surprise" because he had been  led to believe by some senators that they would be voting for his bill.  Although he declined to name names, he added: "I'm disappointed by the Los  Angeles vote."  </P> <P> Among those voting to shelve the bill were President Pro Tempore David A.  Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). Others were  Lockyer, Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) and Barry Keene (D-Benicia).  </P> <P> After the hearing, Ferguson said he received a telephone call from a  representative of Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, whose  office has decided to "try to intercede" with Roberti and Torres to switch  their votes and unearth the proposal before the end of the legislative session  on Aug. 31.  </P> <P> Ferguson's effort is his third since 1987, and is follow-up legislation to his  1988 bill that prohibited the sex-related newspapers from putting "harmful  matter" on their covers to spur news rack sales.  </P> <P> Senators voting to approve Ferguson's bill were Ed Davis (R-Valencia); Robert  Presley (D-Riverside), Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) and John Doolittle  (R-Rocklin).  </P></p>

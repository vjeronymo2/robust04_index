			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 11, IRNA -- The British Government has  bugged the Iranian Embassy in London in breach of the  international laws and regulations, President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani disclosed here today.    He made the remark during his speech at the end of the  Iranian press festival, where he said the Iranian staff at the  embassy could discover the hidden microphones, installed by the  British MI-6.    "The British Government has launched propaganda moves in  order to overshadow the issues," said the president.    Britain has accused Iran of collaboration with the Irish  Republican Army (IRA), in a bid to prevent a blatant fiasco  against the British Government.    Details of the president speech will be aired later.    The president said the British Government made the  accusation of Tehran's collaboration with IRA after Iran charged  the British Government with planting a microphone at Iranian  Embassy in London to spy on the activities of the embassy staff.    "In fact the (British) accusation was made almost  immediately  after the discovery of the microphone," stressed the president.    President Rafsanjani said the British accusations were  "white  faced lies" and unfounded for which Britain did not provide any  evidence.    He said the discovery of the microphone could lead to a big  scandal for London but the British Government launched a  propaganda ballyhoo in coordination with the British press to  create a smoke screen and cover up the issue. Hashemi also  expressed surprise that all dailies and magazines in Britain,  even the ones on the left, began attacking Iran "in unison", a  fact that showed the press in Britain was not that independent  after all.    Elsewhere, the president said imperialism has launched a  conspiracy to undermine the people's morale, and force them to  believe that they had achieved nothing from the victory of the  Islamic revolution.    He regretted that a few local press follow the imperialist  press, however, he asked the Iranian press to cover both the  weak points and strong points.    "The press should avoid biased attitudes, and refrain from  proposing factional issues, but try to fullfil their duties by  taking into account the national interests," said the president.    President Rafsanjani said that he had tried to create a free  atmosphere for the press, and added that he would never allow a  writer to come under pressure because of expressing his or her  ideas.    "The total press system in Iran have rendered very good  services, and I expect them to take a more fair position  concerning the issues."</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (6): Buzzing with prospects - Michael Wiltshire highlights advances in desktop publishing Advancing technology is rapidly changing the definition of basic desktop publishing  - or DTP, as it is called  - since almost all media material can now be processed on today's powerful desktop computers. While many users in the past decade have thought of DTP merely as a way of producing printed documents, the industry is buzzing with prospects of the new electronic infrastructure that goes far beyond putting ink on paper. Today's powerful desktop computer systems can also help turn a brochure or book into a compact disc (CD-ROM), or bring its contents on-line, delivered through a computer. Publishing on electronic media, particularly Internet, which links 2.2m computers and 25m users in 137 countries, was a key topic at this month's Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco. 'In no way is publishing just getting 'ink on paper,' although that will surely remain at the core for many years to come,' comments David Heath of Apple Computer  - the largest single computer vendor to the publishing industry. There are several key DTP markets. At the the lower-end, there is the personal or 'office DTP' sector, which includes in-house publishing for the promotion of products or services. Then, at the higher end, there is professional DTP, described by Apple as 'Publishing for profit.' This includes graphic art services and pre-press work for advertising and publishing of newspapers, books and magazines. In the past four years, the complex DTP market has further fragmented. Apart from increasing applications for electronic lay-out tools by designers and advertising agencies, corporate publishers are producing long, 'content-driven' technical documents and reports which may range from, say, 100 to 3,000 pages. In this sector, personal computers with Windows packages are increasingly evident. In a third development, feature-rich word processing packages are infringing on the traditional DTP market. Increasingly, businesses, educators, governments and individual computer users need systems to author, access and work with the emerging electronic base of information. This aggressive focus on emerging technologies for what is called 'information authoring,' is also leading to mergers in the DTP software industry. Speed of use, cost-cutting, advanced software and colour-management for paper documents are among the hot issues at the higher end of DTP. Another important topic is the ability to view information on-line, using electronic distribution of documents. Publishing is seldom the product of just one or two people. While increasingly powerful PCs are coming to the market, the Apple Mac is still dominant in the pre-press process, both for graphics, advertising and design agencies. Apple has now introduced the Power Macintosh, a new 'platform' based on the PowerPC, developed jointly by IBM, Apple and Motorola. The Power Mac is claimed to offer from two to 10 times the performance of current Mac and Windows-based computers. This speed permits faster use of graphics packages, allowing designers more time to explore varying approaches. For example, the intricate process of picture colour-matching can now be achieved in a fraction of the time it took in the past. Publishers can therefore cut costs while handling more complex documents, while also expanding into new media beyond ink on paper, eventually integrating sound, video, animation, text and still images. For users of DTP systems, the information explosion via the desktop computer is also leading to increasing demands for document and data management, allowing rapid levels of access before the final document is assembled. 'There's no need to send reams of printed information around companies now,' suggests Fiona O'Carroll, European marketing manager of Frame Technology, the US document publishing group. 'Users can rapidly view well-laid-out documents on-line or via CD-Rom disc. A lot of libraries, for example, are using this system.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "General Morillon </F> Appointed to the Rapid Deployment Force"]    [Text] General of the Army Corps Philippe Morillon will be  appointed at this morning's Council of Ministers meeting to take  command of the FAR [Rapid Deployment Force]. He will take over  at the head of this large unit from General Bertrand de la  Presle who, a few days ago, himself took over from General Jean  Cot as head of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops in the  former Yugoslavia.    We all remember the "Philippe of Bosnia," or "General  Courage" of one year ago. General Morillon, with the backing of  Paris, took the front seat in a perilous mission to evacuate  thousands of wounded people from the Muslim enclaves of Cerska  and Srebenica. He did this in the face of hostile Serbian  besiegers. He also did this, it should be admitted, scorning UN  guidelines for "good" conduct. We all remember his voice,  serious, warm, and full of emotion, and his words of resistance  transmitted essentially to the West on the only radio that then  connected him with the outside world.    General Morillon had to leave Bosnia a few months later  when,  in the summer, General Cot was asked to take charge of the  UNPROFOR troops. After being granted leave for recuperation and  to write "an account of the most absurd war" entitled To  Believe and To Dare, the Chronicle of Sarajevo, he was  employed as an adviser to the Defense Ministry. This was a  holding post for a soldier today aged 50.    The initial plan of the French chiefs of staff was reported  to be that General Morillon, with his experience of leading men  and peacekeeping operations, should be made available to the  United Nations to strengthen the limited resources of the  international organization's chiefs of staff in New York, a body  that is far too small. Butrus Butrus-Ghali did not accept  France's proposal, doubtless because he did not want to  displease certain diplomats, whom he could have upset not so  much from the point of view of their comfort, but rather their  very anglo-saxon habits and style.  <H5>  Tenth Anniversary </H5>   The FAR is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.  Created when the Land Army was still composed of three corps,  it replied to a major concern that was largely political:  demonstrating France's desire to be, in the event of major  conflict in central Europe, not just solidly behind the allies  but immediately at their side. The force had to be capable of  being deployed "quickly and far."    Now, this idea of rapid deployment is gaining ground. It  lies at the heart of the thinking behind the new white paper on  defense. Since the threat from central Europe has diminished,  the Land Army has, to some extent, been called upon to "deploy  itself far and wide" since all of its operational resources --  120,000 men in eight or nine divisions -- must be capable of  "reaching out" over long distances.    The FAR will thus increasingly share its unique mission with  the mechanized armored corps. As a reserve force, it will  retain its airborne capacity and as a result will be equipped  with lighter resources. It will comprise 45,000 men and, for a  few weeks, will still consist of five divisions: the 11th  Parachute Division, the 6th Light Armored Division, the 9th  Marine Infantry Division, the 4th Airborne Division; and the  27th Alpine Division. It is the latter which, on 1 July, will  be subordinated to the 3rd Army Corps where, with increased  equipment, it will become the 27th Mountain Infantry Division.</p>

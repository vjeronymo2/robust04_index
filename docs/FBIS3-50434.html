In other words, about  800 armed men are still operating in a disorganized manner in  small groups.    The Army reported that throughout 1993, there were 247  clashes, 137 murders, 105 kidnappings, 254 assaults, 58 burned  vehicles, 19 cases of sabotage, 29 group demobilizations, and  1,059 confiscated weapons. It is said that the remaining armed  groups are less important and will be fought through Army  operations, especially in the coffee zones. Army General  Humberto Ortega assessed the actions needed to bring about peace  in the country.    [Begin Ortega recording] We can surely say that there is  greater security now than last year and the year before that. A  specific example is that early this year and halfway into last  year, tens of thousands of all kinds of weapons were in civilian  hands, but they are no longer in their hands because those  weapons were destroyed. Between 1992 and 1993, we have  destroyed more than 150,000 combat devices of all types.  Undoubtedly, removing these weapons has improved security.    Moreover, the groups that were here with [word indistinct]  legitimacy because they had their enclaves, seven enclaves, and  enjoyed the political support from certain sectors, from one  side or another, no longer exist. There were several thousand.  They included El Indomable [Jose Angel Moran], El Chacal [Jose  Angel Talavera], Pedro el Hondureno [Victor Manuel Gallegos],  the revueltos [mixed groups of recontras and recompas], and  others. Those people no longer exist. They are no longer there  defying the authorities, defying public order, or defying the  Constitution. They were disarmed thanks to the amnesty.    In this way, actually, we have made, objectively speaking,  some progress in offering security to the country. Now, what we  have today is a higher crime rate. In other words, the ending  of the danger of belligerent armed groups of the political sort,  [words indistinct] has coincided with an increase in the  socioeconomic crisis and in the crime rate, which is the case in  all countries. The only difference is that, in our case, there  are still certain individuals who did not take advantage of the  peace process and who failed to surrender their weapons. They  [words indistinct] criminals who have [word indistinct] those  criminals in small groups. They are dangerous because they  still have some of these combat weapons. Therefore, this is  basically the danger we are facing.    Undoubtedly, between 1990 and the present, we have  definitely  achieved substantial progress in national security. [end  recording]</p>

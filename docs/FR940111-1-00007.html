See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule are not retroactive and preempt State laws to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this proposed rule. Before any legal action is brought regarding determinations made under the provisions of 7 CFR part 723, the administrative appeal provisions set forth at 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This proposed rule would impose new record keeping and information collection requirements on domestic manufacturers of cigarettes and related tobacco industry business beginning January 1, 1994. The contents of and justification for the reporting and record keeping requirements will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, under OMB No. 0560&hyph;0058, for review and approval in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended. Comments regarding these requirements in this proposed rule and suggested alternatives may be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20503; and to the Department of Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, room 404&hyph;W, Washington, DC 20250.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Summary of Statutory Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 320B of the 1938 Act imposes certain requirements on ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes'' and those manufacturers are defined in section 301 of the 1938 Act to be those that produce and sell at least one percent of the cigarettes produced and sold in the United States. Section 320B requires that those manufacturers specify each year, in advance, their expected purchases of burley and flue-cured tobacco. The sanction for failing to do so accurately, within certain limits, is that the manufacturer must pay an additional assessment to offset the cost of the Federal tobacco program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 320C provides for additional requirements that must be met by ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes'' to avoid additional assessments. The provisions of section 320C are set out in greater detail below in the description of the content and organization of the proposed rule. Generally, under section 320C manufacturers who are ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes'' must certify each year the percentage of U.S. tobacco used in their cigarettes. If more than 25 percent is imported tobacco, the manufacturer must pay an assessment. Also, if this limit is exceeded, the manufacturer must make compensatory purchases of tobacco from the burley and flue-cured producer loan associations and may be required to pay a penalty for failing to make such compensatory purchases in a timely manner. Under section 320C(f), the 75/25 ratio may be reduced if the Secretary determines that U.S. tobacco supply conditions warrant a reduction due to conditions beyond the control of producers. Also, section 320C requires that manufacturers file reports and maintain records as specified by the Secretary to enforce that section. Failure to file required reports or maintain records, or the submission of false information can lead to criminal penalties as well as other sanctions. Other new provisions concerning assessments on imported tobacco enacted in the 1993 Act will be implemented in a separate rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Coverage of the Proposed Rule; Definition of Tobacco  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The 75/25 ratio is referred to in the rule as the ``domestic content requirement.'' Since this requirement is a calendar year requirement under section 320C, the proposed rule would apply the requirement first in 1994. The authorizing statute was enacted well into 1993. There is nothing in the Act to provide for making the provisions retroactive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement applies only to ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes.'' The statute does not limit, as such, the content requirement to cigarettes produced by those manufacturers in the United States. The fact that section 320C applies the requirement only to certain ``domestic'' manufacturers, and given other provisions of section 320C, the proposed rule limits the coverage to cigarettes produced by subject manufacturers in the United States. For that purpose, the rule defines ``United States,'' consistent with section 301 of the 1938 Act, to be the fifty States, the territories of the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. With respect to limiting coverage to domestic production, section 320C(b) provides that the sanctions in 320C(c), (d), and (e) will apply when the use of ``imported tobacco'' exceeds 25 percent. Tobacco becomes ``imported'' only by reference to a domestic market. Hence, it appears clear that the statute was intended to cover only domestic production of cigarettes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The central study group of the provincial party  committee devoted three days, from 29 to 31 March, to  intensively studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping and the "Decision of the CPC Central  Committee on Some Questions Concerning the Establishment of the  Socialist Market Economy." In light of their own actual cases  regarding ideological understanding and work, members of the  study group talked freely. During the closing session,  provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered an  important speech on theoretical study for leading cadres.    The provincial party committee central study group's main  purpose in organizing this intensive study class was to enable  its members to emancipate their minds, change their concepts,  and to explore a general policy for Hunan Province to embrace  the market economy. The provincial party committee demanded that  members participating in the intensive study class concentrate  on reading the original text of the works and documents,  thoroughly study and understand the essence of Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as  well as the basic content and important significance of the  central authorities' decision, and conduct research on special  topics with reference to the reality in Hunan as well as the  specific tasks assigned to them.    On the afternoon the study class closed, Comrade Wang Maolin  delivered a speech. He said: Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the important  theoretical foundation on which to build socialism well, and the  theoretical ground for our party to formulate its line,  principles, and policies. Our comrades holding leading posts,  especially those holding high-level leading posts, must properly  implement the party's line, principles, and policies and do a  good job in performing the duties that the party and the people  have entrusted to them. Without studying Deng Xiaoping's theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics well, they  will not be able to perform their duties well, thus they will  fail to accomplish the tasks the party and the people assign to  them.    Wang Maolin demanded that everybody conscientiously read the  original text of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  in a thorough and down-to-earth manner, with close reference to  actual cases, try to understand the works' spiritual essence,  and apply the theory to actual work.    Members of the standing committee of the provincial party  committee, the principal comrades in charge of the provincial  people's congress and the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference provincial committee, vice governors,  and the secretary general of the provincial government attended  this study class organized by the central study group of the  provincial party committee.</p>

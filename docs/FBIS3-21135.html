			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Cooperation with Uruguay in plastics testing  technology has begun in earnest, mainly under the direction of  MITI. The purpose of this cooperation is to transfer product and  material testing and inspection technology that is essential to  the growth of the plastics manufacturing industry. The  installation of testing and inspection equipment is near  completion, and increasing numbers of expert engineers are being  dispatched from Japan, so the transfer of technology has moved  into the implementation phase. MITI plans to implement the same  kind of technical cooperation in Asia, and Uruguay will be used  as a model program.    Technical cooperation between Japan and Uruguay has already  been implmented to improve the quality of pulp and paper, and  success in that area has expanded to plastics testing. Japan  signed an agreement for technical cooperation in March 1991 with  LATU, the Uruguay Technical Laboratory under the Ministry of  Industry, Energy, and Mining [literal]. A plastics research lab  was set up at LATU, and transfer of testing technology began.    The technology tranfer is being coordinated in Japan through  MITI and the Japan High Polymer Center. First about fifty types  of the necessary testing and inspection equipment were chosen,  and Japan began sending expert engineers to Uruguay as the  equipment was installed. Recently planning discussions were held  on site, and it was decided that Japan will increase the number  of short-term engineers in addition to those dispatched for  longer periods of time. The range of objects being tested is  also expanding as LATU will begin to provide testing services to  private businesses on consignment.    This technical cooperation will last for four years until  March 1995. Japan will continue to provide cooperation to  Uruguay to aid in its transition from an agricultural to an  industrial nation. Japan considers the plastics manufacturing  industry one cornerstone for this transition.</p>

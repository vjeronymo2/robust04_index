			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Lion Nathan faces challenge in Australia LION Nathan, Australia and New Zealand's biggest brewer, expects satisfactory profits this year but says tougher competition and difficult trading conditions in the Australian beer market will be a challenge. For the six months to February, group profits rose by 72.8 per cent to NZDollars 79.5m (USDollars 42.9m) from NZDollars 46m a year earlier. However, the 1992 result included a six-month contribution from the then 50 per cent owned National Brewing, now fully-owned and known as Lion Nathan Australia. The company is stepping up its interim dividend by 1 cent a share to 6.5 cents. Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive, said yesterday the company had lost 3.6 per cent of its key market share in New South Wales on the same period of last year, but increased it in Queensland, South Australia and Vic-toria. Over the past 12 months, Lion Nathan's share of the Australian beer market was up 1.7 per cent to 40.7 per cent. 'We are ahead of last year but the rate of increase has fallen away,' Mr Myers said. Beer market share in New Zealand was 58.2 per cent. Turnover for the six months rose 136 per cent to NZDollars 1.3bn. The half-year results include extraordinary losses of NZDollars 9.4m and a NZDollars 20m provision for property investment losses. There was a tax credit of NZDollars 6m, against tax paid last time of NZDollars 1m. Mr Myers said the newly-launched Toohey's Blue Label low-alcohol beer had become the top-selling beer in Australia. Lion Nathan International increased exports by 25 per cent with US sales up 37 per cent. Losses from the soft drinks division were reduced to NZDollars 6.7m from NZDollars 7.9m on sales up at NZDollars 112.6m from NZDollars 85.3m. Mr Myers saw the formation of the joint venture with PepsiCo of the US covering both Australia and New Zealand as a 'great growth opportunity'. Group trading profit before interest and tax was NZDollars 197.4m, against NZDollars 97.6m. Interest costs were NZDollars 115.6m, up from Dollars 50.8m for the first half of last year.</p>

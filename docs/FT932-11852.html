			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Christiania Bank returns to profit in first quarter CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second-biggest commercial bank, yesterday reported a return to profits for the first quarter of 1993 following several years of successive losses. The bank achieved a net profit of NKr209m (Dollars 31.2m), against a loss of NKr86m in the first three months of 1992. The improvement was attributed to gains on securities, a 7 per cent reduction in costs and lower credit losses. The performance helped boost Christiania's capital adequacy ratio to 8.9 per cent from 5.8 per cent in the same period last year. Mr Borger Lenth, chief executive, said there were still problems in the corporate lending sector. 'The other major worry is the declining loan volume, which has resulted from the prolonged lack of interest in investing in Norway, both among individuals and in the corporate sector,' he added. Net loan volume fell by NKr5.8bn to NKr78.85bn, while net interest income was largely unchanged at NKr779m. Non-interest income increased by NKr210m to NKr699m, with gains on securities more than doubling to NKr281m and foreign exchange gains rising by NKr15m to NKr117m. Group operating profit, before credit losses and write-downs, increased by NKr264m to NKr783m, while losses on loans and guarantees fell by NKr61m to NKr504m. Operating expenses fell by NKr55m to NKr695m. Christiania warned of higher risk associated with exposure to fish-farming and said this had increased general loan-loss provisions by NKr100m to NKr2.64bn. The bank was also forced to make a specific provision of NKr260m to cover potential loan losses. Net non-performing loans decreased by NKr200m to NKr5.7bn, while gross non-performing loans fell by NKr500m to NKr11.6bn.</p>

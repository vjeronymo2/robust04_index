			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / As They Say in Europe: Let's hear it for nostalgia THE FRENCH proposal to veto the plan for the sun to rise in the east and set in the west ended a rough week for the Paris government at the hands of the press. The papers felt that the nation's leaders had made a mess of defending those central figures of French society, rapeseed farmers (whose emergence has at least ensured there is one more role for Gerard Depardieu in his continuing depiction of the nation's emblematic figures). The day before the Washington deal on oilseeds was struck, the farm minister, Jean-Pierre Soisson, gave a vastly entertaining interview to Liberation which demonstrated the isolation of the British. The next day, there was the barrage of attacks on the 'calamitous' British presidency - just before John Major found himself able to gloat for the first time since April. Thanks to bad tactics, French ministers had helped to produce a result that looked like a British victory. The resulting furore has led to an explosion of nostalgia that seems part of a wider wave of Euro-atavism. One paper, the Tribune Desfosses, wrote: 'France has 1.3m active farmers but 60m citizens are farmers at heart. All proud of their provincial origins, all attached to a piece of land. The United States argues in economic terms, France opposes it with national identity.' There is a corner of a beetroot field that is forever Francois. Humanite described farmers as 'the tree of rurality protecting the forest. Behind these indebted, broken men, there is only wasteland, an inheritance of unemployment. . . Rurality, the life of the countryside, its schools, its postmen, its bars. . .' Whether you see such stuff as noble romanticism or sentimental claptrap, clearly it contains more than a whiff of the 1930s. It owes more to imagination than analysis, though. Reality is far removed from the bucolic fantasies of la douce France supplying the world with a cornucopia of bread and wine, the succulent offspring of a fertile land. In the 1930s, France was a net importer of grain; today, it is the world's second largest exporter. Before the second world war, France harvested less than Canada and accepted grain from the cheapest source. French ministers foster the myth that France's natural role is to provide competition for the US. A corrupt subsidy system is responsible for that. If France ceased to be a major food exporter, cheaper suppliers - including the southern hemisphere and eastern Europe - would immediately take its place. We know too well what happens when countries in that part of the world, with enormous rural populations and nothing to sell but the produce of their fields, find themselves thrown on their own resources. The European Community remains obsessed, however, with its own esoteric internal problems - ratifying the Maastricht treaty and so on. It is like the householder who concentrates on nothing but his plans for repainting the house while groups of potentially violent beggars are gathering on the front lawn. In the eyes of the France's political leaders, the redecoration has to take a vernacular, traditional form. The traditional France, implied by the vote in the National Assembly and most leader writers, is one of smallholdings and gross inefficiency, a single broken telephone at the poste which is always closed. Nobody would imagine from the rhetoric this week that French prosperity rests on foundations that differ from those of, say, Lower Slobovia. And even when it comes to the five per cent on the farm, it was left to a newspaper in the Pyrenees to get near the truth: 'To speak of the interests of farmers as if they were all the same is a destructive myth. . . the richest five per cent earn 35 times as much the poorest five per cent.' Now here are two very, very difficult questions which the finest minds of the Assembly could not answer on Wednesday: which group benefits from the present system? Which group does the government say will lose from any change? After the vote for a veto, opposed only by those who felt it did not go far enough, Liberation wrote that the Europe of Maastricht was at risk: 'History has overtaken the dream and devoured it, and so it is, all things considered, quite logical that history should now have clad herself in peasant finery. . . A compromise must be found.' Liberation added: 'The least one can say is that unanimity, overweaning demands and recourse to a worn-out lyricism hardly prepares one for it.' But who is prepared to compromise with France? James Morgan is diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

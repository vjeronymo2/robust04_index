			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Failure of bank argument Sir, Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint (November 4) contained an excellent evaluation of the potential problem of deficient demand and he naturally followed this with yet another call for (the sensible) targeting of nominal gross domestic product. However, he failed to show how his throw-away remarks about the need for an independent central bank followed in any way from the previous analysis. In particular, if nominal GDP is to be the target, how is a central bank, which only has control over monetary policy, supposed to achieve its target? Surely a pursuit of a nominal GDP target requires both fiscal and monetary levers? Furthermore, in continuing his metaphor about the 1930s, Samuel Brittan fails to explain what happens when it is the independent central bank which is more worried about communism (read inflation) as in federal Germany today?

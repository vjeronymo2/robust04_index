			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Madrid buoyed by a mood of optimism - After months in the doldrums equities are enjoying a year-end rally The Spanish have ways to make a market talk. Brow beaten for months by government deficit overruns, tax increases, a Moody's debt rating review, two peseta devaluations, rising unemployment and falling growth, the Madrid market has suddenly been energised by a financial community desperate to end the year as little out of pocket as possible. The Madrid general index may still be down 13 per cent on the year, but in the last few weeks it has come bounding back from the low 180s reached during the autumn currency crisis to finish at 215.31 yesterday. Everyone is winning. Bank shares have risen most sharply, with the sectoral index advancing from 230.6 on October 2 to 272 on Monday. Likewise, electricity utilities have recovered by 40 to 213, and chemicals were up 35 points to 218. Even the battered construction sector had managed to creep up 8 to 288. Construction was in trouble long before the equity market. The government owes builders about Dollars 8bn, the release of which it is delaying in order to dress up its 1992 fiscal performance. Madrid is also delaying contract awards, which will affect construction companies' 1993 figures. But the banks, the engine room of the Spanish economy, have bounced back in spite of the fact that they face record bad debts this year and next, as economic growth fades to a trickle. The sector, however, has had some help. The Bank of Spain allowed banks, faced with potentially huge portfolio losses on government debt as the bond market fell in the autumn, to defer the effects and thus save their profit and loss accounts. Last week, the central bank cut its reserve requirement from 4.5 per cent to 3 per cent, which freed some Dollars 6bn of deposits previously trapped, interest free, with the authority. The utilities are back in spite of the fact that many are heavily indebted in foreign currencies and will have been hurt by the peseta's two recent devaluations. This is partly because the government has decided on big electricity tariff increases for domestic users next year and also hopes of an early fall in interest rates. But is there good reason for that optimism? Possibly. Inflation will end the year under 5.5 per cent, well below the feared 6.5 per cent. All indirect tax increases planned for next year have been implemented this year. The central budget deficits, running nearly 70 per cent over target in the summer, are now under control and will end the year on target. Moody's, having shaken Madrid in October by announcing a review of Spain's debt rating, has just decided not to touch it. There are sceptics. 'Quite a lot of people would like the year to end more happily,' says Mr Paul Farrow of brokers FG in Madrid. 'So we find they are suddenly being a lot more positive about things they were recently being negative about despite the fact that nothing has really changed.' FG is not, in spite of the festive mood, changing its growth forecast of 0.5 per cent for next year and is advising clients to sell if the general index reaches 220. And with polls showing that the election Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has to hold by next October will most likely force him into a minority or a coalition government, with quite unknowable consequences, investors are going to tread lightly around Madrid. That is evident even in the current boomlet. The Ibex 35 index, which covers the largest companies in the market, has risen by about 20 per cent since early October, outstripping the 15 per cent recovery in the general index. It means investors may simply be buying back into cheap, traditionally liquid stock such as banks and utilities. Analysts do not think the reserve requirement cut for banks will feed through quickly into profits. In the current climate, it might not feed through at all. 'It may mean the banks have more money to lend,' says another broker. 'But given the bad debt provisions they're already having to make they're probably better off being starved of money if they're going to lend it badly. We'll see. The reserve cut will only make a difference if they lend the new money well.' Given the current cheer in the market, not everyone in Madrid is as wary or exhausted as the last speaker. But Spain always deals with bad news by ignoring it and that has to be worth a few more points on the general index.</p>

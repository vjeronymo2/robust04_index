			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: Ski software offers route to satisfaction - Worth Watching Skiers could soon get a better run for their money if the industry harnesses the latest in software. A university lecturer, David Unwin, and student, Simeon Preston, have developed a geographical information system which means up-to-date ski maps can be produced on a weekly or daily basis. Developed initially for use in Scotland's Cairngorm mountains, the system enables skiers to better plan their downhill routes. Eventually the developers say the GIS could have video capability, with television screens at the bottom of major ski lifts so skiers could take a simulated trip down a slope before deciding whether it really was for them.

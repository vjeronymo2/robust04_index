The </F> President's Eyes and Ears, or How the Missile Attack Early  Warning System Operates Following the Breakup of the USSR"]    [Text] The top-secret missile attack early warning system  [MAEW] was certainly assigned a special role among the strategic  deterrence systems developed in the USSR during the Cold War  years. Why? It provided the president, the country's  military-political leadership, and the command of the branches  of the Armed Forces with the information needed to adopt a  definitive decision regarding the use of nuclear missile forces.  That is, it can be said to have been in the direct sense of the  word the eyes and ears of the country's leadership.    Today the Cold War is behind us. The Soviet Union does not  exist. Many over the horizon [OTH] tracking stations, the basis  of the MAEW, have ended up over the border. Furthermore, the  geopolitical position of Russia itself has changed. How has all  this affected the combat readiness of the system and the lives  and service of the troops?    Here were are on the outskirts of Moscow. The trees are  covered with snow. Before us is an outwardly unremarkable  building, which has so to speak been legendary for many years.  This is an MAEW command post, and no journalist has set foot  inside it in its entire existence.    Inside the light is dim and the duty shift wear soft  footwear. There are telephones to the defense minister and the  chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff on  the duty officer's desk.... Opposite stands a huge panel, the  size of the screen at Moscow's "Rossiya" Movie Theater,  indicating the operational situation, the movement of space  objects, and the status and operation of OTH tracking stations  tracking near-earth space, satellites in near-earth orbit, and  all launches of carrier missiles that come within the zone of  visibility.... Figuratively speaking, the key to our strategic  security is here in this room....    It is here that the alarming inscription suddenly flashes  from time to time (for training purposes): "Stand by. Launch.  Missile Attack." Whereupon it gives the launch site, the  number of missiles, and where they are targeted.... This  information automatically enters the special "Krokus" device  which is then used to activate the "nuclear attache case" held  by the country's president. At the same time it is accompanied  by an audio signal, which was said to have irritated M.  Gorbachev a great deal. This is said to have ended in the  "Krokus" being rapidly removed from his office.    As for the people stationed at the command post day and  night  (the duty officer, the systems analysts, and officers in the  analytical service...), throughout the Cold War they were  destined to be the first to learn of the start of the nuclear  apocalypse. Cynical as it sounds, their job is to anticipate  nuclear war.    Information comes into the multicolored command post panel  today from eight MAEW stations, five of them located abroad: in  Ukraine (Mukachevo and Sevastopol), Azerbaijan (Mingechaur),  Kazakhstan (Balkhash), and Latvia (Skrunda). They are still  providing information, but what guarantee is there that it will  not suddenly stop one fine day?    From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's file.    The development and creation of OTH MAEW and space  surveillance radars began in our country in the sixties at the  USSR Academy of Sciences Radiotechnical Research Institute under  the leadership of Academician A.L. Mints. The first "Dnepr"  stations were deployed in Kazakhstan and Siberia, forming a  tight radar barrier 5,000-km long ensuring the accurate  detection and tracking of space objects. During the seventies  it proved possible to expand the radar field by including  stations in the polar region, Latvia, and Ukraine.    A plan was then developed for total, continuous OTH  coverage in the missile-vulnerable western, southwestern,  southern, and northeastern sectors. At the same time work was  also under way on a fundamentally new phased-array OTH radar  station called "Daryal"....    As we can see, the system was progressively built in  missile-vulnerable areas. Needless to say, at the time no one  thought that the Union would break up and that the radar field  erected would be bisected by the national borders of sovereign  states. Or that they would de facto end up under Russia's  "nuclear umbrella." However, now the question is this: Do the  republics need these services today? And, if so, on what terms?  If not, what is to be done with the stations?    Regrettably these are not idle questions, since there are  still no clear accords in this sphere or clear prospects.  Admittedly there is the Treaty on Collective Security signed by  six CIS states. But "nothing is forever".... Remember the  promises about the unified ruble, economic, and information  area. What has happened to all that? Is it true that the  future of these stations and maybe the future of the MAEW is  today being decided not only in Moscow but also in the CIS  nation states?    ...The Balkhash area, where an MAEW unit is stationed,  greeted us with cold gusts of wind and snow. A strange building  like a gigantic hut rose above the wild semidesert.    "Our new `Daryal' looks strange and, you'll agree,  impressive," Colonel G. Kozlyuk, deputy commander for work with  personnel, broke into my thoughts. "The only thing is that the  construction workers and fitters are unable to hand it over. So  at the moment we are working with a `Dnepr.'"    Vast sums of money at the old prices have been invested in  the station -- around 1 billion rubles. It is a reliable  radar. It has triple-redundant technological apparatus, several  independent power sources, and space, radio, and facsimile  communications.... It provides highly important information  about ballistic missile launches, identifies objects during the  booster phase of their flight path, and can instantly compute  warheads' launch and landing sites as well as their flight  time....    "We provided backup for the `Soyuz-Apollo' flight and all  flights from Baykonur and obtained information on `Ferret,'  `Columbia,' and the shuttle," Colonel N. Buchuk, deputy  commander for arms, said not without pride.    The MAEW has never given a false alarm regarding a missile  attack (unlike its U.S. counterpart). But the "Dnepr's" have  virtually outlived their service life, working continuously  throughout this period.    It became clear that the almost complete new "Daryal"  station  is not at its best.    "Everything is vague now," Deputy Chief Designer Yu. Konkin,  who leads a wretched life here now with an uncertain future,  told me. "So it is not surprising if the equipment gradually  gets neglected...."    Regrettably, signs of this neglect are already striking, to  whit "explosive" old electric cable in the living quarters,  empty shelves in the military trading store, the boarded-up  windows of empty apartments, and the lack of clear guarantees  for the officers that they will be provided with amenities in  Russia.... Major General Yu. Kabakov, army deputy commander for  rear services, involuntarily added to the picture by citing the  following figure: "Compared with former conditions, supplies to  our units in neighboring countries have dropped by around 40  percent, although the tasks have remained the same."    The various restrictions on the movement of freight and  property and the confusion over supplies represent another  barrier. In terms of some categories the unit remains on  Kazakhstan's payroll, whereas as far as others are concerned it  has been transferred to the Ural Military District.  Realistically at the moment the unit doesn't know whether it is  coming or going. And virtually everything -- from uniform  badges to pipes -- has to be brought by air from Moscow. You  can imagine the kind of megabucks this costs, but there is  evidently no choice at the moment.    Needless to say all this cannot fail to affect the people,  their mood, and ultimately their attitude to their work.    It is becoming more and more difficult to get replacements  for these units from Russia, Colonel Ye. Tokarev, head of the  army cadre department, thinks.    Nonetheless at the moment, we would stress, all this is  only indirectly affecting the unit's combat readiness. A  commission from the Center led by Major General V. Pronov, the  formation's chief of staff, came here to work and pointed to the  reliability of the whole complex. It investigated a great deal  and set a great deal to rights, so to speak. The unit received  good marks, but its status remains unchanged. "We have no  future here...," one officer told me bluntly.    Why is that happening in our country? The people who have to  "pull" the strategic installation out of the mire without  receiving proper pay, in many respects through personal  initiative and self-restraint, should be rewarded, but they  "have no future." Why did we make such a mess of the identical  installation in Krasnoyarsk, owing to then Foreign Minister E.A.  Shevardnadze's, so to speak, tractability and under pressure  from the Americans, and why are we now turning it into...a  furniture factory? At a time when the United States has not  just failed to mothball its long-range tracking radar in  Greenland but has even modernized it and has absolutely no  intention of cutting back its other stations.    From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file:    The U.S. BMEWS ballistic missile early warning system  is established and operating. It comprises three posts on  Fylingdales Moor (Britain), in Thule (Greenland), and in Clear  (Alaska), which have been modernized in recent years to enable  the system to detect missiles at long range. This system uses a  multifunctional Precision Approach Radar station comprising a  "Safeguard" ABM defense system. During the eighties more  powerful assemblies of the Pave Paws OTH stations were deployed  on U.S. eastern and western seaboards and southern borders. The  NORAD command post in Colorado Springs exercises operational  control of the entire nuclear missile early warning system.    There is also a first-echelon tracking missile launches  and engaged in nuclear burst fix acquisition -- five "IMEWS-2"  artificial earth satellites in orbit at distances of  30,000-40,000 km. This system still monitors the entire surface  of our planet, including Russia and the CIS. And in spring 1993  during the Western European Union's military and scientific  conference the question was raised of creating a European ABM  defense system (EUROWISAT) combined with similar U.S. systems.  Its deployment is scheduled for the year 2005.    So the breakup of the Union cannot so far be said to have  had  any effect on the MAEW. But there are problems, as we can see.  Above all, the question of the status of MAEW units abroad needs  to be resolved most speedily. Regrettably, everything is not as  easy as we would like. Kazakhstan, for instance, has a bone to  pick with the Russian military over use of its airspace,  fulfillment of customs regulations, etc. But that is not the  main thing. Major General A. Kasymov, chief of the Main Staff  of the Kazakhstan Armed Forces, gave his view of the problem as  follows: "The question of the future of the MAEW unit is in my  view linked to the question of Kazakhstan's accession to the  1972 ABM Treaty. We know the Russian Federation's stance:  People say that Kazakhstan cannot be a party to the treaty  because it does not have the status of a nuclear state.... But  this treaty must be reviewed today to take account of the  opinions of states with elements of the strategic nuclear forces  stationed on their territory It is therefore necessary to lay  down new conditions for the creation of the `nuclear club,'  either on a multilateral basis or on a bilateral basis with  Russia. And to record these in a corresponding protocol like  the Lisbon Protocol...."    S. Tyurin, Russian consul in Kazakhstan, is inclined to  think  that Russia should be quicker in making up its mind about the  status of the MAEW military unit in Kazakhstan: "I am not a  military man, but I believe that this unit is a very important  installation, spearheading scientific and technical progress.  And failure to pay attention to it will cause us a setback just  like the earlier setback with Baykonur in terms of the space  program. At the moment -- this is a fact -- the military are  surviving here as best they can. You cannot describe them as  occupiers, since their main weapon is radar equipment...."    Everyday material and technical difficulties are a minor  misfortune. It is their uncertain status that is causing  discord among the officers and the personnel. The republic has  after all adopted a law laying downm that anyone who does not  apply for other citizenship by 1 March automatically becomes a  citizen of Kazakhstan.... So you can understand their position.  And, moreover, that of their wives and school-age children, who  are not particularly enthusiastic about the need for mandatory  study of the Kazakh language in local schools or about obtaining  secondary education certificates here. Not to mention the fact  that there are Kazakhstani security and prosecutor's office  organs at the garrison.... Colonel General (Retired) Yu.  Votintsev, one of the people who developed the MAEW system,  believes that a sorry fate lies in store for these installations  if the problems are not resolved. "The outdated `Dnepr'  stations will be able to operate for another two or three years,  six years at most, and then the whole Commonwealth will be left  without some of the most accurate means of detecting attacking  missiles." However, owing to the dismantling of the Krasnoyarsk  radar a gap has already formed in our OTH tracking systems in  the northeast of the country. Therefore logic itself suggests  that it is necessary to at least preserve what is left.    "The point is that the highly effective system only works  when it receives information from all OTH tracking stations. It  would therefore evidently be right for the MAEW to be not a  national but a supranational system," Lieutenant General S.  Sokolov, MAEW army commander, said. "And, naturally, it would  have other CIS countries taking a shared financial part in  running it."    The Main Staff of the Air Defense Troops takes a similar  view.    "Whether we need this installation or not is not under  discussion," Colonel General V. Smirnov, commander of the  missile-space defense troops, said. "But, in order to resolve  the problems arising there, an agreement is first needed on  Russian-Kazakhstani military cooperation -- an agreement which  is not yet in place."    Well, this would evidently be the optimum solution to the  very difficult situation that has developed since the breakup of  the USSR as far as preserving the MAEW installations is  concerned. It is after all easy to destroy things -- something  that we have repeatedly seen over the last few years -- but it  is hard to create them. The MAEW embodied the best achievements  of many generations' intellectual potential. And, however  stable the world may be today, it was, is, and remains a crucial  deterrent against the unleashing of a nuclear missile war.    A final point. A session of the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry Collegium was held recently. It analyzed the results  of the Russian Federation's military cooperation with  neighboring states and identified tasks for 1994. It was  stressed that, as a result of joint work on the part of the  Russian Federation Defense and Foreign Ministries, a  normative-legal base has by and large been created for  military-political and military-technical cooperation with the  republics of the former USSR. It was pointed out at the same  time that, in view of Russia's strategic interests in this  sphere, there are still plenty of unresolved questions.    It only remains to hope that the necessary decisions on  strategic arms will not be shelved. After all, the fate of the  military and their relatives and friends depends on them. And  ultimately the reliability of Russia's defense itself.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] Eight national political parties and their  presidential candidates have pledged to join efforts for peace,  democracy, and justice. The document was signed before the  Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] General Council, where it was  also announced that there could be changes in the Electoral Law  in advance of the 21 August elections.    The first meeting was chaired by Government Secretary Jorge  Carpizo, who serves as IFE president. He disclosed a commitment  made by the political parties and their presidential candidates.  The commitment is for peace, democracy, and justice, and it is  designed to put an end to violence and to further the democratic  process by way of the law. For this they agreed:    [Begin Carpizo recording] To adopt decisions that will lead  to create conditions of trust and stability in all of the  institutions that will participate in the elections. [end  recording]    In addition, the political parties agreed to foster and  maintain the social and political conditions that will guarantee  a climate of trust for productive investment and economic growth  within a framework of stability and respect for everyone's  rights.    To conclude, the government secretary insisted that this  year's challenge is to hold honest and open elections within a  legal framework.    [Begin Carpizo recording] We must act responsibly, and we  must all take up truth as our motto and our aspiration. Let us  struggle for our causes, but within a legal framework. We have  a point of reference in the law. When it becomes necessary to  apply or to modify the law, it should be within the commitments  made and within the correct institution, and this is precisely  the goal of the IFE General Council. [end recording]    The IFE General Council fixed at 134.460 million new pesos  the ceiling for campaign expenses that each party can spend in  this year's presidential election. This amount is more than  five times less than an original estimate of 722 million new  pesos. In December this amount had already been reduced to  336,151 million new pesos. The ceiling of political campaigns  was reduced by 82 percent, taking into account the 722 million  pesos originally proposed. This is the result of a complex  mathematical operation. It is based on the unit value of six  pesos and 39 cents per deputy seat assigned by relative  majority, to which is added the inflation rate; then it is  multiplied by the number of voters registered, and it is also  multiplied by a value fittingly assigned for the duration of the  political campaign.</p>

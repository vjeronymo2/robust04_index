			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- The time is not yet ripe for  Japan and the United States to resume ministerial talks in the  deadlocked trade "framework" negotiations, a senior Trade  Ministry official said Thursday [12 May].    Both parties should first lay the groundwork for the  resumption of the framework talks through subcabinet-level  negotiations, said the official at the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry, who declined to be identified.    As one option, the official cited the possibility of sending  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international affairs,  to Washington.    But dispatch of cabinet ministers like the foreign minister  would not be timely, the MITI official said, noting that sending  such high-ranking officials with no specific proposals would  further undermine the already-soured trade ties with Washington.</p>

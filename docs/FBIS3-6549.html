Police explosive experts defused the device without incident.    National police chief Prathin Santiprapop said Thursday  night  on television that the bomb "clearly was the work of foreigners  and was targetted at foreigners in Thailand." He said the body,  which was found in the same large, rectangular metal tank as the  explosive device, was that of the original driver of the truck.  The dead man was a foreigner and at first was thought to have  fled the scene following the accident, Pratin said. He did not  give further information on the victim's identity.    Another police officer, who was not identified, said on  television that the bomb was "the most powerful explosive device  ever found in Thailand," and was similar in composition to bombs  frequently used in Northern Ireland. The device included a large  amount of ammonium nitrate, a quantity of flammable liquid and a  car battery.    The six-wheel truck, which had been rented with a driver  March 9, was involved in a minor accident with a motorcycle two  days later in the vicinity of the Israeli, British and US  embassies, police said earlier. A foreigner who spoke almost no  Thai was driving at the time, police said.    When the owner appeared at the police pound Thursday to  claim  his vehicle, a police search turned up the metal container with  the body and the home-made explosive device.</p>

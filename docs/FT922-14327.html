			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: PR taxes attention in electoral reform debate TWO results of the election can be forecast with confidence: the Liberal Democrats will get about 20 per cent or more of the popular vote and Liberal Democrat MPs are unlikely to occupy many more than 5 per cent of seats in the House of Commons. In most elections, the Liberal Democrats and their predecessors have been able to do little about such under-representation except to cry 'unfair'. But this time there appears to be a strong chance of a hung parliament in which neither the Conservatives nor Labour would be able to form a majority. If that is so, Mr Paddy Ashdown says the Liberal Democrats are likely to make reform of the UK's first-past-the-post election system - which produces this disproportionate result - a condition of support for a minority government. He points to the fact that the UK is now one of the few European countries which does not use proportional representation (PR) to elect its parliament. If Labour is the largest party, Mr Kinnock will use the Plant commission, Labour's inquiry on electoral reform, to woo the Liberal Democrats. Chaired by Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University, this has spent 18 months examining the pros and cons of different electoral systems. Mr Kinnock has promised to give the commission official status and to broaden its composition to include representatives of other parties. The new Scottish parliament is to be elected by PR and the Plant commission has proposed the additional member system used in Germany. It is thought likely to recommend PR for elections to the European parliament, where the UK's adherence to first-past-the-post has distorted the overall party balance at Strasbourg. Even if Labour agreed to a switch to PR for the Commons, there could still be disagreement over the timetable for introducing the change: Mr Ashdown has said that he wants this to be the last general election under first-past-the-post; Mr Kinnock wants to submit the change to the electorate at the next election. And there could also be disagreement over the system to adopt. The Liberal Democrats favour the single transferable vote, under which most voters would cast their votes in multi-member constituencies. This allows them to choose between the candidates put up by the parties and even to elect MPs from more than one party. Labour is likely to prefer one of the two systems which retains a strong one-to-one constituency link in line with British traditions. That means the additional member system or the alternative vote - which the 1929 Labour government planned to introduce before losing power. If the largest party is the Conservatives, Mr Ashdown is unlikely to receive a positive response to his demands for PR. Mr John Major is implacably opposed to electoral reform: yesterday he underlined his determination that the Tories will 'in no circumstances' enter into negotiations with the Liberal Democrats on PR. He opposes PR because he believes it would detract from strong government: if the UK had used PR it is likely that every election for the last 30 years would have produced a coalition government. His belief is that such governments find it hard to agree difficult decisions so that, for example, it would have been harder to mount the Falklands campaign or to send the British contingent to the Gulf war. Underlining his opposition to PR the prime minister also said yesterday that he 'would not fancy' changing the system for local elections or for choosing Euro MPs. Mr Major quotes unnamed leaders of other European countries that have PR who would like to get rid of it. The only country which has tried to move from PR to first-past-the-post is Ireland - on both occasions the move was defeated in a referendum. Certainly there are politicians in Italy - particularly Christian Democrats - who blame their system of PR for the paralysis and corruption which dogs Italian politics. In Israel, there is growing discontent with their list system which allows religious and extremist parties with only 1 per cent or 2 per cent of the vote to dictate policies in return for sustaining a coalition. However, according to Simon Osborn of the Electoral Reform Society, all the new democracies of eastern Europe have chosen some form of PR for their parliamentary elections. 'They all visited London, and were very impressed with our parliamentary system but they all rejected our electoral system, having lived under the dictatorship of minority governments for decades.' Whether the UK will continue to allow a party with as little as 42 per cent of the vote to govern with a 100-seat majority remains to be seen. But the arguments over electoral systems will undoubtedly continue.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ELECTORIAL SYSTEM - THE OPTIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST-PAST-THE-POST: the candidate with the highest number of votes in a       constituency is elected. LIST SYSTEM: Voters vote for party lists of candidates in mulit-member       constituencies. Seats are divided between the parites in       proportion to the votes gained in the constituency and allocated       to candidates from the top of the list. ADDIDIONAL NUMBER SYSTEM: At least half the seats are elected on a       first-past-the-post basis. The rest are allocated to parties on       some sort of list basis, so that the number of MPs reflects the       distribution of the popular vote. SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE: Voters number candidates in order of       preference in multi-member constituencies. Complex formula elects       candidates with more than a set quota of votes. Second and       subsequent preferences are redistributed until enough candidates       reach the quota. ALTERNATIVE VOTE: Voters number candidates in order of preference. If no       candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the votes, the second       choices of the candidate with the fewest votes are reallocated       until someone wins a majority of the votes.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

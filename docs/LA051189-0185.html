			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK SCRAPS PLAN TO PAY FOR STATUE  </P> <P> Responding to opponents who had gathered more than 500 signatures on petitions,  the City Council on Monday unanimously rescinded its decision to spend $50,000  on a statue honoring George Washington and the U.S. Constitution and agreed to  a compromise instead.  </P> <P> The council, at the suggestion of Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, voted to  create a committee to seek private funding for a statue celebrating the  nation's founding and to find a suitable location for it. Mayor Barry L. Hatch  will oversee the committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Embarrassed, Appalled'  </P> <P> The council originally approved the statue expenditure on a 3-2 vote in March.  But some critics questioned using city funds, and others questioned the need  for the statue at all.  </P> <P> But Hatch, who since he took office in 1986 has wanted a statue to commemorate  America's founding, said he was "totally embarrassed, appalled" by the attitude  of the critics. "Those great men (who founded the United States), we couldn't  even cast a shadow upon their feet," he said.  </P> <P> "I think (Hatch) has a misplaced sense of what patriotism is," resident  Marjorie Kemmerer said in an interview. "He is overly fixated that we're not  patriotic enough."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Olympic Statue  </P> <P> Hatch had also been criticized for his desire to remove a City Hall statue  dedicated to the 1984 Olympic Games and replace it with the monument to  Washington.  </P> <P> Houseman and Patricia M. Reichenberger, the two council members who had  supported Hatch's proposal for a Washington monument, did not agree with his  proposal to move the Olympic statue across town to Garvey Ranch Park.  </P> <P> Houseman's compromise resolution acknowledged the importance of the Olympic  statue.  </P> <P> "We treasure the fact that the (Olympic) torch was carried through our city,  and the monument which commemorates that will remain intact," Houseman said.  </P> <P> The 15-foot-high sculpture depicts the Olympic torch and five interlocking  rings. It marks a spot near where a torch-bearing runner passed en route to the  Los Angeles Coliseum. Monterey Park, which has since dubbed itself "an Olympic  City with a Heart," was the site of the Olympic field hockey competition.  </P> <P> Judy Chu and Betty Couch, the two council members who originally opposed the  Washington statue, indicated that they will go along with the compromise  because city funds will not be used. Chu and Couch had said a city struggling  to balance its books could not afford to spend money on the statue.  </P> <P> On Monday, statue opponent Kemmerer told the council that the city has "so many  unmet needs" that it can ill afford to spend the $50,000. It would be better,  she said, to spend the money to help the handicapped or homeless, provide  better child care, hire more police or restore cuts to the budgets of the  library and the Parks and Recreation Department.  </P> <P> Complaining about the critics, Hatch said Monday: "How much are we spending on  new immigrants?" He said he had simply proposed "spending a little" to remember  the nation's founders, who created "this great nation for all the immigrants  around the world to enter."  </P> <P> But Hatch said creating a statue committee is an excellent idea because "it  certainly would diffuse any concerns that residents have voiced."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Craig Quintana contributed to this story.  </P></p>

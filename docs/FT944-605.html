			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Time for a voyage of rediscovery - The permanent collections of the major galleries are full of forgotten treasures. William Packer catalogues their delights We are often inclined to take the constantly available treats of permanent art collections for granted, leaving them to the tourist or the provincial. We promise ourselves there will always be Easter or Christmas at which to take them in. Not that we can accuse gallery directors of accepting our indifference. Nicholas Serota's policy at the Tate of a complete rehang every year has refocused attention on the permanent collections. The 1995 displays are due to be unveiled at the end of next month, but, by the nature of the exercise, much is already in place, so this a good moment for an early scout around. At the National Gallery, Neil MacGregor's thorough reordering of the collections, which the opening of the Sainsbury Wing made necessary, is just about complete. As to his success, that is a matter to which I hope soon to return. Even so, the temporary study exhibition drawn from the collections is a special case. These are dressed up with full and scholarly catalogues, or augmented by spectacular loans. The point is usually well made that here indeed is something special. At the Tate, on the other hand, even though the shows are no less remarkable, the feeling is too often of something modest and incidental tucked away in the farthest basement, over-shadowed by more important special exhibitions and permanent displays upstairs. Such self-effacement is, in part, the creature of the sheer richness of the material available combined with the constraints imposed by limited funds. We should, I suppose, be grateful for what we get. The show that currently fills the Tate's lower galleries, of British watercolours, prints and drawings from the mid-18th to the mid-19th century, is remarkable for its quality and scope. Three rooms present, in turn, three aspects of work in those media in which we British have long notoriously prided ourselves. Furthermore, they are from the period in which the British facility for such work supposedly achieved its fullest expression. The room of landscape studies is an exhibition in itself, taking us from Gainsborough to Ruskin through a variety of familiar names yet in unfamiliar if characteristic images. All those we would expect are there - Wilson, Cozens, Sandby, Cotman, Girtin, Constable, Cox, Bonington, de Wint, Lewis, Lear and others beside, while Turner fills the corridor outside. The works are by turns beautiful and surprising, funny and dramatic, from Rowlandson's ripe wenches spying in a wood to Ruskin's freely-stated distant view of Bologna through the trees. To pick out favourite things would be to catalogue the lot - Callow's cliff-like palazzi along the Grand Canal, Cox's no less cliff-like tenements along the Seine, Turner's House of Commons on fire, Muller's stair cut into the rock, Varley's nod to Poussin in his 'Suburbs of an Ancient City', and on and on. But how fresh these things are, and how direct. We sit at the artist's shoulder as he works, as if it were but yesterday. The room of prints takes us from engravings after Stubbs, Constable and Turner to the etchings of Whistler and Keene, but is chiefly remarkable for the series of abstracted rocks and mountain-scapes of Alexander Cozens. He derived these from blots, his 'new method of assisting the invention in drawing original compositions of landscape'. The third room holds figure and composition studies, often very full in their realisation, from Wilkie and Lawrence to Burne-Jones and Millais, with Max Beerbohm's later satires upon life with The Brotherhood thrown in for good measure. Wilkie's drawing for 'The First Ear-ring' is especially charming, and indeed the drawings from life throughout are very fine, from Lawrence's old lady and John Jackson's portrait study of Wilkie, to the seated girls of Rossetti, Wallis and Burne-Jones, and Arthur Hughes's brief first note of his model for 'April Love'. But in truth the room is dominated by the romantic medievalism of the pre-Raphaelite imagination, with Rossetti the central figure and Burne-Jones hardly less prominent. It is all highly enjoyable, dark, intense and romantic with its knights in armour and swooning ladies, sweet-briar and honeysuckle, Mariana at the Moated Grange and Fair Rosamund moving anxiously away from Queen Eleanor. It is even gently comical - Ford Madox Brown's 'King Rene on his honeymoon' sits glumly in the garden as his wife kisses him sweetly on the cheek. Two lovely landscapes by Boyce and Seddon, and an oddly modern drawing of a scrubby field by Wallis, should really be in the first room. From Gainsborough to the Pre-Raphaelites: works on paper - the Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until February 12.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Tsutomu Hata was  elected prime minister Monday [25 April] by Japan's bicameral  Diet, as Japan faces such crucial issues as a trade row with the  United States, tax reform and the suspected North Korean  development of nuclear weapons.    Hata, 58, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core  party in the coalition, became Japan's 51st premier and the  sixth prime minister in five years, succeeding Morihiro  Hosokawa, 56. [passage omitted]    Later in a meeting with Shinseito legislators, Hata appealed  for greater allegiance, saying "Japan is facing difficult times  domestically and internationally." He was apparently referring  to the recession, trade tensions with the United States and the  North Korean nuclear issue. "If Japan made a wrong policy  choice, it would plunge into an abyss and historians (of the  future) will look back and say there used to be a country named  Japan," Hata warned.    He hinted, however, that he would not lead Japan to take a  high profile role in U.N. peacekeeping efforts, saying, "I am  not asserting that the Japanese should go abroad carrying  bazookas on their shoulders."    LDP president Kono called on Hata to step up efforts for  political reform to restore the credibility of Japanese politics.    "I want to see him work toward dispelling the people's  distrust in politics," Kono told reporters. "I heard the ruling  coalition say repeatedly that it should follow through on  promised political reform in order to restore the credibility of  politics," Kono said.    Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP urged the  governing coalition to live up to its vow to implement policies  earlier agreed upon as a policy platform. "I want the Hata  administration to carry out policies which were worked out by  Shinseito," said Watanabe, who threatened in mid-April to leave  the party in a bid to seek the premiership, hoping for backing  from some of the ruling coalition. The leader of the LDP's  third-largest faction said, "we will extend our support for (the  Hata administration's) policies that could help our country,  while withholding support for any policies that could not."</p>

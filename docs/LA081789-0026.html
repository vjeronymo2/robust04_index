			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INDUSTRY REPORT ADDS TO DISPUTE OVER USE OF ACID  </P> <P> A chemical industry-sponsored report says the impact of a large release of  acutely hazardous hydrofluoric acid can be limited by tall walls that would hem  in the resulting gas cloud and by fine droplet water sprays that would dilute  it.  </P> <P> The report is intended to aid the design of improved safety systems at  facilities using the acid throughout the nation. It was written by K. W. Schatz  of the Mobil Research and Development Corp. and Ronald P. Koopman of the  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and describes the results of  laboratory experiments, wind tunnel tests in the Nevada desert and computer  simulations.  </P> <P> Federal officials have said an uncontrolled release of the chemical, which is  used in large quantities at three plants in the South Bay, could be as deadly  as the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District is considering banning or  restricting the use of hydrofluoric acid, and industry officials are expected  to use the report to fight any proposed ban.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inadequate Spray Systems  </P> <P> In May, a senior environmental engineer for an AQMD task force studying  hydrofluoric acid warned that three of the major Los Angeles County users --  including an Allied Signal Corp. plant in El Segundo -- lack adequate water  spray systems to contain a major release.  </P> <P> In Torrance, approval of a March, 1990, ballot measure would force Mobil Oil  Corp. to switch to less deadly sulfuric acid, and a city lawsuit against Mobil  cites the refinery's use of the substance as justification for needing more  control over the facility. Mobil generally stores more than 29,000 gallons of  the acid at the refinery.  </P> <P> Mobil hailed the report's conclusions as corroborating its position that  hydrofluoric acid can be used safely.  </P> <P> "Great! Great!" said Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti, when he was told of the  report's main findings. The refinery is planning to increase its water spray  system.  </P> <P> But Ralph Nutter, the attorney for Torrance in its lawsuit, noted that Mobil  was one of the sponsors of the industry group that produced the report and  added that the tests "appear to be absolutely inconclusive."  </P> <P> "As far as I am concerned," he said, "they aren't any safer. It doesn't tell us  a damn thing."  </P> <P> The Times obtained a copy of the report Wednesday from the Torrance Fire  Department.  </P> <P> The largest users of hydrofluoric acid in the county are Mobil, the Ultramar  Refining plant in Wilmington, Golden West Refining Co. and the Powerine Oil Co.  refinery in Santa Fe Springs and the Allied Signal plant in El Segundo.  </P> <P> About half the nation's oil refineries use hydrofluoric acid as one of two  possible catalysts that boosts the octane of unleaded gasoline; the other is  sulfuric acid. Allied Signal uses the acid to manufacture refrigerants.  </P> <P> David Schwien, a member of the air quality agency's task force studying  hydrofluoric acid, said the three facilities that lack adequate water sprays to  fight a major release are the Powerine, Golden West and Allied Signal plants.  Schwien said Wednesday that he had not seen the report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Texas and Torrance Accidents  </P> <P> The AQMD task force was created in January, 1988. Concern about a release of  the acid was triggered by the largest accident involving hydrofluoric acid, a  35,000-gallon release from the Marathon refinery in Texas City, Tex., on Oct.  30, 1987, and by a thunderous explosion and two-day fire at Mobil's Torrance  refinery on Nov. 24 and 25, 1987, during which 100 pounds of the substance were  released.  </P> <P> Appearing at the AQMD board meeting that created the hydrofluoric acid task  force, environmentalists cited the Texas City release, which injured 650  people, forced the evacuation of 3,000 residents and defoliated trees for  miles, as having had the potential to be as catastrophic as the Bhopal methyl  isocyanate gas release in which 3,000 were killed and 200,000 injured in 1984.  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency recently joined in the conclusion, listing  the Texas City release among disasters that had the potential to have been as  bad as Bhopal.  </P> <P> The environmentalists also pointed to industry-sponsored tests conducted in the  Nevada desert in 1986 that showed that a two-minute, 1,000-gallon spill of  hydrofluoric acid could form a dense, ground-hugging cloud of gas and small  droplets that could be lethal up to five miles downwind. They noted that  hundreds of thousands of people live within five miles of the facilities using  the acid in the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wind Tunnel Experiments  </P> <P> In 1988, a group of hydrofluoric acid users and manufacturers followed the  earlier tests with wind tunnel experiments in Nevada on water sprays, as well  as computer simulations of releases blown against vapor barriers, such as  walls.  </P> <P> The report is a summary of the findings.  </P> <P> Confirming preliminary results released last year, it said that drenching a  hydrofluoric acid release with large amounts of fine water sprays could turn  much of an escaping gas cloud into less dangerous puddles of diluted  hydrofluoric acid. A ratio of 40 times as much water as acid could cut the  escaping gas to a 10th of its original concentration, the report said.  </P> <P> The report added that experiments showed that: Water sprays facing upwards are  more effective than downward sprays; smaller droplets are better than larger  droplets, and sprays closer to the release are more helpful than sprays farther  away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fire-Hose Sprays  </P> <P> Because water sprays might be dislodged by an explosion, the experimenters also  studied fire-hose sprays, which have much larger droplets but can be moved into  position after a blast.  </P> <P> The study found that such sprays provide some protection but are not as  effective as the fine droplet sprays in general.  </P> <P> "The main conclusion from the program is that water sprays and (fire nozzles),  properly designed and applied, can be used in mitigating an HF aerosol leak  with high efficiency," the report said.  </P> <P> In a section on vapor barriers, it said that a four-sided enclosure with an  open top -- known as a "vapor box" -- could also reduce concentrations of acid  gas and delay the arrival of a gas cloud at a downwind spot by 50 seconds to  eight minutes and 20 seconds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vapor Box Effectiveness  </P> <P> Just outside the enclosure, the concentrations could be one fourth to one 15th  as strong as they would be without any enclosure. Farther away, vapor barriers  would have much less effect on gas concentrations, according to the report.  </P> <P> The report noted that the drawback to vapor boxes is that concentrations inside  the vapor box would be higher.  </P> <P> The best water spray system currently operating at a major hydrofluoric acid  user in the county is the 9,000-gallons-a-minute deluge system at the Ultramar  refinery, which could reduce concentrations of a leak of 225 gallons a minute  by 90%.  </P> <P> Using the same 90% standard, the Mobil refinery water spray system could  similarly reduce a hydrofluoric acid leak of 78 gallons a minute. The water  system at Allied Signal's plant could mitigate a leak of 21 gallons a minute,  and the one at the Golden West refinery could dilute by 90% a leak of eight  gallons a minute. The Powerine refinery, which also uses hydrofluoric acid, has  no spray system.  </P></p>

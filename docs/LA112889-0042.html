			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAVE MURPHY RESIGNS AS SIMI GRID COACH AFTER SIX SEASONS  </P> <P> Dave Murphy has resigned as football coach at Simi Valley High, six years after  accepting the position and four years after the school's only Marmonte League  grid championship.  </P> <P> In six seasons, Murphy became the second winningest football coach in Simi  Valley history, despite a 1-19 record over the past two. He compiled a career  21-40-1 mark.  </P> <P> Murphy on Saturday tendered a two-page letter of resignation to Simi Valley  Principal Dave Ellis, who set no timetable in finding a replacement.  </P> <P> Among the reasons for resigning, Murphy mentioned the problems a three-year  high school like Simi Valley has in competing against four-year schools in the  Marmonte League. He also said that football has maintained a lower priority  than other sports on the Simi Valley campus.  </P> <P> Murphy will retain his duties as coach of the girls' basketball team.  </P> <P> "There comes a time when you have to leave gracefully," Murphy said. "I've seen  very little progress in certain areas. It wasn't anybody's fault, but it's not  getting done.  </P> <P> "I'm happy. I know what I'm doing is right."  </P> <P> Ellis said he accepted the resignation with mixed feelings.  </P> <P> "I don't blame Dave for the decision he made," he said. "He has been a class  guy always."  </P></p>

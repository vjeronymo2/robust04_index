			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Bahamas accounts overdrawn THE Bahamas government is withholding release of Dollars 33m in cheques it has written because its domestic bank accounts are overdrawn. Mr Hubert Ingraham, the prime minister, said it was 'unacceptable for the public treasury of a sovereign state to be in a scandalous position whereby Dollars 33m in cheques are written to pay government bills, but cannot be released because there is no money in the government's overdrawn bank accounts for the cheques to be honoured.' Mr Ingraham, who took office in late August, said tax collection methods would be improved, especially of customs duties which account for more than half the government's revenue. However, the administration would not change the tax regime, in which incomes are not taxed. He blamed the previous administration of Sir Lynden Pindling, saying the budget deficit grew from Dollars 35m in 1990 to Dollars 82m last year. Mr Ingraham said the policy of a balanced current budget had been abandoned under the previous government.</p>

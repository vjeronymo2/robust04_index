			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Regulators disagree on state of financial services THE TREASURY may be called on to settle a dispute between regulators following the publication yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading of two reports which fiercely criticise the regulation of retail investments. The OFT asked two consumer affairs consultants, Jeremy Mitchell and Helena Wiesner, to prerpare separate reports. Both found that there were 'market failures' in financial services, resulting from public ignorance and the commissions paid to intermediaries. One report said: 'A commission-based remuneration system poses substantial conflicts of interest for intermediaries and can have a deleterious effect on the type of product a consumer is advised to buy, and for independent financial advisers, also on the company from which that product is bought.' It also criticised the scope of retail regulation, and the fact that building societies, unlike insurance and other investment products, are not regulated under the Financial Services Act. If the OFT accepts the reports' conclusions, Sir Gordon Borrie, the director-general of fair trading, would be brought into direct conflict with the Securities and Investments Board, which regulates most of the financial services industry. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would then be called on to make a final decision. However, the OFT stressed the reports were aimed at 'stimulating discussion' and did not commit the office to the recommendations. It said the reports had revealed much useful information. The SIB announced last month it would not force independent financial advisers to reveal the commissions they received from investment companies in cash terms at point of sale. It also allowed life companies to quote illustrations for potential buyers on the assumption that their costs were in line with the industry average - even if their expenses were much higher. Both decisions are attacked in the OFT's reports, which said: 'Clear information about costs and other features of the product or service are essential. This is patently not the case as far as the provision of independent advice is concerned.' When Sir David Walker, out-going chairman of the SIB, announced the results of his review, he admitted he disagreed with Sir Gordon on commission disclosure. He added: 'Ultimately, if he persists in his view, and I persist in mine, then we will have to leave ministers to decide.' The OFT will be unable to act until the SIB's proposed rules have been fully drafted, which will probably not be until the end of next month. At that point, the director-general could advise Mr Lamont to change the proposals. Sins of commission, Page 7</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Loral ties up Dollars 182m sale to Europe group LORAL, the US defence electronics group, yesterday completed the Dollars 182m sale of 49 per cent of its satellite business to three European partners. This concludes an agreement made in October with Alenia, the Italian state-owned aerospace group, plus Aerospatiale and Alcatel Espace, the French public and private sector aerospace companies. Space Systems/Loral makes communications and weather satellites, with 2,000 employees and sales of Dollars 350m last year. The four partners' combined forces represents one of the world's biggest civil communications and weather satellites groupings, with 7,800 employees and Dollars 1.5bn of joint turnover. The US satellite business, formerly part of the space systems division of the Ford Motor Company, was won by Loral in an auction last summer, against unsuccessful bids from rival teams including Aerospatiale and Alcatel. The completion comes days after the acquisition by Alenia and Aerospatiale of Boeing's De Havilland subsidiary in Canada, and underlines the growing ambitions of the two continental European aerospace manufacturers to break into the US and the specialised satellite markets. According to Alenia, the deal will help the three European companies provide turn-key communications packages, offering clients satellites, control units, earth stations and related services. The three European companies have worked together with the US group now owned by Loral for some time on commercial communications satellites, notably the Intelsat V series and three Arabsat models. They are currently involved in the joint development of the next generation of Intelsat VII satellites due to enter operation next year. Independently, Alenia, which was formed from the merger of the state-owned Aeritalia and Selenia aerospace and defence groups late last year, has sealed a number of international collaboration agreements in recent weeks as part of its own foreign expansion drive.</p>

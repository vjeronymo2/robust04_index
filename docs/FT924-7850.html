			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (3): Sales remain sluggish - Retail Sector / Last year saw the completion of some 25 town-centre developments. But as new shopping centres continue to open they add yet more space to a market which is probably already oversupplied RETAIL sales remain sluggish and show no signs of returning to the heady levels of the mid- to late 1980s. Meanwhile shopping centres, conceived with such enthusiasm in those days, continue to open - adding yet more space to an arguably already oversupplied market. Last year saw the completion of some 25 new town centre developments with a total net floorspace of some 4.62m sq ft, according to surveyor Healey &amp; Baker. And surveyor Hillier Parker reckons that this year 23 town-centre shopping projects will be completed adding a further 4.3m sq ft. Another 25 centres with 3.3m sq ft are scheduled for completion next year and just 16 with 2.5m sq ft in 1994. The total of planned future space is, however, drifting downwards as more developments are either deferred or scrapped altogether. The shopping centre letting market, says Mr John Faulkner of Healey &amp; Baker, is now largely driven by cash from landlords. Retailers are demanding capital sums and-or contributions towards fitting out, rent-free periods and-or stepped rental agreements before they will agree to take space. In addition, tenants are understandably nervous of possible continuing liabilities under privity of contract and are looking for shorter leases - of 10 or 15 years. And more and more landlords are having to accept turnover-related rents. But it is not all bad news. Mr Faulkner points out that several retailers have seized the opportunities provided by all these incentives to build up small chains. And, although some have gone bust - leaving landlords not only with empty space on their hands, but also minus large amounts of hard cash - others who have made use of the same advantages look as if they are expanding solid and innovative new businesses. Retail rents are down - and there seems to be a consensus that we shall not begin to see any improvement until 1994 at the earliest. Despite this general impression of gloom, shop agents are quick to make the point that there are still locations where there is unsatisfied demand from retailers and shortage of supply. There are also towns which need either new shopping centres or the big refurbishment of out-dated space in order to provide the type of environment attractive to shoppers - and to remain competitive with neighbouring locations. Surveyor Jones Lang Wootton undertakes location-specific research aimed at identifying locations which are likely to buck the general trend and prove the best bets for investment and development. Factors considered in Jones Lang Wootton's model include employment and population growth, retail spending power, current and likely provision of shopping space and current rental levels. The firm's Mr John Milligan says that despite appearances to the contrary there was actually less shopping space built in the 1980s than in the decade previous to that. And, he adds, a lot of that 1970s space is now looking very tired and in need of a revamp. In addition there are, says Mr Milligan, towns which were bypassed by the rental explosion of the 1980s which took place as the so-called 'space bandit' multiple retailers scrambled to take prime pitch shops in as many high streets as possible pushing rents sky-high in the process. Investors are certainly prepared to take another look at the retail property sector. This despite little prospect of rental growth in the near future. Mr Andrew Waters of surveyor Richard Ellis says that there have been several sales of high street shops in the favoured cathedral cities - Bath, York, Salisbury and so on - at around 5 per cent initial yields. He cites the recent sale of a shop in Silver Street, Durham, at a little over 5 per cent as an example. Such purchases at first sight appear to defy logic unless buyers are taking a long-term view. On the other hand, shop units in these popular locations are almost always in demand and at an average lot size of about Pounds 3m, highly tradeable - perhaps one of the very few categories of property which could be considered quasi liquid. Another sector towards which investment sentiment has improved substantially is retail warehousing. Only some two years ago in the wake of the Lowndes Queensway collapse, yields had moved out to 11 per cent. Now yields have fallen to 8.75-9 per cent for the best product. The sector is also unusual in that it is showing rental growth - and there is a feeling that there could be more growth to come through. In addition there is strong demand from a whole new range of out-of-town retailers. Led by the privatised electricity companies these include many types of retailers; from those selling toys to those selling pet food. There are far fewer incentives on offer to retail warehouse tenants. And in some cases landlords are looking for - and getting - premiums. Shopping centre investment yields have also fallen. After drifting up to between 9 per cent and 10 per cent, prime yields are now standing at about 8.5 per cent. This, however, compares with the reputed 6 per cent at which some 2 1/2 years ago General Accident funded Capital &amp; Counties' recently-completed shopping centre in Bromley. Despite landlords' cash and the efforts of hard-pressed letting agents some of the newer shopping centres have opened their doors with disappointingly low occupancy levels. The problem has been worse in the south-east where the recession has hit consumer spending hardest. But even here, certain centres are showing respectable levels of lettings. Friends Provident's 450,000 sq ft County Mall in Crawley, Sussex opened two-thirds let last Easter. And Norwich Union's 460,000 sq ft Bentalls Centre in Kingston boasts not only a W H Smith multi-level flagship store with its own wall-climber lift and the largest ever single-level Dillons book shop in the UK; but also several much-courted overseas fashion retailers. In central London itself the shop market is confused and patchy says Ms Emma Thacker of Richard Ellis: 'Desperate in some areas and thriving in others'. The two traditional high fashion locations - Sloane Street and Bond Street - have undergone a reversal of fortunes with Sloane Street rents down from their 1988-89 levels of Pounds 410 a sq ft (Zone A) to about Pounds 250 a sq ft while in Bond Street, where Zone A rents only reached about Pounds 200 a sq ft at the peak, a much-needed boost has been provided by the much-trumpeted arrival of Versace. His new Pounds 13m store represents a Zone A rent of Pounds 250 a sq ft. Oxford Street is reportedly trading well although some landlords would rather accept temporary tenants at Pounds 250-Pounds 275 a sq ft (Zone A) - or even keep shops empty - rather than provide clear evidence of a fall in 'face' rents when involved in hotly-contested rent review negotiations on other units. Throughout central London, and many other centres, over-renting is a serious problem - particularly for those who took space at the high peak rents that are now unobtainable. The high level of the Uniform Business Rate only adds to the misery.</p>

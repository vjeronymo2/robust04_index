			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Sinatra to Cross the Line: Frank Sinatra said he will perform scheduled  engagements at Bally's in Las Vegas Dec. 4-9 and Dec. 26-31 despite an ongoing  strike by musicians. "The holiday season is here and it's time for everyone to  get back to work," the singer said in a prepared statement. Sinatra refused to  cross picket lines in Las Vegas for previous shows. The singer's decision was  seen as a major blow to Musicians Local 369, which has been on strike against  Bally's and four other resorts since summer. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Myo Nyunt, member of the State  Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] and chairman of the  Yangon [Rangoon] Division Law and Order Restoration Council  [LORC], held a meeting with the chairmen of district and  township LORCs at the conference room of the Yangon Division Law  and Order Restoration Council Office at 0800 this morning.    Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that the  SLORC has assumed state responsibility for five to six years and  that those present should not take their work lightly, but  should discharge their duties with a new spirit and personnel in  the new year of 1994 to strive for greater improvements. Lt.  Gen. Myo Nyunt noted that it has been six months since the  positions of chairmen of township LORCs, formerly held by  military officers, have been held by personnel from the  Department of General Administration. As former members of the  LORCs, the new chairmen of the LORCs have no difficulty in  discharging their duties, but they need to work with enthusiasm.    Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said the SLORC government is holding the  National Convention for the emergence of the State Constitution  in order to transfer state power to the people in accordance  with democratic means as soon as possible. Training courses are  being held to prepare for the administrative machinery, which  will emerge in the future. Those who have undergone the  training need to work in accordance with the motto: Quantity  with Quality. They will be able to prove their ability in the  workplace.    As they work in the capital city of Yangon, they will be  under the constant scrutiny and supervision by state leaders and  close observation by their immediate departmental superiors at  township and district level. They should bear this in mind in  their work.    Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that in implementing the three major  tasks of the SLORC, they should observe the following five  factors:    1. Always strive to know who are the old and new residents  in their respective areas;    2. Inspect the area under one's jurisdiction both  publicly and incognito;    3. Move around unnoticed like wind in order to assess  public behavior and the situation in districts and townships;    4. Do not engage in four kinds of improper conduct; those  who become rich in a short time become poor in a short time;  those who are wicked do not have enough to eat, those who are  honest have more than enough to eat. Therefore, honestly and  diligently work.    5. Discharge diligently one's duty.    Their constant duty is to ensure the prevalence of law and  order and peace and tranquility. The basic task of the state is  to promulgate and execute the existing laws and maintain the  capabilities of the Defense Services.    Regulations on traffic, roads, and trading are being  violated  in some townships. There are muggings and robberies by gangs  and trafficking and consumption of narcotic drugs. It is  necessary for chairmen and members of district and township  LORC's to act with care in order to ensure the prevalence of law  and order.    The government is building roads where there are mountains  and bridges where there are streams as part of its effort to  ensure good transport and communications and to develop the  country, including border regions. Irrigation projects are also  being implemented to bring greenery to the regions. They need  to cooperate with the development committees in various areas  for road repairs and to build drainage and reclaim land.    A Shan proverb says: Look after one's land in one's country;  it will be developed and prosperous one day. Accordingly, it  will be necessary to give priority to agriculture.    Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said some who do not desire peace and  tranquility in the city of Yangon and some power-mad  politicians, who have entered the business sector with help and  assistance from spies, are manipulating the market to keep  prices high and thereby instigate the hungry into creating  unrest. District and township LORCs must be vigilant against  this and strive to satisfy the people's need for food, clothing,  and shelter. Those who are manipulating prices on the  assumption that commodity prices will fall if the price of rice  falls will have to face the consequences.    Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt also said that security should not be  overlooked. He said special care should be taken to prevent the  disappearance of the language, religion, and nation and it will  be necessary to open monastic schools and conduct courses on  Buddhist culture.    Colonel Thura Myint Maung, deputy chairman of the Yangon  Division LORC, then participated in the discussion and chairmen  of district and township LORCs presented the situation in their  respective areas.    In his closing address, Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said the National  Convention will resume on 18 January 1994. He explained that  the eight groups had achieved the basic principles for the 15  chapter headings at the convention and that when the convention  resumes, discussions will be held to obtain firm basic  principles for each chapter. He said the Union Solidarity and  Development Association [USDA] has been formed with five  objectives, basic principles, and a code of behavior to strive  for the emergence of a developed and modern state. Branches  have been formed in divisions, districts, and townships. He  urged those present at the meeting to give necessary assistance  for the successful implementation of USDA programs and to serve  in the USDA.    General Aung San said: Think and work for the reconstruction  of Myanmar [Burma] and the preservation of our nation. Heroes  plan and work to make our nation become powerful. Lt. Gen. Myo  Nyunt said that there are currently some political parties with  a tendency to depend on things foreign -- this could lead to the  disappearance of the nation. Likewise, among the business  sector there is the tendency to depend on things foreign as can  be seen in the signboards with foreign names they put up. The  meeting ended after Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that although names  of townships, wards, and streets bearing English names and names  of traitors had been changed during the SLORC administration,  there are those who put up the foreign names and they must be  duly informed.</p>

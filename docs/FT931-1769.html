			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / China names former HK chief as adviser on colony HONG KONG'S former top civil servant, Sir David Akers-Jones, is to be appointed to the ranks of China's advisers on the colony's affairs. Sir David - the first expatriate appointed by China to such a role - was chief secretary of Hong Kong from June 1985 until February 1987. In the aftermath of Sir Edward Youde's death in 1986, he served as acting governor. He stepped down as chairman of the HK Housing Authority this week. Having someone of Sir David's stature as a Hong Kong adviser is seen as a propaganda coup for Beijing and an important step in the building of a 'united front' against governor Chris Patten's proposals for wider democracy in the colony. Beijing is due to announce within a fortnight a second tranche of advisers, which is expected to number more than 50 and to include leading conservative political figures. A year ago it selected 44 prominent Hong Kong citizens in the first round of appointments. According to one mainland Chinese official, Sir David, 65, who still lives in the colony, would be able to provide Beijing with unparalleled advice on the working of the Hong Kong government. He may also be able to advise China on how it can protect its interests from penetration by the British intelligence community in the colony. But the official said the symbolism Sir David's appointment carries is perhaps more important. 'He will be an example to senior Hong Kong civil servants that they have a life after 1997, if they follow his lead.' Last night, Sir David said he was unable to confirm or deny reports of his impending appointment. But he said he thought Britain had gone back on agreements and understandings it had reached with China in early 1990. Sir David said that Mr Patten's plans for more democracy in the colony were 'not worth the candle' and warned of the potential damage to Hong Kong and British interests in China of the UK pursuing its current policy. 'I believe the way forward lies in co-operation rather than antagonism and confrontation,' he said.</p>

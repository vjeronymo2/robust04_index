			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Paler shade of Green: The troubled party's future Green party members were not behaving like an endangered species at the start of their annual conference on Thursday in the far from green Wolverhampton Civic Hall. 'One of our functions is to keep the other political parties sane. Of course we have a future,' said one member, defiant about the party's recent troubles. But outside the conference hall many members said they were hurt by the remarks of Ms Sara Parkin, head of the party until September 20, who claimed two weeks ago that the Green party had become a liability to green politics. As well as Ms Parkin, another five of its 11-strong executive are standing down for various reasons. One of its highest-profile members, Mr Jonathon Porritt, has also declared that he will no longer take an active part. The party's rise and fall has been rapid; the question is whether it now faces extinction. Its membership, at 8,000, has fallen to 1987 levels after reaching 19,000 in June 1990, shortly after its European elections triumph when it captured 15 per cent of the vote. Significantly, its following halved in a period when popular support for green issues and environmental pressure groups continued to rise. Some symptoms of its troubles were on display at the conference. Its members' widespread mistrust of leadership and 'cult of personality' is one reason its executive has changed so often. 'Better in some ways not to have a leader - though you have to for political purposes,' said Mr Guy Woodford from Malvern Hills. The party's introversion - the agenda contained 25 motions on internal procedure - has sometimes sat oddly with its policies on the welfare of the planet. And its pursuit of political correctness, while scrupulous, can be paralysing. Mr Matthew Patterson of the standing orders committee pleaded for an amendment to be 'put in language the man in the street can understand  -ignore the sexism'. Beyond its control, however, is a wider problem. 'Other parties have stolen bits of our clothes,' according to Mr Woodford, such as its long-standing support for catalytic converters on cars. Perhaps the biggest reason for the membership decline, however, is that many who joined in 1989 and 1990 misunderstood the character of the party. 'The European manifesto was not as radical as the party actually is. People were joining just to save the whale,' said Ms Jo Graham from the party's Loughborough branch. She and many others believe membership has simply shrunk back to the pre-1989 core. Much of that comprises the hippies and anarchists who joined the party's first incarnation as the People party, along with the peace movement contingent who joined in the mid-1980s when the Labour party abandoned its commitment to unilateral disarmament. At its present level the Green party may have reached equilibrium, 'sustainability' on a small scale, the goal its conference is now prescribing for many communities. Provided it follows the prudence of its last executive committee and keeps several tens of thousand pounds in the bank, it will probably survive as the political expression of those who want to live a pure green life. But it is wishful thinking for its members to hope that it can influence other parties as it did after its European triumph. That threat has shrunk together with its membership. Instead, greater pressure on mainstream parties is now being exerted by environmental pressure groups, which now dwarf the Green party in membership, money and organisation. As the Green party has lost impetus, the pressure groups have gained momentum, hindered only slightly by the recession. Friends of the Earth now has more than 200,000 UK supporters and an annual income that tops Pounds 5m. Greenpeace UK has more than 400,000 supporters and Pounds 4m income; its worldwide network has more than 4m supporters and expects to receive Dollars 150m this year. The turning point was 1989-90 when a series of environmental concerns helped treble their UK membership. For nearly two years the front pages detailed the death of seals in the North Sea; a salmonella outbreak; the levels of pesticides and bacteria in water. 'It does tend to be fear that brings people to green issues at first,' says Ms Parkin. 'In 1989 the environment was out canvassing - it was delivering the evidence.' According to Mr Mark Gilden, director of ICD marketing services, a market research company, 'the profile of people who are interested in these issues has enormously expanded. The main supporters are directors and professionals  -the bank manager who keeps his green politics in the cupboard - as well as the student radicals.' But unlike the Green party, the pressure groups have held on to their new members. The groups have also become more sophisticated in their research - often tracking down obscure government figures. They have become more adept at recruiting: 'We start them on the whales when they're kids then move them on to nuclear as they get older,' said one Save the Whale campaigner. But all groups face the threat of recession, which has stalled or cut into their income - for example, Greenpeace has just axed its turtle campaign and may drop work on marine pollution. According to Mr Porritt, the pressure groups must adapt to 'a change in the tenor of the debate - business is no longer so hostile. Some of the green groups have been terribly slow to get involved in discussions of market mechanisms - such as pollution permits and carbon taxes. The quality of their research has been better on the problems than the solutions.' But if green pressure groups can make those changes, they are unlikely to find the Green party a hindrance, as Ms Parkin feared. Nor are they likely to need its help - they look set to eclipse it still further.</p>

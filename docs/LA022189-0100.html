			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> SEARCH CONTINUES FOR SLAIN BROKER RIVAL  </P> <P> Police on Monday continued their search for Vicente Lapid OCampo, a real estate  broker wanted for questioning in last week's slaying of a Seal Beach woman who  was shot and found dead in a truck of a car.  </P> <P> Long Beach Police Detective William MacLyman said OCampo may have left the Los  Angeles area. Speculation centered on the possibility that OCampo had returned  to the Philippines, where he was born.  </P> <P> "We just don't know," MacLyman said. "We can't find him."  </P> <P> MacLyman said he would seek an arrest warrant for OCampo today in connection  with last Wednesday's shooting death of Arlene Chee, a 46-year-old real estate  broker.  </P> <P> Chee, owner of Century 21 Fortune in Long Beach , was last seen Wednesday  morning heading to a noon appointment with OCampo, who owns a rival realty firm  in Long Beach. Police said the two had been arguing over a real estate agent  who left OCampo's firm to join Chee's more successful business.  </P> <P> Chee's late model Mercedes-Benz was found by members of her family last  Thursday night. A Long Beach patrolman opened the trunk and found the woman's  body. She had been shot once in the head.  </P> <P> Alan Chee, the victim's brother-in-law, said a memorial service was planned for  1 p.m. Saturday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress.  </P> <P> A short service will be held at the park in the Church of Our Fathers chapel,  with burial to follow, he said.  </P></p>

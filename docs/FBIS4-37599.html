			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Excerpt] Israel has informed the PLO that it has approved  the return of 84 of the 104 members of the PLO Central Council  [PCC]. The approved list of returnees includes Faruq Qaddumi,  Mahmud 'Abbas, Sulayman al-Najjab, Jamal al-Surani, Taysir  Khalid, 'Abdallah Hurani, Salim al-Za'nun, Ibrahim Bakr,  al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Khalid al-Hasan, Dr. Walid Mustafa,  Ibrahim Abu-'Ayyash, and others.    It is noteworthy that the Israeli list of approved returnees  excludes Palestine National Council [PNC] Speaker Shaykh  'Abd-al-Hamid al-Sa'ih.    Also excluded are Taysir Qub'ah, PNC and PCC deputy speaker,  and Muhammad Subayh, PNC and PCC secretary.    Five of the PLO Executive Committee members, who are also  PCC  members, have also been excluded from the approved list. They  are poet Mahmud Darwish (independent), Bishop Iliya Khuri  (independent), 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh (representative of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, PFLP), Dr. Samir  Ghawshah (representative of the Popular Struggle Front) and 'Ali  Ishaq (representative of the Arab Liberation Front).    It is also worth noting that Bishop Iliya Khuri is a  deportee, while poet Mahmud Darwish was a citizen in the  Palestinian territory occupied in 1948, but he left in the early  seventies to join the Palestinian revolution.    Also excluded from the list were Abu-'Ali Mustafa and Ahmad  Fu'ad, PFLP representatives on the PCC; Saji Salamah and Salih  Zaydan, representatives of the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine; Nasif 'Awwad, representative of the  Arab Liberation Front; and Salih Ra'fat and 'Isam 'Abd-al-Latif,  FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Federation Party] representatives.  This is despite the fact that the names of FIDA  representatives were mentioned in the Israeli authorities'  recent lists of Palestinian officials.    The list also includes names of people who returned with  earlier groups of deportees, including B'ir Zayt University  President Dr. Hanna Nasir, 'Abd-al-Jawad Salih, Fa'iq Warrad,  and Taysir 'Aruri.    AL-RA'Y has learned that the Palestinian leadership in Tunis  has instructed its personnel to delay their return in order to  arrange it in an adequate manner. [passage omitted]</p>

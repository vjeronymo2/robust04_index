			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA) -- After an ideological and  substantive separation of more than four decades, Taiwan and  Mainland China found in 1993 that the two sides were finally  ready to meet at the negotiation table.    Since C.F. Koo, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits  Exchange  Foundation (SEF), and Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), met  April 27-29 in Singapore for the first "direct formal" talks  between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland since 1949, three other  SEF-ARATS "business" talks have taken place.    The three "business" meetings were held in August, November,  and December in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei respectively.    Although the talks did not result in any definite  agreements,  the two sides arrived at a consensus that a negotiation channel  for direct talks between the two semi-official intermediary  organizations had been established.    During the three-day "Koo-Wang" talks in April, the two  organizations signed four agreements, including the agreement on  the establishment of systematic liaison and communication  channels between SEF and ARATS which stipulates that SEF and  ARATS officials at the level of deputy secretary-general or  department director should hold talks every three months on  either side of the Taiwan strait.    Under the Koo-Wang talks joint accord, the two sides were to  hold talks during 1993 on such issues as repatriation of illegal  immigrants, fishing disputes, crackdown on crimes on the sea,  judicial assistance, and intellectual property rights protektion.    With a communication mechanism linking SEF and ARATS  established by the "Koo-Wang" talks, SEF and ARATS officials met  three times in 1993, but all talks ended without agreement.    Even though "official" relations between the two sides made  little progress, private ties, especially two-way trade,  continued to grow during the past year.    According to Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) statistics,  indirect two-way trade between Taiwan and the mainland reached  US$6.39 billion in the Jan-Sept period last year, up 21.2  percent from US$5.28 billion in the same period of 1992.    In terms of civilian visits, 1993 saw a faster growth for  the  mainland than Taiwan, MAC said.    Mainland residents made 16,000 visits to Taiwan during the  first 10 months of 1993, up 36.96 percent from the corresponding  period of 1992. Taiwan residents, meanwhile, paid 1,230,000  visits to the mainland, compared with 1,280,000 visits  registered a year earlier, MAC statistics showed.    During the past year, a MAC official said, a "white paper"  published by Beijing in August concerning its relations with  Taiwan was an undeniable setback in the course of cross-strait  relations.    A spate of 10 hijackings in 1993 also had an adverse effect  on the development of cross-Taiwan strait relations, the  official remarked.    Nevertheless, MAC, SEF, and all related government agencies  have determined to try harder in the next years to reach the  goal of final reunification of China, said MAC Spokesman Kao  Koong-lien.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Books: Modern British drama under the microscope - BA Young on Kenneth Tynan and Nick Curtis on Arnold Wesker KENNETH TYNAN LETTERS edited by Kathleen Tynan Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 22, 690 pages This collection of letters, unlike Kathleen Tynan's earlier, much admired and affectionate biography of her late husband, displays some of Kenneth Tynan's less charming characteristics. The correspondence also reveals several surprising, and sometimes contradictory, judgments from one of the most celebrated critics of British theatre. His early letters from school were innocuous enough, offering only fan letters and gossip to a friend. Oxford provided the first of several love affairs; there is fun and variety in this correspondence but only his own evidence of burgeoning talent. He both directed and played in the theatre; 'my production of Sweeney Agonistes was a terrific success.' Isis called him 'Oxford's best journalist, objectionable Kenneth Tynan.' He came down without a degree but with several theatrical offers waiting. To Picture Post he wrote that 'the year which I spent in Oxford was a superb parenthesis in my life and, like all the best parentheses, they mean more than all the rest of the sentence.' This was in 1950, when he was 23. The following Christmas, he sailed with Elaine Dundy, later his first wife, to New York. John Gielgud asked him to supper and Tynan described Kenneth More (in The Deep Blue Sea) as 'our best answer to Marlon Brando.' Arthur Miller's The Crucible, he wrote on a later visit to New York, was 'a failure dramatically'. Yet 10 years on, in a memo to Olivier, Tynan included it in a proposed schedule for the National Theatre. In January 1953 he was working both for the Daily Sketch and the Evening Standard but in July he wrote to David Astor for a job as second-string theatre critic on the Observer. This did not stop him from taking on a job as script editor at Ealing Studios, assuring Astor that 'a not too-tedious job in another field would stimulate me.' In September 1958, Wolcott Gibbs of the New Yorker died and William Shawn, the editor, invited Tynan to take his place. Tynan left Ealing, with a long critical letter to its director, and began work on the New Yorker. The section entitled 'Crest of the Wave' begins with the break-up of his first marriage, which Tynan, on the evidence of these letters, tried to keep going. The ATV programme, We Dissent, which Tynan had built up with 26 liberal Americans citizens, went out in January 1960 and was ill-received in US. It is hardly surprising that he reckoned he should be in England again, where he wrote to Olivier to ask for a job. Olivier, reluctantly at first, took him on as literary manager for the National Theatre. 'Celebrating the Sixties' is predominantly National Theatre correspondence. Controversial plays included Robert Graves's re-written Much Ado and Charles Wood's Dingo, which were turned down by the board. He continued his freelance work, and the seduction of Kathleen (largely by telegram). In 1956 he proposed an erotic show, 'Nothing that is merely funny or merely beautiful should be admitted; it must also be sexy.' This became the notorious Oh] Calcutta. The 1970s marked the start of Tynan's fade-out period. He was becoming increasingly radical; work was commissioned from Havel and there was an idea for pieces about Wilhelm Reich and Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In a series of letters from Tunisia, his marriage to Kathleen was going well but his health was breaking down. In London, Peter Hall had taken over from Olivier at the National and there was talk of Tynan's departure. By the spring of 1977, he and Kathleen were in California, where he went on writing pieces about literary and dramatic figures while retaining his English friendships. He made friends again with his first wife and with fellow-critic Harold Hobson, and wrote rhymed birthday-cards to his children. Then he died. It is hard to sense much affection in these letters - but the answers to some of his more provocative correspondence would have made interesting reading. ***** AS MUCH AS I DARE by Arnold Wesker Century Pounds 18.99, 578 pages If Tynan was the great chronicler of modern British drama, John Osborne, who reshaped it in the 1950s, was its scalding prophet and Arnold Wesker was a quieter, questioning counterpart. While Pinter and Becket wowed a complacent theatre with their oblique absurdism, Osborne and Wesker employed their supposed working-class realism to equally devastating effect: Osborne raged and loathed, Wesker argued, doubted and loved. Unlike Pinter and Beckett, their seminal early plays (Osborne's Look Back in Anger, Wesker's Chips With Everything and his Trilogy) have dated badly, a fact both refuse to acknowledge. While Osborne ossifies into damn-you-all curmudgeonliness, Wesker writes, writes, writes, appealing for justice and the recognition he gets abroad and feels he deserves at home. This Arnold Wesker - the wounded, misunderstood artist - cries out sporadically from the pages of an unruly, unbalanced first volume of autobiography. He appears in paragraphs announced as 'Asides' in a narrative that hopscotches back and forth through his life up to 1959 and beyond. There is also the bereft husband confessing, if not regretting, the adultery that wrecked his 35-year marriage to the adored Dusty, a marriage barely begun as this book ends. Most embarrassingly, there is the penitent father, appealing directly for forgiveness to the eldest son Lindsay Joe who will not speak to him because of this betrayal. (The publisher notes that, since writing, Wesker and son are reconciled. Whoopee.) Mostly though, this is a chronicle of the early years that preceded Wesker's early success, where he's at pains to assert what most writers spend their lives denying - the direct autobiographical nature of his plays, poems and prose. The last hundred-odd pages are gripping as the twentysomething Wesker is tentatively fostered by the Royal Court, lunched by impresarios and championed by his revolutionary peers after years of rejection letters. To reach this consummately readable apotheosis, though, you have to hack through over 400 pages of reminiscence, romanticism and (Wesker denies it, but it is there) nostalgia. The story of his childhood and early adulthood is clotted with diary extracts (his own and others), letters (ditto), and illustrative snatches from his works. Wesker could condense, paraphrase or edit, but refuses to. He depicts himself through younger writings as a mildly embarrassing but adorable innocent. His hopes, dreams and, above all, his family and friends are laid painstakingly and repeatedly before us in an often gauche, sometimes unctuous and always rambling narrative. Wesker's family - cantankerous but loving mother, ineffectual father, saintly sister - appear with a frequency justified by his reliance on them for the grist of his drama. His friends are another matter. Although many metamorphosed into characters in his plays, many more seem to be evoked for the sake of avenging past slights or expunging past guilts in print. A huge number are incidental to the narrative, suggesting that Wesker is more interested in communing with his past than communicating with the reader. Wesker bemoans his infelicity with prose, and it shows. His style at first is either overwrought and overexcited or fetishistically introspective and self-absorbed. As if to illustrate the blend of self-doubt and self-justification that makes up the large part of this volume (the title is very apt), the pages are littered with question and exclamation marks. When writing about his early years, Wesker is like a child, alternately demanding acknowledgment of his cleverness or wheedling for sympathy. Later  -much later - he settles down to become fast, funny, even fair. He is brilliantly even-handed to his late friend, the dictatorial director John Dexter, who premiered Chicken Soup With Barley, Roots and The Kitchen. There are also thumbnail sketches to rival Osborne's depictions of Tony Richardson and George Devine, the powerful Royal Court supremos. For the most part, though, as in his early plays, Wesker now seems to be overdoing it. His Russian-Transylvanian ancestry; the milieu of an East End Jewish family through the 1930s, '40s and '50s; the factors that shaped a young, working-class, autodidact Jewish playwright are all somewhat smothered by the tangential, the incidental and the inconsequential. Since this book officially ends in 1959 (Wesker constantly runs ahead of himself), I presume there's at least one more volume to come. The last fifth of As Much As l Dare hints at how good the next book might be. The other four-fifths do not.</p>

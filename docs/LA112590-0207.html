			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> HIKING TRAIL TO BE REOPENED  </P> <P> A hiking trail that has been closed since World War II will be restored and  reopened with a $50,000 state environmental grant funded by fees on  personalized license plates.  </P> <P> Work on the Ben Overturff Trail project has just begun, said Daniel Iwata,  manager of the city's Community Services Department, and many details are still  being worked out.  </P> <P> Plans call for volunteer workers to restore the trail on the city's northern  edge, along Sawpit Canyon Wash near Monrovia Canyon Park and the border of  Angeles National Forest.  </P> <P> Glen Owens, a member of a city committee overseeing the grant, said the  restoration is important because "we'll be opening up a trail alongside a  riparian area that has been closed for virtually 50 years."  </P> <P> No date for the reopening has been set.  </P></p>

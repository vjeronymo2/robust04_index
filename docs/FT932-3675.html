			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Farmers who went to sea - A couple who found their dream cottage and then worried about work FARMERS have to be adaptable, but few would change their plans to suit circumstances as much as Joe and June Folder have. The Folders' background is in conventional farm management in northern England and Wales, but they have turned to raising a completely different kind of livestock - millions of Pacific oysters - at their farm on the Cleddau Estuary in Pembrokeshire. The switch to shellfish followed their discovery 13 years ago of a cottage set in 23 idyllic acres of Pembrokeshire Coast National Park land overlooking the estuary. 'This just seemed like a nice place to live,' Joe says, 'so we began looking for a suitable crop. There were native oysters already growing in the estuary, which seemed to be a good indication of the potential.' The Folders set up Carew Oysters in 1980, budgeting about Pounds 52,000 for equipment and working capital. It took a good deal of persuasion to get the bank to co - operate, especially as a nearby oyster farm was going bust. 'You can imagine the reaction of a bank manager if you say you want Pounds 50,000 to throw in the river and in three to four years you might begin to show a return,' Joe says. The farm's oysters are bought as 2mm seed, or spat, from a hatchery in Kent and kept in a semi-controlled nursery for a few months until they are about one inch long and tough enough to survive in the open. The oysters are then loaded into plastic mesh bags which are placed on pontoons and transfered to the open estuary, where they will stay for two to three years. The oysters are spread out over five acres of sea bed where they feed on plankton and other nutrients brought to them twice a day on the tide. During the summer, the 10,000 bags have to be turned once a month to keep off algae and other fouling organisms. When they eventually reach market size, the oysters are cleaned inside and out in purification tanks before being packed, still in their shells, for sale. Carew Oysters' growth also has been steady, and the business now has five employees and an annual turnover of Pounds 100,000, representing about a million oysters. Half of the crop from the farm, not yet mature, is shipped to countries such as France and Germany, where they can finish growing to market size and be sold - quite legally - as 'French' or 'German' oysters. Joe Folder deals with wholesalers on the continent, but in the UK, a market he would like to expand, he is aiming more at retail outlets. But the high street fishmonger who would stock fresh oysters is a disappearing breed, along with the housewife who would buy from him. 'We have two generations of housewives who don't know anything about fish,' Joe complains. 'It's all supermarkets now, with everything pre-packaged.' Nevertheless, he does sell to wholesalers in Wales and England who in turn sell the oysters to retailers, and Carew Oysters are served in local restaurants and hotels. He also runs a mail order business, marketing the oysters, with their reputation as both an upmarket food and an aphrodisiac, as the perfect gift for St Valentine's, anniversaries or other special occasions. Food shows and exhibitions provide another way of bringing oysters and the public together, and there is a shop at the farm with free samples for visitors. 'It's sometimes difficult to get people to try oysters,' Joe says, 'but once they do, they usually enjoy them.' Carew Oysters, West Williamston, Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire Tel: 0646-651452.</p>

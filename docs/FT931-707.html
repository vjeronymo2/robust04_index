			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Arts: Russian piano duo - Recital When the Wigmore Hall advertised a recital of Russian two-piano music by Dmitri Alexeev and Nikolai Demidenko for last Saturday, some of their fans may have felt anticipatory thrills. But cynical old hands like me had their doubts. Part of what makes a successful virtuoso is a single-minded determination to catch the ear; such performers usually collaborate more easily with other instruments than with their own kind. Besides, Alexeev and Demidenko would seem less than a natural match. Where intense feeling and spontaneity characterise the one, the other cultivates perfection with forethought. Yet in the event, their differences were all but submerged in a shared passion for their native repertoire. Though the occasion for the concert was the 50th anniversary of Rakhmaninov's death, there is not quite enough two-piano music by that composer, fortunately, to fill a programme. That made a good excuse for jettisoning his Suite no. 1 and adding some unfamiliar Medtner, and a chain of Schubert waltzes as arranged by Prokofiev. But Rakhmaninov carried the evening after all; and a tingling account of the brilliant Second Suite was certainly the crown of it. His early Russian Rhapsody (1891) was at least interesting for its debt to Balakirev and Borodin, St Petersburg nationalists whose echoes were more often suppressed in Muscovite products such as Rakhmaninov's or Skryabin's. In the two-piano version of the Symphonic Dances (1940, very late), some quirks in the harmony sounded less plausible than in their opulent orchestral disguise. Still, with playing of such devoted expertise one could only sit back and enjoy. Here and there, when Demidenko had an 'accompanying' role his awesome authority made him rather too prominent, and in some prestissimo digital passages Alexeev audibly scrambled. No other quibbles but to remark that biological piano duos - the Kontarskys, the Contiguglia twins, the sisters Labeque and Pekinel - have set a standard of eerie unanimity that few other pairs can reach. Here, at phrase-ends and paragraph closes, Alexeev and Demidenko were regularly a fraction of a second apart: they just are different musical animals.</p>

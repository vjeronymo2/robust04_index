			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Kuwait's difficulties in Spain widen THE financial difficulties at Grupo Torras, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office which this month filed for receivership, have spread to other parts of the Torras empire. Prima Inmobilaria, the company's large property affiliate, has filed for court protection against creditors. The move is widely seen as a serious threat to another Torras subsidiary, Torraspapel, Spain's biggest paper company. The news of the Prima filing came as KIO officials met in London over the weekend to contain a crisis of confidence in the KIO itself, which has been left with losses of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) following its investment thrust into Spain. Some international banks are studying ways of acting against the KIO if Torras and its affiliates do not repay their borrowings. Bank creditors to Torras and its companies met last week in Madrid with KPMG Peat Marwick, which has been appointed to replace Torras' Kuwaiti managers during the receivership. Banks are insisting on accelerated repayment of loans from Torras affiliates, which, like Torraspapel, are not legally affected by the parent company's receivership. Formal approval for the Torras receivership was given by a Madrid judge last Friday, a move which immediately triggered the Prima filing. Bankers in Madrid say Torras' financial plight may have been overstated. While the Kuwaitis insist all Dollars 4.5bn invested in Spain since 1986 has been lost, KPMG Peat valued the group at Pta2.9bn (Pounds 16.57m) just over a year ago and warned Kuwait that if it tried to sell assets in a poor economic climate it risked taking substantial losses. KPMG also advised the Kuwaitis to treat Torras debt to the KIO as equity. But in receivership papers filed in Madrid the Torras liabilities are shown as Dollars 2.4bn, of which Dollars 1.6bn is debt to the KIO. Prima, Spain's third largest property developer, filed for receivership on Saturday along with its biggest subsidiary, Urbanor. The two have liabilities of Dollars 1bn, owed mainly to Spanish banks. The KIO, through Torras, owns just over 30 per cent of Prima, though former Spanish managers say the true holding is close to 70 per cent.</p>

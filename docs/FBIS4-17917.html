			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tleuzhan Yesilbayev: "Kazakhstan Without Meat or </F> Butter"]    [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- Painful figures were cited at a  routine sitting of the Kazakhstani Cabinet of Ministers a few  days ago.    For instance, as of 1 April, 1,084 enterprises were either  completely or partially standing idle in Kazakhstan.  Electricity generation had fallen by 14 percent, and coal  extraction by 10 percent. The extraction of oil, gas  condensate, and gas had fallen. In the first three months of  this year, the fall in production in the Republic's food  industry alone was 33 percent. As a result the production of  butter, milk, cheese, canned food, whole milk and fish products,  flour, groats, and pasta products decreased. The acceleration  of inflationary processes has been reflected in the material  position of the Kazakhstanis. During the past year, average  monthly earnings increased by a factor of only 14.2, while  consumer prices went up by a factor of 23. The price of  consumer services jumped even higher -- by a factor of 24 -- but  there was a record price hike in the housing sector -- by a  factor of 62. And you now have to pay 37 times more for medical  services than you did a year ago.    In a word, the crisis in the economy and the social sphere  has affected all strata of the population. Many Kazakhstanis  are pinning their hopes for a better future on the professional  parliament, whose first session opened last week.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraphs (c)(2) (ii) and (iii) of &sect;1.637 are proposed to be amended for clarification. Paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) and &sect;1.637(c)(3)(iii), which relate to &sect;1.633(f) motions for benefit, are proposed to be deleted and reserved as unnecessary, since motions under &sect;1.633(c) (2) and (3) do not efect the count. Paragraph (c)(3)(ii), which applies to motions under &sect;1.633(c)(3) to designate a claim as corresponding to a count, is proposed to be amended to have claims compared to claims, as is the case in &sect;1.633(c)(4)(ii), which applies to motions filed under &sect;1.633(c)(4) to designate a claim as not corresponding to a count. The proposed amendment avoids the need to compare claims to counts, which are subject to different rules of construction than are claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of &sect;1.637 is proposed to be amended to require that a party moving to designate a claim as not corresponding to a count must show that the claim could not serve as the basis for a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c)(1) to add a new count. The proposed amendment, if adopted, would preclude a party from moving to designate one of its claims as not corresponding to the count where an opponent's disclosure would support a similar claim, in which case the party could file a &sect;1.633(c)(1) preliminary motion proposing a claim to be added to the opponent's application and suggesting that the proposed claim and the party's claim in question be designated as corresponding to a proposed new count. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(4) of &sect;1.637, which authorizes a party to file a motion for benefit together with a motion under &sect;1.633(d), is proposed to be deleted and reserved as unnecessary, because motions filed under &sect;1.633(d) do not affect the count. Paragraphs (e)(1)(viii) and (e)(2)(vii) are proposed to be amended to make it clear that a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(e) (1) or (2) need not be accompanied by a preliminary motion for benefit under &sect;1.633(f) unless the moving party seeks benefit with respect to the proposed count. Paragraphs (e)(1)(ix) and (e)(2)(viii) are proposed to be added to specify that where an opponent is accorded the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed application in the notice of declaration of the interference, the moving party must show why the opponent is not entitled to benefit of the earlier filed application with respect to the proposed count; otherwise, the opponent will be presumed to be entitled to benefit of the earlier filed application with respect to the proposed count. Paragraph (f)(2) of &sect;1.637 is proposed to be amended to change ``abroad'' to ``in a foreign country'' and to delete both occurrences of ``filed abroad'' as superfluous. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h) of &sect;1.637 is proposed to be amended to explain that a preliminary motion to add a reissue application that includes a new or amended claim to be designated as not corresponding to a count will be given the same treatment as a preliminary motion proposing to amend a claim in, or add a new claim to, an involved application to be designated as not corresponding to the count, i.e., the preliminary motion will be dismissed. See L'Esperance v. Nishimoto, 18 USPQ2d 1534, 1537 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1991) (interference rules do not authorize a motion by party-applicant to amend or add a claim to be designated as not corresponding to the count). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.638, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) for clarification by changing ``a reply'' to ``any reply.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;1.639, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a), which requires that a motion, opposition or reply be accompanied by the evidence on which a party intends to rely in support of or in opposition to a motion, to be consistent with paragraphs (c) through (g), which permit some types of evidence to be filed after filing of the motion, opposition or reply. It is also proposed to amend paragraph (d)(1) by changing ``call'' to ``use.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.640, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) in several respects. The first is to provide that a decision on a preliminary motion shall be deferred to final hearing unless an administrative patent judge or the Board is of the opinion that a decision on a preliminary motion will materially advance the resolution of the interference. The second is to state that a matter raised by a party in support of or in opposition to a motion that is deferred to final hearing will not be entitled to consideration at final hearing unless the matter is raised in the party's brief at final hearing. It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) to state that where the administrative patent judge determines that the interference shall proceed to final hearing on the issue of priority or derivation, a time shall be set for each party to file a paper identifying any decisions of the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed at final hearing as well as identifying any deferred or belatedly filed motions that the party wishes to have considered at final hearing. Paragraph (b) as proposed to be amended would also require that any evidence a party wishes to have considered with respect to the decisions and motions to be considered or reviewed at final hearing, including any affidavits filed by the party under &sect;1.608(b) or 1.639(b), would have to be served on the opponent during the testimony-in-chief period of the party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;1.640 is proposed to be amended for clarification. Paragraph (b)(2), which currently states that a preliminary motion filed after a decision is entered on preliminary motions under &sect;1.633 will not be considered except as provided by &sect;1.655(b), is proposed to be amended to state that a preliminary motion filed after the time expires for filing preliminary motions will not be considered except as provided by &sect;1.645(b) by changing ``1.655(b)'' to ``1.645(b),'' which relates to consideration of belatedly filed papers in general. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) of &sect;1.640, which currently requires an administrative patent judge or the Board to specifically authorize an opposition to a request for reconsideration of a decision by an administrative patent judge, is proposed to be amended to authorize an opponent to file an opposition, thereby saving the administrative patent judge or the Board the time it would otherwise take to determine whether an opposition should be authorized. If adopted, the administrative patent judge would continue to have the authority to deny a request for reconsideration without waiting for an opposition. In order to conserve the resources of the Board, it is also proposed to delete the last sentence of &sect;1.640(c) so as to authorize a single individual administrative patent judge to decide a request for reconsideration. Paragraph (c) is also proposed to be amended to require that a request for reconsideration be filed by hand or Express Mail. Paragraph (d)(1), which currently states that an order to show cause under that section can be based on a decision on a motion which is dispositive of the interference against a party as to any count, is proposed to be amended to include decisions on dispositive matters raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e) of &sect;1.640 is proposed to be amended to incorporate the substance of the Deputy Commissioner's Notice of December 8, 1986, published as Interference Practice: Response to Order to Show Cause Under 37 CFR 1.640,'' 1074 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 4 (Jan. 6, 1987), reprinted in 1086 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 282 (Jan. 5, 1988). Specifically, paragraph (e) as proposed to be amended would provide that where the order to show cause was issued under &sect;1.640(d)(1), the party may respond with a paper (i) requesting that final hearing be set to review the decision which is the basis for the order and identifying every other decision of the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing, or (ii) fully explaining why judgment should not be entered. Any other party would be permitted to file a response to the paper within 20 days of the date of service of the paper. Where the order was issued under &sect;1.640(d)(1) and the paper includes a request for final hearing, the response must identify every decision of the administrative patent judge that the responding party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. Where the order was issued under &sect;1.640(d)(1) and the paper does not include a request for final hearing, the response may include a request for final hearing, which must identify every decision of the administrative patent judge that the responding party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. Where only the response includes a request for a final hearing, the party who filed the paper would have 14 days from the date of service of the response in which to file a supplemental paper identifying any other decision of the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. The paper or the response thereto would have to be accompanied by a motion (&sect;1.635) requesting a testimony period if a party wishes to introduce any evidence to be considered at final hearing (&sect;1.671), such as affidavits previously filed under &sect;1.639(b). A request for a testimony period would be construed as including a request for final hearing. Where the paper contains an explanation of why judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order and no party has requested a final hearing, the decision that is the basis for the order would be reviewed based on the contents of the paper and the response. If the paper fails to show good cause, the Board would enter judgment against the party against whom the order issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

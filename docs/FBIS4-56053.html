			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["is"-signed report: "Slovak Republic's Balance of Payments </F> for 1993 Shows a Moderate Surplus, But at the Cost of Growing  Indebtedness Abroad" -- all figures as published]    [Text] Bratislava -- According to the report on monetary  development in the Slovak Republic in 1993, which has been drawn  up by the Slovak National Bank [NBS], the consolidated balance  of trade ended in a deficit of 31.961 billion Slovak korunas  [Sk] ($1.038 billion), the balance of services in a surplus of  Sk12.843 billion ($417.1 million), the balance of yields  (interest rates, investments, wages of citizens working abroad)  in a deficit of Sk1.17 billion ($38 million), and the balance of  current transfers in a surplus of Sk3.077 billion ($99.9  million). The total balance of the current account of the  balance of payments as the sum total of the preceding balances  was therefore in deficit to the tune of Sk17.211 billion ($559  million).    After including the balance on the capital and financial  account, which ended in a surplus of Sk17.790 billion ($675.9  million), and the item of mistakes and errors (minus Sk1.111  billion, that is, minus $58 million), the total balance of  payments of the Slovak Republic ended in a surplus of Sk1.69  billion ($58.5 million). However, this positive result of the  balance of payments is attributable, to a large extent, to  credits taken abroad -- the issue of NBS bonds to an amount of  Sk7.6 billion, an IMF loan of Sk3 billion, a World Bank loan of  Sk1.1 billion, import liabilities of the entrepreneurial sector  of Sk8.7 billion, and the drawing on resources from commercial  banks' lines of credit to an amount of Sk6.8 billion. The  external indebtedness of the Slovak Republic increased last  year, with the gross debt in foreign currency reaching $3.622  billion by the end of the year.</p>

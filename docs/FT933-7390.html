			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Markets: Where to put your trust - Serious Money INVESTMENT trusts have rarely been so healthy. Over the past year, while the sector's assets have grown by 48 per cent, the average share price has risen by 61 per cent, according to NatWest. The result is that the average discount in the investment trust sector has fallen to its narrowest level, at 8.7 per cent, since 1972, according to S G Warburg. The FT Investment Trust index also hit an all-time high. At this point, a good contrarian has to argue; have things gone too far? Certainly experienced sector watchers, such as Hamish Buchan of NatWest Securities, find much at which to marvel. 'The discount on Foreign &amp; Colonial (the largest trust in the sector) is just 1.3 per cent' he says. 'If you had mentioned that possibility to F&amp;C 10 years ago, they would have laughed.' At least Foreign &amp; Colonial is still at a discount. On Friday morning, shares in Templeton Emerging Markets were trading at a 17.6 per cent premium; much as one might admire the investment skills of Mark Mobius, the Templeton manager, it is hard to see why you should pay Pounds 117.60 to buy Pounds 100 of assets. The shares could fall 15 per cent and still be trading at asset value. Why has this been happening? With the share market reaching new highs, investment trusts represent a quick and efficient way for private investors, and some small institutions, to put money into shares. Furthermore, the regular drip-feed of savings schemes appears to have been steadily narrowing the discount over the years. A further factor is that the number of trusts which are either geographical specialists, or have a split capital structure, has increased. Such funds tend not to trade at a wide discount, because in the case of the former, they offer institutions something they cannot replicate on their own and, in the case of the latter, they offer the private investor tax advantages. But can the situation continue? Hamish Buchan says: 'Some people think the discount has gone for ever. I don't believe that to be the case. The sector looks a bit toppy at the moment.' The worst that could happen is a sudden fall in the market. Institutions might sell their holdings as a way of reducing exposure to the market and private investors might lose confidence in equities. Those still invested might suffer a 'double whammy' as assets fall and the discount widens. All this might tilt the odds in the long-standing argument over whether investment trusts or unit trusts are better for the private investor. The main arguments in favour of investment trusts have been threefold: costs are lower; ability to gear up through borrowing should enhance returns over the long run; and it is possible to buy their assets at a discount. But some of those arguments have been undermined. The costs of the investment trust sector have been steadily rising. Some new issues absorb 4 to 5 per cent of the proceeds in expenses (close to the 5 per cent initial charge on a unit trust). Some savings schemes also pay 3 per cent commission to intermediaries, a charge which is passed to the investor. With markets at all-time highs, the fact that a trust is geared might concern cautious investors, as might the ability of trust shares to move to a wider discount. Take the example of a investment trust at a 5 per cent premium, and a unit trust with a 5 per cent initial charge. Although the bid-offer spread on the unit trust will be wider than 5 per cent, there will also be a bid-offer spread on the investment trust shares, plus stamp duty, and, if you do not buy via a savings scheme, brokers' commission. Unit trust annual charges tend to be higher on average, but it is possible to cherry pick. For example, Gartmore's UK Index fund, with no initial charge and a 0.5 per cent annual charge, might represent better value than some UK general investment trusts. In sectors such as emerging markets, a unit trust trading at asset value might represent better value than an investment trust at a double digit premium. (Although, for the moment, unit trusts are restricted in the markets where they can invest, so they might not be as genuinely 'emerging' as their investment trust rivals). There is no perfect answer to the issue of unit versus investment trusts. Much will depend on an individual's attitude to risk. Lewis Aaron of SG Warburg Securities points out that in a market fall, investment trusts, being closed-ended funds, will be able to sit tight, while unit trust managers will have to sell holdings to meet redemptions. A footnote to my piece last week on price-earnings ratios. Gerald Ashfield, who has been active in the investment trust industry since the 1940s, says that the ratio he follows most closely is the link between the earnings yield and the yield on irredeemable government stocks, such as War Loan. The earnings yield is calculated by dividing corporate earnings by share prices and is thus effectively the inverse of the price-earnings ratio. Ashfield argues that the ratio tends to average about 100, ie the two yields tend to be about the same level. At the moment, the ratio is 82 per cent (ie, the earnings yield is less than the return on irredeemables), a sign that shares are expensive. But the ratio is not as low as it was at the peak of the market in 1987, or in 1972.</p>

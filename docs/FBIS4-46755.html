			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Gribanov: "The Army of Kazakhstan: </F> Spring Escapes"]    [Text] Almost two years ago, during the period of the  creation of the Armed Forces of the republic, the views of many  military men boiled down to the belief that our country would  come to have one of the strongest armies in the Asia-Pacific  region. Indeed, Kazakhstan inherited the military districts of  the Soviet Union that were not the worst. Their geopolitical  situation made it imperative for the leaders of the USSR to  continuously monitor the combat readiness of the troops and to  equip them with the most up-to-date materiel.    Present-day judgments concerning the army of Kazakhstan are  conflicting--from unreserved recognition of its potential  advantages to sharply worded criticism of the government for  squandering the people's money to maintain "toy" troops.  Clarifying the real situation in the army turned out to be a  difficult affair. The endless red tape on the part of employees  of the press center of the Ministry of Defense who must ensure  liaison between the military and the press suddenly ran into the  impenetrable fence of military and state secrets.    Nonetheless, Major General Sabit Taulanov, chief of the  cadre  directorate of the military department, acknowledged that it is  premature to refer to high combat readiness on the part of the  army of Kazakhstan. However, in case of need, the residents of  Kazakhstan will be protected by ground forces, the Air Force,  the Air Defense Troops, and, strange as it may sound, the Navy.  This service, which is new for our republic, importunately  conjures up the children's joke about "a submarine on the  steppes of Kazakhstan" and for now is represented solely by the  Naval Department of the Ministry of Defense. Kazakhstan does not  have any submarines yet; however, there is hope that in the  future military vessels of the republic will ply the expanse of  the Caspian Sea.    In the opinion of General Taulanov, problems in the  republic's army began because of non-Kazakh officers leaving the  country. According to data from the Ministry of Defense, the  shortage of officers in the Army as of now comes to 30 percent.  However, according to data received through unofficial channels,  the actual cadre shortage exceeds 50 percent. It is no secret  that an overwhelming majority of officers who served on the soil  of Kazakhstan spoke Russian. They have been leaving for Ukraine,  Russia, and Belarus. Nobody is holding them back. Most of the  officers left because of beggarly pay and social and housing  problems which had gone unsolved for years.    The junior command echelon (from lieutenant to major) has  been particularly thinned out, that is, precisely those whose  duty it is to make new recruits into soldiers and directly lead  them. They are trying to fill the void by using the higher  military command school in Almaty, the only one in Kazakhstan.  It graduates 200-210 young officers a year. Only 53 persons from  the last class remained in the republic. The rest of the  non-Kazakh officers left for their native parts. Previously, the  school graduated only motorized infantry personnel; now, motor  vehicle, artillery, and tank personnel train next to them. In  the new school year, logistics and engineering cadets will be  added. In addition, the total number of those admitted to the  school will increase by a factor of two. Diversification is a  good thing, but unfortunately, under our conditions quantity  seldom turns into quality. The Ministry of Defense sees the  annual assignment of 450 residents of Kazakhstan for study at  the military schools of Russia as the next scenario for the  replenishment of the lost officer cadres. However, the  difficulty is that our cadets are frequently expelled from the  schools. It is likely that insufficient level of knowledge,  large distances from home, and complications in mutual relations  are factors. Besides, there are no guarantees that, having  become an officer, a cadet from Kazakhstan will not remain in  Russia to serve.    Following many years of oblivion, short military courses of  the "takeoff + landing = officer" kind have been resurrected in  our country. National Hero of Kazakhstan Sagadat Nurmagambetov,  minister of defense of our republic, began his military career  in similar courses during the war years. From the history of the  war we also remember how latter-day lieutenants led soldiers  into battle after two months of training, were the first to  perish, and left the rest on the ground.    A call-up of reserve officers who received their military  ranks simultaneously with college diplomas for a two-year stint  became the last trump card played by military officials. Some  1,500 "students," strictly civilians, ended up in the army. They  are reinforced by 700 volunteers from among reservists. However,  a majority of both groups do not have the necessary knowledge  and experience in operating materiel and commanding soldiers.    It is necessary to discuss the soldiers and sergeants of the  Kazakhstan Army. They will and do carry out the orders of their  officers. General Taulanov maintains that the troops have a 100  percent complement of enlisted men and sergeants, despite the  fact that in the last five years the authority of the Army has  been substantially undermined. Cases of evasion of service and  absence from units have been reduced to a minimum. To a great  degree, the fact that residents of Kazakhstan serve for the  entire 1.5 years only within the republic has contributed to  this. As far as "dedovshchina" [recruit abuse] is concerned, in  the opinion of the general, it afflicts "guys who are  unaccustomed to labor and do not wish to accomplish the assigned  tasks. This prompts fellow servicemen to physically influence  disobedient ones."    We believe that not everything is that simple within the  community of soldiers. Inductees begin to experience their first  problems in military commissariats during examinations by  medical commissions. Colonel Galim Aldamzharov, deputy military  commissar of Almaty and the capital city oblast, states that  according to the findings of physicians, one in three draftees  is unfit to serve. Their weight falls 20-25 kilograms short.  They are afflicted with intestinal disease, tuberculosis, and a  bunch of other conditions.    Employees of military medical commissions admit that they  are  pressured in certain military commissariats, and a certain  proportion of the "unfit" are put in the ranks of soldiers. It  is precisely of unhealthy soldiers that the first group of  escapees, deserters, and military criminals is comprised. The  second group consists of those who, according to the general, do  not wish to carry out commanders' orders. These guys are not  prepared for service either physically or morally. We cannot  help thinking of the system of school-based and pre-induction  training. It was also destroyed in the heat of "disarmament."  The third group consists of "martinets," the mainstay of  "dedovshchina," mainly sergeants and second-year servicemen.  They establish their own rules in view of the reluctance and  inability of officers to discharge their official  responsibilities.    According to data from a well-informed source, the number of  crimes committed by servicemen keeps growing. Based on the  totals for last year, in the capital city oblast alone more than  500 criminal cases were instituted, including those involving  particularly dangerous crimes. Some 320 servicemen left places  of service without official leave; 118 of them have already been  convicted, and the search is on for the rest.    The issue of omitting Article 232 of the Criminal Code  (absence without official leave) which draws up to two years of  disciplinary battalion for the escapee is being worked on.  Otherwise a good proportion of the Army would trade in barracks  for cells. A one-month disciplinary confinement to the  guardhouse is proposed as an alternative.    The combat readiness of all armies is judged not only on the  basis of the strength of troops but also on the results of army  exercises. In the two years of existence of the Kazakhstan Army  not a single large-scale exercise has been held. They have  restricted themselves to command post exercises, unit commander  training, and end-of-training performance evaluations. The  Ministry of Defense is inclined to associate this fact with  difficulties in forming the Armed Forces of the republic.  However, other reasons making it impossible to conduct such  exercises are also apparent. Between December 1991 and May 1992  a power vacuum prevailed in the former Union army. The Union no  longer existed, republic armies did not yet exist. In the words  of many military men, this period was sufficient for once  menacing districts to be stripped. Weapon depots were plundered,  elements of air defense and space surveillance systems were  removed. All drugs of any value were removed from the central  military hospital.    Of course, we cannot call the Army of Kazakhstan indigent  troops. It does have modern combat materiel. Under a military  treaty with Russia signed this year our Army will be able to  mitigate a weapons shortage. This is necessary and advantageous  for both sides. However, use of weapons needs to be learned.  Meanwhile, trainers are clearly in short supply.</p>

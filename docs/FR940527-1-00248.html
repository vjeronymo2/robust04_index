			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 2: Payments to Hospitals Serving a Large Share of Low-Income Patients <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Health Security Act would substantially reduce Medicare disproportionate share payments, as universal coverage ameliorates many of the problems these payments are intended to address. The Commission believes the timing of any such reduction in Medicare payments should be coordinated with the extension of universal coverage, so that hospitals that provide care to low-income populations are not disadvantaged. As a result, payments would be targeted more effectively to the hospitals that provide care to these populations. Even so, the payments received by different hospitals and the balance between payment levels for Medicare and other patients may be affected significantly. These changes should be structured to ensure that both the level and distribution of payments are appropriate. ProPAC intends to work with the Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to monitor and study this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Medicare DSH adjustment was implemented in 1986 to provide additional payments to PPS hospitals that treat a large share of indigent patients. Since then, the amount of DSH payments has grown rapidly, as Congress has increased the number of eligible hospitals and raised the adjustment for many. From fiscal year 1989 to fiscal year 1993, Medicare operating DSH payments grew from $1.1 billion (2.4 percent of all PPS payments) to $2.7 billion (4.1 percent of PPS payments). In addition, beginning in fiscal year 1992, hospitals received a DSH adjustment to their prospective capital payment amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analyses by the Congressional Budget Office, ProPAC, and others have shown that Medicare DSH payments far exceed any additional costs that might be associated with treating Medicare patients in disproportionate share hospitals. As a result, in the eighth year of PPS, the PPS margin for all disproportionate share hospitals was 1.6 percent, compared with ^7.2 percent for other hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bulk of Medicare DSH payments goes to hospitals that provide a large amount of uncompensated care and other services to the poor. This is often cited as a justification for the magnitude of the payments made under the Medicare DSH provision and the rules that govern how these payments are distributed. Disproportionate share hospitals_particularly those in inner cities_tend to have lower total margins than other hospitals. The Commission is concerned about whether, without Medicare DSH payments, Medicare beneficiaries and other populations would continue to have access to the services these hospitals provide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, ProPAC also is concerned about the ability to target Medicare DSH payments effectively to the hospital that need them most. Of all PPS hospitals, the 10 percent with the greatest uncompensated care losses relative to their total costs provided 28 percent of all uncompensated care (net of government subsidies); these hospitals received only 17 percent of all Medicare DSH payments. At the other end of the spectrum, the 10 percent of PPS hospitals with the smallest uncompensated care burdens provided almost no net uncompensated are, yet received almost 9 percent of all Medicare DSH payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Health Security Act eventually would eliminate almost all Medicare DSH payments, lowering Medicare hospital payments by an estimated $430 million in fiscal year 1996. Medicare DSH payments would be $4.8 billion lower than currently projected by fiscal year 2000, amounting to a 3.5 percent reduction in baseline Medicare payments. On the other hand, people who are now uninsured and those who are underinsured would begin to receive coverage. Consequently, hospitals now uncompensated for providing care to these patients would be paid for these services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospitals that serve low-income populations would still face some risk of financial losses, particularly in treating some noncitizens and other individuals who may be unable to meet their financial obligations to providers. To recognize the additional costs of treating low-income patients and to help hospitals furnish inpatient services to poor populations not covered by the standard benefit package, $800 million would be available in each of the first five years following passage of the Act. These funds would be distributed based on the share of total inpatient days accounted for by low-income patients at each eligible hospital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with many provisions of the Health Security Act, the impact of the reduction in Medicare DSH payments and the extent to which it is offset by universal coverage is difficult to estimate. In addition to the level of total hospital payments, the distribution of payments also may change significantly. The Commission is concerned by the magnitude of these changes and their potential effects on the availability of necessary services to Medicare beneficiaries and all Americans. In addition, if the timing of the reduction of DSH payments is not coordinated with the extension of universal coverage, hospitals that provide care to low-income populations may be adversely affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preliminary analysis indicates that the financial status of hospitals in the aggregate will depend largely on their ability to hold cost increases below historical rates. ProPAC will continue to examine the implications of health care reform for the distribution of payments. In addition, the technical appropriateness of the proposed changes in the rules that determine Medicate DSH payments will be investigated as part of the Commission's ongoing mandate to analyze, develop, and recommend improvements in Medicare payment for facility-based services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 3: Payments for Additional Patient Care Costs Incurred by Teaching Hospitals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC supports the explicit recognition by all payers of the higher patient care costs teaching institutions incur. The Commission believes such payments should be separated from patient are rates and paid through a fund similar to the Academic Health Center Account proposed in the Health Security Act. ProPAC is concerned, however, that a sharp reduction in the payments teaching hospitals receive from government payers may result in financial hardships for some of the nation's major hospitals. Constraints on payments from private payers may exacerbate this problem. Therefore, ProPAC recommends that the total level of funding and the formula for distributing payments through such a mechanism should be based on careful analysis of the costs teaching institutions incur in carrying out their functions and how these payments will affect graduate medical education and access to the care these facilities provide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Health Security Act proposes an Academic Health Center Account to support the patient are costs incurred routinely by teaching facilities but not by other institutions. Among these are the costs of reduced faculty productivity, uncompensated costs of clinical research, and higher costs associated with specialized treatment of exceptional cases. Contributions from Medicare and from the regional and corporate alliances would fund the account. The available funds would be distributed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the basis of a formula related to the proposed Medicare IME adjustment percentage for fiscal year 1996. Thus, payments for the additional patient care costs insured by teaching hospitals would be separated from payments for patient care services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

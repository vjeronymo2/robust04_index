			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> (2) contain a convincing minimum set of measures that all employers must implement to reach the target APO; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) provide that failure by the employer to meet the target APO will result in implementation of a regulation-specified, multi-measure contingency plan designed to meet the target APO; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) include financial penalties and/or compliance incentives for employers who fail to meet the target APO that are large enough to provide a significant prospective incentive for the employer to design and implement an effective compliance plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> An option can be used by itself or in combination with others. The proposed ECO regulation uses a combination of the first and the fourth program design options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In sum, the proposed ECO regulation meets the basic ECO program requirements. Consequently, the proposed ECO regulation may be adopted by a state or locality to meet the requirements of Section 182(d)(1)(B). A general discussion of its requirements is included below in section (c). The detailed proposed ECO regulation is included in this Federal Implementation Plan NPRM at 40 CFR 52.2999. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Employer and compliance plan requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed ECO regulation requires the following seven actions of employers: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> (1) register with EPA as an employer subject to the regulation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) designate an Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) at each work location; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) conduct an annual APO survey of its employees at each work location to determine employees' current commute patterns and report the results of the APO survey to the EPA; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) develop and submit to the EPA before March 1, 1997, 2 years from program inception, and in subsequent years as required by the regulation, trip reduction plans that describe activities to be implemented at the location under an ECO program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) implement the ECO program described in the approved trip reduction plan; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) no later than March 1, 1999, 4 years from program inception, increase the average passenger occupancy (APO) at each location by not less than 25 percent over the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) for Sacramento ECO program area; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) maintain the target APO upon achieving it. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> An employer failing to accomplish any or all of these actions would be in violation of the proposed ECO regulation and would be subject to penalties under section 113 of the Clean Air Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The required components of an employer's compliance plan are as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> (1) the name of the employer, address of the work location, and name, title, and signature of the Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) at the work location; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the results of the most recent APO survey and a description of the procedure used to conduct the APO survey; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) a description of the physical and transportation service characteristics of the work location, and demographic, work, and travel-related characteristics of the employee population; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) a description of ECO strategies currently implemented that provide commute alternative incentives to employees at the work location and additional ECO strategies the employer will implement at the work location; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) activities planned by the employer to implement the ECO program and a time schedule for implementation of the program; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) a description of the process by which the employer will periodically monitor and review progress toward the APO target. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Employer plans will be certified by a third party for completeness in order to reduce EPA's implementation burden. EPA will approve or disapprove plans. The Air Pollution Control Districts for the Sacramento nonattainment area will have the right of first refusal to certify plans of employers in their district. Should one or more APCDs decline the opportunity to certify employers, another organization or other organizations will be designated by EPA as plan certifiers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By March 1, 1999, all employers must submit either a maintenance plan describing either how the employer will maintain the target APO, or an update compliance plan describing what additional measures the employer will take to reach the APO target within one year. An employer's update compliance plan must discuss good faith efforts to achieve the target APO, provide an explanation of why the ECO strategies included in the last plan did not produce the target APO, and discuss how the update compliance plans will cause the employer to achieve the target within one year if the target has not been met by then as required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

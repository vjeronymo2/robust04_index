			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: When democracy called the tune - Andrew Clark reviews a troubled musical year in Europe It was the year when politics counted more than music. To survive the financial squeeze, to push through reform, or just to maintain the status quo, Europe's musical movers and shakers needed friends in high places more than ever before. In France, a sympathetic centre-right government was the sine qua non for Hugues Gall to adopt strong-arm tactics against Myung-Whun Chung, as he began flushing out the old Bastille regime and laying foundations for the new. Gall will need a superhuman dose of political guile in coming months if he is to cut through the Paris Opera's back-stabbing, unionised culture and give it a clean start next season. Alone among provincial opera companies, Lyons could shrug off the recession  -thanks to a culture-loving mayor. No other company north of the Alps saw its subsidy keep pace with inflation. And none could match Lyons's knack of picking up foreign tours and prestige recording work. At Aix-en-Provence, the very absence of political clout left one of Europe's long-established festivals struggling to survive. Mounting debts and declining artistic appeal - together with the French government's evident lack of sympathy - have knocked Aix out of the premier league of summer festivals. The situation was little different in Germany, where cultural shrinkage has become a fact of life. In Berlin, the Staatsoper's political connections, rather than artistic quality or good housekeeping, gave it the edge over the Deutsche Oper in their cut-throat battle for public funds. The Deutsche Oper's intendant, Gotz Friedrich, balanced his books and produced solid artistic results. At the Staatsoper, Daniel Barenboim's ambitious programme led to a huge overspend. But thanks to Barenboim's political influence, his company emerged at year-end with an increased subsidy for 1995 - leaving the Deutsche Oper with less. At Salzburg, Gerard Mortier scraped together enough support within the Austrian establishment to carry his festival reforms forward into 1995 - despite an antagonistic Viennese press. Buoyed by healthy box-office returns at the 1994 festival, the board of directors approved Mortier's commercially-risky plans for a bigger slice of 20th century music next summer. Their decision set the seal on Mortier's campaign for a livelier, more contemporary festival. He now seems certain to stay beyond 1997, when his current contract expires. Elsewhere in German-speaking Europe, musical life suffered where political will faltered. The city fathers in Bonn cancelled the triennial Beethoven Festival, robbing the composer's birthplace of its only musical event of international scale. In Frankfurt, the fractious governing coalition advocated self-help, leaving the arts in a permanent state of crisis. Basle persisted with its drastic scaling-down of cultural subsidy, undermining morale and vitality. And the Swiss government ended the year by slashing its contribution to the national cultural foundation, Pro Helvetia. 'Never has democracy been so hostile to the arts,' said a senior German orchestra manager last month. Amid the gloom, there were nuggets of comfort. Let us start with Sylvain Cambreling, who resisted the temptation to leave Frankfurt in disgust, and instead conducted much-praised performances of Pelleas The Ring and Don Giovanni. Matthias Bamert took some calculated risks at the Lucerne Festival, and widened its appeal. Thanks to Alfred Wopmann's canny stewardship these past ten years, the Bregenz Festival stood out as an example of how to mix art and commerce. Claudio Abbado brought his programme-making skills to the Berlin Philharmonic and to Salzburg at Easter. And the Prague State Opera sought inspiration in adversity, pulling off revivals of forgotten works by Hans Krasa and Gottfried von Einem. The biggest loser in 1994 was the Vienna Philharmonic, which found itself marginalised at Salzburg and criticised on foreign tours - partly because of its uninspiring choice of star conductors. The other prominent loser was Myung-Whun Chung: it will be interesting to see what value his record company places on him without his prestigious Bastille perch. And now for some awards, based on a personal end-of-year glance across musical Europe. Conductor of the year is Nikolaus Harnoncourt, whose blazing Beethoven cycle with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe set the 1994 Salzburg Festival on fire. Orchestra of the year is the Oslo Philharmonic, for refusing to bow to the cynicism and complacency widespread in the profession. Composer of the year: 91-year old Berthold Goldschmidt, who lived to enjoy his rehabilitation in Germany at this year's Berlin Festival. The most memorable instrumental performance was Miklos Perenyi's account of the Haydn D major cello concerto at Salzburg in August - a matchless display of old-world musicianship, entirely at the service of the composer. The most satisfying opera production I saw was Billy Budd at Geneva, conducted by Roderick Brydon and staged by Francesca Zambello: what a pity the same cast and conductor cannot accompany the production to Covent Garden in May. The outstanding individual performance was Robert Tear's Vere. The most promising young singers were Andrea Rost (Gilda in the Muti Rigoletto at La Scala), Rene Pape (Fasolt at Bayreuth) and Gwynne Geyer, the American soprano who has been singing Marenka and Mim in Geneva over the past six weeks. Flop of the year was the new Bayreuth Ring.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: Reluctant trustee of transition - Anand Panyarachun, Thailand's prime minister, speaks to Victor Mallet and Peter Ungphakorn Mr Anand Panyarachun, the suave, Cambridge-educated businessman, who this month became reluctant caretaker prime minister of Thailand for the second time in less than two years, has survived some remarkable ups and downs in his relations with the country's influential military establishment. Thais were surprised but relieved when he was appointed by the king on June 10 to resolve the crisis which followed the killing of at least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators last month. Sixteen years ago, as a senior diplomat responsible for negotiating the withdrawal of US forces from Thailand at the end of the Vietnam war, he was forced by the generals to undergo a humiliating investigation for alleged communist sympathies. He was cleared of the charges, but disillusioned. Two years later he quit the foreign service for the boardrooms of some of Thailand's biggest companies. It was not until last year that he came into close contact with the military again. Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, a deputy military attache under Mr Anand when he was ambassador in Washington, had risen to become head of the army, masterminded a coup d'etat and asked Mr Anand to lead the government until elections this March. To the surprise of many of his colleagues, the enigmatic Mr Anand accepted. He was praised at home and abroad for liberalising the economy with a torrent of legislation during his 14-month term of office, but stood down with no intention of returning to politics. Then Gen Suchinda became prime minister, the people of Bangkok took to the streets, troops fired on protesters, and Mr Anand replaced the general. Sitting in the ornate Government House where the prime minister has his offices, Mr Anand is philosophical - in fluent English - about this second accident of history. 'I have never been interested in political office and it doesn't conform with my character. I do not aspire to be a public figure. I lead a private life, a quiet life. I enjoy my family, my children, and having spent 23 years in the diplomatic service and nearly 15 years in the private sector, I thought I was entitled to some kind of less troublesome lifestyle.' It was not be. Mr Anand finds himself charged with three difficult tasks in the next few months: dealing with the generals responsible for the shootings in a way which will satisfy public opinion without provoking a dangerous response from the generals themselves; supervising fair elections in a country known for corrupt electoral practices; and restoring foreign and domestic confidence in an economy where the generals (and air chief marshals) have granted themselves lucrative sinecures to match their political influence. A process of political and military 'structural adjustment' will at least have started by the time he leaves, Mr Anand hopes. 'The objective is to try to lower the army profile,' he says. 'It is not aimed at destroying the institution or defaming the institution. I'd rather look at the positive side of the structural adjustment, in the sense that it will enhance the army's professionalism, enhance the effectiveness of their management and make them into a more efficient fighting force. 'In the past 60 years - and this is not really the fault of the army, I think it's the fault of the entire system in Thailand - somehow inadvertently we have acquiesced in the acquisition of this very high profile role of the army. We have to take moderate and gradual steps. We cannot just charge into a china shop and break everything, so if we can begin demilitarising the political process and decommercialising the armed forces, perhaps this is the direction that I'm aiming at. The generals are aware that for the first time their position is being seriously threatened by Thailand's rapid economic advances and the rise of the middle class professionals who formed the core of the demonstrators last month. 'Out of every crisis there are both positive and negative side-effects, and I think that there are many good people in the army establishment who are convinced that the year 1992 is different from the year 1960 or 1970. Mentally, they have already adjusted, but the structure of the army is such that open debate about their role, or about their power, is something which is alien to their culture. We must take that into account. We must strive not to make them feel that they are being cornered.' Mr Anand will have to use all his diplomatic skills in behind-the-scenes negotiations with the military, and he declined to be drawn on how he hoped to achieve his aims or on whether he was pressing for the resignations of senior military officials. Restoring confidence in the economy - still buoyant by international standards - will be easier. 'Well, I hope my name means something,' he says with a laugh. 'I think that the integrity of my previous cabinet and my present cabinet would go a long way to restoring confidence. I always believe that if the people at the top are not corrupt and are not even seen to be corrupt then that's going to be a natural curb on the corrupt tendencies of the bureaucrats.' Unable to formulate new legislation for the parliament about to be dissolved, Mr Anand intends in the short time available to entrench the economic reforms of his previous administration, including trade liberalisation, the establishment of a Securities and Exchange Commission to police financial markets and the introduction of value-added tax. Does that mean he wants to consolidate his policies before another government can mess things up? 'You said it,' he replies. 'Partly this is an indirect way of further opening the political system. If you have an open economic system, then the opening up of the political system is inevitable, so this is part and parcel of the process of structural adjustment.' Mr Anand recognises that Thailand's recurrent political problems owe as much to the inadequacies of the Thai parliamentary system as to the influence of the military. He is urging businessmen and other urban professionals to become involved in a political game which has been dominated by personal influence and patronage. He wants a poll as soon as is practicable - four months' time is the arbitrary deadline he has set himself - but he does not hold out great hopes for a clean election. 'Don't expect miracles, because we have toyed with the democratic process for 60 years and I only have four months to deal with the fundamental flaws, but I believe that it can be no worse than the last elections, so any improvement is already a plus. As Winston Churchill said, the democratic process is perhaps not the best system but it is the least evil.' In the same vein, Mr Anand rejects suggestions that his much-applauded unelected governments show the validity of the authoritarian political arguments of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's statesman, which are often quoted in Asia to justify undemocratic regimes. 'It's all wrong in a way, when you listen to all these foreigners comparing the May events in Thailand to the Tiananmen Square incident in China or when people try to compare my previous administration with Mr Lee Kuan Yew's style of management, because here we have unlimited freedom of the mass media - that was only interrupted during that fateful week (in May) - and on the whole this is something that I'm personally proud of. 'Mr Lee Kuan Yew's thesis is that development and stability must come before democracy. I do not got that far. But I would say that he is partially right, and in terms of Singapore society, who am I to say that it is not right for the Singaporeans? But Thailand is a different country in terms of the size of the land and the size of the population . . . I mean you can discipline 2m citizens but you cannot really discipline 56m to 57m people.' Does that make Mr Anand, who abolished labour unions in government enterprises in his first term, a democrat rather than an authoritarian? 'I know what I am and I think that most people in Thailand know what I am. I'm a liberal. I'm not a misguided liberal. I hope that they see me as an enlightened liberal, but not an en-lightened authoritarian. There is a vast difference in that.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1932 Born Bangkok.

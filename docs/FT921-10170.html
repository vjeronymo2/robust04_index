			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Croatians fall into line on UN peace plan CROATIA'S President Franjo Tudjman has dropped objections to the United Nations peace plan for Yugoslavia, the Security Council was told last night. Croatia had been insisting that UN troops be deployed in such a way that it would leave open the prospect of recovering the third of its territory now under the control of the federal army and Serb irregulars. Mr Thomas Pickering, the council's US president, said Mr Milan Babic, leader of the Serb-populated region of Krajina in Croatia, now was the only objector to the UN plan. He said Mr Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, felt the time was not ripe to deploy a large UN peace-keeping force, as proposed by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy. Mr Vance said he had received the Croatian leader's assurances after seeking clarification of a communication from Zagreb on Monday. He praised the 'most helpful' intervention of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, in bringing this about. The UN envoy repeated his belief that Germany had been premature in recognising independent Yugoslav republics. 'Given the extremely delicate situation which exists at this time, . . . I would think it very unwise for any further outside parties to disturb the present situation by recognising any of the republics.' Mr Vance said the federal government and army and other leaders were pressing Mr Babic hard to accept the UN plan. Asked about the possibility of sending in an interim UN peacekeeping force smaller than the 10,000 men envisaged, Mr Vance said it was too early to go ahead with other than a modest addition of 25 liaison officers to the 50 already there. Laura Silber in Belgrade adds: Lord Carrington, the European Community envoy, yesterday said the leaders of Bosnia-Hercegovina had agreed to hold an EC-brokered conference in an attempt to dilute rising nationalist tensions. After talks in Sarajevo, he said Slavic Moslem, Serb and Croat leaders had agreed to his proposal for a conference of the republic's main national groups before an independence referendum set for February 29 and March 1.</p>

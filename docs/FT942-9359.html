			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Delors denounces Bonn plan to curb EU law-making: Clarke backs move to bypass bureaucracy Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday launched a blistering attack on a German plan, strongly supported by Britain, to push for faster deregulation inside the European Union. His intervention reopened political divisions over the degree to which the EU should promote a more liberal labour market in order to strengthen competitiveness and tackle unemployment. But it also reflected fears in Brussels that Germany, the Union's most powerful member, may be tempted to challenge the Commission on industrial and social policy. Mr Delors made his attack at two meetings of EU finance and foreign ministers in Brussels. He singled out for criticism a German economics ministry initiative to create a taskforce of experts to root out unnecessary Euro-legislation. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said the proposals put forward by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, were an 'excellent idea'. British experience showed that the only way to make progress on deregulation was to bypass the bureaucracy, he said. 'President Delors is resisting this,' Mr Clarke said. 'He gave a splendid illustration of how bureaucracy will not reform its own procedures and is somewhat impervious to suggestions that we might make faster progress in relieving the burden on industry caused by excessive legislation.' Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, stressed that the Rexrodt plan should not be seen as signalling mistrust towards the Commission. Other German officials noted Mr Rexrodt's initiative was unveiled ahead of a German election campaign in which it was important to address the concerns of German Euro-sceptics. Other countries, notably Belgium and Portugal, warned that efforts to roll back Brussels' legislation risked damaging the European single market and the Commission's authority. France, whose rightwing coalition government is struggling to balance its commitment to privatisation and liberalisation without incurring higher unemployment, remained on the fence. Ironically, it was Mr Delors himself who propelled the debate over deregulation to centre stage with his request, a year ago, to prepare a discussion document on jobs, growth and competitiveness. The 12 heads of government endorsed the paper at the Brussels summit last December. The paper was more in favour of labour market deregulation than expected, but strongly defended the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, which seeks to preserve the influence of trade unions. Aides to Mr Delors stressed that the Commission president was not opposed to deregulation and pointed to his call yesterday for a 'big step' towards faster deregulation of the telecommunications market in Europe. But they added that the Commission president was concerned that the UK and Germany had 'hijacked' the message of labour market deregulation at the expense of the rest of the document. In particular, they pointed to its call for generous financing of so-called trans-European networks, huge, multi-billion dollar investments in road, rail, energy and telecommunications.

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Novo buoyed by acquisition WITH A significant contribution from the Walport acquisitions in the second half, Novo Group turned in Pounds 1.8m pre-tax for the year to March 31, compared with Pounds 728,000 adjusted for FRS 3. Novo provides storage and logistic services to the visual entertainment industry. Walport is regarded as the world leader in the distribution of rented video products to the merchant marine industry, and had begun to penetrate the airline market. Turnover rose to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 12.8m) and operating profit to Pounds 2.31m (Pounds 1.69m) of which Walport contributed Pounds 480,000. Net interest charges were cut to Pounds 401,000 (Pounds 612,000). Earnings per share, after a sharply higher tax charge and on increased capital under the rights issue, were 3.82p (2.95p). The proposed final dividend is 1p for a total of 1.3p (nil). Trading in the current year was in line with budget, said Mr Michael Woolley, chief executive. There were particularly good performances from some divisions. Although prices remained under pressure, margins had been maintained through controlling costs and overheads. Mr Elie Housman is giving up the chairmanship and Mr Richard Wevill will take over immediately. M Serge Desvignes comes in as a non-executive director; he is managing director of Com2i, a French investment fund holding 5 per cent of Novo.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> TOOTHPASTE LINKED TO ASTHMA  </P> <P> Asthma sufferers who find themselves wheezing and coughing might look to their  toothpaste as a possible cause of their problems, two doctors said last week.  An artificial mint flavoring found in a brand of toothpaste made from an opaque  paste instead of a gel apparently triggered breathing problems in a 21-year-old  woman with a history of asthma, according to a letter published in the New  England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Then, she switched toothpastes. She had been using Crest Tartar Control  toothpaste, "but when she switched to a gel-based toothpaste her wheezing  resolved dramatically," wrote Drs. Bruce Spurlock and Thomas Dailey of Kaiser  Permanente Medical Center in Santa Clara, Calif.  </P> <P> When the woman subsequently used any paste-based toothpaste, she started  wheezing again within 10 minutes, they said.  </P> <P> Terry Glover, spokeswoman for Procter and Gamble Co., the maker of Crest, said  she was unaware of any other cases in which toothpaste apparently induced  asthma symptoms.  </P></p>

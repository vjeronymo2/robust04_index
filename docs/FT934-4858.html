			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Mitterrand and Kohl in Gatt pledge France and Germany yesterday pledged themselves to make 'real efforts' to promote a compromise agreement in the Gatt trade negotiations in the coming days, insisting that both the European Union and the US had to make concessions. President Francois Mitterrand of France and Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl both agreed that compromise was essential, and that no country - meaning France - should be isolated in the negotiations. Speaking after the latest Franco-German summit meeting in Bonn, Mr Kohl warned that a deal was necessary, not only to guarantee the future of free world trade, but also for the future cohesion of the European Union. At the same time Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, repeated his insistence that an initial deal must be done by next Monday, to give him time to present it to the French national assembly. He also warned that any agreement must be unanimously accepted by the 12 members of the European Union: 'There is no question of any member state being isolated,' he said. 'If anything is isolated, it would be the European Union itself.' The words of both Mr Mitterrand and Mr Balladur suggested a willingness on the part of France to make concessions, provided the US government gave ground on the key questions of farm trade, films and television. 'We must keep on making real efforts to reach a compromise that will allow the signing of an international agreement,' Mr Mitterrand said at a press conference after the summit. 'We are ready to make these efforts, but we are not alone. This must include the US.' Mr Balladur said the Gatt negotiations amounted to the first great test for the European Union, after the Maastricht treaty came into effect. The union had to show it was capable of acting as a single international entity. The French premier, whose own political reputation is most at stake if the Gatt deal is rejected in France, said he needed 'eight to 10 days' after agreement on an initial text between European and US negotiators, to present the document to both the French president and the parliament. That would mean a deal by next Monday, to allow French approval by the US Congress deadline of December 15. On his return to Paris yesterday, Mr Balladur told parliament that there was still no progress on France's demands on a new world trade organisation, market access, agriculture, steel, culture, and textiles. He rebuked members of his own coalition who have urged him to show more courage in doing a Gatt deal, but hardly in terms that ruled out compromise. Mr Kohl was anxious not to make any statement which could be seen as interference in the heated French domestic political debate, but merely to stress the importance Germany still attaches to a deal. 'It is our common goal to ensure that Gatt reaches a positive conclusion,' he said. 'For this it is necessary that both sides, on this side and on the other side of the Atlantic, show they are capable of compromise.'</p>

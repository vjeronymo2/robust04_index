			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / MPs seek wider Budget debate MPS ARE considering plans to invite more open discussion of Budget proposals by publishing draft clauses of the legislation weeks ahead of the official announcement. The all-party Treasury and Civil Service committee, said yesterday that the idea of a 'budgetary green paper' will be among the issues it will consider ahead of the unified Budget in December. 'A great chunk of every finance bill is taken up with merely correcting mistakes of the past Budget,' said Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the committee. 'Obviously some things would have to be kept secret but much of the finance bill is about technical changes which involve no pecuniary advantage for anyone.' The committee will also consider the impact of the unified Budget - the Budget and Autumn Statement combined - on the timing of taxation decisions, the implications for Treasury forecasting, the timing of the financial year and the timing and progress through parliament of the finance bill, which implements the Budget proposals. In particular the committee will discuss what the December Budget means for the timing of the local authority financial settlement announcement. Mr Watts said MPs were worried that councils might receive very late notification of what resources were available to them, making it difficult to plan for the future. The UK's longer leading index, which indicates turning points in the economy about 11 months in advance, rose slightly in December. The Central Statistical Office said the rise was due to the reduction in interest rates since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Higher share prices and an improvement in business optimism also boosted the index. The shorter leading index, pinpointing turning-points about four months in advance, has also risen. This followed increases in new car registrations and the results of the Confederation of British Industry survey of new orders and expected changes in stocks of materials. The coincident index, which tracks the business cycle, has hesitated, according to the CSO, following its rise since spring 1992.</p>

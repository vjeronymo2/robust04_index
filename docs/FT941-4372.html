			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Leading Article: French disgrace The French government has caved in to pressure from Air France's unions. Its agreement to provide FFr20bn or more in fresh capital for a company which lost FFr7.5bn last year cannot be understood from a commercial perspective. A rational private investor would provide such sums only if there was a plan to stop the financial haemorrhaging fast. The flag-carrier's softly-softly approach does not constitute such a plan. The explanation for the hand-out is political. Mr Edouard Balladur is reaping the bitter rewards for appeasing the unions last November, when they brought France's airports to a halt in protest at an earlier restructuring plan. He followed a similar approach in dealing with rioting French fishermen. But it is not just French taxpayers who will pay the price of aid to Air France. The subsidies distort competition in the European Union's newly liberalised aviation market. The question is whether the European Commission will also cave in to political pressure and approve the hand-outs. The Commission's overall intention is clear: it would like to stop state aid. Brussels is battling against strong political interests at a time when its authority is weak. Although Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark are expected to urge it to be tough, other countries which plan to bail out their own financially stricken airlines could side with France. Moreover, the Commission may find itself impaled on its own doctrine that subsidies can be provided on a 'one time, last time' basis. In Air France's case, this is something of a misnomer. It has already received FFr7.3bn in four tranches since 1991 and the new hand-outs will be provided in three tranches. According to some calculations, that makes seven dollops of aid, not one. But Brussels may not see it that way. It mistakenly viewed the first set of tranches as normal financial transactions rather than subsidies and so, under the doctrine, Air France still has one last chance. It may be that the French government has decided to make the most of this last chance by agreeing to such a large capital injection. While it is probably unrealistic to expect the Commission to block all aid to Air France, it should reject the current plan. The carrier should be required to make deeper cuts, if necessary softening the blow with generous redundancy payments. Some way must also be found to limit the damage to Air France's rivals, for example by preventing the carrier from dumping subsidised seats on highly contested routes. The Commission may not have the stomach for a fight. But a failure to tackle the issue forcefully would badly undermine its overall state aid policy. While a hard line would provoke a war of words, in the end Mr Balladur might thank Brussels. The faster Air France is returned to viability, the sooner he can press ahead with plans to privatise the carrier.</p>

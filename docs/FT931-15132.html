			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: D Smith rises to Pounds 15m on back of French unit DAVID S SMITH, the paper and packaging group, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.2m for the half year ended October 31, against Pounds 3.1m previously, which was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 8.7m. Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said the contribution from Kaysersberg Packaging, the French company acquired for Pounds 154m at the end of last March, had more than offset the fall in profits in the UK paper division - which only broke even. UK packaging maintained profits, but the UK paper business had been hit by unfair competition from Germany, Mr Williams said. The group has lodged a complaint with the European Commission. Group turnover rose from Pounds 171m to Pounds 259m, with Kaysersberg chipping in Pounds 81.7m. Operating profits of Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 11.4m), included Pounds 11.9m from Kaysersberg, whose high margins offset a decline elsewhere. However, an interest charge of Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 400,000 credit) was all due to Kaysersberg. In the UK, conditions were the worst he had experienced. But Mr Williams was now more optimistic about a recovery in demand, with corrugated case material volumes up 7 per cent, allowing a small price increase. Redevelopment of the Kemsley mill was nearly complete and by the autumn it would be producing at an annual rate of 400,000 tonnes. Kemsley has been losing between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m a year. A labour dispute at the Abbey Corrugated sheet feeder plant cost more than Pounds 1m and volumes there had yet to be rebuilt. Mr John Miller, finance director, said that a high level of capital spending, Pounds 27.7m in the first half (Pounds 7.4m) and an expected Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m for the year (Pounds 21.7m), meant the group should pay no tax in the current year and a low charge for the next couple of years. Net debt of Pounds 95.1m (cash of Pounds 13.7m) at the end of the half year gave gearing of 43.9 per cent. However, fluctuations in the franc, in which most of the debt is denominated, could change gearing significantly. Earnings per share were 12.2p (3.4p after the exceptional charges) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.75p. COMMENT Smith's share price initially rose in reaction to the figures, but after the market considered the implications of a weaker continental market the shares fell back to close 1p lower at 314p. Forecasts were shaded back too, an all too familiar and depressing story with Smith. However, by comparison with the substantial losses being made in other parts of the paper industry Smith is doing well. There is still every hope of reasonable profits growth in coming years. Forecasts of about Pounds 28m (Pounds 24.1m before exceptionals) and no tax, give a prospective p/e of about 14, which gives nothing away.</p>

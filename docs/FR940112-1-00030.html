The sales price shall be equal to the sales price from comparable uncontrolled transactions determined in accordance with &sect;1.482&hyph;2(e)(2). If a sales price from comparable uncontrolled transactions cannot be determined in accordance with &sect;1.482&hyph;2(e)(2), then the taxpayer shall not be treated as having possession sales with respect to such leasing transaction. If the possession product is a component product or an end-product form, and there is a comparable uncontrolled price for the integrated product which includes the possession product, the combined taxable income with respect to the possession product shall be determined under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Q &amp; A. 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of this paragraph (b)(1). For purposes of determining the basis of a component product or an end-product form, the deemed sales price of such product must be determined. The deemed sales price of the component product shall be determined by multiplying the deemed sales price of the integrated product by a ratio, the numerator of which is the production costs of the component product and the denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated product. The deemed sales price of an end-product form shall be determined by multiplying the deemed sales price of the integrated product by a ratio, the numerator of which is the production costs of the end-product form and the denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated product. The definition of production costs with respect to the component product or end-product form shall be determined under the rules of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Q &amp; A. 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of this paragraph (b)(1). The full amount of income received under the lease shall be treated as income of (and taxed to) the U.S. affiliate and not the possessions corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. 11: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) The U.S. affiliate shall be treated, for purposes of computing its basis in such units, as if it had repurchased such units immediately following the deemed sale and at the deemed sales price as provided in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Q &amp; A. 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of this paragraph (b)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN OFFERS FINANCIAL AND NON-MILITARY ASSISTANCE IN GULF;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: BUT TOKYO REBUFFS U.S. REQUESTS FOR A NAVAL PRESENCE OR NON-COMBAT  MILITARY PERSONNEL.  </P> <P> After nearly a month of procrastination, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu  on Wednesday announced a carefully limited package of financial and other  non-military assistance for the international effort in response to Iraqi moves  in the Persian Gulf region.  </P> <P> Kaifu and his government rebuffed repeated U.S. requests for greater Japanese  participation in the current Mideast operations, such as a naval presence,  minesweepers, military airlifts or the dispatch of noncombatant military  personnel.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration reacted coolly to Japan's proposals, making it clear it  believes Kaifu's offer of help does not go far enough. Although Kaifu did not  specify how much Japan would spend on its plan, Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji  Sakamoto told reporters early today that Japan will offer $1 billion to  multinational forces in the Gulf.  </P> <P> Publicly, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler termed the Japanese  package "useful first steps" but said the Administration wants to talk to Japan  about "further steps and contributions."  </P> <P> Privately, some U.S. officials expressed their disappointment with Japan more  bluntly. "It's something, but we're the ones whose (lives) are on the line, and  they're getting 70% of their oil from the gulf," one Administration official  said. A State Department official said, "We want to see the Japanese flag there  (in the Persian Gulf)," and then added, "This is not what we had in mind."  </P> <P> Japanese government officials characterized the prime minister's announcement  as a significant "first step" in Japan's response to the Middle East crisis  because it established a legal framework for action.  </P> <P> Japan's postwar constitution -- adopted while the country was under American  occupation -- has a provision prohibiting the use of force to settle  international disputes. That provision has been interpreted to mean that  deployment in the gulf of even non-combat personnel from Japan's Self- Defense  Forces would be illegal.  </P> <P> Instead, Japan decided to "urgently dispatch" a team of about 100 medical  volunteers to the region; charter Japanese civilian aircraft and ships to carry  non-military supplies such as water, food and medicine, and provide equipment  to help protect allied troops from the desert heat.  </P> <P> "We sought every possible contribution we could make within the constraints of  the constitution," Kaifu said during a nationally televised news conference.  "We cannot take part militarily, but we have decided to do our utmost to help  maintain peace in the region in accordance with U.N. Security Council  resolutions."  </P> <P> The government also will pay for the chartering of non-Japanese aircraft and  ships to carry supplies and personnel to the gulf -- including foreign military  equipment and troops. Japanese airlines and seamen's unions had rejected the  idea of transporting war materiel.  </P> <P> Also, economic assistance of "significant magnitude" will be provided to  Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and possibly other gulf nations to help alleviate the  damaging effects of the U.N. blockade against Iraq. Japanese Foreign Minister  Taro Nakayama visited the region last week and heard requests for billions of  dollars in aid.  </P> <P> Kaifu said Japan would contribute an initial $10 million toward the relief  effort for refugees in Jordan.  </P> <P> Over the past four weeks, U.S. officials have conveyed expectations that Japan  would take a more visible role in the gulf. Michael J. Armacost, U.S.  ambassador to Japan, has taken an unusually vocal stand in the Japanese media,  asking that Japan "share the risk" as well as the financial cost, and warning  that U.S.-Japan relations may suffer if Americans see the response as  inadequate.  </P> <P> According to a State Department official, the Administration asked Japan to  help the United States in four ways. He said it asked Japan for some form of  naval presence in the Persian Gulf; for economic help to Mideast countries; for  help in the sea lift and airlift of American men, women and materials, and for  financial assistance for the U.S. military forces.  </P> <P> Of the four U.S. requests, Kaifu on Wednesday went along with two: economic  help and help for the air and sea lift. But a State Department official said  Japan's offer to provide two civilian aircraft and two ships for the  transportation effort "is far below our needs and far beyond Japan's  capabilities. . . . We'd like to see an increase in Japan's airlift and  sea-lift capacities."  </P> <P> Taizo Watanabe, chief spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, said late  Wednesday he understood the initial U.S. reaction was "positive" and that some  U.S. officials "said they were impressed with the list."  </P> <P> Watanabe compared the package to a "baby," saying that it may look small now  but it has the potential to grow in the future. He also said the government  took into consideration the likelihood that Asian neighbors -- victims of  Japanese wartime aggression -- would feel "uncomfortable" if a more ambitious  plan had been proposed.  </P> <P> "This is the first experience in our postwar history to contribute to working  for peace and stability in a region so far away from Japan," Watanabe said.  </P> <P> He said the measures were a "happy compromise" aimed at high visibility but in  an entirely non-military role -- and one that goes beyond merely paying for the  efforts of other nations.  </P> <P> Officials had considered a proposal to contribute indirectly toward the cost of  America's massive military deployment in Saudi Arabia by increasing the  host-nation support the government pays for U.S. troops based in Japan, but  that was not included in Kaifu's announcement. Watanabe said the idea of  increasing host-nation support predated the Iraqi invasion and was still under  study.  </P> <P> As part of a strategic plan to protect oil supplies, Japan adopted a highly  conciliatory posture in relations with Middle East nations after it was caught  off-guard in the oil shocks of the 1970s. It kept a polite distance from  Israel, opened a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization and  maintained friendly ties with both Iran and Iraq during the Gulf War.  </P> <P> After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Japan reluctantly followed the United  States and the European nations in imposing economic sanctions and boycotting  oil from those two countries. Like its allies, Japan had a large number of its  citizens working and living in Iraq and Kuwait. As of Wednesday night, there  were more than 400 Japanese being held against their will.  </P> <P> Schoenberger reported from Tokyo and Mann from Washington.  </P></p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Bottom of the barrel: The diverse effects of low oil prices The conflicting consequences of low oil prices are apparent in scenes being played out daily along US highways. Motorists are counting the savings from a slide in wholesale petrol prices to just 45 cents a gallon, the lowest in five years. But those travelling through the 'oil patch' - parts of the Midwest and Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and California - see another picture. Thousands of 'nodding donkeys' - the 'stripper' wells which produce a few barrels of oil a day - have long been a common sight in the region. But as world oil prices have fallen over the past year from about Dollars 20 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend to about Dollars 14 a barrel, hundreds of donkeys have stopped nodding - they have become uneconomic and inactive. Many more may soon be idle. The impact of falling prices on marginal US oil production is such that small US oil companies last month invoked national security concerns when they asked President Bill Clinton to limit oil imports. But the oilmen may get short shrift from an administration enjoying the macro-economic tonic of low oil prices. It is no surprise that consuming countries are winners from low oil prices while producers feel the pain. For the US, a big importer and a leading producer, the short-term benefits of low prices seem to outweigh longer-term damage to its declining oil industry. Lower prices are putting downward pressure on US inflation while economic growth is accelerating, thus helping to stave off higher interest rates. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development calculates the US is the biggest beneficiary among industrial countries of declining energy import prices, evident in improvements in its balance of payments. Japan, which imports 80 per cent of its energy requirements, will also make big balance of payments gains. But even a 30 per cent cut in oil prices over the past year may not be enough to kick-start the Japanese economy, suffering from 32 months of economic slowdown and a credit squeeze. The impact on the UK, a net exporter and big consumer of oil, seems positive. While export earnings will be hit, an average price of Dollars 14 a barrel for 1994 would knock half a percentage point off underlying inflation (the rate of increase in the retail price index, excluding mortgage interest payments), now at 2.5 per cent. This would have positive effects on headline inflation (which includes mortgage interest payments) and pay settlements, according to early projections by Mr Don Smith, UK economist at stockbrokers Midland Global Markets. But UK, continental and Japanese consumers may see few direct benefits. Dr Robert Mabro of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies estimates the retail price of US petrol falls by 7-8 per cent for every 10 per cent reduction in the oil price per barrel. The decline in the UK can be as low as  1/2 per cent because of automatic annual rises in petrol taxes. Other European governments are also reluctant to pass on the benefits. In Germany taxes on petrol went up by nearly 20 per cent this month. For many European consumers falling crude oil prices simply keep prices at the pump steady. On a sectoral level, energy-intensive industries, such as petrochemicals, fertilisers, road transport and airlines, have suffered in recent years, and low oil prices should soon feed through to higher cash flows, say energy economists. Big integrated oil companies - such as Exxon and Shell with operations in refining and retailing - will weather current conditions better than those specialising in exploration and production. 'The balance sheets of most oil companies are better than the producing countries', says one oil company economist. For his part, Dr Mabro notes that, unlike big oil companies, producing countries 'have lost a third of their revenues'. PetroStrategies, the energy newsletter, estimates that Opec members' revenues fell by 22.5 per cent in the final quarter of last year, and by about 10 per cent for the year as a whole. One of the most vulnerable members of Opec is Nigeria, whose oil production accounts for more than 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings. Receipts peaked at Dollars 25bn in 1980, but this year they will be about a quarter of that, while arrears on external debt of more than Dollars 31bn exceed Dollars 5bn. The outlook is also harsh for Iran: every dollar fall in the price of a barrel of oil means the loss of Dollars 1bn in receipts. The low price means Iran's oil revenues are unlikely to have exceeded a disappointing Dollars 13.5bn last year. Iran is also behind on servicing its foreign debt of about Dollars 30bn. But will prices fall to the point where the benefits to consuming countries are outweighed by instability among the main exporters? 'We all lost in 1990 with Iraq,' notes Dr Mabro, referring to the invasion of Kuwait triggered in part by Baghdad's fear of declining oil revenues. Ironically, the possible resumption of Iraqi oil exports is now one factor pushing prices lower. Traders reckon that the return on to the market of as much as 3.5m barrels a day of Iraqi oil, once United Nations sanctions against Baghdad are lifted, will maintain downward pressure on oil prices. Industry experts do not exclude the possibility of a temporary oil price fall to Dollars 10 a barrel or below, but expect longer-term prices to move upwards. Some fear they could settle in the Dollars 10-Dollars 15 range, rather than the Dollars 15-Dollars 20 band most producers say they need. The only country capable of pushing prices back to the latter levels is Saudi Arabia. Although it is putting a brave face on the impact of the fall in oil prices on its economy, there is deep anxiety in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia was warned by the International Monetary Fund last year that it risked longer-term damage to its economy if it did not address its budget and current account deficits. Since then the fall in oil prices has negated measures, such as big cuts in capital expenditure, the government drew up to correct the imbalances. With liquid foreign exchange reserves at a modest Dollars 7bn, the government may have to borrow substantially. The Saudi government insists it will not resume its role as Opec's swing producer - that is, as the member prepared to cut output to keep prices stable - as other producers nibble away at its market share. But some experts say only a dramatic cut in Opec production, with Saudi Arabia bearing perhaps most of the burden of a reduction as large as 1m barrels a day, could reverse the steep price decline. That would certainly signal that prices were on the way up again. It might even waken some sleeping donkeys. Additional reporting by Michael Holman and Roger Matthews</p>

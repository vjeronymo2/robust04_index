			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIOLOGIST'S LIFE HAS BEEN A STUDY IN CANDOR, CONCERN;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: KARLIN MARSH KNOWS ABOUT THE POLITICAL REALITIES OF LAND-USE. BUT  THAT HASN'T STIFLED HER VOICE ON SOME ISSUES.  </P> <P> Back when she wrote a series of textbooks for the then-new course of  environmental studies for Orange County's public schools, biologist Karlin  Marsh included a few chapters on community activism.  </P> <P> Fifteen years later, she says, those chapters seem a little naive.  </P> <P> "I've learned a lot in the intervening years," Marsh, 52, said wryly. "I've  learned a lot about science and I've learned a lot about politics."  </P> <P> For Marsh, a self-described "farm girl," those lessons have come from more than  a dozen years of work in the environmental trenches, working as a consultant to  some of the county's major developers and, more recently, to public agencies.  </P> <P> Marsh's down-home bluntness occasionally has thrust her into the center of  controversy.  </P> <P> Last month, for example, Marsh and two other biologists warned in a report that  a proposed 2,500-home development on the edge of O'Neill Regional Park would  jeopardize one of Southern California's richest natural habitats unless it were  moved several hundred feet farther from the park.  </P> <P> County land planners commissioned the report at a cost of $8,000 but never  formally presented it to the Planning Commission. A few weeks after the report  became public, the commission, upon the recommendation of its staff, approved  the proposed Las Flores Planned Community by a 5-0 vote.  </P> <P> Commissioners cited the county's overriding need for more affordable housing  and the Santa Margarita Co.'s pledge that 60% of the homes would sell for less  than $250,000, the average cost of a new house in the county. Santa Margarita  Co. executives had dismissed Marsh's report, noting that she had previously  gone on record against the project.  </P> <P> Marsh, a widely respected biologist who has worked as a consultant since the  late 1970s, previously declined comment on the Las Flores project. But she  discussed herreport and the county's response during an interview Monday.  </P> <P> Marsh, softly graying and given to folksy metaphors, said she was "disappointed  for the critters" in O'Neill Regional Park but was not surprised by the  commission's approval of the project.  </P> <P> "It takes a whole lot more energy and time and -- sometimes -- money to make a  difference in this county than I ever conceived of in the mid-'70s," Marsh  said. "It's not easy for Joe Blow on Elm Street to make a difference anymore or  even for very well organized environmental groups to make a difference. . . .  </P> <P> "I think Las Flores was a good example. Here you had some of the best field  biologists in the area saying, 'Hey, there (are) problems here that need to be  considered.' "  </P> <P> The project still needs to be approved by the Board of Supervisors, which is  scheduled to take up the proposal at its Dec. 5 meeting.  </P> <P> Marsh, who says she practices what she preaches, works out of her home, made of  natural wood siding and set down into the hillside at the end of an unmarked  dirt road in Silverado Canyon. Her office, at the top of her three-story home,  rests above a canopy of oak trees.  </P> <P> A creek with tiny rainbow trout gurgles about 100 feet from the house. From her  window, she's far more likely to spot a chickadee than a fellow human. Her  husband, Gordon Marsh, curator of UC Irvine's Museum of Systematic Biology,  shares her love of nature and is likely to be seen roaming the grounds of their  home in the late afternoon, sometimes in search of insects, which he collects.  </P> <P> Her two children from a previous marriage, a son and a daughter, are grown and  live in Louisiana.  </P> <P> Marsh is a transplant from West Virginia, the daughter of an engineer who  raised his family on a sheep farm because his wife was uncomfortable with  crowds.  </P> <P> Marsh graduated from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., and did some  postgraduate work at the University of Pittsburgh. She came to California from  West Virginia with her former husband, who was transferred here in the late  1960s. She worked as a nature guide in Orange County parks and as an  environmental education teacher in the county's public school system until the  mid-1970s, when the first stirring of the environmental movement began.  </P> <P> Nathaniel Lamm, the school system's administrator of environmental education,  recalled the public's heightened interest in teaching youngsters about the  environment, but he noted the county's dearth of reference materials. Lamm  turned to Marsh, whom he had met several years earlier while she was working  for one of the county's nature conservancies and who seemed a natural for the  job.  </P> <P> "We didn't really have a good reference point. That's where Karlin came about,"  Lamm recalled. "She is one of those rare individuals who can take something  very technical and make it understandable. . . . She's very much in demand."  </P> <P> Marsh eventually wrote three volumes, reprinted numerous times, that until a  few years ago remained the principal reference books for environmental  education in the county's schools at the elementary and junior high school  levels.  </P> <P> The first book provides an overview of the county's biological communities, the  second provides a more detailed look at the county's coastal wetlands and  mountain habitats, and the third looks at the effect of development and  urbanization on the county's wildlife, Marsh said.  </P> <P> At the time Marsh was asked to write the reference, she was already bored with  teaching and eager for a new challenge.  </P> <P> "You can only give so many nature walks to little snappers," she quipped. "I  figured there must be something more out there."  </P></p>

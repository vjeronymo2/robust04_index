			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Serious blow to bonds market THE market in European government bonds thrived last year on almost one word  -convergence. Dealers and investors piled into high-yielding bonds, hoping to benefit from falling inflation and lower interest rates as the high-yielding markets converged with those in Germany. But Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty is a serious blow to such convergence trades. The European government bond markets were driven upwards in 1991 largely by the convergence argument, and immediately after the Maastricht summit, they rallied strongly. Investors were eager to put funds into the high-yielding bond markets - such as those of Spain, Italy and Portugal - in the hope of making substantial capital gains as interest rates came down. However, while many of the market participants were committed to convergence, the European bond markets saw less scope for convergence in much of 1992 for two main reasons - worries about German inflation (and hence the level of German interest rates), and the uncertainty about a change of government in the run-up to the British general election. Economists point out that, following the Danish referendum, convergence trades will cease until the bond markets have a clearer picture of what happens to Maastricht. 'Obviously the situation is one in which those markets which have been most dependent on the convergence argument are facing the most problems,' says Mr Peter Fellner, UK financial analyst at NatWest Capital Markets. 'But we don't know yet what is going to replace Maastricht.' Economists expect to see some 'de-convergence' of yields now - in other words yield spreads over German government bonds are likely to widen, rather than narrow. Mr Brian Martin, economist at Yamaichi International in London, says: 'Until we get a clearer picture, convergence in the European government bonds will not go ahead and markets relative to bunds (German government bonds) will underperform.' However, he points out that one of the factors which will now hold back the bond markets is the prospect of a realignment in the European monetary system's exchange rate mechanism. While an immediate realignment is not expected, the markets may start to worry about the prospect of a realignment in the longer term.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Kuwaiti stock fund targets foreigners A FUND giving foreigners other than Gulf Arabs their first chance to invest in the Kuwaiti stock market is shortly to be launched, Reuter reports from Kuwait City. A prospectus for the KD25m (Dollars 82m) First Investment fund is to be issued by Kuwait Foreign Trading Contracting and Investment. The emirate's exchange is enjoying a modest revival following agreement on a mechanism for solving a Dollars 19bn bad debt problem. An unofficial index published by the al-Shall economic consultancy puts share prices 9 per cent above their level on the eve of Iraqi's invasion in August 1990. Minimum participation would be 10 units out of a total 2.5m units available, with a nominal price of 10 dinars a unit. The launch of the fund is in line with privatisation plans announced last year to sell off the government's stakes in 66 local companies.</p>

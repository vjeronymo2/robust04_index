			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Arnotts posts 16% rise to ADollars 44m at halfway stage Arnotts, the Australian biscuits, snacks and confectionery company now majority-owned by Campbell Soup of the US, yesterday reported a 16.6 per cent increase in after-tax profits before abnormal items, in the six months to the end of December, to ADollars 44.2m (USDollars 31.5m), and said it was confident of meeting its full-year forecast of ADollars 80.9m. There were no abnormal charges in the latest half-year, but the first half of 1992-93 included a ADollars 15.8m surplus, taking the group's net operating profits for that period to ADollars 53.8m after abnormals. Yesterday, Mr Paul Bourke, Arnotts managing director, admitted that underlying sales advances had been extremely difficult to achieve during the six months. Arnotts' total sales fell from ADollars 344.8m to ADollars 332.8m, although Mr Bourke said that if asset disposals were excluded, there was a small 1.3 per cent increase. The underlying increase in volumes was just 0.9 per cent. Overall, sales for the core Australian biscuit division were similar to the corresponding period a year ago, but Arnotts said that the contribution for the newly-launched snack products range had been 'lower than anticipated'. Mr Bourke also conceded that lower media spending had helped the profits increase. He said Arnotts' planned move in Asian markets was progressing, with discussions under way which could lead to biscuits being manufactured in southern China within a year to 18 months.</p>

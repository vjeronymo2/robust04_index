			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / People: Rustic at Cable &amp; Wireless The new director of corporate finance at Cable &amp; Wireless, Richard Wainright-Lee, is a firm countryside man from his higher education - agriculture and economics studies in 1971 - to his determination to live in what he describes as a 'rustic Hertfordshire hamlet'. With Barclays for 20 years, working in France and South Africa as well as the UK, he joined C &amp; W in 1991 to develop the role of industry marketing within the business networks division. Reporting to Rod Olsen, executive director, finance, on the group's main board, Wainright-Lee terms himself an 'enthusiastic part-time sheep farmer and gamekeeper' who is - usefully enough, given his new position - 'intrigued by the implementation of innovation'.</p>

The group's talks are being coordinated by  Dumitru Popescu, the minister of industry.    Our correspondents have informed us that so far the press  has  not been permitted access to the talks.    The demonstrators, who this afternoon have been in the  square  of the Gorj Prefect's Office, continue to wait in a tense  atmosphere for the results of the negotiations held at the  Ministry of Industry.    According to our correspondent's reports, a new element came  up after 1300. Mr. Virgil Magureanu, the director of the  Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] addressed the miners for a  few minutes at the microphone installed at the entrance of the  Targu Jiu Brown Coal Autonomous Public Corporation. He  mentioned that he has learned from Miron Cosma [leader of  Romania's Mining Trade Union Confederation] about their claims  and that all of them should display patience. Mr. Virgil  Magureanu said that in the next few days, an investigation will  be carried out in connection with the accusations against the  Administration Council of the Brown Coal Public Corporation and  the results of the investigation will be made public. The  demonstrators did not agree with this delay.</p>

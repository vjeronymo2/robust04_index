			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODMAN ON BARNEY FRANK  </P> <P> As an ordinary citizen, I am insulted and outraged by the remarks in Morton  Kondracke's column ("Lynch Mob Should Quit, Not Barney," Op-Ed Page, Sept. 25)  about the virtues of Barney Frank, whom he described as a "national treasure  that should be preserved."  </P> <P> This esteemed congressman solicited, paid, used and harbored a male prostitute.  </P> <P> Most people would be jailed for this kind of activity, but instead Rep. Frank  is extolled and defended by a columnist in The Times as if he were  indispensable to Congress.  </P> <P> If Frank is a "national treasure," then the legislative branch is in Chapter  11.  </P> <P> S.W. RETCHIN  </P> <P> La Quinta  </P></p>

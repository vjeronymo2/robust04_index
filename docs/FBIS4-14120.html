			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 27 (AFP)--The PLO will seek the help of  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to press Israel to  change its stance to the remaining hurdles in the self-rule  talks, a senior Palestinian official said Wednesday [27 April].    Faysal al-Husayni told reporters the Palestinian delegation  here would inform Christopher of some of the issues obstructing  the launch of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip  and the West Bank town of Jericho.    Christopher is expected here later Wednesday, after arriving  in Riyadh earlier on the first leg of a Middle East tour  designed to give fresh impetus to the peace process.    He would be told of the difficulties "so that he can try to  convince the Israelis to change" some of their positions,  al-Husayni.    Israeli and PLO delegations resumed their talks here  Wednesday to try to iron out the remaining differences to seal  an accord to launch self-rule.    Al-Husayni, who is the main PLO leader in the occupied  territories, said although the issue of jurisdiction in the  territories remained "the main obstacle" there had been a  breakthrough.    He said both sides had agreed that the Israeli military  controlling the three lateral roads linking Israel to the  settlements in Gaza would have the right to question non-Israeli  and non-Palestinian foreigners.    If the visitors were accused of a serious crime, then they  would be handed over to Palestinian authorities, al-Husayni said.    But the two sides still disagree on who should have the  right  to try a Palestinian who attacked a settler, he said, adding he  was not taking part in the talks.    He insisted the future Palestinian authorities should be  given "full powers," saying incomplete powers would reduce their  ability "to provide total security," in Gaza, where Jewish  settlements will remain, and in Jericho.    Meanwhile in Jerusalem Palestinian leaders said they would  urge Christopher to press Israel to ease its restrictions on the  territories.    Sa'ib Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the  Middle East peace talks in Washington, said the situation in the  territories and the continued Israeli settlement would be "the  main subject on the agenda" at a meeting planned with  Christopher in East Jerusalem on Friday.    Christopher is expected to travel to Israel from Egypt on  Thursday for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  Friday before heading to Syria on Saturday.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said on Tuesday it  was  "not impossible" that he would meet with PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat on Thursday in Cairo, but it depended on how the talks  progressed.    Arafat is expected here Wednesday overnight, an Egyptian  official said.</p>

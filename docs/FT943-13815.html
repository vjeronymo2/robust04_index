			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Fujitsu lines up trials across a range of services Fujitsu, the computer and telecommunications manufacturer, plans to start trials of what it claims will be Japan's first comprehensive multimedia services. In December, it will launch trial services such as near video-on-demand, games and karaoke software delivery, local community information services and telephone, facsimile and PC communications services. It will do so in co-operation with five Japanese CATV companies in which it owns equity stakes. The aim of the trials is to evaluate what kinds of services consumers want, how much they would be willing to pay for such services and how such services can be made to become viable businesses, says Fujitsu. While the company has recently been putting emphasis on its service businesses, the latest venture takes it into new territory. Fujitsu, which has one of the most well-defined strategies for multimedia among Japanese electronics manufacturers, says it hopes to use the trial to gain experience in the management of urban CATV companies. The increased involvement in cable TV management and in rolling out multimedia services through cable TV would also support the hardware business of the company. Fujitsu is a significant manufacturer of much of the equipment that goes into providing multimedia services, from central computers that control the systems, to transmission equipment and PCs, which could act as the home terminals. However, if the trials lead to a fully-fledged multimedia service, it could put Fujitsu in direct competition with NTT, the telecommunications company which has scheduled its own multimedia trials and which is a major customer of Fujitsu. For the trial services, Fujitsu plans to use equipment that already exists at the studios of the co-operating CATV companies, with additional equipment introduced as necessary. The company stresses though that it plans to use the best equipment available, regardless of manufacturer. Near video-on-demand will be provided by using several channels with staggered starting times for programs. These will be shown simultaneously across a number of channels. Video games and other information software can be offered through repeated transmission for users to download as desired on home terminals. The trial services will be available to up to 1,000 subscribers to cable TV during an evaluation period of between 6 months and a year. If these trials prove successful, Fujitsu says it will launch a second phase of trial services in which it will offer full video-on-demand.</p>

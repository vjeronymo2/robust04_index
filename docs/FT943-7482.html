			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Bank raids The British may fall short of the Americans in the degree of hostility they show towards the banks, but the politics of knocking the UK financial community is no less crude for that. In the case of the Tories, the deed is usually done in the name of fiscal expediency. The arbitrary levy on non-interest bearing bank deposits in 1982 was an opportunistic response to the coincidence of distressed public finances and high banking profits. The more recent adverse change in the tax treatment of pension fund dividend receipts came at a time of high dividend payouts and an unprecedentedly high public sector borrowing requirement. With Labour, populism tends to be the beginning and end of it; and it is hard to see any broader rationale in the interest shown by the Labour shadow chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, in attacking bank charges. True, fee income has gone up as the banks have sought to compensate for the decline in profitability of their core lending business. Yet most personal customers - and that is where the political sensitivity lies - are enjoying an astonishingly good deal from the banks. For the 80 per cent who do not run an overdraft, current account services, including the hugely expensive payments system, come largely free. Not that the banks are happy with that. Such is the competition in this area that whenever one of the clearers tries to eliminate the cross-subsidy to customers in credit, another can be relied on to give free-if-in-credit banking a new lease of life. That has now extended to offering interest on current account balances. A more interesting question arises in the case of the minority who borrow. Many face overdraft rates of more than 19 per cent, while the rates on small personal loans and credit cards are well over 20 per cent. With the headline rate of inflation down to 2.3 per cent this is a swingeing levy in real terms. Yet attempts at price cutting by individual banks have had little impact. This raises interesting questions about the nature of banking competition. Interesting, but not crude enough for the political mill. The banks behaved insensitively in the recession; they now have a short-term bonanza; ergo, they must be bashed. So there.</p>

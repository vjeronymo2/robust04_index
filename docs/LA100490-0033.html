			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: IT'S WISE TO DO ALL ESTATE PLANNING EARLY  </P> <P> Estate planning is an often overlooked obligation that if neglected can wreak  havoc with family members left behind.  </P> <P> Thomas E. Stindt, a Woodland Hills lawyer and frequent correspondent to Legal  View, shared his frustration about several neglectful clients in a letter  earlier this year:  </P> <P> "The accumulation of property over a lifetime of work and saving, and the  growth of investments or a family business all involve a responsibility, and it  is one which is frequently overlooked. That responsibility is to a spouse,  partner, child or close relative, and it is a responsibility to not leave for  someone else to sort through and straighten out an entangled mess of jumbled  titles, property holdings, and half-completed transactions.  </P> <P> "Why do people of substantial accomplishment wait until a spouse is unable to  sign deeds or even give medical consents or instructions, then feel unfairly  put upon by the system?" he wrote. "A health care power, a trust, a durable  power, any number of (legal) devices could save family members thousands of  dollars of expense and weeks of delay."  </P> <P> I couldn't have said it better.  </P> <P> The first step in any estate planning is to thoroughly understand your own  financial situation and the available legal options, many of which have been  mentioned in this column in the past. That may require some time and effort on  your part. Buying one of the many good books available on estate planning and  talking to friends who have already consulted estate planning lawyers are good  initial steps. If your estate is simple, you may find the fill-in-the-blanks  will form described in last week's column best for you.  </P> <P> However, depending upon the complexity of your financial position, you may need  personalized legal counsel.  </P> <P> But be a smart legal consumer. Come prepared. Understand what your lawyer is  talking about when he or she refers to a trust, a durable power or a health  care power.  </P> <P> To start you on your way, let me explain briefly a few of the devices Stindt  mentioned. The durable power of attorney allows you to appoint someone else to  handle your financial affairs, even if you become incapacitated.  </P> <P> This allows you to avoid the expense and inconvenience of a court  conservatorship proceeding. The court won't have to select someone to act on  your behalf, because you will have already done so. "The Power of Attorney  Book," written by Denis Clifford and published by Nolo Press, includes tear-out  forms.  </P> <P> A separate issue from your financial affairs is health care decisions. Who  makes them if you are incapacitated?  </P> <P> There is another legal document, called a durable power of attorney for health  care, that allows you to designate a person as your agent to make decisions  about surgical procedures, life support equipment and other health care choices  that you are unable to make.  </P> <P> The California Medical Assn. has published a form and explanatory booklet. For  a copy, send $1.50 plus area sales tax to Sutter Publications, P. O. Box 7690,  San Francisco, 94120-7690, telephone (415) 882-5175.  </P> <P> One other planning option Stindt mentioned is a trust. The most common one is  known as a living trust. A trust is a legal entity into which you can transfer  your assets.  </P> <P> The trust owns the assets, not you, but you control the trust by appointing  yourself as trustee. After your death, the person you select as the successor  trustee takes over control of the trust, and follows your instructions in the  trust document. You avoid probate, but trusts are not a panacea. They don't  save taxes, and they do require paperwork.  </P> <P> One problem Stindt has noticed with clients who have established living trusts  is that they forget to fund them. It's not enough to create a trust document,  which is commonly done by an attorney.  </P> <P> Then you must make sure that you or your lawyer complete the paperwork to make  the trust the legal owner of your property, for example, by changing the title  to your home or bank accounts to reflect the trust ownership. If you don't do  that, the property won't be subject to the instructions in your trust and will  be subject to probate.  </P> <P> For example, if property is listed as owned by two joint tenants, it won't  matter what the trust says, the surviving joint tenant will inherit the  property.  </P> <P> "If Uncle Mort is to get his brother's half interest in the deli," explains  Stindt, "and is relying on the trust which says so to make this happen, it  won't work out that way if the brother and his wife hold title to the deli as  joint tenants."  </P> <P> And Uncle Mort wouldn't be too happy.  </P></p>

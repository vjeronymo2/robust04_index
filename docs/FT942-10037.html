			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bigger is not necessarily better - Enterprise's bid for Lasmo When Mr Graham Hearne, chief executive of Enterprise Oil, justified his hostile bid for fellow explorer Lasmo by describing oil exploration as a big boys game which required critical mass, he triggered off a chorus of criticism. Analysts accused him of seeking size for its own sake, and pointed to the many big discoveries made by small oil companies. Many industry executives said what mattered most was the way in which companies handled their existing assets. However Mr Hearne's comments have brought to the surface an issue which bedevils an industry in which corporate minnows co-exist alongside the big integrated majors. 'There is a very great debate on whether size is an important issue,' said Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum. Mr Hearne said he never intended to convey the impression that Enterprise was interested in size for its own sake. But he stands by the argument that critical mass makes good industrial sense and that Enterprise, the largest UK independent, needs to be of a 'size we feel necessary to deliver shareholder value'. Lasmo's defence document rebutting this argument has to be published by Monday but it is widely expected to be out before the weekend. The size argument has not found many supporters among Mr Hearne's industry colleagues. 'I think that aspect of Enterprise's argument is total rubbish,' said one executive. 'There have always been niches for different sizes of players and different skills.' Many in the industry believe the proposed deal is driven more by financial issues than industrial logic. They point out that neither company operates many of their main projects, so there is little scope for greater production efficiency. The commercial argument, that cash-rich Enterprise is short of medium-term development prospects while cash-strapped Lasmo may not be able to fund all its potential projects, is somewhat stronger, according to analysts. They note that revenues from Lasmo developments such as the Liverpool Bay gas project would smooth out an expected dip in Enterprise's production and cash flow later this decade as output falls from the Nelson and Scott fields. Many industry observers believe, however, that Enterprise's need to keep growing its dividend is one of the most compelling reasons for the deal. Smaller independents are relieved of that pressure. They have always been seen as North Sea-based capital growth stocks, the price of which could soar on the back of just one strike. Enterprise, however, is 'too large to be regarded as an asset play,' said one independent executive. He added that it was judged more on its dividend paying capacity in much the same way as an integrated oil major. In fact, a combined Lasmo and Enterprise would rival in size the exploration and production arms of some of the integrated oil majors but without the benefits of being a diversified group with downstream activities. 'There is a lot of pressure to pay dividends, and investors want it to go up each year,' the head of a rival independent company said. But to carry on paying, companies need to find oil fields, either through exploration or acquisition, or have the support of diversified downstream operations. Some in the industry feel that Mr Hearne has compounded his problems by choosing to focus on upstream exploration and production. 'Most other large companies have some sort of vertical integration so they can ride out the storms of the oil price by making money at the petrol pump,' said the managing director of a UK independent. Some analysts also argue that Enterprise could have realised its upstream ambitions by simply buying packages of assets, thus avoiding a costly takeover battle. Completed asset disposals in the UK North Sea alone have totalled Dollars 1bn since the beginning of 1993, according to analysts at Kleinwort Benson, and brokers say there is no shortage of assets for sale. Buying packages of assets might have been more warmly greeted in the City, but it would also have taken Enterprise much longer to achieve a similar spread of business. In addition Enterprise says the Lasmo portfolio fits particularly well with its own. Many in the industry understand the pressures which have forced the hostile bid. Yet they still question the wisdom of a move which would force a whole new range of problems, such as the fact that big oil companies need to make big discoveries. The chances of making discoveries adequate to replenish reserves fall dramatically as the companies get bigger, as the graph shows. 'Lasmo might make Enterprise a stronger company . . . but it does not answer the fundamental question of what to do afterwards. The challenge to replace such large reserves with reserves of equal quality is an even greater one,' said one sceptical executive. The only way off the dividend treadmill is to shrink the company by selling assets. 'Every oil exploration company has to shrink at times,' says one executive. Companies such as Exxon and BP have succeeded in downsizing, but the task of persuading shareholders that such a move can be in their interests is not easy, he added. 'Investors don't understand downsizing, even though the only time you make money is when you sell.'</p>

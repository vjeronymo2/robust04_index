			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg awaits budget Stocks in Johannesburg fell sharply, in line with other markets, and ahead of the new government's first national budget tomorrow. The firmer financial rand also depressed equity prices. Gold's inability to hold a Dollars 392 an ounce high and its subsequent dip below Dollars 390 took the steam out of the golds sector, although shares still managed to end higher on the day. The overall index fell 73 to 5,712 and industrials lost 109 at 6,621. Golds gained 30 at 2,227 after touching 2,273. Anglos came under pressure, shedding R8.50 to R234. De Beers fell R3.25 to R112.75.</p>

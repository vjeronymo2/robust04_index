			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Broad welcome for move on Trident GOVERNMENT plans to restrict the size of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent were broadly welcomed by MPs yesterday although some senior Tories were more cautious, David Owen writes. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the defence select committee, said Trident was a 'sane' place to look for defence savings. But he said the move left questions about the number of missiles and warheads the armed forces would have in reserve and on how easily the policy could be reversed. Labour welcomed the move, which it said it had been advocating for the last four years. Mr Menzies Campbell, for the Liberal Democrats, said it showed 'some belated commonsense'. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will today announce the new policy, under which the UK is to commit itself to deploying a total explosive power no greater than the present generation of Polaris ballistic missile submarines.</p>

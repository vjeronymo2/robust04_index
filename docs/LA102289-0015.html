			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF  </P> <P> Children tend to regard nonfiction books as spinach or lima beans. They may be  good for you, but they're hard going down.  </P> <P> Too often the children are right. Although the nonfiction written for them may  be as full of significant facts as spinach is of vitamins, frequently the books  are dry, boring and unappetizing.  </P> <P> In the right hands, though, nonfiction for children can be as riveting and  dramatic as any storybook or novel.  </P> <P> Take Aliki's The King's Day: Louis XIV of France (Thomas Y. Crowell: $13.95; 32  pp.), a picture book aimed for 7 to 11-year-olds. The author-illustrator  examines life in 17th-Century France by following the brilliant and pampered  Sun King during a typical day at Versailles. While the facts may be true, the  story reads like a fairy tale. "Louis XIV was every inch a king," begins Aliki.  "He wore the curliest wigs, the richest robes, the rarest jewels, and the  fanciest shoes in all of France." The rituals of Louis' court are as  fascinating as the king's extravagance, which Aliki captures in her charming  drawings -- full of plumes and buttons and lace. Like all good fairy tales, the  book even has an implicit moral: It is better to be a king than a courtier.  </P> <P> The California Gold Rush of 1848-1852 is another historical period in which  life was as colorful and mythical as fiction. Rhoda Blumberg, an award-winning  author of history books for children, brings this subject to vivid life in The  Great American Gold Rush (Bradbury Press: $16.95; 144 pp.). During the Gold  Rush, the 19th-Century equivalent of today's lottery, argonauts dug up a  quarter of a billion dollars of gold. Like those who play the lottery, though,  most wound up with only hard-luck stories for their efforts.  </P> <P> Blumberg quotes from the letter of one disappointed miner: "Say to all my  friends: Stay at home. Tell my enemies to come." The author describes the many  hardships the gold-seekers faced, especially the difficulties of crossing the  continent to California, either overland by wagon train, around the Cape Horn  by ship, or by ship and mule or canoe in "shortcuts" through Panama and  Nicaragua. Blumberg is more interested in the broad sweep of the Gold Rush than  she is in individual stories, but she quotes from diaries and letters to give  the era color and detail. The book is also richly illustrated with paintings,  sketches, and cartoons of the period.  </P> <P> The Spanish Civil War (1936-39) is as romantic a historical event as the  California Gold Rush, but one that American history textbooks scarcely mention.  Few high school students know that about 3,000 idealistic Americans joined  volunteers from around the world to help save the republic of Spain from a  Fascist takeover. More than half the American volunteers were killed or  seriously wounded in the fight to preserve Spain's democracy and warn the world  of the Nazi danger menacing Europe. Two new books for older children recount  this often neglected chapter of our history: Don Lawson's The Abraham Lincoln  Brigade: Americans Fighting Fascism in the Spanish Civil War (Thomas Y.  Crowell: $11.95; 160 pp.) and William Loren Katz and Marc Crawford's The  Lincoln Brigade: A Picture History (Atheneum: $14.95; 84 pp.).  </P> <P> In this case words tell the story better than pictures. Lawson not only  provides a richer historical context for understanding the Americans'  experience in Spain, but his decision to focus on one American couple who  volunteered -- Robert Merriman and his wife Marion -- makes his book more  compelling reading. Merriman, who was killed in the Spanish civil war, was also  the model for the fictional Robert Jordan in Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell  Tolls." Merriman's personal story gives Lawson's history an intimacy and  tension that Katz and Crawford's book lacks. Their book, however, quotes a  broader range of volunteers and is particularly good in describing the racial  harmony of the Lincoln Brigade, which was the first fully integrated U.S. Army.  </P> <P> The bravery and idealism of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade inspired a generation  of young Americans in the '30s. A half-century later the brigade still stands  as a powerful example of sacrifice and heroism.  </P> <P> The columnist Erma Bombeck and photographer-writer Jill Krementz have found  role models of courage closer to home -- in children fighting life-threatening  diseases. In I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to  Boise(Harper &amp; Row: $16.95; 185 pp.), Bombeck writes about children  surviving cancer. In How It Feels to Fight for Your Life (Little, Brown:  $15.95; 132 pp.), Krementz interviews and photographs children with serious  illnesses or disabilities. Both books portray the emotional resilience of  children and demonstrate the importance of attitude in fighting sickness and  injury.  </P> <P> Bombeck started out writing a pamphlet to show that not every child who gets  cancer dies. Two years later she has written a moving book about "children  fighting a disease some of them can't even spell." Although many people persist  in thinking of cancer and death as synonymous, the fact is, today, 40-to-90% of  kids with cancer survive. Bombeck set out to find the strength and optimism  that enables children to conquer the disease.  </P> <P> She is particularly drawn to the dark humor and zany antics that children  employ to cope with their illness: the artificial-limb jokes, the contest to  see who can wait the longest to throw up during chemo, the crazy answers to  explain what happened to their hair. Bombeck's breezy style is well suited to  conveying the gutsiness of the cancer patients, who deserve, she writes,  "better than buckets of tears and public pity." In her effort to be "upbeat"  and "optimistic," she sometimes slights the pain, fear and bewilderment of the  cancer experience, but her interviews, and the many letters she quotes from  children and their families, provide real examples of hope and courage.  </P> <P> Krementz's book has no good jokes or kooky stories, but it is a more balanced  book about children facing illness. Ten-to-15% of children in the United States  have some form of chronic health impairment. Krementz focuses on 14, with  illnesses ranging from asthma and diabetes to epilepsy and cancer. One boy  suffers from accidental burns, another from a gunshot wound that severed his  spinal cord. Whatever the specifics of their illness or disability, the  children have many emotional reactions in common: They talk about feelings of  aloneness, helplessness, and hope.  </P> <P> Children suffering from severe or chronic health problems will especially  appreciate Krementz's book, for it captures truths about illness that only  young patients can convey. One thoughtful, articulate young girl suffering from  cancer emphasizes how important it was for her to meet and talk with another  young girl who had just completed chemotherapy treatments. "One of the  requirements for a medical degree should be to have had a serious illness," she  comments later. Another 14-year-old boy with congenital heart problems says  about his open-heart surgery: "One thing I can say for sure is that now I know  how to fight for my life and never give up hope."  </P> <P> The power of these witnesses is not just their insight and courage, but that  they have survived. Inspiration for adults as well as children.  </P></p>

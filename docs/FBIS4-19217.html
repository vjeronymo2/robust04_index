			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Scalfaro: Reconciliation on 25 </F> April"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- Yesterday, in Ciociaria [near Rome],  remembering a priest who was murdered by the Nazis, Scalfaro  launched an appeal to "reconcile history with harmony among our  people." The upcoming 25 April [Liberation Day] must therefore  become the "day of concord." Fifty years after the Resistance,  it is high time to bring the second post-war period to a close  because "what is heard from all the dead, from the dead on all  sides, from the sufferings of the mothers on all sides, is not  the voice of divisiveness, resentment, opposition, but the voice  of unity, fraternity, and love of our fatherland."    The appeal also seems to go half way toward meeting  [National  Alliance leader] Fini's requests for general pacification in the  name of all victims, on all fronts, whether on the side of the  victors or the vanquished. Scalfaro also made an appeal to  judges: Avoid polemics and avoid being used instrumentally. On  the other hand, Scalfaro forcefully confirmed the principle of  the magistrature's autonomy and independence. [passage omitted]</p>
